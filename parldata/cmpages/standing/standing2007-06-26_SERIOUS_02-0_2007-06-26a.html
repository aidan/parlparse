							<a name="07062685000500"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> Good afternoon to you,
Mr. Benton, and to all members of the Committee. Before I
continue what I was saying before lunch, I wish to take the opportunity
to welcome you formally to the Chair. We had an interesting and good
debate this morning and I am sure that it will continue. We very much
look forward to serving under your chairmanship this afternoon and
during forthcoming sittings of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07062685000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
replying to the debate on amendment No. 57. As I was saying to the hon.
Member for Taunton, the key point to when a person should be liable for
an order is that their actions must be unreasonable in the
circumstances. It is not enough for the person simply to be told by law
enforcement that their actions are facilitating serious
crime.</div>
					<a name="07062685000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has said a number of
times that the orders are based on strict liability and that there is
no mental element in relation to facilitation. As I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>
						trying to make clear before lunch, including the
mental element suggests that the orders are criminal in nature.
Concepts such as intention or knowledge are inappropriate in that
context. In the case of McCann, the House of Lords decided that
antisocial behaviour orders are civil orders. One of the reasons for
that decision was that the court does not consider whether the subject
had a particular mental
state.</div>
					<a name="07062685000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said
several times, the orders are not punitive. We are not concerned with
whether a person intended harm, but with a person&#146;s actions and
their outcome. Including a mental element will make it more difficult
to obtain an order even when it may be reasonable to impose an order on
the basis of behaviour when it would not be possible to prove intention
or knowledge.</div>
					<a name="07062685000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
giving the hon. Member for Taunton a number of examples and was
finishing with the example of a person who owns a string of
lodging-houses that had been found on several occasions to contain
individuals who have been trafficked or smuggled, with the
accommodation paid for by others. The first option for law enforcement
might be to approach the owner and make him aware of the problem.
However, if it continued to happen, law enforcement might decide to
apply for an order. Although the matter would depend on the
circumstances, in such a case there would be a doubt about whether law
enforcement could prove that the owner had the requisite intention. The
owner might argue successfully that he had no knowledge that the people
were being trafficked or smuggled or that his purpose was to make money
and run his business rather than to facilitate
people-trafficking.</div>

						<a name="07062685000501"></a>
							<b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I was concerned this
morning that some examples were being given to make it look as though
the orders were trivial in some way. I was thinking about some cases of
paedophilia in my constituency. Let us consider a taxi driver who
routinely took children to a particular address. If the taxi driver
owner was told that children were being taken there, but then did not
respond, what proceedings should follow his being told that the
children were being taken routinely to a particular address for ill use
and
abuse?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000502"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for intervention. She has
highlighted another example of when serious crime prevention orders
could be used to prevent serious crime when someone is facilitating it.
They might not know that the taxis were being used for that, but when
told that they were, said, &#147;My intention was not that they
should be used for crime; I am just running my business.&#148; That
was the sort of example that I have cited in connection with
lodging-houses.</div>
					<a name="07062685000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the lodging-houses, an order that required the owner to provide law
enforcement for a limited period with a list of those staying in the
houses or where people&#146;s stay was paid for by a third party
would be a reasonable and proportionate response to prevent those
houses from being used as stepping-stones on the way to
people-trafficking.</div>

						<a name="07062685000503"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): Following my hon.
Friend&#146;s remarks and having just come back from a visit to the
Child Exploitation and Online
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>Protection Centre, would the Minister enlighten us as to whether such an
order would be helpful in tackling child abuse online? For example, if
a social networking site were warned that child abuse was happening on
that site, could the orders be used to prevent further abuse of
children?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000504"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Certainly the orders could be considered in a
whole range of different circumstances. If my hon. Friend
looks&#151;as I know she will have done&#151;at the schedules, she
will see that there are a number of offences related to such issues.
However, the whole point of the order&#151;as both my hon. Friends
said&#151;is to prevent serious crime from taking place. That is the
whole purpose of the order. One of the ways of preventing serious crime
from taking place is to stop the facilitation of that
crime.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000508"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> The Labour Members are contributing in greater
numbers than they did this morning. I want to clarify two brief points.
First, in the example given a moment ago, surely the best course of
action is to prosecute the suspected paedophile and bring the case to
court, rather than to use the examples contained in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062685000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I am
still unclear as to what constitutes a warning. If I am a taxi driver
and a large amount of my business is taking children to play groups and
other such activities, a malicious individual wishing to do my business
harm might say that they think that some of the children in some
circumstances might be being taken to places that those children ought
not to go to. Is that sufficient warning? Does it have to be a police
officer? How many times does it have to be? Or can one person try and
ruin my business in that
way?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000509"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I have said on a number of occasions that the
behaviour of a person who is the subject of an applicant authority
trying to take out a serious crime prevention order has to be
demonstrated to be unreasonable by the applicant authority&#151;that
is the whole point of a serious crime prevention order.The
person&#146;s defence, using the standard proof of the balance of
probability, is to demonstrate to the court that their behaviour was
reasonable. I put to the hon. Gentleman that surely, if the warning
given by law enforcement was not sufficient or was not regarded as
appropriate or the proper way of doing things, then the defence of the
person against whom the serious crime prevention order was being sought
would demonstrate to the court that their behaviour had been reasonable
and they had not been properly warned about what was taking
place.</div>
					<a name="07062685000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
hon. Gentleman and I may differ, I have said on a number of occasions
that the respondent has the opportunity to demonstrate in the High
Court 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>that their behaviour was reasonable. Also, where prosecution could take
place, we would expect prosecution, but the orders are about preventing
crime in the future and about trying to stop harm wherever it may
occur. My hon. Friends gave us two other
examples.</div>
					<a name="07062685000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other
thing is particularly important. Hon. Members should note&#151;there
was some confusion in the other place&#151;that when talking about
facilitation and about &#147;mental state&#148; and a
&#147;mental element&#148;, we are not talking about those who may
be suffering from a mental illness or otherwise mentally vulnerable.
There is nothing in the Bill on the issue because, in the High Court
and a Crown court, an order must be proportionate. It is hard to see
how it could be proportionate to give an order to a person who is so
mentally ill that they cannot manage their own affairs. In addition,
with proceedings before a Crown court, a person would have recently
stood trial, so it can be assumed that they have the necessary mental
capacity to be given a serious crime prevention
order.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062685000510"></a>
							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): May I ask the
Minister to consider one possibility? He has explained that before
someone is subjected to one of these orders they would have the
opportunity to demonstrate that what they had done was reasonable. The
burden of proof would be on the respondent to do that. If someone was
acting foolishly, they may have difficulty demonstrating to a court
that they had behaved reasonably. Presumably, it would not be the
Government&#146;s intention to catch within the ambit of these orders
someone whose behaviour was simply
foolishness.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000511"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The only people we are trying to catch with
the order are those who, for whatever reason, are acting in a way that
facilitates serious crime. I think that it would be for the courts to
judge whether someone&#146;s behaviour had been reasonable or not.
Other members of the Committee will know better than I how the courts
work. My understanding is that foolishness on its own would not
necessarily be sufficient to impose on someone a serious crime
prevention order. The key point is to demonstrate the reasonableness of
their behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07062685000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have spoken for a considerable time on the matter. I hope that my
comments have been helpful to Committee. I would, therefore, ask the

						<b class="B"> </b>I heard that. I noticed that there was quite
a lot of support for amendment No. 58 on the Opposition Benches and
perhaps elsewhere. However, I think that there was less support for the
lead amendment, No. 57. I would have a preference to move amendment No.
58 and not No. 57. I need your guidance, Mr. Benton, as to
whether I can do that. If you could advise me, I would be extremely

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000518"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am very grateful, Mr. Benton. That will
be my intention. I am not going to detain the Committee at any great
length, but I want to reinforce the reason why we should support the
concept in amendment No. 58. I understand why the Minister has
concentrated on clause 5(2). He has emphasised that in certain
circumstances it is for the respondent to come forward and establish
the reasonableness of his actions. He will also know that subsection
(2)(b) instructs the court to ignore his intentions and every other
mental element. In other words, the court is obliged not to consider
questions of knowledge and intent. The compilation of those two clauses
makes it absolutely plain that we are dealing with strict liability.
That means that a person who, as a matter of fact regardless of intent
or knowledge, carries out an act that amounts to a facilitation is a
person to whom the order-making powers can apply. I say &#147;can
apply&#148; and not &#147;will apply&#148; because ultimately
that depends on the discretion of the court. I take the point made by
the hon. Member for Colne Valley with regard to the taxi and people
traffickers. A taxi driver who, albeit unknowingly, goes to premises
which are used for people trafficking is undoubtedly facilitating a
crime.</div>
					<a name="07062685000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
another example. A taxi driver who, albeit unknowingly, takes customers
to a brothel is undoubtedly facilitating the running of a brothel. As a
matter of fact, the courts may not be asked to impose an order, but, on
a strict reading of the Bill, it is self-evident that if an application
is made, the courts could impose an order. I believe that that is
profoundly wrong. I believe that the taxi driver in both cases should
only be subject to the Bill or the order-making powers if he was
knowingly and intentionally encouraging either the brothel or the
traffic in people. That is not what it says in the Bill, which is why I
wish to see incorporated the language in amendment No. 58, namely the
concepts of knowledge and intention. That way, we safeguard people like
the taxi driver who otherwise are prima facie caught by the
facilitation. For those reasons I wish to withdraw
amendmentNo. 57 and move amendment No.
58.</div>

						</b> This is the first opportunity I have had to speak,
as when I have been speaking previously I have been intervening,
seeking your guidance or welcoming you to the Chair of this Committee,
Mr. Benton. I will speak briefly on the intention behind
these two amendments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>
					<a name="07062685000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 4 seeks to remove
the court&#146;s ability to define what a serious crime is. The
legislation states that a serious offence in England and
Wales</div>
					<a name="07062685000106"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is one which, in
the particular circumstances of the case, the court considers to be
sufficiently serious to be treated for the purposes of the application
or matter as if it were so
specified.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062685000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">So although
serious crimes are defined in schedule 1 of the legislation, the list
is not exhaustive and may be amended by the Secretary of State by
order. Amendment No. 4 seeks to remove that discretion from the
court.</div>
					<a name="07062685000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 8
is one that we considered withdrawing, subject to reassurances from the
Minister. The essential point we are trying to get to is whether a
serious crime prevention order could be issued for a crime committed
abroad, which is not an offence in the United Kingdom. The examples
which are often cited in this regard are, for example, holocaust denial
in some other countries in Europe which is not an offence here. I
understand that it is an offence in France not to go to the assistance
of a person in danger, but that is not so in the United Kingdom.
Because serious crime prevention orders can be applied internationally,
we are keen to ensure that they are not issued for offences that may
not exist in the UK but do exist in other member states of the European
Union or elsewhere. If the Minister were to reassure us, we would be
grateful.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000557"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I support the amendment. It is rather important. If
one looks at the language of subsection (2), one sees at once that any
conduct that the court thinks sufficiently serious can fall within the
category of &#147;a serious offence&#148;, and that it shall be so
treated. In other words, it does not have to be criminal conduct. It is
sufficient if the court thinks it serious. I recognise that we are not
dealing with a crime&#151;a point that has been made by the Minister
on many occasions. In theory, we are not dealing with punitive
measures. However, the Committee knows full well that the consequences
of the order are severe and that they are indistinguishable in many
respects from a penalty for a criminal offence.</div>
					<a name="07062685000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">One should ask this question.
How would the Committee feel if one were to introduce a criminal
justice Bill one of the terms of which, notwithstanding the fact that
the matters set out in the indictment did not constitute a criminal
offence, was that a trial judge could, if he thought the circumstances
sufficiently grave, treat an offence as criminal? To say that that was
acceptable would be so absurd that even Labour Members recognised the
folly of it. Actually, it is little different from what is proposed in
the Bill. We are enabling judges of the High Court or the Crown court
to say, &#147;I so dislike this activity that I am going to treat it
as a &#145;serious crime&#146; in respect of which a serious crime
prevention order will be made.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062685000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That raises another interesting
question: how could one appeal such a sentence? If it is entirely
within the discretion of the trial judge, and if he is not given any
guidance or criteria as to whether such matters should fall within the
provisions of subsection (2), the decision is virtually&#151;perhaps
entirely&#151;unappealable.</div>
					<a name="07062685000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Taunton is
entirely right; it is a deeply objectionable provision. If he presses
the amendment to a Division&#151;I hope that he does&#151;he will
have my
support.</div>
				
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>

						<a name="07062685000558"></a>
							<b class="B">Nick
Herbert</b> (Arundel and South Downs) (Con): I too support the
amendment and everything said by the hon. Member for Taunton and my
right hon. and learned Friend. I too believe that subsection (2) is
objectionable. It seems to be slightly tautologous. It says that a
serious offence is</div>
					<a name="07062685000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one
which...the court considers to be sufficiently
serious&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062685000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">No elaboration
is given, so the definition is as broad as the court would wish it to
be.</div>
					<a name="07062685000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition to
the objections given by my right hon. and learned Friend, the provision
contravenes the principle of legal certainty. We heard in debates on
previous amendments that no element of mens rea is required for issuing
serious crime prevention orders; but setting that aside, how is a
person to know that his conduct might come within the ambit of a
serious crime prevention order if no definition is given of serious
crimes? Despite the fact that we have a list of offences&#151;the
list given in schedule 1 is obviously non-exhaustive, as the Minister
seeks the power to add to it&#151;how can anyone know whether his
conduct is &#147;serious&#148; if the court can determine that any
conduct is serious if, in its own judgment, it is to be treated so?
That undermines completely the principle of legal certainty and
seriously widens the potential scope of the legislation. The Minister
needs to explain why it is necessary to have a specific list of
offences as well as the catch-all provision. If he cannot explain why
the catch-all provision is necessary, it is
indefensible.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000559"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> May I provide some clarification on the point
raised by the hon. Member for Taunton and then come to the more general
discussion on the amendments? If he looks at clause 2(5) he will find
the answer to his question about to whom a serious crime prevention
order could be applied. The answer is that if someone commits an
offence overseas, a serious crime prevention order can be applied,
providing it is an offence in this country as well. For example, if
somebody committed an offence of drug trafficking in France, where it
is obviously illegal, as it is here, it could form the basis of a
serious crime prevention order. The offence would have to be illegal in
both countries for such an order to be used. I hope that that clarifies
the point.</div>
					<a name="07062685000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed already, we have provided a schedule of offences to show the
large majority of offences in relation to which the use of such orders
would be appropriate. Within the framework of the schedule, we have
also provided a discretion forthe High Court to treat an
offence as serious if inthe circumstances of the case before
it, which we cannot know or foresee, it considers the offence to be
serious enough to be treated as if it were specified in schedule 1.
This might be a point of disagreement between us, but we think that it
is important that the Court has that discretion. We cannot list every
type of offence. It might be appropriate to leave that to the
consideration of the High Court, which might wish to consider other
serious crimes. We think that that discretion is important, which is
why we have put it in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000560"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> The more the Minister defends the provision, the
more it strikes me as objectionable. He says that we cannot know or
foresee what he describes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>
						as serious crimes that might be caught under the
provision. If the Government cannot know or foresee such serious
potential offences, which could fall under the ambit of what becomes a
criminal matter or certainly might lead to serious restrictions on
people&#146;s freedom to go about their business, how can he
reasonably expect individuals to know or foresee that something may
become subject to one of those orders? What does that do for the
principle of certainty and what kind of legislative basis is it when
this House provides a provision that could catch any conduct subject
only to whether the Court judges it to be
serious?</div>

							<a name="07062685000561"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman that, of course, the
High Court is a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights
Act 1998 and that any judgment that it makes must be proportionate.
That is a discussion that was had with the right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham earlier. As I said, we want to
ensure that the High Court has the necessary discretion so that is not
fettered by looking only at a schedule. Serious crimes and other
matters might come before it that are not in the schedule, but which
the Court believes to be appropriate for a serious crime prevention
order. That is why we have provided the discretionary power for the
Court.</div>

court system better than me, but he also knows that if an offence is
treated as serious, and people regard it as unreasonable, the decision
can be appealed against, and it can be appealed against to the Court of
Appeal. There is an appeal process in the legal system, and if the High
Court makes an unreasonable decision, a decision that people consider
inappropriate, disproportionate or inconsistent with the Human Rights
Act, or there is an error of law, it can of course be appealed against
to the Court of Appeal. There is an appeals
process.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> I did not say that, or if I did, I did not mean to
say it. I said that an appellate court could not consider an appeal,
not that there would not be an appeal. I know perfectly well that the
Bill makes provision for an appeal procedure, but when thereis
an undefined set of circumstances, it is not easyand probably
not possible for an appellate court toreview
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000571"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman has clarified
for the Committee the importance of the fact that there is an appeal
process, which is available to somebody who is made the subject of a
serious crime prevention order in the High Court and believes that it
is disproportionate, that there has been an error of law or that an
injustice has taken place.</div>
					<a name="07062685000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that we do not
fetter the discretion of the courts to adapt to the constant changes
that surround us, consider the context of events and make a fully
informed and reasoned decision about whether it would be appropriate
for the offence to attract an order. I shall provide an example of why
the discretion is necessary. It is inappropriate to include in the
schedule offences against the person such as assault or murder, because
they are not suitable for attracting an order in all circumstances. For
example, if one person assaulted another in a simple fight in a pub, I
am sure that we would all agree that the order would be inappropriate.
However, if someone has routinely used violence to intimidate and
maintain a reign of terror in an area, and if there is evidence that an
order would prevent such crimes from happening again, that person might
be an appropriate candidate for an order after serving their
sentence.</div>
					<a name="07062685000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances in which the offences are committed make an order
appropriate&#151;or not. The person best placed to judge those
circumstances is a judge sitting in the High Court, or as the case may
be, a judge sitting in the Crown court, with all the facts in front of
him. That is why I do not propose to agree to fetter judges&#146;
discretion to deal with the cases before them in the most appropriate
way. As a result, I ask the Committee to resist the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07062685000588"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I shall be brief because I have made my substantive
arguments by way of amendment. I object to the provisions of the clause
and disapprove of it for three reasons. First, as I have explained to
the Committee, I am strongly opposed to the way in which it defines
&#147;a serious offence&#148;. It is wrong in principle to do that
by way of categorisation. If we have to do it at all, we should do it
by reference to the sentence that particular conduct attracts; hence
the amendments that I tabled suggesting that the length of a sentence
be the indication of an offence&#146;s
gravity.</div>
					<a name="07062685000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have very real inhibitions about including in the scope of &#147;a
serious offence&#148; the act of facilitation. Facilitation per se is
not necessarily a criminal offence. Although the orders are not being
created for criminal offences, the consequences of an order will be
almost indistinguishable from a penalty imposed. I am loth to agree to
that when the act complained of is not a criminal offence. Thirdly, if
we are driven to the position whereby facilitation is to be included as
a triggering act, it is quite plain that that should be done only if
the facilitation is knowing and intentional. That addresses the point
made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley.</div>
					<a name="07062685000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the three principal
reasons why I am against the clause, and I shall vote against

							<a name="07062685000609"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Do you know, I am absolutely terrified of getting
the name of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s constituency
wrong? I am going to write it in big letters. In response to what he
said, I should like to say that I believe that prostitution and keeping
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>brothel are serious offences. It is right that they should be listed in
the schedule and that, in relation to such an offence, the High Court
should be able to consider whether a serious crime prevention order is
appropriate in the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07062685000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule is based to a large extent on schedule 2 to the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002, which sets out &#147;lifestyle offences&#148; in
which serious criminals regularly engage. In developing the list for
the purposes of this legislation, we also thought about other serious
offences against which it might be suitable to use the orders. Two
criticisms of the orders have been made. The first questioned why we
did not include offences against a person, which I think we dealt with
in a previous discussion. The second criticism related to environmental
offences. The hon. Member for Taunton, among others, raised that point.
Those offences were included on the recommendation of the Association
of Chief Police Officers lead for wildlife and environmental crime.
Environmental crime, such as the poaching of fish or dumping of waste,
can cause both ecological and economic harm to local communities.
Ecological harm, in particular, is the perfect example in which
prevention is most assuredly better than a cure, which makes the orders
a potentially valuable tool. The inclusion of environmental offences is
extremely important.</div>
					<a name="07062685000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that it easy to
make a debating point of sorts by saying that a serious crime
prevention order will be made against anybody who takes one fish from
the lord of the manor&#146;s river or trout farm. In response, I say
that we are talking about serious crime. As we all know&#151;I said
it this morning and Lord Dear said it&#151;chucking an explosive into
a pond is more serious than taking the odd fish, although that is
illegal as well. </div>
					<a name="07062685000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments relate to two areas where we think it is
important for the orders to be an option. In response to a helpful
suggestion from a colleague of the hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs in another place, Baroness Anelay, we agreed that we could
consider adding robbery to the schedule, where it is committed with a
firearm or offensive weapon. There is no specific offence of armed
robbery, but we believe that parliamentary counsel&#146;s drafting of
Government amendments Nos. 24 and 29 meets the commitment that we made
in the other place. I hope that those Government amendments meet the
concerns of Baroness Anelay, and that the hon. Gentleman will not press
amendment No.

Herbert:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation and for his amendment. My noble Friend Baroness Anelay in
another place tabled the original amendment to bring armed robbery
within the scope of the offences listed in the Bill as a probing
amendment. It was designed, as the Minister picked up on, to try to
tease out why certain offences that do not seem to be so serious, such
as environmental offences, including salmon fishing, have been included
in the schedule, yet offences involving significant violence, which the
public would consider to be part of the problem of serious crime, have
not been included. That was her purpose in tabling the amendment in
relation to armed robbery.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>
					<a name="07062685000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My noble
Friend then received significant support from the industry, which was
keen, despite its reservations about the operation of serious crime
prevention orders, to which I referred this morning, to have a specific
offence included that would cover armed robbery. The British Bankers
Association pointed out that last year its members suffered 119 armed
robberies, incurring significant losses and resulting in injuries to
staff and customers. There is growing awareness in and outside this
place of the problem of armed robbery and the particular pressure that
it puts on the industry and on staff who are victims of
attacks.</div>
					<a name="07062685000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government agreed to look at the amendment to see whether it could be
tidied up, and have now tabled their own. I do not wish to sound
churlish, but while I am grateful to them for accepting my noble
Friend&#146;s proposal, I have some reservations about including
another offence in the schedule, given that the Government have made no
concessions in relation to the operation of the
orders.</div>

Herbert:
						</b> I am grateful to my right hon. and learned
Friend, but that strikes me as going dangerously down the line of John
Kerry and his explanation of why he votes for things before he votes
against them. It is not surprising that this puts us in something of a
dilemma because, on one hand, there is a harm that we want dealt with,
which is why we raised the problem initially. On the other hand, we
have serious concerns, which we set out this morning, about the
operation of the orders, and the Government have not felt able to make
any concessions. Nevertheless, if there is to be a schedule, it would
be sensible to include the specific harm in it and within the
definition of serious crimes, rather than leaving it to a court to
decide whether it is a serious crime under the provisions that we

found itself in precisely the same position as us&#151;it expressed
concern about the operation of serious crime prevention orders and
argued strongly that there should be prosecution when possible. I
referred this morning to its concerns about the orders, but it wants a
widening of the offences if the orders must go forward. On that basis,
I would be happy not to press my amendment.</div>

						</b> We have already discussed the reasons behind and
structure for the schedule. The Government amendments relate to two
areas in which we think the orders should be available. Amendments Nos.
25, 26, 30 and 31 add the offence of acquisition, use and possession of
criminal property under section 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
That offence is considered to be one committed by organised criminals.
It can attract a financial reporting order under the Serious Organised
Crime and Police Act 2005. Amendments Nos. 27 and 32 add the offence of
false accounting. Finally, we tabled amendmentsNos. 28 and 33
because of the growing evidence that serious criminals are targeting
the tax system in an increasingly systematic and large-scale manner.
There is a direct impact from serious crime on the Exchequer in respect
of indirect taxes and excise duties; several billion pounds are lost to
the Exchequer through VAT and excise fraud. There is also evidence that
criminals are attacking the tax credit system and evidence of
systematic attacks by organised criminal gangs. The measures can
provide a useful means of preventing the harm caused by such
crimes.</div>

reassurance from the Minister about tax credits, the issue that he has
just raised. All hon. Members will have had huge postbags of letters
from constituents who have had issues with the complexity of the tax
credit system and felt that they have been wrongly accused of trying to
defraud&#151;through overpayment, or whatever. Many will be concerned
at the failings of the system&#146;s complexity.</div>

be applied to someone who has been accused of or investigated for some
offence; is it the Government&#146;s intention that those provisions
should be confined to people who were offending in a systematic way
against that system? There are those who have had a one-off individual
issue with the system and may have been found, officially, to have
committed fraud. That finding, however, may well have resulted from
some inaccuracy in the form

						 The object of amendment No. 95, which stands
in my name, is to remove subsection (4) of clause 5, which gives the
Secretary of State, by order, the power to amend schedule 1. By that
power he can either add to or delete from the list of offences that are
categorised in the schedule.</div>

							<a name="07062685000621"></a>The

there are too many social conversations going on. I ask hon. Members to

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000622"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> As you know, Mr. Benton, the affirmative
resolution procedure is not amendable. Therefore, we are enabling the
Secretary of State to add to these offences by way of an unamendable
order, which is a very unattractive proposition. For that reason, I
hope that the Committee will rally behind amendmentNo.
95.</div>
					<a name="07062685000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more general
issue is whether schedule 1 should stand part of the Bill. I shall be
brief, as I have rehearsed my arguments many times. The Committee by
now will understand that I take a strong objection to this part of the
Bill. I am very much against the definition of a serious
offence&#151;I use the language of the Bill&#151;by reference to
categorisation. I have expressed my reasons already; it is wrong in
principle and if we are to have serious crime prevention orders they
should be made by reference to the penalties imposed by the courts
rather than by categorisation.</div>
					<a name="07062685000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">My objection is to the whole
architecture of the Bill as set out in schedule 1, which is reinforced
by the fact that in respect of facilitation, the facilitator may be
committing no offences known to the law but will be caught if he or she
is facilitating an act that is specified in the schedule, which may be
pretty trivial.</div>
					<a name="07062685000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not like procedures being carried out, therefore my argument against
schedule 1 relates to the whole structure of the Bill. I would like to
think that in a spirit of collegiate support my Front Bench will take
the same view, but if they do not I shall, in any event, vote against
them.</div>

							<a name="07062685000623"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> I rise, in the spirit of collegiate support, to
support my right hon. and learned Friend in relation to amendment No.
95, in which he seeks to remove the provision in clause 5(4) that
enables the Secretary of State by order to amend schedule 1, either by
taking offences away or, more seriously, by adding
them.</div>
					<a name="07062685000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I signalled on
Second Reading that the official Opposition were unhappy with the
provision. It seems wrong in principle, even if the statutory
instrumentis subject to the affirmative procedure, that the
Government should take the power to add to the list of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>offences that can be used to make serious crime prevention orders. We
have expressed concerns about
that.</div>
					<a name="07062685000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is
necessary to add offences to the legislation in the future, it should
be done by primary legislation. After all, plenty of Home Office Bills
are likely to come forward as vehicles for such amendments. Judging by
the number of Home Office Bills we have had so far, there will be no
shortage of legislative opportunities. The nature and scope of the
orders mean that, for consistency&#146;s sake, given our concerns
about the operation of the powers, we cannot support granting an
open-ended power to the Government of the day to add to the list of
offences.</div>
					<a name="07062685000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the
wider schedule, I am inclined to agree with my right hon. and learned
Friend. After all, we objected to clauses 1 and 2 in the first place
because the Government have failed to meet our concerns about the
operation of the
orders.</div>
					<a name="07062685000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">An issue for
us is that if the schedule of specific offences were to disappear, it
would leave in the Bill only the power for courts to determine whether
offences were sufficiently serious. Nevertheless, I am content to
oppose the schedule on the basis that we oppose that power as well.
Therefore, for consistency&#146;s sake, in spite of the addition of
the offence of armed robbery that was proposed in the other place, we
shall oppose the
schedule.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000624"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is why I prefaced my remarks on the previous
group of amendments by saying that I knew that the hon. Gentleman was
not being churlish. I slightly suspected that he would ask his
colleagues to vote against the schedule even though we had included
armed robbery. I understand that he is not being churlish, even though
we agreed to the earlier
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062685000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, amendment No. 95 would remove the order-making power of
the Secretary of State to add to the list in the schedule. I have
already outlined the reasons why the schedule is important, not least
in providing guidance for the courts in exercising their discretion.
The order-making power is necessary to ensure that the list is kept
current, and to provide the most effective tool for the courts. Even
five to 10 years ago, we probably could not have anticipated the impact
that the use of computers would have in enabling serious targeting of
the Exchequer, which occasioned the amendments in the last group. We
need to be able to adapt to emerging trends in crime and the rapid
diversification of criminal activity that I alluded to earlier. That is
why the order-making power is
necessary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000625"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> Just for my elucidation, could the Minister explain
the process that his Department went through in deciding the make-up of
the
schedule?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000626"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we went to
consultation. We spoke to stakeholders and the police, which is one of
the reasons why we included environmental crime in schedule 1. ACPO
told us that it should be included. We spoke to many different people.
The amendments that we just accepted indicate that we even took advice
from Conservative Lords as to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>what should be in the schedule. A broad church of people have been
involved in deciding what should be included. I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to make that interesting
point.</div>
					<a name="07062685000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already
discussed the context for the schedule in relation to clause 2(2),
which sets out what constitutes a serious offence. This includes the
necessity of providing the courts with the discretion to treat an
offence as if it were specified in schedule 1. The schedule therefore
provides not only a list of offences that will always be capable of
attracting an order, but guidance to the courts on the types of offence
that could form the basis of an
order.</div>
					<a name="07062685000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule is
based on schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. That set out
what constituted lifestyle offences for the purposes of that
legislation&#151;offences that are committed by serious criminals to
fund and maintain luxurious lifestyles at the expense of their victims.
All these offences should be capable of attracting an order. However,
the purposes of the Bill go further than those of the 2002 Act, so we
thought it necessary to see whether it was appropriate, through this
legislation, to prevent the harm caused by serious criminals in
relation to other offences. As a result, we added certain categories of
offence to this schedule. Those include the environmental offences that
I mentioned earlier, along with offences relating to fraud, and
corruption and
bribery.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000627"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> On the point about the Home Secretary being able
to add extra categories, how would the Minister answer a constituent of
mine who approached me to express concern that at some future point, a
less benign and enlightened Home Secretary than the one who exists
until this time tomorrow may seek to impose, through this provision,
various draconian measures that would pose a great threat to the
liberties of the citizens of this country? Indeed, they would apply to
people who had committed no criminal offence whatever. Is that not, in
the eyes of many people in this country, the slippery slope towards
imposing by order a set of measures that would potentially severely
curtail our
liberties?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000628"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I would say to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituent what I would say to my own. Whatever the Home Secretary
decides should be able to be included in the schedule, it is not the
Home Secretary who will decide whether someone should be subject to a
serious crime prevention order. A High Court judge will take that
decision. I would also say to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent,
as I have said to a number of hon. Gentlemen in Committee and to my
hon. Friends, that the High Court is, for the purposes of the Human
Rights Act 1998, a public authority. Therefore, the High Court is bound
to act in a way that is consistent with human rights legislation.
Should a judge in that Court err, as I said to the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham earlier, there is an
appeal process.</div>
					<a name="07062685000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
an important part of our democracy&#151;an important part of our
constitution&#151;that we have a Parliament that makes the law. We
have a part of our democracy that sets down what we believe to be right
and proper, but it is a matter for the courts to protect certain
freedoms of individuals, to protect the civil 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>liberties of individuals and to apply the law. That would be a perfectly
reasonable response to reassure the constituent of the hon. Member for
Taunton.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000629"></a>Kali
Mountford:
						</b> What would my hon. Friend say to a constituent
of mine who said to me, &#147;What are the Government doing, allowing
criminals to develop their crime in the face of new technology and not
being prepared to act against
that?&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">

that that is why the Bill is before Parliament. Serious crime
prevention orders are part of a range of measures that the Government
are taking to tackle not only antisocial behaviour, but serious crime
that causes much harm to my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents, as it
does to
mine.</div>

Coaker:
						</b> Let me just develop the point. It is interesting
and it pervades the entire debate that we are having on the Bill. There
is always debate, discussion and disagreement about where the line is
drawn between individual liberty and public protection. The interface
between those two concepts is always a subject of tension and debate. I
do not believe that there are many Committee members who do not
sometimes have people coming to them to ask exactly the question that
my hon. Friend set out. That question is not about the civil liberties
of criminals or of people who might, under the provisions of the Bill,
be the subject of serious crime preventions orders. The question is:
&#147;What about my civil liberties, and what about the fact that I
see things happening in my community that I want to have
tackled?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062685000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that there is a range of options. Of course, prosecution is
appropriate in the majority of cases, but the Bill is about civil
orders that will prevent crime. My hon. Friend&#146;s constituents,
and mine, are as concerned about their own civil liberties and human
rights as about those of
others.</div>

						</b> I understand the point that the Minister is
making. However, I differ from the views of the hon. Member for Colne
Valley in relation to the assumption that the state will always have
benign intentions&#151;in every circumstance, and for ever more. Is
the Minister wholly and 100 per cent. satisfied that, if the British
National party won an overall majority in a general election and sought
to make it a serious offence, for example, for people to have sexual
relations with people of different ethnicity, that party would not be
aided in their attempt to introduce such a measure by what we are being
asked to vote
for?</div>

to finance their other criminal activities, which is why offences of
fraud are included in the Bill. The inclusion of bribery

against international bribery and corruption, and the schedule reflects
the breadth of operation of serious criminals in this

						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. The
Government wish to oppose the inclusion of clause 4 and schedule 13.
For the benefit&#151;&#151;to be honest&#151;&#151;of myself
and perhaps that of the Committee, could you advise me on the
procedure?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000655"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It might be helpful to the Committee if I gave
some opening remarks. It is the Government&#146;s intention that
clause 4 and schedule 13 be opposed.</div>
					<a name="07062685000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government want to support
the efforts of the security services and law enforcement in their fight

<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>
						against terrorism and serious crime. No one on this
Committee will disagree with that aim, I am sure, but whether or not it
is possible to increase the effectiveness of interception, attempting
to do so by extending its use to the evidential arena is difficult, not
least because, as the agencies have made clear, interception is one of
their most effective tools and there is a danger that its evidential
use would seriously hamper the fight by undermining its use and
effectiveness and seriously impact effort
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07062685000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do they
say that? What have they to protect? Is the police view on intercept
evidence not different from that of the intelligence agencies, and how
is it that our agencies cannot do what every other country using
interception does? Those points have been raised repeatedly in recent
discussions, so I shall address some of them
now.</div>
					<a name="07062685000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
difference in view between the law enforcement and intelligence
communities on intercept as evidence. Close scrutiny of what key
figures have said on the subject shows that they support what the
Government have been saying&#151;the laws should be changed to allow
intercept evidence if safeguards can be put in place to protect
sensitive capabilities, techniques and resources, and the benefits of
changing the law outweigh the risks of doing
so.</div>
					<a name="07062685000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General, whose office has been working closely with the Home
Office; the Director of Public Prosecutions, who recently gave evidence
before the Joint Committee on Human Rights; and the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, who is often misrepresented as an unqualified supporter
of intercept as evidence, believe that safeguards are essential.
Without safeguards, there can be no benefits.
</div>
					<a name="07062685000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider Lord
Lloyd&#146;s proposal. Where are the additional safeguards required?
The model before us has none. What have UK intercepting agencies to
protect that is not dealt with perfectly adequately in the overseas
jurisdictions using intercept evidence? The answer is the very thing
that sets the UK apart and, I would say, ahead of overseas
jurisdictions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000657"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Let me develop this point, and then of course I
will. The UK&#146;s model is intelligence-led policing, in which
intelligence agencies and law enforcement often work hand in hand. That
is not replicated anywhere else. Nowhere else in the world can one find
law enforcement tasking intelligence officers on interception matters.
In contrast, overseas jurisdictions protect advanced intelligence
capabilities from exposure in court simply by not sharing them with law
enforcement. That leaves overseas law enforcement with perfectly
serviceable but more basic
capabilities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000658"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I understand the point that the Minister is
making. It is welcome that the Government are at least considering
introducing intercept evidence, but I ask him this. Schedule 13
provides for the admissibility of intercept and metering evidence. He
says rightly that it does not include safeguards, but is there any
reason why schedule 13 cannot be agreed to with a view to the
Government&#146;s developing the safeguards elsewhere and, if
necessary, later?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000659"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> In answer to the point made by the hon. Gentleman,
the Government want to look at all of this in the round, which is why
we wish to take out both the clause and schedule 13. We want to ensure
that we have a model that works and is agreed, and that the
intelligence and law enforcement agencies feel it is acceptable. At the
present time, we do not have that
model.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000660"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but we
have just been through a series of arguments in which he has said that
it is necessary to have provisions in the Bill that will enable changes
to be made later if circumstances change. Surely, he cannot have it
both ways. In this case, we could have the schedule and provisions
ready for a situation in which circumstances do
change.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000661"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> We do not know whether the law enforcement or
intelligence agencies are satisfied with schedule 13 or whether there
are additional safeguards that they want included. Those things are not
worked out by Lord Lloyd&#146;s amendment or by the inclusion of
clause 4 or schedule 13. There are still a number of unanswered
questions.</div>
					<a name="07062685000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
the hon. Gentleman for recognising that the Government want to discuss
the issue and are prepared to do so. He knows that there will be a
review on Privy Council terms to consider the use of intercept as
evidence. The details of the review are yet to be worked out, but it
will be a serious review about how to introduce something that is
workable and practicable, which is better than leaving something in the
Bill, about which we are not totally sure. With the best of intentions,
he cannot be sure that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies
are absolutely satisfied with every bit of the schedule or whether they
would like to see other things included. At the present time, we think
that it is appropriate to take the clause and schedule out of the Bill
so that the review has a clean slate, can look at the issue in its
totality and can propose something that we hope and expect to be
included in a Bill in the
autumn.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000662"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Will the Minister forgive me if I build on the point
that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made? As far as
I can see, schedule 13 will be commenced by a commencement order under
clause 84 of the Bill. That lies within the sole discretion of the
Secretary of State, so the provisions under schedule 13 will not come
into force unless and until a commencement order is made, which can be
done only by the Secretary of
Sate.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000663"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> As I said, it may be that it can be commenced
under the clause to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman
referred. What he failed to mention was the point that I made to his
hon. Friend: we do not know, and neither does the Committee, whether
all our intelligence and law enforcement agencies are absolutely
satisfied that the provisions under schedule 13 are appropriate to the
model that they want. As I have said, our intention is to take out the
schedule.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>
					<a name="07062685000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strength of our system is
illustrated by the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency last
year, which combines intelligence with enforcement, and by police
forces across the country that call on the security services to help
with their investigations. The UK&#146;s approach has produced
outstanding results. Where is the evidence that overseas countries do
better than the UK in fighting terrorism and serious crime? As Baroness
Scotland mentioned recently in another place, we can point to figures
that show that intercept evidence is not always used as extensively or
as effectively overseas as is sometimes claimed.</div>
					<a name="07062685000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is important is what would
happen in the UK if we had intercept as evidence. Would we improve on
the results that we get now? The Government have said before that
intercept as evidence is not a magic bullet against terrorism, which
was one of the conclusions of the 2003-04 review. The prospect of
improvement always needs to be taken seriously, particularly in the
current climate where the stakes are raised and where there are
strongly opposing views on how to go forward, as was evidenced in the
House of Lords. That is why, earlier this month, the Government agreed
to commission a review of intercept as evidence on Privy Council
terms.</div>
					<a name="07062685000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">To rebut Lord
Lloyd&#146;s proposals vigorously might give the impression that we
are prejudging the outcome of the new review, which would not be
helpful and I certainly do not wish to do so. I do not wish to leave
anyone in any doubt that Lord Lloyd&#146;s proposals do not provide a
sound basis to progress the issue of intercept as evidence. As we
stated on Second Reading, we believe that they are unworkable and,
indeed, defective&#151;so much so, that it is not possible, nor,
given the seriousness of the subject, appropriate, to make such
amendments during the passage of the Bill. Any sensible person involved
in this complex subject will recognise the need for the appropriate
safeguards and to develop a workable, legal model for change. To do
otherwise, as would happen if we retained Lord Lloyd&#146;s
amendment, would undermine the effectiveness of our intelligence and
law enforcement agencies. That could have damaging
results.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000664"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I do not want to be pedantic, but I would like a
clear understanding of what the Minister means by intercept evidence,
because various classes of evidence could fall under that definition
such as that intercepted by telephone, bugging and e-mails. I need to
know exactly, as I think the Committee does, what class or classes of
evidence will fall under that definition in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000665"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is one of the very points that the review
needs to debate&#151;what we mean by intercept evidence. What sorts
of intercept evidence do we believe would be appropriate in court were
we to allow it? The right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s point is
one of the important questions for the review: whether the examples
that he gave are the sorts of evidence that should be admissible in
court. I think that he makes a valid point. Intercept evidence would be
a huge catch-all for a range of different types of evidence. His
question identifies very clearly the need for the review, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>because, of course, one of the questions for it would be: what counts as
intercept evidence and what is admissible in
court?</div>
					<a name="07062685000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changing the
law on the basis of what works is the way in which to proceed, and we
do not believe that Lord Lloyd&#146;s amendment would give us that
certainty. The Government have signalled their intention to proceed on
a responsible basis by commissioning the review on Privy Council terms.
I hope that the Committee will support that approach. I propose,
therefore, that clause 4 and schedule 13 do not stand part of the
Bill.</div>

committed to tell me what progress had been made, but that has not
happened. Given those circumstances, we cannot possibly go along with
the Government and accept the clause&#146;s withdrawal.</div>
					<a name="07062685000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second concern is that the
review should be truly independent and not pre-judged. The Minister
knows that we are concerned about that, but his remarks about concerns
regarding the use of intercept evidence did not give me great
confidence that the Government have an open mind on this issue. He
talked about the real dangers of the use of intercept evidence and
about Britain&#146;s unique form of policing, which I shall discuss,
but I must first question the extent to which there is a consistent
Government view on this matter. The incoming Prime Minister made clear
his support for the use of intercept evidence in a briefing to the
Sunday papers on 3 June. He also said recently that he never believed
that presentation should be a substitute for policy, and that we are
about to enter an age in which spin would no longer be a feature of
government, and yet he made that announcement, typically, by way of a
briefing to the Sunday papers and not to this House. One of the
relevant articles, in <i class="I">The Sunday Times</i> of3 June,
said:</div>
					<a name="07062685000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Gordon
Brown will this week put his personal authority behind a move to allow
evidence from telephone taps to be used in court to ensure terrorist
suspects do not escape the
law.&#148;</div>

					<a name="07062685000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;said:
&#145;Personally, Gordon believes the weight of argument points to
using intercept evidence in court, but we want this review to build a
nonpartisan consensus on the best balance between obtaining convictions
of people plotting terrorist acts and preserving our sources of
intelligence for the future. It is vital that the security services are
closely consulted and happy with the
outcome.&#146;&#148;</div>

wishes of the law enforcement agencies when determining whether to make
such an
application.</div>

the various safeguards that could easily be introduced to the operation
and use of intercept

					<a name="07062685000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads
me to my next point. The Government complain about the absence of
safeguards in Lord Lloyd&#146;s amendment, but they could have come
forward with proposed safeguards of their own. Instead, they choose to
strike down the measure so that the House of Commons has no long stop
on the Privy Councillor
review.</div>
					<a name="07062685000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before leaving
the issue of the extent to which the Government are united on the
matter, the Attorney-General, who will resign in the next 24 hours or
so, told the &#147;Today&#148; programme on 21 September last

					<a name="07062685000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
have a need to use intercept in court if we&#146;re going to give
ourselves the chance of convicting some of the most dangerous and
prolific criminals in the country. It is a vital tool therefore for
organised serious crime - this is what I&#146;ve been told
particularly by colleagues in the United States - and for
terrorism.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000678"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
interesting intervention, but it is my understanding that both the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner and his assistant, Andy
Hayman&#151;I shall say more about his views&#151;who lead on the
issue of terrorism, believe that intercept evidence should be
considered. I accept that other individual officers have concerns and
that those need to be investigated by the Privy Council committee. I am
asking for the assurance, which I have been given, that that committee
will go ahead on the terms requested by the Leader of the
Opposition.</div>
					<a name="07062685000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister seemed to dispute the potential benefits of the use of
intercept evidence and suggested that Britain has a kind of unique
system to which we should hang on. Let us examine that claim. First, it
is clear that other countries use intercept evidence successfully. If
we look at cases that brought the conviction of al-Qaeda members in the
United States following 9/11, mafia godfathers in New York and war
criminals in The Hague, we will see that intercept evidence was used. I
agree that Britain is different in this respect: we have increasingly
been urged by the Government to accept measures that are more and more
draconian and restrictive of civil liberties on the ground that
insufficient evidence can be assembled to pursue prosecutions of
terrorists.</div>
					<a name="07062685000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
consequence of the failure to use intercept evidence as our peer group
countries have done is that Government proposals for the indefinite
detention without trial of terrorist suspects have been struck down,
while the control orders that they introduced are ineffective. Those
were serious incursions into civil liberties. The extension of
pre-charge detention in relation to terrorist suspects was agreed by
the House, but the Government now propose a further extension. All
those matters demonstrate the price of the Government apparently having
a closed mind on the use of intercept evidence.</div>
					<a name="07062685000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister says that Britain
is different. It is different in one important respect: we have chosen
not to use a procedure that is used everywhere else but have instead
embarked upon measures that will cause a serious reduction in civil
liberties. The serious crime prevention orders are very much in the
same vein.</div>
					<a name="07062685000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister managed to find a police officer who has expressed concern
about the use of intercept evidence. Perhaps he will find another.
However, he will know that the Home Affairs Committee concluded that
there was &#147;universal support&#148; for the use of intercept
evidence. Indeed, the call for its use has been supported by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;tomorrow&#146;s Prime
Minister&#151;and the Attorney-General, by the present Director of
Public Prosecutions and his predecessor, by Andy Hayman, Assistant
Commissioner of the Metropolitan police and the Commissioner, and by
the Government&#146;s adviser on terrorism Lord Carlile, who, with
caveats, has said that it should be considered by the Joint Committee
on Human Rights. An overwhelming consensus is emerging that the issue
should be looked at. A case can be made for the use of intercept
evidence. The question is why the Government have stood in the way of a
proper review for so long.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>
					<a name="07062685000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, in response to my right
hon. and learned Friend, who spoke well on the subject, I referred to
the potential safeguards that could be introduced. Those safeguards
operate perfectly acceptably in other countries. The use of such
evidence could be authorised by a judge, as happens in the United
States, and those proceedings could be heard in camera. As he said, it
is highly unlikely that prosecutions would rely on intercept evidence
about which the state was unhappy. However, the defence could be given
the right to challenge the use of such evidence; clearance could be
given for defence lawyers and judges to ensure that it was appropriate
for them to make judgments about the use of such evidence; and the
evidence itself could be edited or summarised. That is important,
because some of the objections to the use of intercept evidence that
the Government rehearsed on Second
Reading&#151;</div>

something that I could not

							<a name="07062685000680"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> I understand my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s concern about breaching the privileged relationship
that must exist. Nevertheless, the principal objection levelled against
the use of intercept evidence is that its disclosure would reveal to
our enemies&#151;&#151;to those who are being
surveyed&#151;&#151;the methods being deployed in that surveillance
by the intelligence services and others.</div>
					<a name="07062685000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assistant Commissioner Hayman
dealt with that when he gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee. He
said that he was initially unsupportive of the use of intercept
evidence, but that he had now moved. He felt that the other side were
well aware of the methodologies, and he described the argument as
lightweight. He went on to deal with the next objection to the use of
intercept evidence. None of the objections is trivial. The next
objection is that a tremendous logistical burden would be placed on the
authorities if vast amounts of evidence had to be transcribed, but he
said that if an investigation was focused and precise, that need not be
the
case.</div>

will be examined in the committee of Privy Councillors, assuming that

reason for the delay? I do not know whether the delay is because of the
change in regime, or because the Government are having difficulty
accepting the suggestions from the Leader of the Opposition about the
committee&#146;s composition. It is important that we understand
those concerns and receive the reassurance that the committee will be
open-minded about the way in which it reviews the evidence.</div>
					<a name="07062685000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the circumstances, it is
unreasonable to expect us to accept the withdrawal of the provision

						</b> Thank you, Mr Benton, for giving me an opportunity
to speak about the matter more briefly than the previous
speaker.</div>
					<a name="07062685000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ever since
the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) became leader
of the Conservative party, drifting leftwards on policy, he has sought
a clause IV moment. I always thought that the Conservative
party&#146;s adoption of clause IV would be that moment, and although
we have not gone quite that far, we have&#151;to some
extent&#151;got to the point where the Conservatives are adopting
clause IV. We share their opinion in Committee this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="07062685000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why we share their opinion is that when I expressed to the Home
Secretary in the House my view that it was desirable to allow intercept
evidence in court, he was absolutely scathing to the point of rudeness
in his dismissal of that position. The Leader of the House, the right
hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), supported him in that
opinion and assertion, not orally, but with vehemently expressed body
language, and although we do not know, there is speculation that the
Leader of the House may become Home Secretary again tomorrow, having
previously held the post. It was none the less clear to me and to other
Members, some of whom are in Committee this afternoon, that the
Government had dismissed out of hand the case for allowing intercept
evidence.</div>
					<a name="07062685000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have made their case by seeking to portray members of the
Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties as hopelessly irresponsible
and out of touch for thinking that intercept evidence had a role to
play. We were left in that position, until suddenly&#151;low and
behold&#151;and magically, the man who will be Prime Minister
tomorrow announced, as we have heard, through the Sunday newspapers
thatthe position had been stood on its head. Suddenly, the
Labour Government, far from being dismissive of the use of intercept
evidence in court cases, were inclined towards it being used.</div>
					<a name="07062685000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation is obviously a
humiliation for the Home Secretary, but he is shortly to depart in any
case. It also gives us all in Committee good reason to doubt that the
Government will follow through with the consistency and focus that we
might like on allowing intercept evidence subject to the considerations
and recommendations of the Privy Councillors.</div>
					<a name="07062685000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth recalling that we
are not saying that intercept evidence should be compulsory in court
cases. We are not claiming, as the Minister rightly said, that it is a
silver bullet. It is merely one of the tools at the disposal of those
who wish to prosecute serious crimes. We share the view expressed by
the Conservative Front Bench spokesman and many others beyond the House
that it is legitimate and sensible to allow intercept evidence to be
used. We are minded to support both the clause and the schedule on the
basis that they are before us and we have no firm and consistent reason
for believing that the Government are committed to going down that path
were they to remove them from the
Bill.</div>

Mr. Benton.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>
					<a name="07062685000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to speak in favour of
retention of clause 4 and schedule 13, and I confess that I am still a
little mystified as to the Government&#146;s profound reluctance to
accept the provisions as part of the Bill. I am grateful for, and
recognise the Government&#146;s movement, to which the Minister
referred this afternoon. It is good to know that they are moving slowly
in the direction of admissibility of intercept evidence, but I fear
that that movement is too slow, and it seems anyway, for reasons that
have been given, that there is no reason why we could not have the
provisions in the Bill, and that all the necessary safeguards that the
Minister believes should come could
follow.</div>
					<a name="07062685000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Be that as it
may, I want to make several general points about why intercept evidence
is so important. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Taunton that
we are not suggesting that intercept evidence is the only weapon to
defeat the serious crimes that the Bill is designed to counter, but it
can be one. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and
South Downs that there are safeguards that can be put in place to
provide the necessary
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07062685000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
setting myself up as a better expert on intelligence than the
intelligence officers who advise the Minister, but if they are worried
that there would be a release of information about sources that would
damage ongoing operations, that is similar in many ways to the concerns
that the police have always had about criminal operations in which
surveillance is involved where we have developed adequate safeguards
that have worked
well.</div>
					<a name="07062685000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should declare
an interest as a criminal barrister. I am not currently practising, but
when I was I came across many instances of police operations in which
surveillance was carried out. Someone&#146;s home would be used for
the surveillance, but the owners of the house were not keen for those
involved in the criminal activity to know where the surveillance was
placed, so that information was not disclosed in open court, nor was it
made available to the defence. The judge would make a decision on the
ground of public interest immunity that that information should not be
vouchsafed to the court or to the defence. That system has worked
admirably for many years, and there is no real difference between that
situation and the situation regarding intelligence that we now
confront.</div>
					<a name="07062685000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
Minister properly referred a number of times to the independence and
trustworthiness of the judiciary, and the reliance that can be placed
on the good sense of the judges. If that is true, we can also rely on
that good sense and trustworthiness when deciding what information
should and should not be made available in intelligence-related
cases.</div>
					<a name="07062685000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me
that we should have the provisions in the Bill because we should have
wider availability of intercept evidence to allow us to defeat
precisely the sort of criminals that the Minister set out as the target
for this
legislation.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000684"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend. I
entirely agree with what he says about PII applications. At the end of
last week, I finished a long case in which much of the evidence was the
result of bugging conversations in cars. A number of PII applications
were made along the lines indicated by my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>hon. Friend, I think to protect the methods by which bugs were put into
a vehicle, although I was for the defendant and therefore did not know.
That is by the
way.</div>
					<a name="07062685000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question that one must ask is where the prima facie argument lies. It
seems to me that as a matter of principle it lies in favour of
admitting intercept evidence. Is it probative? Very often. Is it
relevant? Very often. If it is both relevant and probative, it should
in principle be admissible. Would it enable one to prosecute in cases
that are not presently prosecuted? The answer is probably yes. It would
be good for the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and
South Downs, in that it would enable us to move away from control
orders and towards more
prosecution.</div>
					<a name="07062685000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are
the serious arguments against it? There are two, and here I speak with
a degree of knowledge. It is old knowledge, as from 1990 to 1995 I was
the Foreign Office Minister responsible for working with Government
Communications Headquarters and the Secret Intelligence Service. I saw
all the intelligence product coming to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s
desk and my own and was familiar with the methods and targets adopted
by the Foreign Office and the intelligence services.</div>
					<a name="07062685000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that two issues
of technique need to be addressed. The first is targets. It is
obviously thoroughly undesirable that prospective or actual targets
know that they are they are the targets of intercepted communications.
I accept that. Secondly there is a point that is somewhat less strong
now: the method used. When I was in the Foreign Office, methods were
unquestionably used that were not generally known. I suspect that they
are now. So there are serious questions to be considered on both
targeting and
methodology.</div>
					<a name="07062685000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another,
different matter is the copying of material for ultimate disclosure to
defendants. The prosecution is under a duty to disclose to the
defendant any material that might undermine the prosecution&#146;s
case or reinforce the defence&#146;s. It will be argued that the
intelligence services are therefore under the duty to copy and make
available bodies of the intercept evidence that they are accumulating
for a trial. The question is whether those arguments, which are real
and not derisory, should stand in the way of the admission of intercept
evidence. In my view they should manifestly not.</div>
					<a name="07062685000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill itself provides the
answer, although there may be other answers. As I said in my
intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth,
paragraph 4(1) of schedule 13 makes it plain that intercept evidence
will be admitted only on the application of the prosecution. For that
purpose the prosecution is largely the spokesman of the intelligence
services. If for one reason or another the intelligence services do not
want the intercept evidence to be communicated, either because it
reveals methodology or targets or because it involves too much
transcribing input, a prosecution will not take place. The prosecution
counsel will not make the application. That is the
safeguard.</div>
					<a name="07062685000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
cases the prosecution will go ahead because the intelligence services
are not concerned. If they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>concerned, there will not a prosecution. That is probably a sufficient
safeguard.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000685"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend will know well
that in a PII application, if the judge were to determine that
information should be disclosed to the defendants, and if the
prosecution, presumably in consultation with intelligence authorities,
were to determine that that price was simply too high, they could
always discontinue the prosecution at that
point.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000686"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> That is entirely right, and it does in fact happen.
It reinforces the point that the safeguard that is already in the Bill
will protect the interests of the security services on both methodology
and targeting and the cost and burden of transcribing.</div>
					<a name="07062685000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that we will keep the
provision in the Bill. I accept that it may require further discussion
with the intelligence services to provide reassurance. However, we
should be moving towards the admissibility of intercept evidence in
principle. However, we should be moving towards the admissibility of
intercept evidence in

pleasure to serve under you, Mr. Benton. I want to make only
two or three short points.</div>
					<a name="07062685000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also uncertain about why
the Government are behaving so much like a bashful maiden about this
category of evidence. I understand to some extent that the Minister
wants to ensure that the provisions are brought in a way that perfectly
satisfies the concerns of people who frequently have to risk their
lives in circumstances of great danger, and I quite understand their
concern that any legislation should be thoroughly researched and have a
proper basis.</div>
					<a name="07062685000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am still troubled by
some of what the Minister said. I was considerably puzzled by his
statement that nowhere in the world other than the United Kingdom did
the police and intelligence agencies work together on the interception
of communications. If that is his information, it is wrong.
</div>
					<a name="07062685000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have experience of
several such jurisdictions; I have been advising a particular
Government, not all that distant from here, in whose jurisdiction
precisely that is taking place&#151;the police and judicial
authorities are working extremely closely with the intelligence
agencies, specifically on the eavesdropping of communications in
respect of some very serious criminals indeed. I invite those who brief
the Minister to look again at the issue. If they would like a word with
me, I can tell them where I am talking about and about the practices
adopted elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07062685000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, want to mention Lord Lloyd&#146;s amendment. A good deal of
injustice is being done by the Minister in characterising what we have
been discussing as unsatisfactory and unsafe. With respect, it seems to
me that the amendment has been drafted with the elegance of design that
one would expect of the noble Lord. For the precise reasons mentioned
by my right hon. and learned Friend, and for another reason that he may
not yet have perceived&#151;he certainly did not mention it a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>moment ago&#151;all the safeguards that any intelligence agency or
police authority could reasonably wish for are contained, in one bold
stroke, in the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062685000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only does clause 1(4) do
precisely what my right hon. and learned Friend has said&#151;that
is, apply the provisions of section 17 of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000 until an application is made by the
Crown. It also goes much further. In effect, it enables the Crown to
choose whether to make the application, in which case, as my right hon.
and learned Friend said, it would need the approval of the intelligence
services, which would have carried outthe eavesdropping.
Furthermore, clause 1(4) enables the prosecution to tailor and fashion
its application by submitting it on the terms in respect of which it
wishes to have the intercept evidence admitted. Paragraph 2 to schedule
13, &#147;Considerations for allowing intercept or metering
evidence&#148;, makes it plain that in</div>
					<a name="07062685000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;deciding whether to admit
intercept or metering evidence, the court shall take account of all
relevant considerations...in particular...any application by
the Secretary of State to withhold the evidence or part of the evidence
on the ground that its disclosure, or the disclosure of facts relating
to the obtaining of the evidence, would be contrary to the public
interest&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062685000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can envisage what Lord Lloyd had in mind, and what the inevitable
interpretation of the provision would be in the courts. A prosecutor
would, with the approval of the intelligence agency, put before the
court the terms of the evidence that he wished to be admitted. Such
terms would no doubt omit a whole range of transcripts of other
eavesdropped conversations. They might well omit the circumstances in
which the evidence had been obtained. They would make clear to the
judge the basis on which the Crown sought to have it admitted. If the
judge said, &#147;Well, no, unless you give details of this
particular means of interception&#148;, then the prosecution would
withdraw the application.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000688"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I put it to my hon. and learned Friend that
subsection (2) is double-locked because what it provides in its
cumulative whole is first, the decision of the prosecuting authority.
But it gives the Secretary of State the right to intervene if he or she
feels that the prosecuting authority has made an
error.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000689"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> Yes, it certainly does that. But what I am
concentrating upon is that what this section appears to envisage is
that if one were prosecuting this, one could put a statement before the
court, edited and shorn of all details of how the interception had been
carried out, of all details relating to other conversations or names,
put it before the judge and say, &#147;Will you allow that to be
admitted into evidence?&#148;. Of course, the defence would be able
to make submissions based on that.If the judge said no, they
could withdraw their application.</div>
					<a name="07062685000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that that is not
only reasonable but that it contains all the safeguards that could be
needed. The Crown and the intelligence agency can decide whether to
make an application, the terms on which that application should be
made, the nature of what should be revealed or disclosed and then, if
the judge decides that he will not admit it on that basis, they can
simply withdraw it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>
					<a name="07062685000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those safeguards seem to provide
almost everything it is conceivable that could be wanted. It may be
that only in one case a year would one would make an application and it
would be made on confined terms, which would give little away other
than the fact that they have been eavesdropped. If the judge was
willing to allow that evidence in, and he might very well, then why not
use it in those circumstances? What possible apprehension could there
be, provided one was willing to allow the fact that one had
eavesdropped to have been disclosed in the first place? Of course, the
whole of this argument presupposes that that disclosure is
made.</div>
					<a name="07062685000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
submission to the Minister, he needs to look again at Lord
Lloyd&#146;s provision. It has been elegantly designed&#151;as one
would expect of the noble Lord, with his enormous amount of
experience&#151;and it needs to be carefully considered. Having said
that, the provisions stand perhaps uncomfortably in this Bill. I am
puzzled by an oddity of drafting which, under clause 4 apparently gives
effect for the purposes of this Bill to schedule 13. It effectively
says that the conditions of admissibility when the High Court is
considering a serious crime prevention order shouldbe those
set out in schedule 13. But scheduleparagraph 1(4) of schedule
13 seems to confine admissibility only to a criminal
prosecution.</div>
					<a name="07062685000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
some unease. It may be that further discussion with the distinguished
author of the clause would settle my mind, but at the moment I am not
convinced that it stands in the right place in the Bill. But as a
provision of schedule 13 for admitting intercept communication
evidence, I submit to the Minister that this clause has some elegant
advantages. I would be grateful if he enlightened me as to where the
risks lie in that legislative proposal, if the prosecution can choose
when and on what terms to make an application and further, if the judge
declines to admit it on those terms they can then withdraw
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000690"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> This an extremely important debate, not least
because of the environment within which it happens. It is important for
the Government&#146;s role to be serious. They should not, in any
sense, be seen to be playing games, but to be addressing the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07062685000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament has
been driven in the direction of legislation such as control orders, and
a 28-day period of detention; the Government invited Parliament,
happily unsuccessfully, to agree to a 90-day detention order. We have
been trying to tell the Government that if they bring forward measures
which, by any standard, are repressive and strong, to deal with
terrorism they run the very serious risk of making the position worse.
The laws being put in place make it easier for terrorists to recruit
people to operate against the United
Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="07062685000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
extremely serious issue. Anyone who has read an account of the run-up
to 9/11 in the United States will know that the CIA and the FBI had a
very different approach to this kind of evidence. The CIA saw it as
intelligence; the FBI tended to want it to be of evidential quality
that they could produce in court. There was a serious difference in
operations between the two agencies and they failed to co-operate
adequately with each other. Had they co-operated properly with each
other, it is likely that the passage of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>information between them would have led to the earlier detection and
arrest of the 9/11 bombers, and that appalling tragedy might have been
averted.</div>
					<a name="07062685000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
referred earlier to the United Kingdom&#146;s enormous advantage in
having a system in which the agencies co-operate with each other. There
will not be a divergence between the different agencies who are tasked
with getting information and those who have to produce it as evidence
in court. However, the danger in our approach is that the agencies
dictate the agenda.</div>
					<a name="07062685000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament and the Government
should be the arbiters of the overall public interest but in order to
address the terrorists directly, because we have not confronted the
issue we are being driven to impose serious, regressive legislation in
order to go after the terrorist threat. By doing so, ironically, we run
the risk of making that threat worse, because the legislation acts as a
recruiting sergeant for the terrorists.</div>
					<a name="07062685000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue has been around for a
long time. The incoming Prime Minister presented it in a briefing to
which journalists were not invited, or were told that if they took the
briefing, they could not seek a comment from the official Opposition.
It is unfortunate that the Government still seem to be trying to
present Opposition parties as soft on terrorism. The Government should
bear it in mind that the provision suggested by their lordships acts as
a long-stop in the review process on which they are about to
embark.</div>
					<a name="07062685000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">People would
get the wrong message if the Government were to extract the clause from
the Bill. From now on, they should avoid the presentation issues and
deal with the real issue of co-operation between the agencies, which
includes Parliament and Government. We must all try together to get the
right powers to take on the terrorists effectively without handing them
the tool of repressive legislation that will simply help them to do
their
work.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000691"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank all hon. Members who have contributed to
debate and discussion of this part of the Bill for their comments. The
hon. Member for Reigate makes the point that this is an extremely
important issue that all of us want to see resolved, and I think that
we all agree. He stressed the importance of the issue and the need to
present it to the public in the most appropriate way. I thank him for
his comment.</div>
					<a name="07062685000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs if the
Government have made a commitment to do something and have not done it.
I will check that and reply to him. I can only apologise if it is the
case. We will check the commitment, see what has not been done and try
as far as possible, although we cannot rewind the clock, to see what we
can do.</div>
					<a name="07062685000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make a
couple of remarks. The hon. Gentleman raised all sorts of issues, as
did his hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and other
Members. The Government are absolutely committed to a review of the use
of intercept. We are also committed to using intercept as evidence if
we can find a workable model and the necessary safeguards can be put in
place. That is the Government&#146;s position. It is clear, and there
is no rowing back from it. As the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>Prime Minister-designate and others have said, we will pursue that
review on Privy Councillors&#146; terms.</div>
					<a name="07062685000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot say what form the
review will take, what the membership will be or any of the other
things that have yet to be resolved&#151;as I understand it, those
discussions are still going on&#151;but I make in this Committee the
commitment, to be recorded in <i class="I">Hansard, </i>that that review will
take place. We expect and hope that it will not take too long. If the
review concludes that the use of intercept evidence is appropriate, a
working model can be identified and the necessary safeguards can be put
in place, it might be possible to include it in a counter-terrorism
Bill in the autumn. Those commitments have been made. That is what we
have said, and that is what we are trying to achieve. We cannot
guarantee that it will happen, but that is how we propose to take the
matter forward.</div>
					<a name="07062685000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall share a couple of points with the Committee to identify the
difficulty. To be fair, the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and
West Devon, as well as his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham, raised issues about the drafting of clause
4 and schedule 13 that will need to be overcome. Many hon.
Members&#146; questions involve the very issues that need to be
resolved if we are to find a workable model built on consensus that
allows us to use intercept as evidence. That will include Parliament,
as the hon. Member for Reigate said; it will include law enforcement,
the intelligence services and everyone else involved, but issues still
remain to be resolved. We would be deluding ourselves as a Committee if
we did not appreciate
that.</div>
					<a name="07062685000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Arundel and South Downs said&#151;I know that he did not mean
it&#151;&#147;a police officer said&#148;. It was not a police
officer. I shall repeat it, because it is very important. It was not a
police officer; it was a deputy chief constable speaking on behalf of
the Association of Chief Police Officers in evidence to the Joint
Committee on Human Rights. Not 10 years ago but a couple of months ago,
in March 2007, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07062685000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If we
reduce our capacity in order to serve the evidential regime, there is a
possibility...that we will lose that capability to disrupt some
potentially catastrophic
scenarios.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062685000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government were to ignore that and say, &#147;We will proceed
irrespective of what one of the most senior police officers has told
us&#148;, I do not think that the Committee would be saying,
&#147;Why are you not using this intercept as evidence?&#148; If,
as a consequence of doing that, some catastrophic event was not
prevented, which could have been prevented, Parliament and hon. Members
on both sides would rightly ask, &#147;Why did you not take any
notice of what the senior officer
said?&#148;</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000692"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> The Minister is not dealing here with a provision
that would allow the interception of communication evidence to be
admissible in every burglary, theft, shoplifting or even drug dealing
case, but with a specific provision&#151;it might apply only to three
or even one case a year&#151;that would allow the prosecution to
choose its own territory and to say, &#147;This case is so important,
and it is so important that we bring a conviction, that we will bring
this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>
						application and choose to put to the judge the way
in which we propose to adduce the evidence, and ask him to approve it.
And if he won&#146;t, we won&#146;t do it.&#148; Now what on
earth is wrong with
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000693"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The Government are searching for such a model that
will allow that to happen, so that we do not have senior police
officers telling us that the consequences of taking forward a model
that they do not believe has the necessary safeguards in it could be
catastrophic. We often quote senior people such asthe
Information Commissioner. Now let me read another quote, this time from
the interception of communications commissioner&#151;another senior
figure. He said, again, not 10 years ago, but in his last published
annual report in February
2007,</div>
					<a name="07062685000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in my judgment,
the introduction of intercept material in the criminal process in this
country...would put at risk the effectiveness of the agencies on
whom we rely in the fight against terrorists and serious criminals,
might well result in less convictions and more acquittals and, most
important of all, the ability of the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies to detect and disrupt terrorism and serious crime and so
protect the public of the country would be severely
handicapped&#148;.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000694"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Will the Minister not recognise that the two
statements that he has read out were made by people addressing the
issue at large, not in the context of the Bill? My hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon made it plain that the
provisions in the Bill provide precisely the kind of protection that
the two gentlemen quoted by the Minister were
seeking.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000695"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> With respect to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman, the point that I am trying to make is that senior figures in
the police, interception world and intelligence services have serious
concerns about the use of intercept as evidence and the way in which it
has been included in the Bill. The Government have said that,
notwithstanding those concerns and objections, if we can find a
workable model and a way in which to ensure the necessary safeguards,
we will look to introduce into the counter-terrorism Bill in the autumn
the necessary legal changes so that we can use intercept as
evidence.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000696"></a>Nick
Herbert:
						</b> I do not think that any of us have tried to do
anything other than concede that there are concerns in the intelligence
services about the use of intercept. In fact, I said that specifically.
That is why surely it makes sense to examine those matters
properly.</div>
					<a name="07062685000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the Minister should be allowed to get away with the
suggestion that there is some sort of universal expression of concern
among the police. I do not dismiss the concerns of the officer who
warned about the impact on capacity, but the fact is that the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who is the most senior police officer
in the country, and his assistant, who is tasked with tackling
terrorism, have both made it clear that they favour the use of
intercept evidence and want the issue to be
considered.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000697"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> My understanding is that the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner&#146;s view is exactly the same as the
Government&#146;s; that is, that intercept evidence is perfectly
acceptable, provided we can find 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>
						the necessary safeguards and put together a workable
legal model. As I said, that is the intention of the review. That is
how we want to go forward, and I believe that it is a sensible way of
proceeding.</div>
					<a name="07062685000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to resource implications. I
raise with him the example that Sir Swinton Thomas, the interception of
communications commissioner, gave in his last annual report. It
illustrates the problem of an increased resource burden on the
interception agencies. He quoted a recent case in which a trial judge
orderedthe prosecution to transcribe some 16,000 hours of
eavesdropping material at a cost of just under
&#163;2
million.</div>
					<a name="07062685000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, when
I visited the Serious Organised Crime Agency to see some of its
capability and capacity, one of the concerns that was raised with me
was the use of intercept as evidence. Apart from the philosophical
debate that may take place, there are practicalities to be considered.
If a piece of intercept evidence has to be of an evidential standard
instead of just something to be used to inform some law enforcement
activity, the transcribing of huge amounts of data is required rather
than just the securing of a particular place. The only point that was
made to me was that, notwithstanding the philosophical points and
points of principle that need to be made about the use of intercept
evidence, there are practical consequences for the agencies as
well.</div>
					
					<a name="07062685000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000698"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> Does the Minister not understand that the provision
circumvents that problem? It allows the prosecution to go to the judge
with a certain amount of information, but a certain amount of
information only, and ask him to admit it on that basis. If the judge
says no, the prosecution withdraws. It can say to the judge, &#147;We
want to introduce evidence that is particularly devastating and
compelling. This is the conversation and context in which it took
place, but we will give no further details. If you will not admit it on
that basis, we shall withdraw the application.&#148; The judge can
say yes or no.</div>
					<a name="07062685000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no risk that a judge will order massive disclosure to the defence of
hundreds of conversations tape-recorded over many hours&#151;much of
the material would be unused&#151;because the prosecution will be
able to get a ruling from the judge beforehand as to what he will and
will not permit. That is what the provision means. That is how I would
interpret it, and I have spent 25 years practising in the courts at a
level that would involve precisely such applications. I cannot see the
problem.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062685000699"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I gave an example from the commissioner&#146;s
last report of a judge who said that it was necessary to transcribe
16,000 hours of eavesdropping material. Concerns are being raised by
the agencies that are responsible for law enforcement, for tackling
serious crime and for running our intelligence
services.</div>

it is not a matter of shutting down the debate or closing our minds to
the use of intercept as evidence. We have made a serious commitment to
the review. I note again the point made by the hon. Member for Reigate,
but we will take the review forward and we would be foolish to proceed
by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>
						ignoring what the intelligence services, senior
police officers and the Serious Organised Crime Agency tell us. We want
to find a workable model and a way in which intercept evidence can be

Minister&#146;s apology, but we still have not received that
