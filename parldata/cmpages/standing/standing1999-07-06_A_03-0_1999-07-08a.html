</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. May I say, as I was not here for our first sitting, what a pleasure it is to have you in the Chair for our deliberations?
<P>
Let me return briefly to what I said earlier about amendments Nos. 37 and 39, which would remove references to the FSA's general functions as defined under clause 2(4) with the purported effect that the authority's objectives and principles would bite directly on all the FSA's functions, not just those set out in clause 2(4).
<P>
It must be clear by now how committed the Government are to ensuring that the authority is properly accountable and that it acts fairly and reasonably at all times. It is equally important to allow the FSA to do its business without undue or unnecessary hindrance. In the light of that balance, the amendments are inappropriate and possibly a recipe for complete disaster.
<P>
The general functions cover the FSA's rule making powers and, we propose, its code making functions. It also provides guidance and determines policy principles by reference to which other functions are performed. For example, in determining enforcement policy or rule waivers, the FSA will need to try to meet its statutory objectives and to have regard to the principles. However, individual enforcement decisions or rule waivers will not be subject to challenge on the grounds that the objectives have not been met.
<P>
That is entirely proper. Otherwise, each and every member of staff will have to make a judgment whether and, if so, the extent to which all the FSA's objectives and principles have been met in every single decision. They would also have to decide on a proper balance between the objectives and the principles. Individual members of staff would have to decide, before doing anything at all, how to balance the consumer protection objective and the principle of facilitating innovation or not necessarily impeding competition. Requiring such judgments to be made every day by every employee every time he or she wants to do something would be a formula for delay, inconsistency and trouble.
<P>
That is not to say that FSA staff will not be obliged to have regard to objectives and principles in other ways. As with every organisation, FSA staff will be subject to policies and guidelines that would be set by people at an appropriately high level in the organisation so as to deliver consistently and across the board on the principles and objectives. Indeed, it is quite likely that both would go into much greater detail than the objectives to ensure that staff had appropriate guidance. That is akin to what would happen in the usual corporate structure and is not at all dissimilar to the application of both the FSA's rules and a regulated firm's own detailed rules to its employees.
<P>
The issues of competition and competiveness were raised this morning in amendments tabled by the Opposition. The amendments address two matters that also were debated by the Joint Committee and attempt to change the requirements imposed on the FSA to have regard to those matters under the principles set out in clause 2(3) into fully fledged objectives.
<P>
The Government have no doubt at all about the importance of maintaining the strong competitive position of United Kingdom financial businesses in world markets. There is no disagreement between us 63 64 [Ms Patricia Hewitt]
<P>
about that being vital to our national well-being. The Government keep competitiveness high on their list of priorities. Similarly, we are clear about the benefits to consumers of strong competition in our home markets.
<P>
The Bill does not stop competition law applying to firms in the financial services sector. It simply disapplies that law where it might otherwise conflict with firms' compliance with FSA rules. The rules will be subject to rigorous competition scrutiny by the Director General of Fair Trading under the Bill. I want to stress an important point, which is that all FSA rules and practices, including capital adequacy rules for banks and insurance companies, will be subject to scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading. Contrasting that with existing regulations, under which only investment business rules are subject to that scrutiny, makes it clear that the Bill takes a very important step forward by subjecting the regulatory regime itself to competition scrutiny. In other words, the regulatory activity previously carried out by the Bank of England will be covered for the first time by competition scrutiny. That is an important innovation that does not apply to other areas of regulation such as that for the environment and health and safety.
<P>
The fact that competition and competitiveness figure in the FSA's principles, but not in its objectives does not represent a downgrading of the importance of these issues. Instead, the Government believe that such an approach best equips the FSA to take them into account along with other matters such as protecting innovation and ensuring a proper cost-benefit analysis when applying its objectives. The Joint Committee agreed that it was not appropriate to give the FSA extra new objectives.
<P>
It is clear that the amendments are intended to act as a constraint on executive regulation. We share the belief that regulation must be proportionate. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said in Committee on Tuesday, we want regulation to have a light touch where possible, but to give effective protection where necessary.
<P>
The principles set out in clause 2 (3) deliver that aim. The subsection addresses directly several factors that the FSA must have regard to when carrying out its functions. It covers competition, competitiveness and innovation as well as equally important issues relating to regulatory costs and burdens and the role of senior management. The need to have regard to such factors is part and parcel of the FSA's statutory duty, and will have a pervasive influence on the way in which it carries out its functions. I think that that answers the question that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) asked this morning.
<P>
Paragraph (f) is intended to reflect fully our commitment to ensuring that competition is protected. In this interesting debate we have not heard any reason why the principles in subsection (2) and in paragraph (f) in particular will not have the effect that we intend.
<P>
One amendment relates to how the Treasury considers competition and competitiveness. I fully agree with Conservative Members that the Treasury should be aware of the impact of its rules on competition in United Kingdom markets and the competitiveness of UK firms. Those issues will certainly be in our minds when we or our successors exercise Treasury powers under the Bill.
<P>
The FSA and the Treasury are fundamentally different. The FSA is an independent statutory regulator, whereas the Treasury is a Government Department and Treasury Ministers are directly accountable to Parliament for their actions. Indeed, there will be Parliamentary procedures for many of the powers exercisable by Ministers under the Bill.
<P>
The non-statutory objectives that are set for the Treasury by the Government include increasing the productivity of the economy through competition, among other means, as well as securing an efficient market in financial services. In addition, the Treasury, like other Government Departments, must follow the better regulation guidance issued by the Cabinet Office in preparing public regulatory impact statements outlining the costs and benefits of proposed regulations.
<P>
We intend to consult widely on the most significant items of secondary legislation made under the Bill. Indeed, we have already set that process in train. That approach has been widely welcomed and it will allow firms and others to bring to our attention any concerns that they may have.
<P>
However, I do not see why the Treasury should only take account of competition and competitiveness when it exercises its powers. We might also wish to consider to take just two examples the protection of consumers or the international character of financial markets. I do not want the specific issues singled out in the amendments written into the Bill in the way that Conservative Members propose.
<P>
We have had an extremely interesting debate. I have no doubt that we shall continue to reflect on the issue of competition. However, in the light of what I have said, I hope the amendment will be withdrawn. If it is not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I say how delighted I am that you are chairing our proceedings, Mr. O'Brien? I apologise for the fact that I was able to attend only the first part of our sitting on Tuesday.
<P>
Nine Opposition amendments and two new clauses are bracketed together and they cover three distinct areas. However, they interrelate because they all seek to beef up the checks and balances and the potential for legal constraint in the event of the arbitrary use of powers by the FSA. The provisions in the Bill need to be beefed up so that we do not damage Britain's most successful industry. However, a constitutional principle is also involved. There must be routes for legal constraints if the FSA does not act in a proper fashion. The FSA will have huge legislative powers and the abuse of them may have an unfair impact on people working in the industry, reduce competition and competitiveness and ultimately damage our most successful industry.
65 66 <P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We all support good regulation. As the Economic Secretary pointed out, the Government have, to some extent, included those three territories in the Bill. However, those territories are too prescribed. I cannot resist quoting Howard Davies, who said in the Financial Times:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The good side of Stalinism is that it enables projects to be delivered on budget and on time".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The extent to which an enormously powerful legislative body with thin channels of accountability is being created constitutionally has not been adequately realised.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): Labour Members are rather confused. Will the hon. Gentleman explain the relevance of Stalin to the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that you ate not going up that street, Mr. Flight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We know what we are talking about.
<P>
Most Labour Members have not fully grasped that we are giving undemocratic, unaccountable powers to the body created under the Bill. I shall go through the three related issues that we have been attempting to highlight and the importance of which was clearly grasped by the Economic Secretary.
<P>
To which activities of the FSA should regulatory objectives and principles relate? Should those activities be limited or prescribed, subjective or objective? In specifying that the objectives and principles relate only to general functions, the Bill makes that territory pretty narrow. Those functions, which we have discussed, are rule-making, giving advice and guidance, and determining general policy and principles.
<P>
Leaving such matters undefined would mean that the objectives would be too wide. By contrast, the definitions in the Bill are far too narrow.
<P>
Should the FSA's conduct be subjective or objective? Under the Bill, it is subjective what the FSA considers to be most appropriate. In other words, the FSA will be off the hook if it says that its conduct is appropriate, even if the result of that conduct is extremely undesirable.
<P>
The objectives should be objective. The FSA should act so as to achieve the automatic defence proposed in amendment No. 19. Leaving the FSA's conduct as subjective places its legislative powers above the law.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would require the FSA to conduct itself in a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasonable, open and transparent"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
manner.
<P>
We do not accept the Economic Secretary's arguments against that. No one is suggesting that those words or its context mean that the FSA should make confidential documents available to the public. It is about the manner in which it should act, just as the FSA requires the financial services industry itself to act in like manner on the other side of the fence. We cannot see why there cannot be a pari passu balance between regulator and regulated in terms of transparency.
<P>
Pulling those two areas together, it must be right for objectives to relate to the activities of the FSA generally and not only to rule-making, advice, policy and principles. Just looking at the range of things which the FSA covers, why is it logical to exclude such important areas as market abuse, security law, discipline, authorisation, prosecutions and many others? Why should the behaviour of the FSA and its functions in those areas be excluded from the obligation on the FSA to act in accordance with its objectives? Several of its objectives not all relate closely to those areas; they do not just relate to those defined under the general category.
<P>
The Economic Secretary to the Treasury said that it would be unreasonable to expect staff of the FSA to be able to act in this fashion. But it is a challenge to the staff of the FSA just as it is a challenge to members of the industry to be on top of such requirements. Clearly, it would be for the management of the FSA to communicate down through the ranks just as it is for the management in the financial services industry to communicate down.
<P>
Again, there are many areas of general objective within the financial services industry itself such as: know the customer; safeguard the assets of the client; protect investors; best execution; transparency of information. Everyone working in the industry, not just people with particular licences, is required to act in accordance with those principles. It does not seem at all peculiar to expect people working for the regulator to be taught and to act in accordance with the objectives and principles of the FSA. To claim that it would be too difficult so therefore exempt them and define the territory to which objectives and principles apply is to buttress a privileged position quite unjustifiably.
<P>
I turn to the question whether the FSA's behaviour in pursuing its objectives and principles should be subjective or objective. The Economic Secretary argued that they should be subjective. We cannot justify a subjective qualification. It can so easily be an excuse for doing something wrong or for not doing something one should have done. It is, in essence, to argue on the regulatory side of the fence that ignorance of the law is a defence.
<P>
If someone in the industry claimed that in his judgment something he did was the best execution, and that he was acting on the basis of knowing his customer, it would be a complete joke. There are clear rules. Either staff obeyed those rules or they did not. We are now saying that it is quite alright for the regulator to say that he thought he knew what the law was and doing it right. That is not good enough. It needs to be objective, not subjective.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He is speaking to amendment No. 19 among others. Does he agree that that is a classic example of the sort of circumlocution that goes into this Bill in order to give maximum latitude to the authority? Clear English goes out of the window.
67 68 [Sir Nicholas Lyell]
<P>
Clause 2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In discharging its general functions" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we object to "general"
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Authority must, so far as is reasonably possible, act in a way",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 which is fine, but I would prefer "which is appropriate for meeting the objectives". Does my hon. Friend agree that including another phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which the Authority considers most appropriate" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is simply an attempt to escape a judicial review? That gives the authority a latitude that could be struck down only if it were wholly unreasonable, notwithstanding the reference to reasonableness earlier in the clause. Does that not make my hon. Friend's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. and learned Friend for making my very point in such good and healthy legal language. Acting in manner that meets the objectives subjectively has no value whatever as legal protection. None of the 1 million-plus people in the financial services industry would dream of providing as an excuse the fact that they thought subjectively that they were acting in accordance with the principles. The rules are complicated in detail and everyone is expected to know them. Why should not everyone in the FSA be expected to know the objectives and principles, and to act in accordance therewith?
<P>
The third territory is competition and competitiveness. Amendment No. 46 asserts that the maintenance of domestic competition and the promotion of the UK's competitiveness internationally should be objectives, not principles. New clause 1 spells out what that means. Regulation is merely not to impede competition domestically, so we are not asking the FSA to have an unreasonable role in that respect. Competitiveness internationally is about giving the UK a regime that provides a competitive advantage. That is accepted by the Government and everyone else as a key objective of the regulatory regime.
<P>
There is little difference between the current wording of the principles part of clause 2 and our wording in the amendments. Dare I say it, our wording is perhaps clearer and more precise. It is not true that our wording would impose great difficulties on the regulator in international discussions or oblige it to be proactive on the domestic competition front. We are not seeking to achieve that.
<P>
The key issue is whether principles or objectives are most appropriate. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) said, if the goal is to provide legal protection against oppression through judicial review, the principle is completely useless. The FSA could always argue that one or other of the objectives overrode the principle, or that it had given due attention to the principles but matters worked out another way. In terms of assembling a case for a judicial review, competition as a principle is immensely weak, but competition and competitiveness as objectives are strong because it can be demonstrated clearly whether either has been damaged.
<P>
New clause 2 seeks to join the Treasury into the competition and competitiveness objective. Perhaps the Economic Secretary is right that the Treasury should be joined into the other objectives, given that the Bill is drafted strangely. One thinks initially that it is empowering the FSA as the legislator. On reading it, we find that the Treasury has reserved a number of powers to make the FSA its ventriloquist and puppet. The whole basis of legal protection provided by the objectives is substantially undone if the Treasury is not joined into them in some way in relation to its role under the Bill. I would have to defer to a lawyer about whether that conflicts with other requirements on the Treasury, but I cannot see why it should in principle, specifically in relation to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There has been a deliberate lack of clarity about why we attach so much importance to competition and competitiveness. There are two different aspects. A healthy industry is one that has healthy competition and is competitive in its domestic market and is competitive internationally. Therefore it is crucial to the health of our largest single industry, largest exporter and largest employer. Behind that lies the subtlety of this being the area that permits a legal and constitutional route in the event of the FSA abusing its excessive powers to the detriment of the industry. In that territory, we take the view that to make competition and competitiveness merely a principle, not an objective, is to undo that protection.
<P>
Clause 361 has no doubt deliberately been left to the end of the Bill on the assumption that we shall all be exhausted by the time we get to it, but it is relevant to clause 2. The clause ends up giving the Treasury virtual carte blanche powers to override all the detailed clauses of the Bill. It allows the Treasury to do whatever it thinks necessary or expedient for general and particular purposes. If hon. Members believe that it is necessary and desirable for this legislation to include legal checks on the Bill being used to promote unlimited legislative powers and powers to intervene, then that power for the Treasury is meaningless unless it is joined in to the objectives, and potentially joined in to the principles, but the objectives are key.
<P>
For example, some 10 days ago in a session with Howard Davies, we asked him what he saw as the FSA's role in relation to salaries. He said that he saw it as the role of the authority to determine remuneration structures in the derivatives industry, that some remuneration structures could lead to high risk and commercial dangers and that the right type of structure would not do that. I understand the point. Mr. Davies is right; he is a highly intelligent man. However, the concept of the FSA deriving a legal right to interfere in remuneration policy in the financial services industry even before the Bill is enacted is alarming. For those reasons we are anxious that appropriate legal channels to check the authority's power be put in place.
<P>
While we seem very much at one with the Government on the objectives that we wish to achieve in this important early part of the Bill largely clause 2 we 69 70 remain of the view that the Bill has packaged those three key elements in a very weak manner. Considerable beefing up of the powers is required. We want to vote on amendment No. 4 and on the others formally when we reach clause 2.

<P>

<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I wish to say a few brief words in support of amendment No. 46 and new clause 1, which deal with competition and competitiveness. They contain important policy aims that we all share, and it is inherently sensible that those aims are embedded as securely as possible in the Bill through the definition of objectives.
<P>
I wish to criticise not the amendment, but the way that the concepts be they objectives or principles are dealt with in legislation as a whole. However, I have a problem with the language and what we precisely mean by competitiveness and competition and the relationship between the two. We all have a common-sense understanding of what competitiveness means and what the FSA should do. We all want to create an environment in which the City of London can continue to attract world-class firms. They will be attracted here if we have an open and transparent market, the rule of law and if regulations keep out dishonest and poor quality companies, but will not over-regulate the rest. We have a mental picture of what a successful City of London involves.
<P>
I hope that I am not being pedantic, but that objective is not necessarily the same as more competition. Big mergers are taking place in the broking sector in the City. They may increase its competitiveness by driving down costs, but they reduce competition. In the retail sector, there is a process of elimination of many banks and building societies. That has taken place in the name of competitiveness and driving down costs, but it reduces competition. The two concepts are different, and they may well oppose each other in terms of underlying trends.
<P>
We need to clarify the definitions and resolve contradictions, and the amendment would be helpful. The arguments of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) were persuasive, and I am inclined to support them.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise for coming late to the debate. Consequently, I shall be brief.
<P>
I wish to speak in support of new clause 2. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>".When deciding what regulations or orders the Treasury should make under this Act, or what other powers or discretions the Treasury should exercise under this Act, the Treasury must seek to meet the maintenance of competition and competitiveness objective and must have regard to the considerations set out in section 2(3)(c) and (d).".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That ties in with the duty suggested in new clause 1 for the FSA to have regard to the United Kingdom's competitive advantage internationally.
<P>
Clause 2(3) refers to the authority's discharge of its general functions we would prefer it to refer simply to "functions" and states that it must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) the principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person, or on the carrying on of an activity, should be proportionate to the benefits, considered in general terms, which are expected to result from the imposition of that burden or restriction;
<P>
(d) the desirability of facilitating innovation in connection with regulated activities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In amendment No. 46, we propose that, in an additional paragraph (e), it should also have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the maintenance of competition and promotion of United Kingdom competitiveness".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surely all Committee members agree that that is extremely important. However, unless those words are added to the clause, that will not be spelt out in this crucial part of the Bill.
<P>
Including in the Bill the wording proposed in our amendment would be more satisfactory. However, should the Government, with their superior drafting skills, prefer a different wording, we would not object to that, provided it was done in an effective way and makes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the maintenance of competition and promotion of United Kingdom competitiveness"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a general objective.
<P>
On Second Reading, there was almost unanimous agreement that that was a key factor for the City. Obviously, maintaining competition should not override a proper regulatory system. Indeed, a regulatory system cannot maintain confidence unless it regulates fairly and effectively. However, per contra, if competitiveness is not borne in mind, a top-heavy system can easily build up, weighing down the regulators and, more importantly, the regulated.
<P>
We are right to bring to the Committee's attention the need to make that matter explicit in the Bill. As presently drafted, the Bill's initial clauses are not sufficiently upfront about that.
<P>
I therefore invite the Minister to prove me wrong or accept our proposals.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall happily respond to that. As has been acknowledged by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, there is no disagreement among Committee members about the importance of the financial services industry, the need to maintain and enhance competition in that industry for the benefit of consumers, and to maintain our international competitiveness in an industry so crucial to the UK economy.
<P>
We are wholly agreed on those objectives. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary and I have made clear repeatedly, we believe that effective regulation, properly done, is a source of competitive advantage. On that, too, we are agreed.
<P>
We have sought to secure in the Bill the balance between lightness of touch, where possible, and effective protection, where necessary. That is essential if we are to get the regulatory system right. We do not wish the financial services industry to become tied up with regulatory red tape; indeed, our intentions are quite the reverse.
<P>
Clause 2(3)(f) states that the Authority shall have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily."<P>
</UL></FONT>
71 72 [Ms Hewitt]
<P>
<P>
That spells out the competition principle. I am not sure that the wording about the maintenance of competition suggested by Opposition Members achieves anything different.
<P>
Clause 2(3)(e) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the international character of financial services and markets",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ensuring that the FSA is reminded of that global fact of life. Subsection (3)(e) also refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, subsection 3(d) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the desirability of facilitating innovation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All those requirements direct the FSA to have proper regard to competitiveness, competition and innovation in the exercise of its general functions. In other words, the FSA will not tie up the industry in regulatory red tape.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): The text of what the Minister has just said will reveal that we all share the objectives of competitiveness and competition. She perhaps was perhaps using the term "objective" in a more general sense than the technical sense that would be applied in the Bill. It is significant that she took that word and that notion to be the bedrock of looking at all the other aspects of the regulatory objectives. We have to look at competition in relation to the other four objectives. That is how I took her remarks. She may wish to challenge that.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are clearly not acknowledging that although, quite correctly, there is a reference to competition in clause 2(3)(d), (e) and (f), the FSA simply has to "have regard" to those factors. They have not been elevated to the level of an objective. That comes back
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Then I shall stop there and come back again in a moment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was making an intervention. I was beginning to wonder whether I had got it wrong. The hon. Gentleman should not get overexcited; I choose my words with great care. The Government and the Opposition have a shared policy objective in relation to the financial services industry. We will achieve the objective of securing effective competition and international competitiveness through a variety of means.
<P>
One crucial method is by requiring the FSA, when it discharges its general functions, to have regard to the principles that I spelled out a moment ago and that are spelled out in the Bill. We shall achieve that by subjecting the financial services industry, like every other industry, to the considerably strengthened competition regime that the Government put in place with the Competition Act 1998. We will also secure those principles by ensuring, for the first time, that all the rules and the exercise of its powers by the FSA are subjected to the competitiveness scrutiny of the Office of Fair Trading. That is extremely important which is why I stressed it earlier.
<P>
I am happy to reflect further on the debate. It is an extremely important issue and certainly, if there are ways in which we can improve the wording of the principles, we will be happy to look at them. The way that we have spelled out the principles to which the FSA must have regard meets our shared goal of ensuring that competition and competitiveness are maintained and not impeded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Some of us are still not comforted by the phrase "have regard to" which could mean a little notice on the washroom wall of the FSA. Could she therefore reassure us in another way? Subsection (3)(f) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Could she give some examples where there would be a justification for distorting or impeding, thus looking at it from the other angle?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful for that question. It deals precisely with the kind of trade-offs that the authority will on occasion have to make. Let us take as an example of capital adequacy requirements for banks. The FSA, very properly in my and, I hope, the hon. Member's view, sets capital adequacy requirements by looking at the strength or otherwise of the financial institution concerned. It does not take an across the board, one-size-fits-all approach. It may be faced with a proposed new entrant to banking that is backed by a foreign institution about which, for good reasons, it has some concerns. It may know of regulatory matters in the home country of that institution. The authority, considering its objectives of securing market confidence and appropriate protection of consumers, may rightly decide that a higher capital adequacy ratio is required for that new entrant to the British banking market. That would undoubtedly be an impediment to competition because it would make it more difficult for the new entrant to come into our market. But in the hypothetical circumstances that I outline, it would be a necessary impediment, otherwise confidence in the financial system as a whole, or the proper protection of consumers, could be damaged by inadequate attention to the need to regulate the new institution. It is that sort of trade-off that we think the Bill now requires the authority to make by having regard to the principles and deciding whether the rules that it proposes to make in the discharge of its general functions are in danger of unnecessarily impeding or distorting competition.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I agree completely with the hon. Lady's point, which harks back to a point that I made this morning about capital adequacy. Will she look at the issue from the other way round? Under her scenario, what would justify allowing a foreign bank to come into the London market and give it lower capital adequacy ratios, to make more banks, or whatever? How would she justify that on the competition basis that she outlined?
73 74 <P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The FSA must have regard to both its objectives and its principles. It will need to decide what would be an appropriate capital adequacy ratio for that institution, having regard to both those things. I think that that is clear although I see that I am about to take another intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are on crucial territory here. For me, there is a clear implication that the objectives weigh heavier than the principles. Regardless of whether the issue is capital adequacy or protecting the consumer, it is not a question of weighing equally competition and competitiveness against those objectives which would be the case if the two were objectives. They must rank higher in priority than the principles. The key point is that competition and competitiveness have been downgraded to category 2 in the quasi objectives although they should be on an equal basis with the four existing objectives.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This is a fascinating debate on an extremely important issue. I underline that we strongly favour competition in banking, as in other industries. That is why we propose in the Bill to extend the Office of Fair Trading's role to allow it to scrutinise banking regulation as well as the banking industry, so that if the FSA, in discharging its general functions, were to be unnecessarily impeding competition by setting, say, excessively high capital adequacy ratios, thus distorting and preventing entry into the market, the OFT would be able to investigate and report.
<P>
That proposal and the manner in which we structured it was endorsed by the Joint Committee. But the whole issue of competition in banking, which is a very important part of the industry, is the subject of an inquiry by Mr. Cruikshank which was established by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. We look forward to the publication of his interim report, which will be available for parliamentary and public debate. If it suggests further improvements we shall consider them carefully as we shall continue to consider carefully suggestions from members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We are on some of the most important clauses in the Bill and these objectives and their drafting are crucial, as the Minister recognises. I am glad that she is considering carefully the detailed wording of which we speak. Does she agree that merely "having regard to" is a fairly light burden on the regulator? New clause 1 seeks to impose an obligation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the United Kingdom or by any category of authorised participants" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 and now come the crucial words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to secure a regulatory regime in the United Kingdom which provides a competitive advantage internationally".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a slight but important distinction in those words. We are not seeking merely to maintain what we have, where we have it, but, consistent with good regulation, to secure a positive advantage for the future. Does the Economic Secretary accept that in principle, and will she consider suitable wording to achieve it?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for that point. The issue arose this morning when my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) said that if we act to secure a competitive advantage, there is a danger of undermining the regulator's ability to secure co-operative relationships with regulators in other countries, with whom it is essential for the FSA to work to secure effective regulation of the rapidly growing number of financial services organisations that are global companies operating in different jurisdictions.
<P>
Securing competitive advantage through regulation may present another danger in being misunderstood as referring simply to regulatory costs. I would strongly resist, as would many right hon. and hon. Members, any implication that the FSA should seek to secure a competitive advantage by trying to reduce regulatory costs to the worst regulated jurisdictions in the global economy, regardless of the impact on market confidence, consumer protection and so forth.
<P>
Let me stress again that I am happy to look again at the wording of the principles to establish whether opting for "competitive advantage" rather than "competitive position" would add something useful to them without running into the dangers to which I have just referred. If we decide that that is desirable, we can return to it in our later sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to look at it again. I would like to press her a little more by asking three questions. First, does she agree that the prospect probably inevitability of judicial review is one of the crucial tools by which the FSA will be held to account? Secondly, does she agree that "having regard to" principles is a weak form of words that will have legal consequences in the judicial review process? Thirdly, if she does agree in part with those two points, does she accept that the courts will put objectives ahead of and superior to principles, and that the process of judicial review will place competition at a lower level of importance than the regulatory objectives in the Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> May I add a few more points for the Minister to respond to? I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) about the hierarchy of the phraseology in the Bill and I agree that "having regard to" principles is far too woolly. Far too much terminology in the Bill emulates that problem and needs to be tied down.
<P>
Ironically, both sides of the Committee agree more or less in principle: the Government are going along with our case, so I am at a loss to understand why they are hesitant to go the whole hog and tie it down in black and white in the Bill, which is what we are trying to do. I repeat the question that I asked this morning, which the Minister has not yet answered, about the future role of the OFT if, as she said, it will extend to scrutinising banking regulation.
<H4><center>5.30 pm</center></H4>
<P>
How can firms and regulated persons challenge rulings of the OFT? What is the complaints procedure? The OFT will presumably refer its decisions to the Treasury. From what we read in the press and hear in the 75 76 [Mr. Loughton]
<P>
speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, it seems that the Government are retrenching from their role of being the last adjudicator in OFT cases.
<P>
The Government do not seem to want to adjudicate on competition matters, and I go along with that. However, if the Minister is not prepared to be the last stop, and if it is unclear how people can complain about the role of the OFT, we shall be going round in circles and not resolving the problem. It is inherently important that the competitiveness objective is put down as a responsibility of the FSA. I repeat that it is a red herring to say that the FSA has its hands tied behind its back when dealing with other international regulators. The Government have not made their case. It is an oft-repeated mantra, but I contend that it would promote the competitiveness of overseas regulators, and free financial services markets across the world in the interests of all consumers and not only those in this country.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The debate is, indeed, interesting. It underlines once again the value of the Committee's scrutiny.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester asked three questions, to which the answers are yes, no and no. First, recourse to judicial review is by no means the only way in which the FSA will be held accountable for its actions, but it is important. Secondly, I do not believe that "must have regard to" is a weak phrase that will have no effect. I am perfectly happy to consider that further, but I know that the Parliamentary draftsman has already given attention to that matter because we made it clear that we wanted the principles to be given proper weight. Thirdly, I do not believe that the principles can be regarded as unimportant. They are there to guide the authority in the exercise of its general functions and in its view of its statutory objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister explain what she thinks will be the likely balance between a court examining the objectives and a court examining the principles. Does she think that a court would look on them as equivalent, or that the court would consider them to be different and that there would be a hierarchy between them. If the latter, does she think that the objectives would be superior to the principles or vice versa?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall not be drawn into anticipating the view that a court might take on a series of facts of which I have no knowledge. It is an entirely hypothetical matter. However, I shall try to answer the hon. Gentleman's question by referring to the example that I gave earlier of a would-be entrant into the banking industry. That body might find itself unable to secure a licence or it might be offered a licence by the authority on terms that it regarded as being wholly unacceptable. I understand that it would be able to seek judicial review on the grounds that, in discharging its general functions, the authority did not have proper regard to the principle that competition should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily. The FSA would have to make a case that the distortion or impediment to competition that had adversely impacted on the institution bringing the case for judicial review was necessary.
<P>
Of Course, in judging that necessity, the courts, like the FSA, would have to have regard to the objectives. However, a balance would have to be struck between, on the one hand, the principles and objectives and, on the other, the decision to be made about whether the impediment to competition was necessary.
<P>
I shall come back on the following matter if I am wrong. However, clause 3(3) states that the authority "must have regard to" those principles. By making that requirement, we are ensuring a proper basis for judicial review, if it is felt that the FSA has got the matter wrong.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie rose</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I should like to make progress. I am not sure that I can assist the hon. Gentleman any further; perhaps the following comments will help, if I may be allowed to make them.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) asked about the role of the Office of Fair Trading. Clause 272 and the following clauses deal with competition. When we come to debate those clauses, we will examine in detail the scrutiny of competition which we are implementing to ensure that the regulatory regime does not impede competition unnecessarily That is another source of accountability for the FSA, providing a further check and balance on the exercise of its powers which is quite separate from the judicial review recourse that we discussed. For instance, should the OFT decide that the capital adequacy requirements imposed on banks impede or distort competition, it can investigate the matter, take evidence and report on whether it thinks that the FSA rules and requirements distort competition unnecessarily. Should the OFT decide that those rules and requirements are not justified and are distorting competition, the Bill provides that the Treasury will be the arbiter.
<P>
I do not want to pre-empt later discussions on the Bill. I simply wish to indicate that we will deal with all those extremely important aspects of competition scrutiny much later in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It is very hot, it is Thursday and we are all keen to leave. However, the people regulated by the Bill want clarity about the Government's view of the relationship between the objectives and the principles.
<P>
Does the Government regard the objectives as superior, having an override over the regulatory principles? Flowing from that is the inevitable conclusion that, in the event of judicial review, a court is likely to consider an objective superior to a principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her comments.
<P>
We have taken legal advice in arriving at our stance. We have been advised that the objectives would rank higher than the principles in a judicial review. That was the basis of what we have said today. However, it is clearly a matter of legal opinion.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> As a burden of labouring this important point, I suggest reading clauses 1 and 2 with clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6. Should the Minister do so, would she not agree that the regulatory objectives that are 77 78 mentioned in clause 2(2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) and spelt out in clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6 are given a much higher prominence than what my right hon. and hon. Friends have called the principles that appear in clause 2 (3) (a) to (f)? They are not all described as principles; they are described as desirable.
<P>
The Economic Secretary agreed about the importance of the City and our financial services industry, but that importance should not be downgraded because of a drafting error and she should take that point on board.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I will try one last time to convince Opposition Members. The courts, like the FSA, should look at the objectives and principles together when, for example, deciding how to meet consumer protection objectives. The authority must have regard to the principles and the courts will have to recognise that. I am sure that they will do that and judge the authority's actions accordingly in any subsequent action for judicial review.
<P>
Objectives and principles are all part and parcel of the FSA's statutory duties. It is required to fulfil its statutory duties which include the principles as well as the objectives. The fact that each of the objectives has a clause of its own should not lead us to the conclusion that the principles do not matter. The fact that the principles are stated with great economy does not detract from their importance.
<P>
I have said and I hope that the Committee will accept my assurance that I shall look again at these important matters. I shall consider whether the drafting needs to be strengthened to give effect to what we all want to achieve. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> With the greatest politeness towards the Economic Secretary, I want to make it clear that we think that this is such a crucial issue that we want to register that fact in a vote.

<H4><center>5.45 pm</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> This raft of amendments deals with the arrangements for the investigator. I am glad to say that some of the Joint Committee's recommendations on that matter were taken on board in redrafting the Bill. However, as with much of the Joint Committee's report, we scored approximately a 50 per cent. hit rate with what the Government decided to adopt and what to ignore.
<P>
I shall quickly run through the gist of the amendments, then dwell a little longer on the principle of compensation. Under amendment No. 5, the word "prompt" would simply be added to the Bill. Any investigation of complaints arising from the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any of the FSA's functions should be taken up promptly. Surely the addition of the word "prompt" is beyond controversy. If the Government do not accept the amendment, in effect they will suggest that the FSA should be tardy. That is the natural and logical conclusion to be drawn from anyone not leaping to accept the amendment. I am optimistic that this might be the first of the our amendments that Government might decide to accept in their common-sense approach to the Bill.
<P>
On a slightly more serious note, the point of adding the word "prompt" is that we would like the Bill to contain more detail on how the FSA should handle the timetabling of such complaints. Many Government agencies, private companies, quangos or even Departments have a code for the time taken to process certain inquiries and complaints another version of the citizens charter. It is perfectly reasonable to require the investigator to respond to complaints promptly within a timetable, and he or she should account for failing to do so within a certain time.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 deals with the autonomy or independence of investigators. We were pleased that the Government sensibly made it a requirement of the Bill 79 80 [Mr. Loughton]
<P>
that an investigator should be appointed. We suggest that the word "Authority" should be replaced with the word "investigator". Surely if the investigator is to be independent, as he or she must be to be effective or if he or she is to be seen to act independently and, therefore, to be effective the onus must be on the independent investigator, not on the authority against which the complaint is made, to decide whether the complaint is appropriate and whether he or she should deal with it on behalf of the complainant.
<P>
That is all the more important if the true independence of the investigator is still questioned. I am led to believe that the investigator will use FSA staff and resources to investigate complaints, so he or she is not entirely at arm's length from the FSA. Making the investigator the initial arbiter of which complaints should be taken up, rather than allowing the authority to deem which should be referred to him or her, is crucial to the effective working of the investigator.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would replace the word "reference" with the word "submission", so that paragraph 8(1)(2)(a) of schedule 1 would state "submission to the investigator" of any complaint.
<P>
Consequent on those amendments, amendment No. 8 would delete the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which the Authority is investigating",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the reason that the investigator should determine which complaints should be taken up. Those amendments go to the heart of the matter, because, if the investigator is to be meaningful and independent, it should have greater powers and be outside the remit of the FSA.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 latch on to that. If the authority decides not to investigate, it should notify the investigator. It would be a nonsense if the investigator decided what was to be investigated. The amendments would replace that with a requirement for the investigator to notify the complainant if complaints were not taken up. They are logical amendments designed to ensure the independence of the investigator.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 would delete subsection (4); if the other amendments are accepted, it becomes redundant. I am highly optimistic that the Government will agree to them.
<P>
That leaves amendment No. 9, which would add a new section (iv) to paragraph 8(2)(b) providing for the complaints scheme to award compensation. The amendment goes to the heart of the matter. It is a counterbalance to the statutory immunity of the FSA, about which we shall have even longer deliberations probably not tonight, but later in our deliberations and I hope before Christmas. The Government have set up and published the complaints procedure to which the FSA must respond. However, I am slightly concerned that the FSA is still consulting over the complaints procedure. That is another problem that the Committee faces: so much of what we are talking about is still up in the air, and there is little in the rule books to help us construct a framework. If the consultation exercise resulted in something contrary to what the Committee had decided, would we have to revisit the Bill or would further amendments have to be made on Report?
<P>
I referred earlier to the recommendations of the Joint Committee. First, it said that the investigator should be appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The Treasury's response was that that was not necessary and that, because the expert on financial services was the Treasury, the Treasury should make the appointment. However, I believe that someone with legal qualifications, a legal professional, should be at the head of the investigative body, and making the appointment seems obviously to be within the remit of the Lord Chancellor. Will the Minister say why the Government think that inappropriate?
<P>
The second recommendation of the Joint Committee, which the Treasury has taken up, is that the investigator should be an on-going body with adequate resources. It is essential, if it is to be meaningful, that it should not be an ad hoc investigator, which is rung up every fourth week to do a bit of extra work. It must be a properly constituted and recognised investigative office.
<P>
The Joint Committee's third recommendation was that the Government should give serious consideration to the investigator having the power to award compensation. That is the reason for amendment No. 9. It is ironic: we want an independent investigator, but if the Government do not agree, we shall be back at first base. I thought that the whole point of the FSA, and the ethos behind it, was the Government's contention that self-regulation in the City and the financial services industry had not worked. However, allowing the complaints procedure against the FSA to be policed by the FSA is patent self-regulation. The Government have said that we must have an end to self-regulation, and that there should be proper statutory regulation of the FSA, which we have accepted in principle. However, they now say that a key aspect about which people may complain will be regulated by the FSA itself, which seems rather anomalous. What is being proposed in the Bill is self-regulation by another name. It must be up to the independent investigator to decide when the FSA has transgressed its procedures. The FSA will not be prevented from conducting its own investigation if it wants to do so, in parallel with the independent investigator.
<P>
The real meat of the matter relates to compensation. I understand why the investigator has been provided but not what sanctions it will have. If it cannot award compensation, what remit will it have? Will it merely give a verbal rebuke to the FSA a metaphorical smack on the wrist? I should like the Minister to give her interpretation of what sanctions the investigator will be able to bring to bear in the absence of a compensation requirement.
<P>
The investigator of complaints is not required to award costs against the FSA in the event of a complaint being upheld. That means that a firm that has incurred costs as a result of an FSA maladministration case will not be able to recover those costs, except by suing in a civil court. 81 82 However, under existing terms of statutory immunity, the complainant would not be able to proceed, in cases involving acts committeed in good faith, a matter that we shall discuss under part IV of schedule 1.
<P>
Such a maladministration case may be the result of the FSA having given wrong advice, as a result of which a firm incurs a lot of unnecessary expenditure or loses business or members of staff. That is not uncommon. Many of the problems experienced with the FSA and other self-regulatory organisations over the past few years have been the result of bad interpretation of the rules and bad advice. One could conjecture that that is more likely to happen now and in the near future, because a whole new rule book is being written, and in many cases the FSA is employing a whole new set of staff to administer those rules. The possibility of bad or erroneous advice that could result in losses being incurred through fines is rather higher now and will be so in the near future.
<P>
It seems very unfair that firms that suffer will have no recourse to any compensation. The equation set out in this part of the schedule remains wrongly balanced. We need an independent investigator who can award compensation. If the Minister is not prepared to introduce such a balancing measure, it will be hard for her to justify the FSA's retention of statutory immunity powers, which we shall discuss, shortly. She should allow bad FSA decisions to be challenged in court.
<P>
If the amendments were accepted and a compensation scheme introduced, we would ask that the compensation be liable against the Treasury, not the FSA. The result of the FSA having to pay compensation would be that fines rebated to firms as a reduction in fees would be comparatively less as a result of the FSA's own negligence. It would obviously be grossly unfair if firms were to lose out because the FSA had proceeded incompetently or by maladministration, for example.
<P>
I have some grounds for optimism. In paragraph 4.12 of the Treasury response to the joint Committee's report, the Minister did not rule out a compensation scheme but said that she was prepared to consider the matter. However, she claimed that the Bill provides sufficient recompense for the aggrieved consumer, because he will have access to the ombudsman and that, in cases of default, there was the compensation scheme, although I fail to see how that is appropriate. It is an altogether different scenario. The consumer has the power to refer enforcement decisions to a tribunal that can award costs. Because of these additional routes, the Treasury would claim that it is not necessary to have recompense through a compensation scheme by the investigator.
<P>
There will be cases when the FSA has behaved unreasonably and there is damage to a firm or an approved person, or when a decision cannot be taken to the tribunal when, for example, an investigation is conducted unreasonably. The argument for allowing the investigator to make compensation awards greatly outweighs the arguments against it. As the Bill stands, the position is very unbalanced. The FSA has all the powers in its hands. It is trying to have it both ways and, ultimately, it can hide behind its immunity, claiming that it has acted in good faith.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
These are serious amendments, which are slightly clearer than the enormous batch that we have just debated. The FSA cannot have it both ways. Either there must be modifications to the statutory immunity, or we have a truly independent investigator, with teeth. That should take the form of a power to award compensation, which will have to be paid by the Treasury, not the FSA, and which ultimately will be at the expense of regulated members.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to Opposition Members for tabling the amendments, which lead us into an interesting debate about the proper role of the complaints procedure.
<P>
I should begin by spelling out the circumstances in which the scheme will be relevant. We would expect many of the so-called complaints about the actions of the FSA to be related to regulatory actions decisions on matters relating to authorisation, enforcement and discipline, for example. People affected by such decisions will have the right, if they do not agree with the decision, to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal. It is not a self-regulatory or an unaccountable body. The FSA's regulatory decisions are entirely subject to the decisions of that independent tribunal.
<P>
The sort of complaints that might be open to review by the complaints investigator are more likely to be general in nature, or connected with matters such as process rather than outcome. The kind of thing that might arise could involve an independent financial adviser, for instance, alleging that the FSA had been inconsistent or disproportionate in the requirements imposed in relation to personal pensions mis-selling. Another example could be about FSA staff accidentally, or carelessly leaving a firm off the register of authorised firms. That sort of example would not go to the tribunal, but it might well be the subject of an entirely legitimate complaint.
<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware that our original proposal in the consultation draft of the Bill that was published last year was that the authority would have primary responsibility for dealing with complaints. When we reflected on the responses to the consultation and on the recommendations of the Joint Committee, we decided to amend the relevant provisions to ensure that there was much greater independence of the investigator. One of the things that we did was to require the investigator's appointment to be subject to Treasury approval. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested that the approval should come from the Lord Chancellor's Department rather than from the Treasury.
<P>
In response, I stress that the complaints investigator does not provide a judicial function, nor should it be a judicial appointment. The Financial Services Authority is accountable to Treasury Ministers. There is certainly nothing to stop the independent investigator being a lawyer but it is most important to have an investigator who knows about financial services, and can investigate complaints such as the examples I gave, and who has 83 84 [Ms Hewitt]
<P>
stature, is independent of mind, and has credibility among the regulated conmunity. After reflection, my conclusion was that it would be more appropriate for the Treasury rather than the Lord Chancellor's Department to approve the appointment. I am, of course, prepared to reflect further on this but those are the reasons for our conclusions.
<P>
We have added other improvements. The FSA will be required by the Bill to maintain on a continuing basis an independent investigator who must also have the means to conduct an investigation of complaints referred to him by the FSA. In addition, the FSA will be required to inform the investigator of the conclusions of internal investigations, and decisions not to pursue complaints. He will have the discretion as an independent investigator to pursue matters where he judges there to be a case for doing so.
<P>
We have reflected on amendments Nos. 5 to 8 and Nos. 10 to 12 and concluded that they offer a further element of independence. However, we still believe that in the first instance it is right for the FSA, as a transparent and accountable body, which we intend it to be, to respond to complaints against itself. Paragraph 8(3) of schedule 1 provides a further safeguard because it will require the FSA to report complaints referred to the investigator even if it has decided itself that there was no case to answer.
<P>
I am happy to consider amendment No. 5, in which he sought to insert the word "prompt" and made a quite compelling case. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] I thought that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham would be relieved to hear that finally he has had an amendment accepted. Accepting it would be consistent with the equivalent provisions that we are making for the ombudsman. I should like to consult parliamentary draftsmen about whether "prompt" is precisely the right word, but I undertake to come back with an appropriate amendment on that point on Report. I hope that in return the hon. Gentleman will not press amendment No. 5 to a vote.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 is rather different in character and was the amendment on which the hon. Gentleman concentrated most. It provides for a person whose complaint has been upheld by the investigator to receive a financial award the costs of which will be met by the taxpayer. Indeed, the Joint Committee recommended that we consider the possibility that the investigator might be given powers to award compensation. That is not a feature of existing legislation and we do not see a good case for changing that. The role of investigator is a transparent mechanism for investigation of alleged FSA shortcomings. It should not be a route to additional redress for aggrieved firms and consumers. There are other provisions in the Bill to deal with redress in appropriate circumstances. As I have said, in cases where the authority's regulatory decisions are unacceptable, the matter can be referred to the tribunal, which can award costs where the authorised person's case is upheld. The compensation scheme established in the Bill can make awards to consumers who lose money if a firm goes into default, and, similarly, the ombudsman can make awards to consumers when a complaint is upheld. But the investigator which is an administrative mechanism rather like the parliamentary ombudsman in respect of other public authorities can publish his report and, of course, require the FSA to publish its response. We think that that is an appropriate and proportionate response, but we have taken steps in the Bill as drafted to strengthen the complaints procedure considerably beyond what was in the original Bill. I therefore commend the scheme, with the addition of the word "prompt" or a suitable substitute, to the Committee.

<P>
On resuming
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): We are discussing helpful amendments relating to the complaints procedure. I would like to pursue them a little further.
<P>
There are two central issues of principle. First, the complaints commissioner must be, and must be seen to be, fully independent. That relates to the question of whether he should be appointed by the Lord Chancellor rather than the Treasury, because that would add credibility to the appointment. Secondly, the complaints procedure should be backed by an independent resource and should not be a one-man-and-a-dog operation.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's initial reply mentioned several hypothetical cases in which the complaints commissioner would come into play. However, the FSA is already up and running and it has already acquired its own case history of complaints that illustrates how the process works. I have been given one example in a well organised brief produced by Justice in Financial Services. That Organisation may or may not have a grievance certain passages in the document are slightly green inkish but it provides a well-documented case of someone who was brought before the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation in relation to the Morgan Grenfell asset management case.
<P>
The issue is not how IMRO dealt with the case or the justice of it. What is relevant is the process that the FSA followed, and the Economic Secretary acknowledged that that is where the complaints procedure is centred.  I do not know whether the allegation is true, but the complaint in this case was that an FSA official leaked a sensitive report in such a way as to damage the reputation of someone in the City. That is an appropriate matter for complaint. The problem was that there was no satisfactory mechanism for considering the complaint properly. The document describes the experience of going to the complaints commission. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As the Complaints Commissioner, Mr Worsley, does not have his own secretariat, he is supported by Mr Christopher Boyce, who appears in the FSA Organisation Chart as a senior employee of the FSA responsible for public affairs."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We can understand what happened in that case. The FSA has a mechanism for firing off letters to tiresome people who complain about it. That is not a complaints procedure in a deep and challenging sense.
85 86 <P>
I quote that example, because it is the only one that I have been given. It may or may not be based on substance, but, over the years, we shall build up a large portfolio of similar cases. We all have constituents who have been through the process and come out of it with a bitter sense of grievance and a feeling that there was a lack of impartiality. It does not matter whether the case that I described could be followed through to a tribunal. The accusation relates to how the FSA behaved.
<P>
There are two ways of remedying the problem. First, the schedule should contain a provision that obliges the FSA to investigate complaints. Secondly, there should be an independent complaints mechanism if a complainant is dissatisfied with the way in which the FSA has investigated a case. The amendments may need to be buttressed by others that explain how a strengthened, more independent complaints procedure should work. I would happily table amendments to that effect.
<P>
The central point that has been made is absolutely right. If the FSA is to have credibility, it should have a genuinely independent complaints commissioner, appointed independently and with the proper resources to investigate complaints.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to say a few words about an investigator's power to make an award. I anticipate that the Economic Secretary will say that the current structure contains no equivalent power and that we should continue as we have before. However, that is not a sufficient answer when we are considering a Bill of such magnitude.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham on tabling these amendments to tease out an important issue. We seek proper consideration of the principle of whether the investigator should have power to make or recommend an award in circumstances in which the FSA, with the backing of the Treasury, should pay compensation to the member of the relevant market at whose request the investigation was carried out and who suffered as a result of the authority's negligence, inactivity or wrongdoing. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested something similar.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Financial Services Act 1986, which we passed, did not provide compensation in any circumstances. In principle, there was no reason for that, although I do not pretend to have mastered all the details of that measure. However, we are now examining the matter in relation to an authority which is able to consider the powers of eight or nine authorities and a number of ombudsmen I forget how many and several broader compensation schemes.
<P>
There ought to be a system of compensation, unless there are strong reasons for someone who is regulated and who suffers significant financial damage at the hands of the regulator not to receive compensation. However, one must bear proportionality in mind. There are some big players in the market. On Second Reading, I said that in general terms, it was right for the authority to have immunity. I was not surprised to see the Treasury Minister nodding in agreement when I said that.
<P>
Some of the players are so big that the authority might be pinned down and sued for sums so large that it would no longer be able to regulate effectively if it did not have general immunity and was liable for anything for which a legal case could be made. However, there is a big jump from that important principle to saying that, under no circumstances, should the authority pay compensation to someone in the market such as an independent financial adviser.
<P>
We all have such advisers in our constituencies, and they play an important part in modern life. A primary purpose of the reconstruction of financial services regulation is to improve competition and transparency, supply better products and give better explanations. Documentation that I received over the past few days includes a document that the FSA seeks to use to give schoolchildren a better understanding of the kind of financial provision that they ought to be making for themselves in future.
<P>
The Government's ideas for stakeholder pensions  which are to be privately provided involve millions of people entering into dealings with financial institutions, many of which will be quite small. In my constituency, there are a number of well respected independent financial advisers operating in Bedford and surrounding small towns who could be seriously damaged by a regulator.
<P>
From top to bottom, the prospective authority has no intention of damaging independent financial advisers, but it could easily do so and ruin someone who is not immensely rich. We are not talking about a rogue trader who brings about the collapse of Barings bank, or the huge players the in the insurance market. There are much smaller players in the insurace and the pensions markets.
<P>
I start at the bottom because it makes a more attractive case and is more supportable in public terms. While bigger organisations will seek to build up from the bottom and perhaps start frightening the authority with the amount of compensation that might be ordered against it, that should not put us off our exploration of what is fair and right in these circumstances. I ask the Minister to reflect carefully and guide us so that we may test the provisions.
<P>
Let us consider a small but competent independent financial adviser who, by reason of the activities of this great authority, suffers serious financial damage. To see it in human terms, let us say that he and his wife are effectively ruined, lose their house, have to seek state benefits, lose their savings and their hopes for their children all due to a serious error by this enormous body. Is it right that the investigator cannot award compensation, perhaps subject to a limit, or make a recommendation to the authority which it must follow, unless a series of principles about compensation are built into the the Bill?
<P>
I put it in that two-handed way because there are two ways of approaching the problem. At this stage of the Bill, it is not for us to devise the perfect answer, but to raise the proper questions. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has raised important questions and I join him in looking for serious answers.
87 88 <P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The effect of amendment No. 9, the key to the series of amendments, would be to abrogate statutory immunity for the FSA. That issue appears later in the Bill but was also substantially debated in the Joint Committee. There was virtual unanimity that that would not be sensible because if there were constant looking over the shoulders of individuals or the authority as a whole there would be a slow-down, decisions would be distorted, free judgments could not be made as they should be and there would be a tendency to over-caution. The amendment is, as I say, a back-door way of abrogation.
<P>
Another theme in the amendments is that the independence of investigators is somehow suspect. I find that difficult to understand in the light of paragraph 8 to schedule 1. The authority investigates complaints to start with, but it is possible to have a complaint investigated in other ways another dimension to investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I see the hon. Gentleman's point, but he is mixing up two separate issues when he talks about the abrogation of statutory immunity. The investigator may respond to a complaint that can be settled without recourse to all the legal processes. The Economic Secretary said that the role of investigator was not essentially a judicial function. The compensation facility is an attempt to avoid the legal process in which statutory immunity is more relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that members of staff will receive a black mark against their names if there are complaints about them or if they precipitate complaints against the authority? Knowing that that might happen would have the effect that he is trying to avoid through statutory immunity.
<P>
The amendments also make the case that the investigator will not be truly independent. Paragraph 8 provides that the complaint should go to the authority which decides whether it should be considered by the investigator or elsewhere, perhaps by the tribunal. If the authority decides that the complaint is vexatious, frivolous or trivial, under paragraph 8(4), the investigator, who has been notified of the complaint, can disagree and investigate it if he so wishes. He can act independently. If the investigator is appointed by the Treasury, as envisaged in the Government's proposals in the Joint Committee, and is able to investigate almost whatever he likes, I do not understand how it could be said that he is not independent. However, apart from amendment No. 9 which deals with compensation, the other amendments are designed to detach the investigator from the authority, which would make him the regulator of the regulators. The amendments are redundant because they advocate statutory immunity and make elaborate and complex arrangements something that already exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The crucial issue is compensation. The arrangement is necessary to provide full immunity. The Securities and Exchange Commission has statutory immunity in principle, but there are understood and well trod paths which mean that where it has found wrongly against an institution, it has not enjoyed immunity and has been forced to pay compensation. The arrangements are designed to achieve the same fairness within the United Kingdom system. Having lived with regulation for 10 years, I have seen the regulatory world give wrong advice and produce incorrect findings, which have got close to defamation. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire pointed out, it is unacceptable for small operators who do not have the capital resources to have no protection or right to compensation in those circumstances.
<P>
The issue of who should appoint an investigator is a fine one, but it is healthier if it is ultimately the Lord Chancellor. However, I accept that an argument can be made for both sides. The issue of how the investigator gets involved is tricky. Present arrangements provide for that and, from the regulator's point of view, they are perfectly reasonble. The problem is that a member of the financial services industry who is not satisfied can only badger, as we well know, his Member of Parliament. It is unacceptable for the person who is appointed as an investigator not to be obliged to examine the complaint. However, he could write back and say, "I have examined the matter, and it is a load of rubbish." The complainant cannot insist on having his complaint investigated under the Bill's provisions.
<P>
The present regime will not resemble the regime that will be created because the regulations that presently apply are an illusion they merely involve self-regulation. All the members pay to belong to the club, and it would be peculiar to, as it were, sue the collective organisation of which one is a member.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the thrust of amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 10 is to ensure that the authority does not filter out complaints or prevent them from going to the investigator in the first instance? However, it is illogical and irrational to propose removing sub-paragraph 8(4), as amendment No. 12 does. That provision makes the process robust it will give the investigator power over the authority to take a complaint, regardless of whether the authority recommends it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that the hon. Lady and I can achieve what we want by different routes. I need to read her comments in Hansard and to think them through. However, she is right that the proposals, with the exception of the compensation clause, are designed to stop filtering out and to protect the investigator's ability and right to consider a complainant's case. It is not clear whether amendment No. 8 would stop that happening it might achieve the desired result by a different route.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> I feel that the amendment clearly has that effect. Sub-paragraph 8(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the investigator considers a complaint of which he has been notified under sub-paragraph (3) ought to be investigated, he may proceed as if the complaint has been referred to him under sub-paragraph (2)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That judgment is independent of what the authority may decide in the first instance.
89 90 <P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I can only say that my understanding is that if all the amendments were agreed to, the hon. Lady and I might be able to achieve what we both want by different routes. Her argument is that, as matters stand, one necessary objective has already been realised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) may be at cross purposes. Sub-paragraph 8(4) will become redundant if the investigator is the first arbiter of a complaint. The other amendments would have that effect. We want to delete the relevant passage because it would be redundant.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> May I press home the point that sub-paragraph 8(4) will ensure that the investigator will have the final say he will take the judgment? Amendment No. 12 would remove that certainty. However, leaving sub-paragraph 8(4) in the Bill would make the other amendments redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My final response is that the amendments would ensure that the investigator will have what I might call the starting duty to receive, consider and deal with complaints. If the authority has that duty, and if we have to decide whether the investigator would consider matters subsequently, the hon. Lady's remarks would be correct. If the starting duty is removed from the authority and given to the investigator, our amendments make sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee the advantage of doing that? Even if the authority is not the first recipient, the investigators are equally independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I would argue that it is much more straightforward to have a single function, and a single person handling complaints. The arrangement whereby the FSA which is probably sub-contracting the function to the investigator's office anyway has the first role and duty to receive and decide, and can then pass it to the investigator, is a convoluted one. If one imagines how such arrangements might work internally, it becomes clear that operating on two levels is something of a dog's dinner.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> Am I correct in understanding that the hon. Gentleman said that his amendments
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> Yes. Is he saying that the amendments would produce exactly the same result as the original drafting of the Bill, but by a different route? If that is so, why do the Opposition not immediately withdraw the amendment and stop wasting the Committee's time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I assume that that intervention was intended as light relief, but it wasted the Committee's time. Our proposal is clear: the complaints mechanism should be a separated mechanism, and an independent complaints officer should be appointed, preferably by the Lord Chancellor. Such an officer would receive and deal with complaints, thereby avoiding the convoluted arrangement proposed by the Government. On the argument or the convoluted arrangement, I am not convinced that the Bill would guarantee that a complaint would be fully heard. There is scope for complaints to get lost in that process.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I was grateful to hear the hon. Member for Peterborough intervene to the extent that she appeared to agree with us in principle on what we are trying to achieve. If she agrees in principle that there is a case for a degree of compensation, albeit modest, might not that be welcome?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. and learned Friend. I was about to return to the issue of compensation.
<P>
The point that I wanted to make to justify a change from the status quo was that the Bill introduces a change from self-regulation and the membership-of-a-club mentality which may have become an illusion, but at least, had logic to it to statutory regulation. We are now moving into a different kind of structure, in which, if legal immunity is to be given for the various reasons that have been broadly agreed, it will simply not be acceptable for a small business to be ruined by wrong decisions, wrong advice or defamation by such a powerful body. It will not be voluntary licences and regulation will be compulsory. Indeed, a business that lost its licence wrongly might have to stop trading.
<P>
The kind of compensation that the Opposition have in mind is not huge it would not cause the problem that has been referred to in relation to full immunity, which would put such pressure on regulatory staff that their ability to do their duty would be prejudiced. The amount would be of a fair and moderate sufficiency, in order to achieve natural justice. We strongly urge the Government to consider the compensation aspect of our proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to confine my remarks to amendment No. 9. I strongly agree with what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said. He put the moral case for ensuring that regulation is not so burdensome that people's lives can be wrecked by a misstatement or a malicious complaint, which can lead to a small member of the industry going out of business. The Minister justified the provisions in the Bill by saying that the existing legal position is the position set out in the Bill. In other words, the legislation introduced in 1986 created the circumstances that would also pertain under the Bill.
<P>
There is clearly an imbalance between the power of the investigator and the power of the person being investigated. Anyone who has found himself on the wrong side of a civil action in which one party has legal aid and the other does not will know how that imbalance leads to injustice. That is the moral case, and I agree with it, but I also want to make a practical point in favour of amendment No. 9.
<P>
The Government must include somewhere a counterweight to the FSA's almost untrammelled urge to investigate. It will always be under pressure or feel the need to investigate everything, whatever the case. If the FSA overlooks something that turns out to be a scandal, it will be judged to be remiss. If it investigates absolutely everything, it will cover its back, but at the same time, it might put reasonable tradesmen out of business by sometimes wrongly putting them under great 91 92 [Mr. Tyrie]
<P>
investigative pressure. There is a difficult balance to be struck, but to create that balance, some financial counterweight is required some disincentive for the FSA to investigate every complaint. The advantage of<P>
amendment No. 9 is that it would provide such a counterweight which is why I support it.
