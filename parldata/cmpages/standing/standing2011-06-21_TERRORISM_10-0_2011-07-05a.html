                  </strong> Good afternoon, Mr Caton, and good afternoon
to the rest of the Committee. This is the final sitting of the Bill,
and when we broke for lunch, it was timely in one sense, because I was
just about to respond to an intervention from the right hon. Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East on resources, which is part and parcel of
amendment 126. He was pressing me over the indications from the
Metropolitan Police Service about resources and the approach that was
being taken. If time had allowed me before the luncheon break
intervened, I was going say that the Metropolitan Police Service and I
are clear that, from the commencement of TPIMs, we will have in place
appropriate and effective measures to manage the transition from
control
orders.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
fully appreciate—I feel it as much as anyone else—the
duties and responsibilities that we hold and fulfil in moving from
control orders to TPIMs, and we have considered the issue clearly and
have been closely engaging with the security services and the police
regarding the preparations and the work at hand. I do not accept that
there will be gaps. I appreciate that there have been debates about
schedule 1 and all its provisions, and I recognise the points that have
been made consistently during the Committee, but I do not intend to go
over old ground or to repeat myself. I recognise that there are
differences, but we believe that it is possible to manage the
arrangement appropriately and effectively, and we are confident that
will be the case when we move from control orders to
TPIMs.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
had a separate debate about duration, another issue that creates strong
feelings, which were expressed on Second Reading, too. Let me set out
the Government’s thinking on why we did not include some form of
sunset clause or annual renewal clause—a point reflected in
contributions this morning. The review of counter-terrorism and
security powers concluded that, for the foreseeable future, there is
likely to be a need for measures to protect the public from the risk
posed by the small number of people who threaten our security, but who 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 307<a class="bkMark" name="Column307">&#160;</a>
                  </div>cannot be prosecuted or, in the case of foreign nationals, deported. The
package of measures we are putting in place is the result of
a lengthy and considered review and is being
subjected to full parliamentary scrutiny during the passage of the
legislation. That is part and parcel of today’s Committee. We
believe that it makes significant improvements to the control order
system and that it is a good framework that ought to be able to operate
on an ongoing, stable and enduring
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
key difference between this Bill and the Prevention of Terrorism Act
2005 is the parliamentary process involved. The 2005 Act was taken
through under heavily accelerated procedures, making annual renewal an
appropriate safeguard. That is the distinction between the gestation of
the 2005 Act and where we are now, and that will not be the situation
with this Bill. Moreover, my hon. and right hon. Friends have concluded
that there is an ongoing need for powers to disrupt suspected
terrorists who cannot be prosecuted or deported. Clearly, Opposition
Members reached the same conclusion while in government and continue to
hold that view, albeit they would rather keep a different system in
place than move to the system we have outlined. Regardless of that
difference between us, I think all three main parties are in agreement
on the fundamental principle. In such circumstances, the Government
believe that Parliament should legislate
permanently.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
heard some of the debate about timing issues, and the points made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge and by Opposition Members on that
balance. The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East recognised
that need for balance, and the question of whether a continual,
year-on-year re-examination of the facts and circumstances was
appropriate. It is interesting to note the comments of Lord
Carlile:<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
would not retain annual renewal. The reality is that it has been
renewed from year to year, and annual renewal has been a bit of
fiction, to be frank. I think that Parliament should have the courage
of its convictions and decide whether it wants a regime like this or
not. It can always be
repealed.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Terrorism

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that there are strong feelings on this issue. What I have
said will not necessarily find favour with all parts of the Committee.
We have heard the strength of feeling on all sides. We acknowledge and
accept that the TPIM regime, as we would wish to put it in place, is
perhaps regarded as exceptional. It is regarded as something that none
of us would wish to have, if I can put it that way. We wish to bring
people to justice. The mechanisms, whether control orders or the
proposed TPIM regime, are not what would be considered the optimal
solution. We want to bring people to justice using the criminal justice
system and we want to see people prosecuted, but we recognise that
there is an enduring risk. There is a necessity for those we are unable
to deport and for those we are unable to prosecute in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000020">&#160;</a>

and amendment 135 to the Channel Islands. The Committee will be aware
that the Bill extends to Scotland because, primarily, it deals with the
reserved matter of national security. However, powers of entry, search,
seizure and retention in schedule 5, and fingerprints and samples in
schedule 6, impinge on devolved matters. For example, biometric
material taken under provisions in schedule 6 can be used for devolved
purposes such as the prevention and detection of any crime, as well as
national security or terrorist investigations. When the Bill was
introduced, the Scottish Government had not had an opportunity to
decide whether the relevant provisions should extend to Scotland. They
have since agreed that they should, and a legislative consent motion
will therefore be tabled. The amendments reflect that
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000029">&#160;</a>

pleasure to rise to speak to the new clause, which was tabled following
Lord Carlile’s evidence and in light of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights report of 2010. Opposition Members do not have access to

for us to engage fully in debate when we are not aware of all the

parties that are not in government, and that even the Liberal Democrats

                  </strong> I am grateful for that intervention because I was
going to explain that the new clause is framed in such a way to enable
a debate and to create a start for dialogue with the Government about
how to put in place a mechanism to allow the official Opposition and
other Opposition parties access to the intelligence material that
Ministers see. I was not able to put this into the new clause, but the
role of the Intelligence and Security Committee might be relevant. I am
conscious that two of its members are sitting behind me. They have
access to highly sensitive data and material. When they contribute to
debates, they have that in mind, although they cannot in any way tell
anyone about it. We might be able to have a discussion about the
ISC’s role so that we can formalise a structure through which
information might be shared, although I recognise that that any process
could not affect its scrutiny
function.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000041">&#160;</a>

area is worthy of more detailed discussion with the Government, so I
will be grateful if the Minister indicates whether he will be prepared

same terms, although we recognise that those terms cannot be exactly
the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000042">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The new clause would require the Home
Secretary to provide a briefing to the Opposition on the intelligence
material forming the case against an individual each time a TPIM is
imposed. The precise intelligence material to be shared would be agreed
with the independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation and
would have to
provide<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000043">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
agree that well-informed debate and a co-operative approach are
important when considering matters such as terrorism legislation.
However, the hon. Lady will appreciate that there are limitations to
what is possible in this area, and that is why debates on matters of
national security are often difficult. Some people are understandably
reluctant to believe things without having seen the sensitive
underlying material themselves. That was part of what Lord Carlile said
in his report, and that, in many ways, is where the new clause stems
from.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issues are particularly sensitive when it comes to individual cases
because a range of sensitive intelligence that may refer to ongoing
investigations could be involved. It is because of those sensitivities
that, even in government, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 311<a class="bkMark" name="Column311">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the underlying intelligence case is shared only with those Ministers and
officials who have a need to know. It is not shared widely, so I am
concerned by the new clause because of its grounding on that
fundamental point. It would be unprecedented and inappropriate for
Opposition politicians routinely to receive briefings on sensitive
intelligence in individual cases.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I said,
such material is not shared widely beyond those who have a need to
know. That has not been the practice of successive Governments, whether
on control orders or other sensitive cases. That said, we are eager
that any debates on these issues are as well informed as possible, so
the Government will continue to provide briefings on Privy Council
terms to Opposition Members when appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Lady referred to the role of the ISC. It is worth highlighting that the
Green Paper looking at closed evidence and security is considering the
ambit of the scrutiny that is applied to the security services. In some
ways, I suppose that the role of the ISC comes within that context. If
that forms a basis for further consideration and discussion, building
on what Lord Carlile indicated in his last report, it might provide an
opportunity to return to the issues in that purview.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is right
that, in most instances, the Privy Council briefings should be in
general terms and on wider strategic issues, such as the terrorist
threat picture. If more detail is provided, it should be on issues of
critical and immediate importance to national security, such as when a
major terrorist attack has occurred. It is not right that details of
intelligence should be routinely provided for individual cases when
there would be no clear purpose to doing so. I therefore invite the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood to withdraw the new clause,

                  </div>effectively. I thank the Doorkeepers for keeping us safe and ensuring
that everything has been in good order in a broader sense. I also add
my thanks to the Clerks for the support that they have provided to you,
Mr Caton, and to other members of the Committee, and to the
<em>Hansard</em> reporters for recording our Committee
debates.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
broadly, I genuinely thank Opposition Front Benchers for the way in
which they have engaged in our consideration of the Bill. I also thank
Opposition Back Benchers for their contributions. There were occasions
when I wondered where the Front Bench stopped and the Back Bench
started, but Opposition Members have certainly added to our
deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
thank my hon. Friends on the Government Back Benches for their sterling
support. They have contributed their own points and thoughts, and our
proceedings have been better as a consequence. I shall certainly mark
out my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, whose learned contributions have given rise to robust debates
across the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
thank my Whip for his support. As hon. and right hon. Members will
know, there are often two silent members of the Committee: the Whip and
the Parliament Private Secretary, who ensures communication with
officials. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon for his
support and the service that he has
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Last,
I thank my officials and the parliamentary counsel. Again, they are
silent in Committee, but I pay tribute to their support outside the
Committee and during our deliberations. Those who have been Ministers
will appreciate their professionalism, dedication and hard
work.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have had
a good Committee. It is notable that we have had sufficient time to
consider the provisions carefully, in depth and in detail. We believe
that the Bill sets out the right way forward following on from the
counter-terrorism review. I look forward to continuing several of the
debates that we have started in Committee when the Bill returns to the
House on Report.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000058">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Further to that
point of order, Mr Caton. May I put on record our thanks to you and to
Mr Scott for your chairmanship of the Committee? Like the Minister, I
want to thank the Clerks, and the Doorkeepers and the police, who all
who keep us
safe.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
quality of debate in Committee has been excellent. I am grateful that
the Opposition had the experience of two former Home Office Ministers,
now members of the Intelligence and Security Committee, who have been a
big help. I am grateful to all Labour Members, including our Whip and
my Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Ladywood, who I believe has to leave us shortly to go elsewhere. They
have all done a sterling job.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
was right about the quality of the contributions made by Government
Members. The Government Whip usually tells their Back Benchers not to
say anything, but that has not been the case in this Committee. We have
heard some fantastic contributions, and I want to single out the hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham—I will visit
his constituency when I am next anywhere near it—because

                  </div>the expertise that he has brought to the Committee has been helpful. I
thank Government Members for giving us their
experience.<a class="bkMark" name="110705103000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have had a good Committee. I am sure that we will return to those
