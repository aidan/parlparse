[Continuation from column 712] 
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien: I was dealing with specific points on the amendment raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but I shall now deal with some of the broader issues. </B><P>
<P>
It is not the Government's objective to fine anyone unnecessarily. I would prefer not to fine any lorry driver or carrier. Our objective is to prevent them from carrying clandestines and lorry drivers will not pay fines if they check their loads and do not carry illegal immigrants. They must accept responsibility for their cargoes. 
<P>
Last year, about 8,000 illegal immigrants were brought into Britain in the back of lorries because lorry drivers failed to check their loads or because some of them accepted bribes. The going rate is about £2,000 for each illegal immigrant, so half a dozen of them stuffed in the back of a lorry would represent a lot of money. Some lorry drivers have certainly accepted bribes from traffickers and racketeers and carried illegal immigrants in the back of their lorries. We cannot turn a blind eye to that. 
<P>
Other lorry drivers clearly fail to check their loads, and that constitutes negligence. Therefore, we must take a robust approach towards those who do not bother to check their loads or who accept bribes in order to get rich from trafficking in the often vulnerable people who seek to enter the United Kingdom. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What proportion of clandestine entrants are discovered by checks at ports by people other than lorry drivers and what proportion are discovered as a result of lorry drivers reporting their presence after they have entered the UK? I agree that it would be a serious matter for a lorry driver to accept a bribe knowingly to facilitate the entry of illegal entrants into the UK. Will the Minister confirm that that would already be an offence under the Immigration Act 1971? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is difficult to prove that lorry drivers have accepted bribes. When they are discovered carrying illegal immigrants, as they all too ofter are, they did not know that they were in the back. The fact that the lorry driver may have £4,000 stuffed in his back pocket is explained away as the winnings from a bet. 
<P>
It is extremely difficult to prove that a lorry driver is guilty if not of a crime, of negligence, when someone is secreted in the back of a vehicle. We want to ensure that the minds of lorry drivers are concentrated so that they realise that they will be the subject of a civil penalty of £2,000 for each illegal immigrant or clandestine that they carry. 
<P>
Most illegal immigrants report themselves to the authorities soon after arriving in this country. It is fallacious to argue that lorry drivers are the main source of information on the illegals who enter. They drop off the illegals, who quickly make their way to a police station, to Croydon, or to authorities elsewhere. That is how the system works. 
<P>
Alternatively, illegal immigrants disappear into the system and work in factories, such as the institution to which I referred to earlier or on the land as a gangmaster. That sort of thing happens all too often. We have to end the excuses for carrying clandestines in the back of lorries. Each illegal immigrant can cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds and they are fed up with that; 8,000 entered in the back of lorries last year. Some drivers are accepting £2,000 for illegal immigrants and it has become big business. The excuses that Conservative Members make for that situation are not good enough. Their response is simply to do nothing. 
<P>
One of the arguments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere in defence of his amendment was that some clandestines may be genuine refugees. About 17 per cent. of applicants, many of whom apply at port, are recognised as genuine refugees. By and large, clandestines are not recognised as genuine refugees. The British sometimes arrogantly believe that people come here because our human rights are better than those in other countries through which they pass, but under the 1951 convention, persons seeking refuge are obliged to do so in the first safe country to which they come. Britain is not generally the first country to which clandestines come. They may wish to come to Britain because they have relatives here, for example, and such reasons may form part of a later appeal for asylum, but the vast majority of people seeking asylum here will have their claim rejected. Many seek economic opportunity alone; they are undermining and abusing the asylum system. I emphasise that few clandestines are recognised as refugees and they should in any case have applied for asylum in the first safe country. 
<P>
The argument that our proposals are a breach of human rights does not hold water. A human rights policy does not mean an open door for clandestines and illegal immigrants to enter the country in the back of lorries. We cannot have an open-door policy that allows people to come in via lorry drivers or to damage the cargo of reputable business people who want their goods freighted without damage. People travelling in the back of lorries often defecate in them or damage the goods in a way that destroys their value. That is happening much too often and we cannot allow it to continue on the basis that a few clandestines might turn out to be genuine refugees. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister may be straying into the area of later amendments. Will he please focus on the amendments before us? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe. I was trying to deal with the point raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I accept your guidance. We must have a means of cracking down on traffickers and on people who are creating the trade and our policy is necessary. It is tough, fair, tackles a developing scam and deters drivers from bringing in people in the back of lorries. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Let us suppose that, with the best will in the world, a lorry driver had overlooked the fact that he had some unwanted stowaways, but discovers them in the course of the journey. What will happen to him if he then reports them? Is he still penalised because he overlooked them in the first instance? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sure where the hon. Gentleman is assuming the lorry driver discovers the stowaways. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> At some advanced point on the journey. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In the UK? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If a lorry driver discovers that illegals are in the back of the lorry after he is in the UK, he should report it to the authorities. If he fails to do so and he becomes aware that he has facilitated the entry of a clandestine, he may expose himself to suspicion of committing a criminal offence. On that basis, he is best advised to report the discovery immediately to the authorities. He may then be subject to a civil penalty, but, as we shall discover on later clauses, there are defences to that. If he can show that in the country that he left to enter the UK a system of checking the backs of lorries was in place, that he had fully complied with that system and had no knowledge of the illegals, and that all the other provisions of the clause are in place, he may have a defence to the civil penalty. 
<P>
If a lorry driver discovered illegals in the back of his lorry in France, as he came up to Calais, and was worried about what would happen, and he perhaps thought that some of them were genuine, he could phone the immigration service in the United Kingdom--we have set up a help line--which will either advise him where to go to have the clandestines safely and properly removed from the back of his lorry or, if there were good reasons for doing so, give him consent, bearing in mind the safe country argument, to bring them to the UK. That would be done openly and knowingly and would provide protection for the lorry driver in France and, in due course, in the UK. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole) rose-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's question will relate to the amendment that we should now be discussing. There will be an opportunity to consider these matters further on later amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe, for being precise, as we would expect. The amendments relate to whether we should vary the law of certain countries. 
<P>
To pick up on my hon. Friend's intervention, a road haulage company must have a procedure for checking--which is a defence--whether a lorry driver has done everything that he can to avoid taking on illegals. However, in most cases lorry drivers are solitary individuals, so there are no additional witnesses. If we are not careful, we shall end up with the lorry driver saying "I checked"-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying into territory that we can cover later. I am sorry, but he is not talking about the amendment before us. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hope that I shall be able to deal with the hon. Gentleman's point later. 
<P>
In reply to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, of the 4,000 clandestines detected in the Kent area, roughly half were detected in the Dover port area and, of those 2,000, only 15 per cent. came to light as a result of information from lorry drivers. We are talking about 276 cases during 1998. In practice, some lorry drivers report clandestines and some do not, but we need to ensure that they do not carry them across in the first place. That is why we are taking this course of action and why we must oppose the hon. Gentleman's amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. We must try to find common ground. I found myself agreeing with a great deal of what he said. Unfortunately, it is completely at variance with much of what the Labour party has said in the past. However, I am sure that the Minister will accept my remarks as a great compliment--a Prussian compliment, I suppose. 
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Under-Secretary gave us statistics on the numbers reported; he has access to them, I do not. But, even on his statistics, a large number of clandestine entrants are reported by lorry drivers. According to the joint submission by the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Statistics show that over 90 per cent. of illegal immigrants detected in vehicles are detained as a result of voluntary actions by the driver/operator. Only 3 per cent. are detected by foreign authorities and a further 3 per cent. by UK authorities."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That information was supplied me and to all members of the Committee, I think. The associations may be wrong but, even on the Minister's figures, a large number of clandestine entrants are reported by public-spirited lorry drivers who want the law applied properly. 
<P>
As for what the Under-Secretary said about lorry drivers leaving such people to make their own way, I remind him of my correspondence with him last summer. A British lorry driver was horrified that, when he arrived in Hounslow or somewhere in west London and contacted the authorities and the police to bring his discovery of clandestine entrants to light, the police were told by the immigration service to give the entrants directions to the Lunar house. Will the Minister confirm whether that is now common practice on the part of the immigration service, that immigration service officers do not attend every incident and that clandestine entrants are simply given directions to Lunar house--where, in fact, a number of them go because they come here to claim asylum? That lorry driver contacted the media because he was horrified by the dereliction of duty and shambles of the immigration service in not responding to such instances. 
<P>
By Making such a generalised attack, the Under-Secretary is getting off on the wrong foot with the lorry drivers. He did not take sufficient care to distinguish between responsible lorry drivers and irresponsible lorry drivers. I do not deny that sometimes lorry drivers fall short of their responsibilities; they are only human, like the rest of us. But a large number of them are extremely public spirited and responsible. During our Special Standing Committee sittings, we heard about their actions and the help that they give to the police and the authorities. 
<P>
I shall now return to the amendment and say why the Under-Secretary is wrong in everything that he said about his party's past attitude towards the matter and explain the point of difference that the amendment identifies. I was surprised by his explanation of the Labour party's opposition to carriers' liability in the past. I pointed out the well-documented occasions when Labour Front Benchers opposed carriers' liability because they said that it meant no distinction between bogus refugees and genuine refugees. 
<P>
I reminded the Under-Secretary of certain quotes, including one from the shadow Home Secretary in 1992 and one from the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton in 1987. The hon. Gentleman's answer was that that does not matter because refunds are now being given in respect of those who are identified as refugees. That was not the reason why the then Opposition spokesmen were getting into such a lather; they were not worried about the refunds going to the carriers, the airlines, the ferry companies or the shareholders of British Airways. I dare say that, in 1987, the shareholders of British Airways were probably the least of the concerns of the rignt hon. Member for Gorton; he probably thought that British Airways should still be nationalised. 
<P>
The Opposition were thinking that no distinction was made between bogus and genuine refugees getting on the aeroplanes and the ferries in the first place; that the requirement for documentation applied to both of them and that, without it, it would be difficult for them to get on the airlines and ferries. That point still applies today to the existing carriers' liability, as it does to the extremely draconian carriers' liability that the Government are introducing under the Bill. 
<P>
The Opposition disagree with the Government, not on the desirability of keeping out clandestine entrants, on which we agree with the Government 100 per cent., and which we were prepared to do even when they criticised us most ferociously for doing so, but on how the Government are introducing the measure, with a draconian regime for lorry drivers. There is a world of difference between airlines and ferry companies checking whether passengers hold the correct documents and lorry drivers doing so. 
<P>
The amendment would enable the Government to disapply the provisions. They are introducing the measure across the board and will have no chance to disapply the provisions in future. It does not matter what happens in future; the measure will be in place. It is not like visas, which the Government of the day can decide whether to require. The provisions will apply in all circumstances. 
<P>
I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment. I am not pressing him about when and where the Government should use it, but merely to have it available as a power. The Government seem to have taken a completely inflexible attitude towards the matter, and say that the provision in the amendment will never be needed. They are taking an extremely short-sighted view of history. History shows that it is never possible to foresee what events or eruptions will happen, and that even at times of great stability, as we all now know too well, sudden upheavals can happen. We do not know what they will be, but the Bill should be flexible enough to cater for any such upheavals in future. We do not know exactly what the Government might be called on to face, but we do know that they will not be able to disapply the provisions in any circumstances for the nationals of any country. 
<P>
The Government's arguments on the matter do not stand up. They are completely bogus from beginning to end. They cannot square the attitude that they took in 1987, 1992 and for all I know in 1996, with their attitude today. Their approach is entirely wrong.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of some of the information that we have received, especially from the South London Tamil Welfare Group, which is worried about the effect that the clause will have on genuine refugees? Does he think that the amendment would genuinely help allay its fears? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable and interesting point. Anyone who takes an interest in the matter would welcome some flexibility. The Government are taking an entirely inflexible approach. No flexibility is allowed for in the Bill. Whatever happens in the future, the Bill shows that we shall not be able to cater for it. 
<P>
I shall develop the point further in later arguments, but the other point on which we strongly disagree is that we suspect that the measure will turn out to be counterproductive. However, that is a different area that we shall discuss shortly. In the meantime, in order to make progress, and completely disappointed as I am with the Government's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 13, line 16, leave out "in the United Kingdom". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 36 and 40. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the new civil penalty covers cases in which a clandestine illegal entrant attempts to evade United Kingdom immigration control operated in France at the entrance to the channel tunnel. The Bill as drafted provides for that only when the clandestine entrant arrives in the UK still concealed. If the House agrees that the penalty regime should be introduced, it is right that it should apply even when the clandestine entrant is detected at the control and emerges after it but before arrival in the UK. The definition of "clandestine entrant" in subsection (1) is the basis of the civil penalty. Under the Bill as drafted, paragraphs (b) and (c) apply to people who pass or attempt to pass through immigration control "in the United Kingdom". Government amendments Nos. 35 and 36 delete the words "in the United Kingdom" from paragraphs (b) and (c) respectively. Government amendment No. 40 inserts a new definition of "immigration control", which explicitly includes 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any United Kingdom immigration control operated in a prescribed control zone outside the United Kingdom."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The United Kingdom immigration control at Coquelles, used by people travelling on channel tunnel shuttle trains, is a "control zone". As control zones may change from time to time, the relevant "control zone" will be defined in regulations. I invite the Committee to accept the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened extremely carefully to the Under-Secretary's entirely lucid exposition of the amendments' effects. However, I am unsure about how they will affect the substantial number of clandestine entrants who use the channel tunnel and Eurostar. People purchase tickets for the domestic and international legs of the journey, make their way from one seat to another and arrive at Waterloo station having evaded immigration control because they were on the domestic leg of the journey. Will the Government amendments make any difference to that--if so, how? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not think that the amendments will substantially change our ability to solve some of the problems that occur on Eurostar. We have discussed those matters with our French counterparts, so that we can determine how best to control those who enter the country on Eurostar. Such matters are dealt with under clause 25, rather than under clause 18. 
<P>
The issue is how to ensure that effective controls are maintained on Eurostar. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere will know, carriers' liability provisions exist for the Belgian part of Eurostar and travellers from Brussels. To some extent, the difficulty has been reduced by the agreement of the French to cooperate in carrying out what checks they can at Paris and Lille. 
<P>
I do not suggest that those checks are foolproof, as is proved by the fact that such people continue to enter the country. We know that carriers' liability provides a deterrent and that the checks ensure that people cannot easily avoid controls. However, it is not a panacea that will stop people entering the United Kingdom clandestinely, or otherwise as in the case of Eurostar. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the fact that the Under-Secretary is talking about such matters, but he will know that the problem has persisted for a considerable time. What he says will be of interest to lorry drivers who will face considerable penalties for carrying clandestine entrants. Can the Under-Secretary give us any idea of when action will be taken? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Eurostar issue is not really relevant, because its passengers do not travel clandestinely; they do so openly as fare-paying passengers. Therefore, carriers' liability under clause 25 is relevant, rather than the civil penalty. I make it clear to the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we are taking what steps we can to address the issue. I do not want to explore all those steps now because they involve discussions with other Governments. The hon. Gentleman will understand the nature of those discussions. Our aim is to ensure that the immigration controls are as effective as possible, which includes examining how best to deal with Eurostar. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I welcome the amendments simply because we have received many representations from ferry operators who thought that the Bill as drafted would discriminate against them in favour of Eurostar. If the amendments bring the tunnel into the regime, they are to be welcomed. However, freight trains with vehicles on them go through the tunnel. Is a vehicle carrying clandestine immigrants on Le Shuttle the responsibility of the lorry driver or the train operator? Where does the split come? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If a container happens to carry illegals, its owner or hirer will be primarily liable because he will be responsible for its contents. Such liability will also apply if the container is a vehicle. We are anxious to maximise our control of who comes over the borders by clandestine means by imposing as many controls as possible on carriers as well as on vehicles. Controls will therefore apply to lorry drivers and to the hirers or owners of containers. 
<P>
<H5>9 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I am afraid that I missed out on the afternoon sitting, and I am not clear on how trains are caught. The matter may have been covered. The clause refers to vehicles, a term that I assume does not include trains. Will the Minister explain whether the clause applies to trains? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government are trying to ensure enforcement in areas where we have controls beyond our border. Currently we have controls in Coquelles, where necessary checks are carried out, and we may have controls elsewhere in future. We want to be sure that wherever our controls are, the penalty will apply from the point at which they are passed. Freight trains will not be caught by the Bill. Only vehicles loaded on trains will be caught, and we shall consider the appropriateness of including freight trains at a later stage. The clause addresses the point at which the penalty will apply to a vehicle that is on the train, whether it is a container or a lorry. As far as we are concerned, it will begin to apply once our controls had been passed, even if they are not in the UK, as in the case of Coquelles. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> That is what I had understood. The effect of amendment No. 40 is fairly clear, especially after the Minister's explanation. I am not certain, however, whether the Government are right to leave trains out of the clause. I understand that the Committee will in time consider clause 25. It is not clear, however, that people may not conceal themselves on a train, whether or not they come here without the proper documents or without fulfilling other requirements set out in clause 25. It is not clear why the amendments and the part of the clause to which they apply explicitly 721 722 exclude trains. The Minister may say that channel tunnel legislation or other existing legislation will deal with the matter. Let the Committee suppose, however, that an illegal gets on a train without a ticket, in the same way that such a person could get on a lorry. How could carrier liability be established or the definition of a clandestine entrant become relevant? Does the Minister have a satisfactory explanation? If so, the Committee should hear it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> All I want to say about trains at the moment is that we have decided not to include freight trains in the Bill because it is necessary to address, a number of practical issues concerning other countries and freight train operators. We have had clear discussions with lorry and freight organisations such as the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association Ltd, and have discussed with them how we intend to proceed. Other legislation than the Bill may be more appropriate to deal with trains that go through the channel tunnel. If we were to consider such an issue, that might be a more appropriate place for it than in legislation such as this. 
<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press me at this stage. I understand that he is raising a legitimate issue, but there are issues of some sensitivity here, which he will be aware of from his experience as a Minister which we do not want to go into now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> That may be so, but there is a worry in that the amendments, particularly amendment No. 40, deal with the immigration regime that affects the channel tunnel trains. The Minister said that this may not be the best clause in which to address this matter; I am not sure whether it is the best Bill. If it extends civil liability to carriers, the people who operate the freight on ships and on vehicles--the definition is in clause 28, but let us assume that that means road vehicles--may start asking what arguments the train operators used which the Government found so convincing when the arguments used by those to do with road vehicles have not been convincing. 
<P>
The Minister will have to tell us, at least by Report stage or when the Bill reaches another place, what has led the Government to exclude trains under this clause. I understand that other provisions will include some parts of the train service. I see not reason why freight or passenger trains should not be included in the clause to provide at least the power on all fours with vehicles, ships and aircraft. 
<P>
If I have missed something in today's debate or in terms of the principle or philosophy behind the provisions, I should be very happy to have an explanation, and it is unsatisfactory.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Part of the question should be answered on clause stand part. Would the Minister care to answer the part of it that relates to the amendment? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, Mrs. Roe, I take your guidance. To some extent, we are dealing with issues relating to people who are not clandestines and have paid for their tickets. We are dealing with trains, which are not covered in these provisions. 
<P>
Freight trains entering the United Kingdom are made up of wagons and containers which have travelled from different parts of Europe and come together in the United Kingdom. There are many issues relating to responsibility for security, which is much more difficult to establish than obvious responsibility for a container or a lorry, when it is clear that someone has a degree of direct responsibility. Before including trains in the provisions, we would want to explore the issues much more carefully. We would also want to consider whether this was the legislation that would best deal with the matter, or whether subsidiary legislation under other Acts of  would be better. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The amendment would extend the provisions to the channel tunnel. The Minister just said something very interesting--that trains are made up of containers that come from different parts of Europe. Of course, many trailers on road haulage vehicles come from ships on the back of one lorry, go across a boundary and on to another lorry, and so on. The issues are somewhat similar. The trailer may be sealed; it may have come from another country. The driver may not know what is the inside, or have only a vague idea, yet he will face penalties under the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I would not deny that there are some similarities, but there are also clear distinctions. When a trailer or lorry has a container on the back which has an identifiable hirer, owner or haulier, it is clear who is liable. When there is a large array of containers perhaps 18 or 20 it becomes more difficult to identify responsibility. Without denying that there is a link and that the issues need to be examined, we have identified an area in which we can improve the effectiveness of immigration control in a clear and definite way, whereby the boundaries of that control and the responsibilities for paying the penalty can be made clear. It is a tough penalty, and I can see why some lorry drivers are concerned about it, but it is necessary to tackle the large-scale scam that has developed among some lorry drivers. It is also necessary to tackle cases in which lorry drivers are not dishonest but negligent and do not take proper account of what they should he doing, and cases in which it is not the lorry drivers who are negligent but the owners, the hirers or the person who has loaded the container and sealed it. Some of those people are not taking their responsibilities seriously. We must find a way of addressing that, and I believe that the Bill is the best way of doing so. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Will the Minister clarify his point about cars that are carried on the shuttle? According to the Channel Tunnel (Carriers' Liability) Order 1998, the shuttle train is specifically excluded from trains to which liability is applied. The Minister implied that that will continue. Did I correctly understand his reference to a vehicle that might be on the shuttle train concealing the illegal would-be immigrant? If a person had his own private car on the shuttle, and somebody secreted themselves without his knowledge in the boot of that car, might the car owner be subject to the same penalties that are being outlined? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, I remind hon. Members to speak to the amendments that are before the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Vehicle means vehicle, and that includes cars. It would be extraordinarily difficult for a car driver to carry a clandestine in his boot without being aware of it. We do not want anybody to carry clandestines in the backs of their cars, caravans or lorries. The aim of the Bill is to concentrate the minds of people who come into this country having been negligent or tempted by a bribe on the fact that if they are discovered to be carrying a clandestine they will face a serious penalty. They might claim that they did not know, or did not check, but that will not be good enough. They might prevent themselves from being prosecuted under criminal law, but they will not be able to evade the civil penalty that we will impose. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I have never been on the shuttle, but are not people often separated from their vehicles in the course of the journey, and could not someone sneak into a vehicle after the owner had checked it and found nothing? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand that that would not be possible in a car or a lorry on the shuttle, because owners are not allowed access to their vehicles. Anyone who is in the vehicle should not be there, so a clandestine entry has in a sense taken place. Before people get on the shuttle, we would ask them to check their vehicle to make sure that they they were not carrying anything that they should not be carrying--clandestines or otherwise--and that no-one was secreting anything in their vehicle that should not be there. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Until now, lorries have been the favoured method of entry in at least 8,000 cases last year. It is possible that cars could become a favoured method, although that is unlikely because it is much more difficult. Cases in which people have been caught in the back of vehicles have largely been dealt with by criminal prosecution, because it is extremely difficult to argue that one did not know that someone was in the boot of one's car. Although we have been able to deal with those cases up until now, it is conceivable that people would say that they did not know what had happend to their car or caravan. If someone travels on the ferry with someone in the boot they would be subject to a civil penalty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to pursue the substance of the amendment, which extends the policy to the evasion of immigration controls in a prescribed control zone outside the United Kingdom. I am still not entirely clear about that zone, which exists in France--I am pleased to hear that we have won the 100 years war and are taking control of Calais again. Who is being checked at the prescribed control zone? We have talked about the train, the shuttle and Eurostar. Who will we catch by extending the reach of the long arm of the law across the channel whom we might not catch if we do not amend the Bill? Are there plans for more prescribed zones, or is the present one unique? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are working with the French and our other European partners to ensure that we improve our system of immigration controls. One way in which we can to do that is by having checks at Coquelles. Obviously, the French authorities are allowed reciprocal rights in the UK. We are examining other possibilities for improving our controls. We might, through co-operation with our European partners, given facilities that we do not have now. 
<P>
The amendments aim to ensure that the penalty becomes payable when our controls are passed. Before people get to our controls--wherever they may be--they should check their vehicles. If they find a clandestine, they should report him or remove him from the vehicle. The people who will be caught are those who carry clandestines who are apprehended in the control zone or who emerge after the control but before entering the UK. The people who are caught at Coquelles, beyond our controls, will be subject to the penalty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Which categories of people are being inspected at that control zone? Is it lorry drivers, car drivers or foot passengers? Who is currently subject to that control on foreign soil? If somebody wanted to take a container off a vehicle and put it on a freight train, would he do that before or after the control? Will we know who has been through and who has been checked? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am advised that there are four immigration controls at Coquelles, which cover lorries, individuals, cars and the other types of control that need to be undertaken. I hope that, on the basis of my explanation, the Committee will support the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The meat of the amendments is in amendment No. 40, which states that the control starts where it is, not necessarily in the United Kingdom. That is understandable. It is also understandable that it applies mainly to channel tunnel rail link traffic. The Minister explained--we may return in the clause stand part debate to the question of whether trains should be included--that there might in future be United Kingdom controls outside the United Kingdom for ferries, aircraft and so on. We understand that. It would not be appropriate to talk about whether we get involved in Schengen-type arrangements, under which there are fewer controls. Nor would it be appropriate to talk about what would happen under the amendment to people who brought in clandestines if there were no controls because Schengen procedures had been introduced. We have had an assurance that that will not happen, at least not without  being warned. 
<P>
A question arises about how the advanced controls in the provisions will interact with people who find an illegal immigrant--a point that was made on a previous amendment and which will probably come up in the clause stand part debate. That might relate to the defences that are available later in this part of the Bill. The Minister should put out warning notices where UK controls come into effect to say, "Check your caravan. Check your car." A Member of the European Parliament might fly here, but send her car through on the shuttle. If the shuttle is excluded, will there be a separate law for those who send their car on the shuttle without accompanying it and who do not have direct responsibility? Does a driver who comes with a vehicle to collect someone else in the United Kingdom have a vicarious responsibility? What warnings will be given? Will caravaners be told to check their caravans? What will happen to someone who has a soft wall container taken off an articulated lorry and put on to a rail carriage 725 726 if someone gets into that container? Some of these issues are consequential to Government amendment No. 40. At some point, the Minister must be more open with the Committee than he has chosen, or been able, to be hitherto.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There will be warning notices to warn people that they should check their vehicles, so that people arriving at controls will be aware of the main provisions of the Bill. We want people to check their vehicles before they get to controls. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with the points of the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley). 
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West is right to say that we have no intention of applying the Schengen agreement. We made our view clear in the Amsterdam treaty. The controls at Coquelles relate to the shuttle. They have been there since the tunnel opened, and the French have similar controls at Cheriton. Eurostar trains are different: they do not stop at Coquelles or at Cheriton. Different--on board--controls apply to them. 
<P>
On the shuttle, the person in charge of a vehicle must stay with it during the trip. It is quite clear who is responsible for a vehicle. I hope that that deals with the queries. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It almost does. I hope that the Minister will not think this practical example to be theoretical. Suppose that I want to be a clandestine entrant. I get on to the shuttle or another train on one vehicle and then, while in the tunnel, transfer to another. The person responsible for making sure that I was not in his vehicle at the start of the journey would have been successful in that, but I would be in the vehicle by the end. Such a case would provide some difficulty because the person in charge of the vehicle could say, "I did check, and he wasn't there at the start of the journey." How will entry clearance officers, or whoever will be levying the civil charge, establish whether someone was in a vehicle when it went through the control point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There are controls on the movement of people on the ferries and on the shuttle. For example, there are closed circuit television cameras on most ferries now. That point leads the discussion on to a clause in which there is provision for a defence to be brought by someone who --an show that he was compliant with proper safeguards and checks put in place, and has evidence of that. Evidence such as a certificate that he had been put through those checks could prove that he was innocent of having carried a person. 
<P>
Provisions for such a defence are set out in the Bill. They have been carefully discussed with the Road Haulage Association Ltd. and with the Freight Transport Association, which endorsed the provisions, even though they wish that the Bill did not include them. We are seeking to put in place a series of controls. The hon. Member for Worthing, West must remember that the objective is not to catch and fine people if it can sensibly be avoided by preventing them from carrying immigrants in the first place. 
<P>
We understand that it is virtually impossible for someone to transfer from one vehicle to another on the shuttle. That is especially true for the lorry shuttle, certainly during the journey, because the carriages are open-sided. To attempt such an exercise would be enormously dangerous. That is the information that we have concerning lorries; people will be with their cars. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that, in so far as we are able, we have tried to deal with such points in discussion with the hauliers. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The Minister says that it is dangerous to do that, but there are innumerable cases of would-be illegal immigrants who have done extremely dangerous things to try to get in. There have even been cases in which people have stowed themselves away in the wheel bays of aircraft. In one such case, one person survived and the other fell out when the undercarriage was lowered. 
<P>
Does the Minister accept that if someone succeeds in fooling a driver of a private vehicle--a car or caravan--and the private driver cannot convince the authorities that he did his best to check and to observe whatever conditions other clauses will insert in the Act, he could end up having his private car or caravan confiscated? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hope that when we reach the clauses that deal with defences, we can explore such issues at some length. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Briefly. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman hopes that those matters will be dealt with briefly. I note with care the way in which Committee members are dealing with the issues now. 
<P>
This is a tough and important provision, and the Government are committed to ensuring that we strengthen our controls. The hon. Member for New Forest, East describes such cases as innumerable; in fact, there are relatively few cases in which people have taken serious risks. The hon. Gentleman identified the sad case of a man who fell from the undercarriage of an aeroplane in Wembley--I think--and who had another person with him. 
<P>
It is conceivable that some people will take risks, but as many security precautions as are reasonable are always taken on the shuttle. Our objective is to try to get lorry drivers, car owners and caravan owners to check their vehicles beforehand. That is the best way to ensure, first, that there is no clandestine on board and, secondly, that there is no risk to any person. 
<P>
On the shuttle, if a driver can prove that someone boarded during the journey, he will not be liable. If he can show that he took all proper precautions and that the person boarded the vehicle without his knowledge, he will not be liable. We want to ensure that car drivers make such checks. We aim to improve the quality of our controls, and we want to ensure that wherever possible, drivers--car or lorry drivers--check their vehicles. 
<P>
I hope that we will not have to confiscate vehicles--caravans, cars or lorries--although, obviously, if we must, we are prepared to do so. I would  tell anyone who is bringing over a caravan, car or lorry to check his load, because he may be carrying a clandestine whom he ought not to be carrying. That clandestine could cost the British taxpayer a large amount of money. The drivers involved are likely to be taxpayers, and it is best that they check their vehicles before reaching our controls, whether those controls be at Coquelles or in Dover, to ensure that there are no clandestines on board. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. You were not in the Chair this morning, when a complaint was made about the Room being too cold. I was not aware at the time that it was too cold, but when I heard that point of order, I began to feel that it was indeed cold. I looked around and saw hon. Members not shivering exactly but looking a bit cold. I feel hot now and, looking around the Room, I can see that Committee members on both sides are down to their shirt sleeves. Is there any way in which the temperature can be lowered? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is rather difficult to alter the temperature while the Committee is sitting, but the hon. Gentleman's request has been noted by those who will be able to take some action. 
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 460, in page 13, line 23, leave out from "and" to "evades" in line 24. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: 
<P>
No. 188, in page 13, line 33, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"but the Secretary of State must reimburse a person on whom a penalty has been imposed if the clandestine entrant in respect of whom liability arose is granted refugee status".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 218, in page 13, line 33, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) No penalty may be imposed where the alleged clandestine entrant claims that his removal from the country would be in breach of United Kingdom obligations under-- 
<P>
(a) the refugee convention, or 
<P>
(b) the Human Rights Act 
<P>
and he is granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a refugee, or exceptionally as a result of such a claim.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 210, in clause 25, page 18, line 19, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4B) A charge paid to the Secretary of State under this section shall be refunded in respect of any person-- 
<P>
(a) who is granted refugee status, or 
<P>
(b) who is granted exceptional leave to remain."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 460 is designed to probe the issues that arise from providing that a claim for asylum will bring a foreign national within the definition of a clandestine entrant. Who is a clandestine entrant under subsection (1)? 
<P>
The subsection provides that a clandestine entrant is someone who fulfils one from each of two groups of conditions. First, he must fulfil one of the three conditions in paragraphs (a) to (c)--that is, either that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he arrives in the United Kingdom concealed in a vehicle, ship or aircraft, 
<P>
he passes, or attempts to pass, through immigration control",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or he arrives in the United Kingdom having earlier been "concealed in a vehicle", but was no longer so concealed at the time of his arrival. Meeting any one of those conditions will do to fulfil the first group. 
<P>
Secondly, a clandestine entrant must also fulfil one of two conditions in the other group. He will do so if he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"claims, or indicates that he intends to seek, asylum in the United Kingdom",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or if he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"evades, or attempts to evade, immigration control in the the United Kindgom."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to explore the first condition in that second group--that is, that someone 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"claims, or indicates that he intends to seek, asylum in the United Kingdom".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What cases is that condition intended to deal with? Is it aimed at people who claim asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom at the point of immigration control? I might have got that wrong, so I shall be grateful if the Minister would clarify that point. The explanatory notes are less than informative, as they tell us nothing more than appears in the Bill. 
<P>
Is that particular condition--a claim of asylum or the indication of an intent to claim asylum--aimed at people who claim asylum straight away? I assume that it is, because it seems that anyone else who went through immigration control and then claimed asylum would fall into the second condition--that is, that he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"evades, or attempts to evade, immigration control."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be a catch-all provision that would include all people who evaded immigration control, including those who claimed asylum after arrival. It appears not to cover people who claim asylum or indicate that they intend to claim asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom--someone who walks off a ship or emerges from an aeroplane and says at the moment that he or she arrives, "I wish to claim asylum in the United Kingdom. I am fleeing persecution in my home country." Is this condition intended to cover such cases? 
<P>
The Minister is looking puzzled. Will he say a little about the words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"indicates that he intends to seek . . . asylum?"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What do they mean? I am not aware of such wording in other immigration legislation that refers to an intention to claim asylum or claiming asylum, but not to indicating an intention to claim asylum. Surely either someone claims or intends to claim asylum, or does not. If someone arrives in the UK and says, before passing through immigration control, "I am not claiming asylum now, but I will do in the future"--it seems a bit far fetched, but it might be what lies behind the words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"indicates that he intends to seek ... asylum"--
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one would have thought that that person could simply be refused leave to enter. As he is not claiming asylum--although he indicates that he might do so in the future--and if he has no other reason or leave to be here, he does not satisfy the immigration rules and can thus be refused leave to enter, so he can be sent on his way. 
<P>
It would appear that the words deleted by the amendment cover the case of someone who claims asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom. I would be grateful for some clarification as it is a matter that we need to consider, especially as it seems to have the result that penalties under the Bill could be triggered by the making of an asylum claim. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 188, 218 and 210 cover what happens when a clandestine entrant applies for and is granted asylum. There appears to be nothing in the Bill to cover that contingency. What is the Government's attitude? I understand, and the Minister adverted to this earlier, that under the existing regime of carriers' liability for scheduled airline, ferry services and so on charges are made if someone enters without the proper documentation but are refunded if the person applies for and is granted asylum. Will that apply here, too? It would clearly be unfair for lorry drivers or lorry firms to have to pay charges that were not being paid by the scheduled airlines and ferry services that breached carriers' liability.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am interested in the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Will he explore the difference between someone who knowingly carries someone who has paid a fare to be carried but may not be coming for the purpose that he or she claims, as might the case with an airline, and someone who carries someone clandestinely, who does not pay a fare--at least a lawful fare? Does he not see a difference between the two? Where does he see the similarity? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am looking at this from the point of view of the lorry company. The principle that the Minister has enunciated so far is that lorry drivers should be made responsible either for their negligence in not checking their load, or for deliberately bringing someone in. That is roughly the same principle that applies under the existing carriers' liability regime, where liability arises for someone who comes in without the proper documentation--in other words, whose documentation is not properly checked. 
<P>
Will lorry firms get refunds if clandestine entrants are granted asylum? I cannot see why there should be a difference between the two regimes in that respect. We would like some confirmation from the Minister on that Question. Will lorry drivers receive a refund of any charges levied on them if the person subsequently makes a successful asylum claim? I hope that I am spelling that out sufficiently clearly for the Minister. 
<P>
One could make out a better case than the one the Minister has made for the road haulage industry to be given special consideration. Of course the measure will cover big lorry companies but it will also cover many smaller companies. Carriers' liability as it exists at present covers mainly large concerns such as airlines and ferry companies: this extends liability to the little man. Will the Minister consider that and whether it might be possible to postpone the charges on the lorry company until the asylum application is determined? It could make a big difference to the financial position of a lorry company or an individual or sole proprietor to have to pay a penalty and then to have it refunded. 
<P>
There is interest in the issue from those who consider it from the point of view of human rights as well as from that of the lorry driver's interests. Justice says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is no defence and no remission of penalties if and when such a person is granted protection in the United Kingdom."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give us some more clues as to the Government's thinking on that? 
<P>
Amendment No. 210 deals with the issue of passengers without proper documentation as opposed to clandestine entrants. Will the Minister explain what happens when such people are granted refugee status? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. It is not entirely clear from the Bill whether, when a road haulier carries a person into the country clandestinely, is fined and his vehicle impounded, the clandestine entrant could still have a case and be granted either refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. It seems unfair that a haulier is fined when the individual brought into the country--though not, acknowledge, in ideal circumstances--is allowed to stay. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have been listening carefully to the arguments of the hon. Members for Poole and for Hertsmere, but can they envisage a circumstance in which a person could come to the UK to claim asylum without first passing through a safe third country? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It would be exceptionally difficult, but, sealed trailers sometimes come from third party countries. An individual might have been picked up en route and enter the country that way. The person in charge of the vehicle when it passes through UK immigration will be fined: he has responsibility, but may not know exactly what was in the cargo. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Does the hon. Gentleman know how containers lock and unlock? How could a person inside a container let himself out? When someone goes into a container the door is shut and it has to be undone by someone outside who must be responsible for it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Customs seals and road haulage company seals can be broken and unsealed at different locations. I would never underestimate the ingenuity of a human being who wants to get out of a place where he does not want to be either because of persecution or for economic reasons. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> They cannot get out. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Some people do. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> It is impossible to get out. The hon. Gentleman will have to explain how because I know--I worked in the industry--that it is impossible. once locked into a container no one can open the door from the inside without assistance from the outside. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Sometimes in such cases third parties help out, which is a problem, but I understand the difficulties mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. It remains the case that someone could face penalties for bringing an individual into the country who might perhaps due to changed circumstances, be granted exceptional leave to stay by the UK Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere's suggestion that penalties be suspended until a case has been determined remains relevant. 
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to that point. The case of an individual coming into the country clandestinely would at least be determined and the road haulage company or the lorry driver would accept the decision. We do not want decisions to be taken before a final determination of the case of a clandestine immigrant is made. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wonder whether the Minister would also respond to the helpful comment made by the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) The Minister asked how anyone could come into this country without passing through safe third countries and being identified: his hon. Friend explained how. If a clandestine entered a container, he could not get out until it arrived and was opened in the UK: only then would he be discovered. France, Germany and several other safe countries might have been passed through on the way. I hope that the Minister will accept that that is possible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. 
<P>
The amendments go to the heart of the Bill by dealing with those who enter this country seeking refugee or asylum status. In an earlier amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere spelt out some of the provisions of this part of the Bill and we can debate them in more detail on clause stand part. 
<P>
I echo my hon. Friend's views on the manifest unfairness of the provision. In a later group of amendments, we will discuss how this part of the Bill affects road hauliers and freight forwarders. We will also discuss the written and oral evidence that they supplied to the Committee. 
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere strayed out of order in the debate on earlier amendments--you brought him back to order, Mrs. Roe--and I think it was these amendments that were in his mind when he raised the issue of the spectacular U-turn that has been performed by the Government since they were in Opposition. He mentioned specifically the right hon. member for Gorton and the Prime Minister, who criticised the proposed legislation for failing to draw an adequate distinction between those who were genuine asylum seekers and those who were not, who were obviously bogus at the point of entry or who subsequently proved to be when they applied for asylum or refugee status. 
<P>
It should not surprise the Government that the extension of carriers' liability has met with almost uniform hostility from not only road hauliers and freight forwarders, as we have already heard and as we will hear more about later, but largely from human rights groups, which have given extensive written and oral evidence to the Committee. I repeat what I said on clause 6 in an earlier sitting: having set up this Special Standing Committee and having sought considerable political capital out of the system that this Committee has carried through, it is perhaps about time that the Government started to listen to such groups. They presumably accept their knowledge and expertise, and were only too happy to draw on their advice when criticising previous Bills when they were in opposition. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will reassure me that he and his colleagues did not ignore the advice of the Refugee Council and other organisations when they were in government. I am sure that he listened to them very carefully. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I always listen to advice given to me, from whatever quarter. Independent of the advice that we have been sent, I have sought advice from some of the charities with which I have been involved for many years. You might rule me out of order, Mrs. Poe, but I might tell the Minister a little later what those charities are--he might be surprised to find out which charities I have supported widely in the past, the advice of which I am only too happy to listen to. 
<P>
The amendments probe the Government's intentions on an issue that, as we have discussed already, exercised them greatly when they were in opposition--the provisions that will cover proceedings taken against a carrier when the clandestine entrants whom he or she carried subsequently make a successful application for asylum. In, I think, the last but one group of amendments, the Minister acknowledged that under carriers' liability legislation carriers will not be fined, or, if proceedings have gone that far, they will be subsequently reimbursed if asylum is sought successfully by clandestine entrants. If those entrants' applications for asylum are accepted, the carrier who has been found guilty or is to be charged under the existing carriers' liability legislation will have those penalties waived. 
<P>
We took some interesting oral evidence from representatives of British Airways, which presumably is the largest carrier in and out of this country. They told us that, in 1998, £4.8 million was levied on British Airways by the immigration service for bringing people into the country whom it should have not allowed on their aeroplanes. They told us that, following challenges and discussions with the immigration service, the net total of £4.8 million that had been levied had been reduced to £2.5 million--just over half the original sum. I went through the evidence from British Airways in some detail, but it would help if the Minister explained how that system works. How could British Airways reduce the sum from £4.8 million to £2.5  million? What challenges and discussions--the two words used by BA--took place with the immigration service? 
<P>
In addition to that reduction, BA conceded that a further £250,000 has been given back to it as a result of passengers subsequently being granted refugee status. The drop from £4.8 million to £2.5 million was not because of people being granted refugee status. It is not a great deal in percentage terms, compared with the original levy, but it would help if the Minister could 733 734 explain briefly how those challenges are made and how the sum was arrived at. The figures show that for asylum seekers, the issue is not so much one of money but of principle, as the representatives from British Airways said. 
<P>
In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Hallam questioned whether clause 16 breached article 31 of the 1951 convention on refugees. The Minister assured him categorically that it did not, but a similar accusation was made about clause 18 by many of the human rights groups from whom we took evidence. They said that there is no distinction in the Bill between those who subsequently successfully achieve refugee status and are successful in applying for asylum and those who do not. As the Minister knows, article 31 prohibits penalties being imposed on refugees who arrive without documentation if they travel directly to the country of safety. As the hon. Member for Hallam said, the hon. Member for Harwich has helpfully informed the Committee how that can be done. Indeed, that is every bit as likely as people being able to get out on the way across Europe.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will understand that these provisions do not impose penalties on refugees or, indeed, on clandestine entrants themselves. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I accept that. I was about to say that and I am grateful to the Minister for pointing it out. Penalties will not be imposed on clandestine entrants or refugees, but, by extension, penalties will be imposed on the carrier. While that may not breach the convention, many would agree--certainly the groups who gave written evidence--that it breaches the spirit of the convention in pushing the guilt on to carriers. Although penalties will not be imposed on clandstine entrants, they might feel a similar sort of guilt. 
<P>
We heard about the refugees who are fleeing from their desperate plight in Kosovo. We warmly welcomed the Home Secretary's announcement that 120 refugees from Kosovo will be accepted here. I think that I understood the Minister to say that there are two categories of refugee: those who are vulnerable, and those who have contact with the 10,000 or so Kosovars already in the United Kingdom. Clearly we shall have to take many more refugees, but I assume that the Minister meant that they must satisfy both criteria. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I welcome the opportunity to clarify that to save any misunderstanding. We are responding to UNHCR requests. We have already said that we have to accept persons who are vulnerable or who have contacts in the United Kingdom. UNHCR might ask us to accept persons who do not fall within either category and we shall consider those requests, as the hon. Gentleman would wish. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Yes, indeed, I would, and I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that, but it might throw up a problem because it could be argued that every refugee is vulnerable. The mere fact that they have gone through a dreadful ordeal implies vulnerability, and it will be difficult for the Government to satisfy the criterion of vulnerability. I understand the criteria for those with existing contacts in this country, but I accept the Minister's confirmation, and am grateful for it. 
<P>
I raise the issue under clause 118 because the Minister said that the purpose of the clause and of others was not to encourage people from Kosovo or anywhere else to come here in the backs of lorries. We endorse that in part, and I entirely share the hon. Gentlemen's sentiments, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. That is the wish of all of us, but for people from Kosovo and for others fleeing areas of conflict and persecution there often is simply no option other than arriving that way. They cannot simply board an aeroplane, although my hon. Friend the Minister for New Forest, East highlighted a dreadfully tragic incident of someone trying to do just that. Stowing away in a lorry, however distasteful for us, however much we may wish to discourage it and however well intentioned the Bill may be, will for many be the only option. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I follow his argument. How would he put the obligation on a refugee to seek refuge in the first safe country, which the convention suggests? How does that apply to his argument? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> With great difficulty, and hon. Member for Harwich gave us a taste of that difficulty. Once a person is in a lorry that he has boarded illicitly, perhaps in eastern Europe, it may be difficult for him to disentangle himself from it if, as the hon. Member for Harwich said, he is locked in. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> The Minister has referred to me a couple of times. When containers or trailers are left either side of ports, they are sealed after they are locked. The seal is numbered and the number is recorded before the lorry goes from one side of the port to the other. It is easy to register the number of the seal when the lorry leaves one port to go to another, and it is known whether someone has tampered with the trailer before it goes to the next destination. Lorry drivers are responsible for checking seals to ensure that they are in the same condition as when they left their goods--perhaps because of thefts of goods from vehicles. There is already an obligation and responsibility on drivers. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Faber:</B> That is a helpful intervention. Let us take the case of a refugee from Kosovo who might have made his way into a container somewhere quite close to where he crossed the border. He might decide to stay in it when it is sealed at a channel port; he would then arrive in this country having been in the container all the way here. I accept the Minister's earlier stricture that that would mean that the refugee might have had an opportunity to get out in another country along the way. But he patently might not have done so; he might have arrived in Dover, by which time he would be seeking asylum or claiming to be a political refugee. 
<P>
The Minister says that he wants a properly organised system for accepting refugees and granting asylum to people who apply for it--an aim that all members of the Committee and all hon. Members share--but in the real world of conflict and disaster, and because of oppression throughout the world, including, tragically, in Europe, that is simply not possible; it does not happen. Under the clause, as drafted, any unwitting carrier who brings a refugee to this country, regardless of whether that refugee's application for asylum is accepted, will be subject to penalties with no recompense. That is the point of my hon. Friend's probing amendment. 
<P>
<H5>10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> May I draw the Committee's attention to the evidence given to the Committee on 18 March by Steve Norris, who said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"He, the driver, may be asked to check his vehicle in a lay-by on a rainy night. On such an occasion, he cannot possibly see whether anyone has got in through the roof of the vehicle, which is commonplace, and he cannot check that numbers on seals are consistent with the numbers that were originally given."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Things are difficult in those circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. We will discuss specific penalties as they apply to road hauliers under later amendments. 
<P>
I am interested in the human rights aspects of the proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East said that victims of conflict who are fleeing oppression, whom the asylum system seeks to help, often do not have paperwork with them. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There seems to be another meeting taking place. I ask hon. Members please to listen to what is being said. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Roe. I am sorry that I am not holding the Committee's attention; I shall try to do better. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East made a point that was made repeatedly in written evidence--that the victims of conflict and oppression often do not have paperwork. They might have been unable to obtain valid documents or have been refused a passport by the regime that was oppressing them or, as we have seen recently, there might have been a systematic attempt to deprive them of their papers and passport as they leave the country. One of the more disturbing aspects of the current ethnic cleansing is that by removing all documents and passports from the people who are being forced to flee Kosovo, the Serbian authorities are hoping that they will not be able to return to that country. People whose identity--their very existence--is systematically removed from them find it difficult to prove their identity elsewhere. 
<P>
In an earlier debate, the Minister claimed that the majority of illegals make themselves known as soon as they arrive in this country. I presume that it is human nature that those who genuinely seek asylum wish to do so as soon as possible, whether they have stowed away or come in through the proper channels. What does the Minister make of the recommendation in the evidence from the ILPA that the Bill should distinguish between those who seek asylum immediately--it presumably confers a moral authority on them that they have sought asylum at the first opportunity--and those who, as the Minister conceded earlier, disappear on arrival? They might be exploited in fruit farms in poor labour conditions. Although they are happy to be out of the country of oppression, they might choose to make themselves scarce and apply for asylum later rather than sooner. 
<P>
We assume that those with a good case will seek to make themselves known to the authorities as soon as possible. The amendments do not make that distinction, as the ILPA said when advising us on them. However, they differentiate between those who remain illegal throughout what we hope will be a short stay in this country, who are presumably subsequently deported, and those who successfully apply for asylum. 
<P>
I remember the Minister's caveat that, part II of the Bill refers not to the refugees themselves but to the guilt by association that is conferred on the carriers by their having to suffer penalties regardless of whether the refugees arrive with a valid claim for asylum. Having made that differentiation, we expect it to be reflected in the penalties that are subsequently imposed on carriers. 
<P>
I remind the Committee of the evidence that the Committee took from the Save the Children Fund, a charity that we are all proud to support and which we all admire. We heard from Labour Members about their concern for children. The representative from UNHCR also addressed the Committee powerfully--the Minister smiles; I am sure that he is recalling what the Home Secretary said about how we should treat that evidence, much of which was about children. 
<P>
The Save the Children Fund said that it was dismayed by part II of the Bill--a strong word for such a charity. It said that the combination of those requirements and carrier liability will encourage the exploitation of asylum seekers by agents or traffickers. We have heard a great deal about disreputable agents and traffickers, all of whom we would wish to discourage. However, what I find distressing about the fund's evidence is that children are particularly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of traffickers. 
<P>
Given the difficulties that they may have in travelling legitimately, many parents will conclude that they have no choice but to use trafficking routes. That places asylum seekers, particularly asylum-seeking children, at great risk of harm from unscrupulous carriers--and from the conditions in which they are forced to travel. There have been well-documented instances of asylum seekers suffering great injury and even death in such circumstances. 
<P>
I know that we would all wish to consider such evidence carefully. My hon. Friend's amendments are sensible, probing though they may be. However, as the Minister knows, it is an issue that caused his party great distress and anguish when it opposed immigration legislation in the previous Parliament. I ask him to give careful consideration to the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I rise to speak briefly to amendment No. 218, to which I added my name. The climate likely to be created by clause 18 is at the heart of the amendment. I am worried about the reaction of carriers when they come across people clandestinely hidden in their vehicles. We believe that the amendment would help. If clandestine entrants are likely to receive asylum and are later granted refugee status, the carriers need not be quite so fearful. 
<P>
The amendment would at least send a clear signal to carriers that the Government were prepared to be lenient if those being carried were granted refugee status; it would not be the end of the world for them. That is especially important once refugees have been discovered, which could happen at a number of stages. For instance, a lorry may still be some distance from the UK when the clandestine entrants are discovered, and they may be turned out into a hostile environment. It is particularly relevant in the context of children, whom the hon. Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber) has just raised. I have spoken to Save the Children, which is concerned about the many asylum-seeking children, many of whom have difficulty accessing legitimate carriers. It is often difficult for children to obtain travel documents, so airlines are often not available to them. Desperate parents will pay money to traffickers to ship their children to another country. That is legally wrong, but wholly understandable if the parent is desperate. What happens when the children are discovered? I do not want to encourage that, but neither do I want the Bill to make matters worse, so that a child who is discovered is treated in a way that reflects the trafficker's fear of the penalties that he will face in the UK. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Surely the aim of a provision such as this is to deter people from allowing clandestines and children to be trafficked on to lorries in the first place. We are aiming to stop trafficking in children; the hon. Gentleman seems to oppose the provisions while somehow allowing the trafficking to continue. I am not sure of the logic of his argument. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister is twisting the logic of my argument. I clearly do not wish to see people trafficked in that way, but a balance must be struck between trying to achieve deterrence, as I hope we will, and making matters worse when a discovery occurs because people, in desperation, have done what we do not want them to do. There will always be instances where we fail to deter. We do not want a carrier who discovers a child in his vehicle to put that child in an even more vulnerable position or to take it out on the child because of a fear of the penalties that will be applied, even if the child has a good case for claiming asylum refugee status. That is the simple point that amendment No. 218 tries to make. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that we should not seek to deter, in case we fail to deter? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> No, I am not. I am suggesting that we must find an appropriate balance between seeking to deter and to catch, another important element of control, and being so heavy-handed that the deterrent causes more problems than it resolves. 
<P>
I am not speaking against any measure to deal with those who have trafficked as individuals, but I refer to an earlier debate on section 8 of the 1971 Act, when the existing legal provisions under that Act were elucidated. For example, they allow us to penalise somebody with up to seven years in jail for trafficking in people and deliberately seeking to avoid immigration controls. I am certainly not against that. Yes, catch the traffickers, yes, use a targeted approach, but my concern is that we risk enacting something more general that causes problems beyond those anticipated when the law was framed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is concerned that people are being put into vehicles undetected. My worry is that a carrier from one destination could put people into a container that is at sea for four or five weeks. Because of the way in which containers are stacked, there would be no way of finding them before it reached its destination, and another carrier might open the container and find people dead. Do we not want to prevent people from going into vehicles undetected? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's concern. I hope that all members of the Committee want to see an end to the trafficking of human beings, which is utterly offensive and repellent and must be stopped. I wholly support the legal provisions that exist and I am prepared to consider new ones that try to prevent trafficking. 
<P>
I am simply querying unintended consequences or actions and exploring them with the Minister, in particular in the context of children and vulnerable people who are discovered. I hope that the Minister can assure us that he is confident, having looked at the facts, that the provision will not have the unintended consequence of creating a tense and difficult situation for vulnerable people who are discovered, which results in confrontation between the individual and the carrier. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have not discussed coach operators. We have had representations from coach companies that pick up people, with documents, and bring them into the country. They may not have the structures to check documents. Some of the individuals may apply for asylum and the coach operator may be fined before the case is determined. Does the hon. Gentleman not think that amendments Nos. 217 and 218 might deal with a problem that the coach operators could face? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I speak from experience of the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987. Airlines are reasonably comfortable about operating under that Act because they are able to receive refunds. That accords with natural justice and makes the provision operable. Therefore, airlines do the job that the Government require them to do. They carry out checking, but are liable as carriers of people. However, they do not come into conflict with the people whom they carry. One of the reasons for that is the clear message in the operation of the rules that understanding should be shown towards cases involving genuine refugees. 
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely and I am interested in the way in which he is developing it. Does he not see a distinction, however, between those, such as airlines, that are meant to carry passengers and those, such as lorry drivers, who are not meant to carry passengers or clandestines in the back of their vehicle? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There is a distinction, and I understand that different rules can be applied. The amendment deals specifically with cases in which someone is discovered and the effect of the law at that point. It was not designed to explore the general issues. 
<H4><center>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair] </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Was not the Minister's latest intervention extraordinary? Are not scheduled airlines and ferry companies in the business of carrying passengers? Therefore, are they not more culpable if they fail to take proper precautions? Lorry drivers are involved in an entirely different line of business. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> On later amendments, we shall have an interesting debate on what are reasonable checks for different carriers to perform. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider the consequences for illegal entrants when they are discovered. However much we try to discourage the carrying of illegal immigrants and however reprehensible we find the trafficking in such people, the Government should give a clear sign on how they will treat them when they are discovered. In particular, we should all be concerned about unaccompanied children, who are an especially vulnerable group. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. Since this morning the temperature has risen by about 10 deg. Some hon. Members are mopping their brows and most of them have taken their jackets off. In whatever interval we may have later, I hope that the thermostat will be adjusted to a target temperature of 68 deg. That would be welcomed by at least some of us. 
<P>
The Minister has relied heavily on the distinction between authorised and commercial carriers, but I am not sure that it carries the weight that he seeks. The problem for immigration controls occurs when someone is caught and makes a claim to remain in the country even though he does not have either the entitlement to do so or pre-entry clearance. If someone emerges or is discovered, the Minister's distinction does not appear to stand up. If it does, he had better produce a better argument than merely asserting it. 
<P>
There is agreement across the Committee that controls are necessary and there is probably agreement that some type of penalty might be appropriate. As the Minister will probably point out, the previous Government introduced the legislation on carriers' liability for commercial operators. If such liability applies to them, it is difficult to argue that non-commercial operators should face no liability. On that, there is reasonably common ground. 
<P>
I presume that the questions testing the coherence of the Minister's argument have received some support from Labour Members. However, if one of them intervenes, the Whip turns around and appears to suggest that the intervention is too long even when it lasts only 20 seconds. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): I was congratulating my hon. Friend on his intervention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I am glad. It is difficult to hear when the Whip speaks from a sedentary position while facing the other direction. 
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) on his intervention. It affords an opportunity to clear up a point that, I hope, will not be considered trivial. If someone arrives, and is detected, but has died en route, I assume that there is no question of asking the carrier to pay the liability charge and that the clause applies to those who arrive alive. I shall not consider the case of someone who arrives, but is terminally ill as a result of the journey, and survives for only eight hours.

<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I am not sure whether I understood the implications of my hon. Friend's comments. In view of the suggestions that the hon. Member for Hallam made about the way in which drivers might react if they found someone who had stowed away, does my hon. Friend propose that drivers should be exempt from penalties if the stowaway was dead, but liable for them if the stowaway was alive? That might encourage serious actions, with extreme prejudice, as they say in the movies, on the part of the drivers, who might be tempted to do something drastic to the unwelcome passenger. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> A clause stand part debate rather than consideration of subsection (1), which defines a clandestine entrant, would be more suitable for such a discussion. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will explain whether there is a penalty in the case of someone who is detected but has died. That sounds amusing, but it is not. Apart from the person who dropped out of the nose wheel housing of an aircraft, people have arrived in containers, but have lost their lives en route. 
<P>
Should we place any weight on the word, "discovered"? I believe that, in future, most people will emerge rather than be discovered. They may be transported with or without the carrier's knowledge, but, at the point of entry, they will turn up and claim refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. People who have passed the point of control, left the vehicle and the point of entry are unlikely to admit that they arrived on Korean Airlines or British Airways or a particular ferry, cargo boat or lorry. I can imagine someone who is eventually discovered beyond the point of entry being asked for the registration number of the vehicle in which he travelled. If such a person gives a number, who will believe that it is correct? How will the question of proof be tackled? 
<P>
That leads to questions that may be better left to a clause stand part debate or to discussions of later subsections of the clause. What sort of proof would carriers have to provide to show that they did not know that a potential clandestine entrant was in their vehicle, aeroplane or ship? Will the Government introduce a code of practice that includes a check list? If carriers can put a tick in each box, will they be considered clear? Would that mean that a clandestine entrant did not fit the definition in the clause, or would the code simply serve as a defence for the operator? 
<P>
We are discussing difficult issues. We should consider them in the context of the bipartisan agreement, however reluctant, between some Government and some Opposition Members on the need for carrier liability that does not exclude those who do not usually transport refugees for commercial profit. 
<P>
In view of the Minister's reference to the Home Secretary's announcement, I stress that should the Government decide to go way beyond 110 Kosovan 741 742 Albanians, I shall support them. Over the past weeks, an awkward impression has been given that focus groups have stopped us doing things before we were asked to do so by the UNHCR. I certainly hope that this country will show the generosity of which we have been proud in the past. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I, too, welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I thank the hon. Member for Worthing, West for his comments about the welcome for the Kosovans, which we hope that we, as a country, will extend to all those whom we receive in due course. 
<P>
I will begin by reiterating a point that I have made several times. It has been broadly accepted by states that are signatories to the 1951 convention that refugees should make a claim in the first safe country that they come to, although that is not explicit in the convention itself. The objective of the 1951 convention is to ensure that people are safe and that their lives are not under threat. It has always been accepted that countries should provide a place of safety if they are signatories to the convention and that refugees should make a claim in that country, although there are a few exceptions when refugees have relatives in other countries. 
<P>
Britain, by the nature of its geography, is separated by the European Union from most countries from which most refugees are likely to come. That is not the case in relation to air travel, in which, for obvious reasons, circumstances are somewhat different. However, on overland travel, it is likely that people fleeing for their lives would travel through another safe country before reaching Britain. 
<P>
There is no real argument for saying that we should have an open door in case one or more persons are genuine refugees. It cannot be argued that, in case that should happen, we should be able to take lots of people who are not genuine refugees who come here in the back of lorries or who come here and claim asylum. As I said, not all those people claim asylum. 
<P>
Our human rights policy is strong, and we demonstrated that in passing the Human Rights Act 1998. We are seeking to pursue an ethical foreign policy. With the support of nearly everyone in the House, we have committed ourselves to accepting refugees coming from Kosovo who are designated by the UNHCR. That demonstrates the strength of our commitment to ensure that the 1951 convention is respected and that we pursue a strong human rights policy. 
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 460, 188, 218 and 210. Clause 18(1) defines a clandestine entrant. The structure of the civil penalty hangs on the definition of a clandestine entrant. The two are inextricably linked because we have introduced the civil penalty to tackle the problem of illegal entry by persons who are seeking to evade the immigration control or who intend to seek asylum in the United Kingdom, either by presenting themselves to immigration control on arrival or by entering illegally and subsequently claiming asylum. 
<P>
Clause 18(1) specifies in paragraphs (a) to (c) the circumstances in which a clandestine entrant arrives in the United Kingdom or passes through our immigration control, based on their concealment at the time of arrival, or of embarkation, or both. That is deliberately quantified by the words which amendment No. 460 seeks to delete. We limit the definition of a clandestine entrant to those who claim--or indicate that they intend to claim--asylum, or who evade--or attempt to evade--our immigration control. We did that deliberately. We have no desire for the civil penalty to affect a person who, for example, hides in a lorry merely to avoid paying the ferry fare. 
<P>
That is a civil matter that we are not engaged in preventing. Ferry companies or others may wish to deal with such a matter, but the state need not be involved in it. 
<P>
Such people may emerge from their lorry and present themselves to immigration control, but--assuming that they do not want to claim asylum--we would not wish the civil penalty to apply in such situations. However, it constitutes reprehensible behaviour, which I am sure all Committee mems want to discourage. The amendment would widen the scope of the civil penalty in a way that is undesirable and unnecessary, and I urge the Committee to reject it. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about clause 18(l)(c) and the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"indicates that he intends to seek . . . asylum".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Someone indicates that they intend to seek asylum when they express a current intention to seek asylum in the future but change their mind. People may arrive at immigration control in the UK and say, "I intend to claim asylum." After a short period, during which the situation is explained to them, they may simply decide to go. That has a certain cost and an impact. Even if such people voluntarily leave the United Kingdom our intention is to apply the penalty, because we are seeking to deal with the way in which they arrived in the UK. 
<H4><center>10.30 pm </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I intervened on the hon. Member for Hallam earlier to discuss coach operators. We have received representations from coach companies, whose representatives said that they often use foreign drivers. A  foreign driver might use the ferry to get a coach full of people to this country, and one person on the coach might have documents that are not accepted by the UK authorities. Would he fall within the definition of a clandestine individual? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> On coach operators, the carriers liability legislation, which involves clause 25, rather than the civil penalty would be applicable. We shall discuss that matter later. The essential difference in this case is that we are dealing with people who are not supposed to be carrying paying passengers. We need to use the carriers liability legislation, which is broadly in place but which may need to be extended, to deal with other problems, including those associated with people who can legitimately act as people carriers. In that case, the issues are slightly different. Are the people who are legitimately being carried properly documented? The clause deals with the situation in which people are clandestine entrants--they are carried not by recognised people carriers but by people who should not be carrying such clandestines. We want to prevent people who should not be carrying them in the back of their lorry, car or caravan from doing so. In due course we can deal with the complex issues relating to coach operators, which need a full and proper debate. 
<P>
I understand the concerns that have been expressed about amendment No. 188, and I have listened carefully to the arguments that were advanced in this context. The amendment would impose on the Secretary of State an obligation to reimburse anyone on whom a civil penalty has been imposed if the clandestine entrant was eventually granted refugee status. 
<P>
The Government are committed to dealing with asylum seekers in a way that complies with our international obligations. However, as I have already said, there is no obligation on the United Kingdom--or on any other Government, in the convention or otherwise--to facilitate or to encourage the arrival of asylum seekers. Controls are needed--people who want to claim asylum should not be completely free to enter the country in the back of a lorry. 
<P>
The civil penalty is intended to address the large and increasing problem of legal entrants who are clandestinely carried by people who should not be carrying passengers. Many of those clandestine entrants subsequently claim asylum and travel here with that intention. However, only a small proportion have their claim accepted--about 17 per cent. of the overall number of people who claim asylum. I cannot give the precise number of people who come off the back of lorries and who are accepted. Other provisions in the Bill are intended to deter the increasing number--

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Can the Minister break down the figures according to the differing types of carriers? Surely the figure of 17 per cent. does not refer to the 8,000 people coming in on lorries but mostly to airline passengers. Will the Minister confirm that virtually none of those who are known to have come in on lorries have been accepted? That would be useful information. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thought that I had already said that I could not provide such a breakdown. I can provide the overall breakdown of the number of asylum seekers who are currently recognised as having refugee status. I cannot break down the figures according to how they arrived, whether on a lorry or by some other means. I suspect that such a breakdown may be possible in respect of Eurostar, for example, but not in respect of lorries. 
<P>
Other provisions in the Bill are meant to deter the increasing number of people who travel to the UK with the intention of using a claim for asylum as a means of establishing themselves for their economic betterment, rather than genuinely fleeing persecution. Such persons increasingly use clandestine illegal entry, the scope for which unlike that for fare-paying passengers--is considerable. The response must therefore be proportionate to the risk, and the civil penalty proposed in the Bill is an important part of the measures to combat the problem. 
<P>
Currently, the civil penalty is based on the arrival of someone who claims or indicates that they intend to claim asylum, or who evades or attempts to evade immigration control. We should not take action that would undermine that objective. Some of the points made in this debate have been strongly expressed, however, and it is important that I give them full consideration. I should like to consider some of the points about refugees and the way in which penalties would operate in slower time. I shall consider what would be the best approach. 
<P>
The objective of the legislation has already been set out--to stop people carrying passengers when they should not be doing so. If the Government were to refund the penalty in respect of lorry drivers who had brought in people who were subsequently recognised as genuine refugees, lorry drivers would have to distinguish between one category of persons and another and prejudge the carrying of the person. I am not sure that we want to go down that route. We want to discourage the carrying of people in the back of lorries per se. 
<P>
I pointed out at the beginning of this discussion that the refugee should claim asylum in the first safe country. We should not have an open door. As part of our human rights policy, we should accept--as in the case of Kosovo--people who are genuinely fleeing. We have an agreement with the UNHCR to accept certain persons. In that and other ways, our international obligations are being fulfilled. 
<P>
We should not allow two lorry drivers to choose-- 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear with me--I am trying to work through some of the arguments so that the Committee can respond. If he will let me finish, we may reach the key point. 
<P>
Lorry drivers should be told not to carry anyone into the country. But if they wanted to bring someone into the country because of an especially difficult situation--perhaps as a result of a dramatic change of circumstances in some of the EU countries--they could use the direct line to the immigration service. That would allow drivers to inform the immigration service of their intention, and the matter could be dealt with openly. 
<P>
The problem is that drivers bring in people who they should not be carrying in the first place. Such a driver is not carrying out a humanitarian act. He may be accepting a bribe--we know that some have done so or he may simply be negligent in not checking his work. 
<P>
The suggestion seems to be that if someone happens to be recognised as a refugee, there should be some refund of the fine or a fine should not be levied. I am reluctant to go down that route because it would undermine what we are trying to do, but I recognise the strength of the arguments and perhaps hon. Members will allow me to consider them in more detail and obtain advice on them. I shall return to the matter on Report if I decide that the civil penalty should be reconsidered and perhaps treated on a similar basis to vicarious liability-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I said that I would give way to the hon. Member for New Forest, East, but I shall then give way to the hon. Member for Hertsmere. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> The Minister has gone some way in covering the point that I am about to raise. I have in mind a case that arose before the fall of the iron curtain. Professor Norman Stone tried to smuggle someone out of communist Hungary, but was caught and imprisoned by the communist regime. A similar situation might arise in future. There may be humanitarian reasons for smuggling someone out of his homeland if he was in genuine fear for his life and liberty and the person doing so might feel unable to abandon that person in the first democracy that they came to, perhaps because that democracy could impose sanctions for having smuggled someone into the country. If they then came to this country, considerable penalties might be imposed for having done something which most people would applaud--having got that person to this country it may become clear that it was a prime case in which asylum would almost certainly be granted. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In those circumstances, Ministers would have a residual ability to take a view. In practice, there would be no need for a Norman Stone to smuggle someone into the United Kingdom. If the entrant had been subject to life-threatening circumstances, we would be helpful in dealing with his case. I would not expect a Norman Stone to have to smuggle someone in a concealed unit to get him into the country. That would be going a little far. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Before I allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene, I shall deal with the point that he raised earlier. He asked about charges being postponed. We could not postpone collection of a penalty until an asylum claim had been determined because that would simply encourage asylum claims. Claims may take some time to determine and the delay would make it difficult to collect a fine. There would be difficulties in detaining vehicles and if the driver were foreign and the vehicle could not be detained, we would have no way of ensuring that the penalty was paid. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion would create substantial difficulties. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall return to that later. 
<P>
The Minister said that he would consider amendment No. 188. In the interests of dispatch, will the Minister undertake to write to us when he has considered the matter and tell us the result of his deliberations before Report? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Westbury also asked us to distinguish between those who ask for asylum immediately and those who wait some time before claiming asylum--the port and in-country distinction, which was used by the previous Government. Asylum seekers who simply seek economic opportunity abuse our asylum system and the hon. Gentleman will agree that they are the worst enemies of genuine refugees because they undermine public support for the asylum system. I do not accept that there is a legitimate distinction. 
<P>
Amendment No. 210 would do two things. First, it would provide a statutory basis for existing Government policy to waive or refund charges. Secondly, it would extend the scope of this policy to those who are granted exceptional leave. The Committee will be aware that existing policy arises from undertakings given by Ministers in the previous Government during the passage of the carriers' liability legislation. It was decided that charges would be refunded in certain circumstances. I have discussed how I propose to examine those issues and I shall write to hon. Members on that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have some other points to make. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I apologise for intervening, but I thought that the Under-Secretary was moving on. During our deliberations on existing carriers' liability legislation, I did not mention the refund to British Airways of £2.3 million in the past year. It would be interesting to understand the difference between the £250,000 that was repaid for successful asylum applications and the £2.3 million. 
<H4><center>10.45 pm </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The carriers' liability legislation allows British Airways to receive a refund if someone is recognised as a genuine refugee. The previous Government gave the undertaking that the carriers' liability legislation would not be imposed on people who are recognised as genuine refugees. As British Airways and most other airlines are large companies, they do not pay the fine as soon as we have contact with the undocumented person, but after a balance has arisen. We consider who has been recognised as a genuine refugee and calculate how much should be refunded. That sum is then deducted from the amount that we claim from the airlines. 
<P>
There is also a problem with documentation. We are talking about companies who carry passengers. Indeed, we would encourage them to do that and be prosperous. The issue for us is whether passengers are properly documented. People may have well forged or questionable documents that, although genuine, might not apply to the person who is carrying them. Whether a person qualifies as a non-documented or improperly documented passenger who should not be arriving in this country gives rise to many questions. We discuss cases with British Airways and other airlines, and there is some leeway on what is regarded as an undocumented person. For example, an airline might claim that it could not have stopped someone travelling. 
<P>
That broadly accounts for the £250,000. It covers people who have been granted refugee status and some disputed cases where we have to consider whether it is appropriate to impose a fine because someone's documentation is questionable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Is the Minister saying that the larger figure of £2.3 million covers disputed documentation and the £250,000 covers the refund for successful asylum seekers? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, I think that it is the other way round, although there is some confusion. I hope to be able to give the hon. Gentleman a breakdown on the figures for British Airways. I think that I answered a parliamentary question recently on that matter.It might even have been tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> While the Under-Secretary is on that point, can he say a little about amendment No. 210? It relates to refunds in respect of the scheduled carriers' liability for people who are recognised as refugees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will come back to amendment No. 210 after I have dealt with some of the other points that have been raised. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) referred to trailers. As for sealed units coming in the United Kingdom, someone put the people into the unit and locked it. Someone was responsible for picking up the unit and transporting it. People who transport such units must accept some responsibility for their actions. If a lorry driver is willing to accept a unit on the back of his lorry that carries clandestine entrants, he is accepting a risk. He may decide that he can contractually offset that risk. Some lorry drivers might say, "Okay, I shall run a risk. There will be a number of clandestines on this run. I shall not check the unit, but I want the person with whom I am contracting to carry this load to undertake a legally binding contract that he will compensate me if I am faced with any fine." The risk will be passed down to the point at which whoever is looking at a unit will be contractually obliged to whoever carries it through to the United Kingdom to ensure that there are no clandestine entrants in it. 
<P>
We do not want a new set of immigration controls conducted by lorry drivers at Calais. We want controls all the way down the line, so that lorry drivers are more careful, the people who are filling up the containers are more careful, and those who are carrying the load for the first part of the journey are more careful. Contractual obligations should emphasise the care that they should take all along the line. If someone were to lock himself into a container, that would suggest that he was not seeking refuge in the first safe country, but in a particular country--something, I think, that we could debate for some time. 
<P>
The hon. member for Westbury referred to British Airways. There is a two-tier system of making representations against carriers, liability, first by an inspector at local level and then by an appeal to a more senior officer at Croydon. At each stage, the file and the representations of the carrier are considered. A change might be made at different stages of the process. We publicise the information about the way in which we operate the concessions. 
<P>
I now come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Westbury about children. The provisions will assist our aim of deterring the trafficking of children in the back of lorries and other vehicles. It is a serious problem. The Children's Society and other organisations are right to identify a growing worry about such trafficking. We must have more checks to ensure that children or others are not secreted in the back of lorries. We have evidence that some children are being brought into the country by that method and the penalties will concentrate the minds of lorry drivers who unwittingly or otherwise might be carrying people in the back of their lorries. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam advanced a complex argument about children. We should have penalties. The hon. Gentleman seemed to say that there should not be penalties in case we failed to deter. We cannot guarantee to deter every person from carrying children, but deterrents must be in place. We aim to deter lorry drivers from carrying children in the first place. I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that we should ignore the intended consequences of the Bill--less trafficking by lorry drivers--because unintended consequences might occur. It is better to deter in the first place than not to deter, because our aim is to reduce the number of children who may be carried in that way. 
<P>
That calls to mind what Marcuse said--that we cannot prevent this from being a world in which children are tortured but we can reduce the number of tortured children. We can have in place a system of penalties that will deter those who might, unwittingly or wittingly, be trafficking in children. The penalty therefore, goes further in protecting children than the hon. Member for Hallam presumed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> There will be some sympathy with that argument, but the problem is the existing carrier liability. By my calculation, British Airways were penalised last year for about 8,000 people who entered clandestinely. Even if half the cases were remitted, that is a lot of people. That 8,000 equals the number that the Minister says come in on lorries. The proposal will not act as a sufficient deterrent for British Airways, for example, which already has every interest in applying the law fully. The intention may be worthy and the provision necessary, but the notion that it will stop clandestine entry does not carry much weight and is, frankly, for the birds. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I used the Marcuse point that we cannot prevent this from being a world in which children are tortured but we can reduce the number of tortured children. With the penalty regime in place, the number of children likely to be trafficked clandestinely will probably be reduced because lorry drivers will make checks of their loads that they would not otherwise make. It is clear that many lorry drivers are simply not checking their loads or are accepting bribes. The proposal will concentrate the minds of such lorry drivers and hopefully prevent children from being carried in the first place. It may also deter those who knowingly carry children or others in the back, because they might find that they face a heavy penalty if they are caught. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked me to deal with amendment No. 210. I have already set out our view on that. The Government support the undertakings given by the previous Government and it remains our intention to continue to apply the existing policy, which reflects our commitment to honour our obligations under the 1951 convention. The hon. Gentleman has asked me to take that further, but I do not think that I can. We have already shown how we will apply the regime in practice; the amendment is therefore unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. 
<P>
In conclusion, the key distinction that we need to make is between airlines which are meant to carry passengers, check their tickets, passports and documentation, other means of transport whether caravans or lorries, which are not meant to carry passengers, or to be in the business of bringing people into the UK, although they may be in the business of bringing in haulage. We need an effective regime that stops the corruption and trafficking and which curtails the organised crime that is rapidly developing through lorry drivers regularly being approached and offered bribes. The issue needs to be addressed and that is what the legislation does. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> After we have suspended for the Division in the House, the Minister may want to return to the issue, which I accept may be easily answered, of whether a carrier is liable for someone who arrives dead. It sounds funny, but it is not supposed to be. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim would be to ensure that the police fully investigate the cause of death. I hope that the penalty regime will prevent people from being contained in the back of a crate or lorry and ending up dead. Our objective is to stop that happening in the first place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It would be useful if, in half an hour's time, the Minister would give us answers on whether the legislation would allow for a prospective charge. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In theory, a penalty might be possible but it would not be our intention in normal circumstances. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a Division in the House on the Finance Bill; my understanding is that there will be two Divisions. I shall suspend the Committee for quarter of an hour for each Division and we shall resume proceedings at 11.30 pm unless other Divisions are called. 
<H4><center>11 pm </center></H4>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-- 
<P>
<B> Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I had just about concluded, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> For the Committee's knowledge, will the Minister confirm that in respect of nearly everything that will carry a civil liability--a charge--if the amended definition of a clandestine entrant is passed, the carrier will in practice almost always also commit a criminal offence, but it will be easier for the Government to pursue the carrier on a civil than on a criminal charge? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, I will not confirm that, because it is not true. A person commits a criminal offence if they knowingly carry someone. Some people who carry clandestines do not do so knowingly. Obviously, some people accept bribes, but I hope that that is not the majority of lorry drivers. 
<P>
We are aware of 8,000 clandestines who enter in the back of lorries. The actual figure will be larger than that; there will be others of whom we are not aware who have come in and gone to ground. A substantial number of people come in on the back of lorries, but I suspect that many lorry drivers who carry them do so unwittingly, so they would not be the subject of criminal charges. By and large, those lorry drivers are negligent or are not taking proper care, so I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman says. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> For clarity, those who act negligently may not commit a criminal offence--they cannot because there is no intent--but those who act knowingly or who take money will commit such an offence, although the authorities may choose not to take criminal proceedings against them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is very difficult to prove a criminal offence unless circumstances make it obvious--if there is a lot of corroborative evidence to substantiate the charge--or the lorry driver decides to admit the offence. The criminal offence is therefore not an effective deterrent for those who are accepting bribes to carry illegals. The penalty for carrying clandestines will be a much more effective deterrent. I repeat that it is a tough policy, but I believe that it is fair. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It will probably be better to consider the remaining issues during the clause stand part debate, rather than pursuing the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate on an especially poignant aspect of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West rightly brought to the Committee's attention the sad circumstances of people who tragically die trying to cross from one country to another as refugees. I understand that a non-governmental organisation in Amsterdam has studied the number and type of deaths of people trying to get from east to west. According to United for Intercultural Action, more than 1,000 people have died in Europe since 1993 trying to evade border controls. Aid agencies report that as many as 1,000 people may have drowned this year--more than 200 of them in Spanish waters. 
<P>
The Minister must answer with a little more precision the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West about whether dead people who arrive in lorries or vehicles count for liability for these purposes. I also appreciated the excellent speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury. The Committee will have gathered that my hon. Friend takes an interest in human rights issues. 
<P>
The Minister tried to draw a distinction between the existing carriers' liability for scheduled carriers and the new form of carriers' liability, which will apply to lorry drivers and others. If I have misunderstood him, it will be my fault, but he appeared to advance two arguments. He argued that existing legislation covers people travelling to Britain from their original, home countries on scheduled services without proper documention. He then argued that the new form of carriers' liability applies to clandestine entrants who have crossed safe third countries and could have claimed asylum there. I understood, that the Minister was trying to draw that distinction. I take the Minister's failure to rebut my assertion as something of a confirmation. His argument will read in Hansard in the way that I have described, and I am a little perplexed about the Bill because of it. It is perfectly possible for clandestine entrants to have come from their countries without having passed through a safe third country. The Bill contains no provision to distinguish between an entrant who has come directly from a country of which he is a national and an entrant who has passed through a safe third country. In either case, charges will not be refunded to the carrier in respect of entrants whose claim for asylum is granted. I am surprised by the Minister's arguments in the light of that. 
<P>
The Minister said that lorry drivers should have a greater obligation to inspect their vehicles. The Opposition agree with the need for such inspection, and we believe that other parties should also do their bit. Such parties include Governments, port authorities and others. 
<P>
I was concerned by the Minister's argument about deterring lorry drivers from bringing people into the country. A lorry driver will have no idea whether a concealed person in the back of his lorry will be granted refugee status. The person will, in the Minster's scheme of things and according to the Bill, present to the lorry driver the risk of incurring a substantial penalty. The Minister argued that refunding charges when such people are recognised as refugees would somehow diminish the deterrent effect. I do not see how it could do so, because a lorry driver will have no idea whether the person in the back of his lorry will be recognised as a refugee. 
<P>
The Minister's point about the low recognition rate also works against his own argument. Let us say that the Minister is arguing on the basis of a 17 per cent. recognition rate, which was the figure for all refugees, rather than those entering the country in lorries. That rate would mean that lorry drivers had an 83 per cent. chance of having to pay a penalty in respect of a concealed person. 
<P>
I notice that the Minister of State is shaking his head. I do not know whether he is doing so in disagreement or some other sentiment. I shall give way to him or his colleague if they want to intervene, but I think that he is simply shaking his head. 
<P>
I am not impressed by the Minister's arguments. I cannot see how refunding charges made in respect of clandestine entrants who are thereafter recognised as refugees would diminish the deterrent for lorry drivers. That is what the Minister claims, but it is not a valid argument. 
<P>
The other argument deployed by the Minister was based on another distinction between existing carriers' liability and the new form of liability. He said that lorry drivers are not in the business of carrying people but scheduled airlines and ferry companies are. In fairness, that should increase the case for being more severe with airlines and ferry companies. If they carry the wrong people, that makes them more culpable. 
<P>
We have to accept that the situation of lorry drivers is different to that of operators of scheduled services. On scheduled services, there is the opportunity to check documents; lorry drivers do not have such an opportunity. Lorry drivers will incur liability if they fail to carry out inspections or are otherwise negligent. A lorry driver does not have the same opportunities as airlines and ferry companies to screen passengers, check documents and ensure that the right person is at a check-in point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that lorry drivers do not have the facilities to screen passengers. Does he not understand that they ought not to be carrying passengers? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand that. The Minister must understand that passengers present themselves at a check--in desk for scheduled airlines. They have the opportunity to look at an individual's documents. If an airline gets that wrong, it is culpable. That is not an enormous duty for them to fulfil when compared with what the Minister is asking of lorry drivers. He has undermined his case with some of his arguments. 
<P>
We agree with the Minister in wanting strong controls and protection. Clandestine entry is not right. However, we wonder whether the proposals are the solution, whether the regime that the Minister wants to put in place will work. Amendment No. 188 was a probing amendment. I do not intend to take the discussion of it further. 
<P>
I was surprised that the Minister said that the deletion suggested in amendment No. 460 would widen the liability. Clause 18(1) contains an either/or proposition. Deleting the "or" would not make the liability wider--the "either" would be left. Actually, the amendment would delete the "either" and not the "or", but never mind. I got that the wrong way round. 
<P>
Having listened to the Minister's response, I have the same feeling as I did at the beginning of the debate. The liability would not be widened by the amendment. The phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"claims, or indicates that he intends to seek, asylum in the United Kingdom",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is intended to deal with the category of person who claims asylum on arrival. The "or" part of the sentence reads: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or evades, or attempts to evade, immigration control in he United Kingdom." 
<P>
That phrase must cover everybody else. I cannot think of anybody who would fall into that category who would not have fallen into the first. I thought, and the Minister did not exactly rebut the suggestion, that someone who indicated that they would claim asylum on entry to the United Kingdom would be defined as a clandestine entrant if he entered in any of the ways set out in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c). 
<P>
The main substance of the group of amendments is covered by amendments Nos. 218 and 210, which concern the recognition of refugees and claims for asylum status. The Minister was kind enough to sav that he would think about our questions. He should do that, 753 754 because he may create an unsustainable distinction between the scheduled airlines and ferry companies and the hauliers. If hauliers and carriers were aware of such a distinction, they might nurture a grievance. We must do all we can with the relevant clauses to try to allay concerns. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> As my hon. Friend rightly said, amendment No. 460 was a probing amendment. Amendments Nos. 218 and 210 are serious, and we should welcome the Minister's agreement to consider their underlying point even though he might not accept them. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would make sense to provide a refund if the number of people who are given leave to remain or are accepted as refugees in this country is low? If the number of people is high, it will be grossly unfair if carriers such as lorry drivers cannot get their money back while commercial carriers such as airlines and ferry operators can? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is an excellent point, to which we may return later. It is possible that being unable to have the charges refunded will create much greater hardships for lorry firms. My hon. Friend the Member for Westbury mentioned figures for British Airways. I am not good at remembering figures, but I think that they were in the millions. Figures of such dimensions will not threaten the commercial viability of British Airways. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The figures showed that £2.3 million had been returned to British Airways as a result of challenges that it had made. The Minister explained that the situation resulted from documentation that had been ill thought through. Only £250,000 related to asylum seekers. In the Minister's reply, however, the figures were the other way round, so I am a little confused. Does my hon. Friend share my confusion at the fact that the figures given by the Minister and by British Airways are diametrically opposed?

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Minister will have to clear that up. 
<P>
The Minister said that he was going to take the matter away and think about it. If he had not been prepared to take that course, I would have been ready to press the amendment to a vote. However, he undertook to write to me so that I could consider the matter, which puts a different complexion on things. This is a serious matter; we do not want to create an unfair, unsustainable distinction between lorry drivers and airlines. We may want to return to the matter later; [whether we do] will be governed by the Minister's reply. In those circumstances, and in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We may have anticipated the points that I am about to make in support of the amendment, but I want to make some new points rather than simply return to the old ones. 
<P>
The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to specify that the carriers' liability regime would apply to certain ports of embarkation but not others. I want to develop the thinking behind the amendment a little. 
<P>
The Committee will recall the striking evidence that we took from the Road Haulage Association and others about different standards at different ports. Mr. Dossetter of the Freight Transport Association was asked about variations in the level of protection and security at the cross-channel ports. He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Most certainly there is not adequate security. The primary bad player here is the port of Calais, where we have all seen recently the extent of the lack of security. The authorities in Calais suggest that they will improve matters later in the year, but by that time we may face £2,000 bills for operators and drivers."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, Thursday 18 March 1999; c. 411.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere in the evidence it was suggested that the position at other ports, such as Zeebrugge, was much better. Apparently, other port authorities undertook proper checks and the situation was regarded as generally much better. 
<P>
One has to see the issue against the background of the regime that the clause introduces. On any view, that regime is tough. The Government parade their toughness as a virtue. We certainly view the regime as tough, although I will not go into our other views on its merits. It is, however, worth exploring whether there is a case for introducing the regime at some ports and not others. 
<P>
The Minister may disagree, but there is a case--perhaps not in his eyes, but certainly in those of the people who are being subjected to the regime--for saying that it is so strict that it is akin to a regime of strict liability. Lorry drivers and operators certainly believe so. It is not strict liability, strictly speaking, because liability does not arise simply through the occurrence of the event. However, many would say that the position is not a million miles away from strict liability. In the context of the other provisions, if the event--that is, the arrival of the clandestine entrant--occurs, the lorry driver and operator are liable unless they can establish that they have a defence under clause 20 and that they have complied with the requirements of the code of practice, which we have yet to see. 
<P>
We have taken evidence from bodies that are to be subject to the regime as to how they view it. The British International Freight Association told us: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is an automatic assumption of guilt placed on the driver".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Over the years, the law has generally reserved the regime of strict liability for cases involving inherently dangerous situations and obvious risks. It is not necessary for me to take the Committee back through all the old authorities on that. However, I shall give some examples of cases in which strict liability has been imposed in respect of the escape of radiation from nuclear installations, oil pollution from bulk oil carriers and poisonous waste escaping from dumps. Those are statutory examples; no doubt there are many others. Will the Minister think about accepting the proposition that strict liability should be reserved for the worst situations, and explore the idea of reserving the draconian regime of carriers' liability for those ports where the risks are greatest and it is therefore incumbent on drivers and others to take the greatest care? 
<P>
The amendment highlights the fact that some ports and their administrations do much better than others, and that the Government need to do more to argue the case for better security in overseas ports. The Minister said this evening that the Government would like to prevent clandestine entry ever occurring, and we all agree with those sentiments. He was asked what the Government are doing in respect of Eurostar, on which a number of entrants--not necessarily clandestine, but certainly illegal--are arriving in the country without proper documentation. The Minister told us that the Government are very concerned and are talking to a number of people about it. However, that has been going on for month after month and he was not able to tell us that any concrete steps had been taken as a result. I understood from what the Minister said--he may correct me if I am wrong--that when people arrive in this country on Eurostar as illegal immigrants, that does not involve a penalty of any sort being imposed on anyone. 
<P>
Will that not look to the lorry drivers as if all the responsibility for the situation is being pushed on to them? They are being subjected to an extremely draconian regime, while others who have a part to play, including the Government, the port authorities and overseas Governments, are not doing their share. By allowing the designation of particular ports, the amendment would create an incentive for the relevant port authorities and countries to improve matters and do more to promote security. 
<P>
That might be a far more effective way of preventing the arrival of clandestine entrants. 
<P>
The haulage industry has taken a constructive approach to such matters. Its submissions to me and to the Committee have reflected its wish to co-operate with the authorities and the Government. Our approach should be informed by the Special Standing Committee evidence that we took. In the joint submission to the Committee, the two trade associations say: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an analysis of the key locations where immigrants are boarding vehicles (which would require co-operation between member states) should be undertaken as this would allow proper targeting of enforcement activity and advice."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a way, that is what the amendment calls for. Can the Minister say specifically what the Government are doing to facilitate such an analysis? What are they going to do to about bringing better measures into force once such an analysis has been conducted? Would not the amendment be a way of highlighting the issue and of putting at the top of the agenda the improvement of security at overseas ports. At present, it looks to the lorry drivers and all those affected as if all the responsibility for a draconian regime is being imposed on them, and that others are not doing their bit. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support amendment No. 462. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has put his finger on an important point. All the emphasis is on lorry drivers, and security at ports is very important. It is worth focusing on this issue in discussions. Our authorities should carry out a survey of points of entry. Inevitably, some points will be weaker than others. 
<P>
I, too, was struck by Mr. Dossetter's evidence to the Committee, especially about Calais, which is one of the major entry points. If we are to impose fines on lorry drivers, it is also incumbent on us to look at the points of entry and the security of ports. 
<P>
Most vehicles have one driver rather than two because of the cost and economics of road haulage. Inevitably, a driver will inspect the load, because he may have £100,000 worth or more of goods on a vehicle. But what about when drivers have to park to take documentation into customs or the authorities on the other side of the channel? What about when they go to get something to eat? They may sleep in the cab, but what if they enjoy the facilities of the local hostel? At the end of the journey, when they reach the port, security is vital. I believe that the amendment should open up the debate and provide great light to the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendment seeks to insert a qualification in the operation of the civil penalty by providing the Secretary of State with a power to specify ports of embarkation from which vehicles, ships or aircraft which travel to the United Kingdom may not be subject to the civil penalty. The Government do not seek such a power, nor would they use it. Any port which was specified under a power of this sort would have an enormous commercial advantage over competitors. That would be invidious. 
<P>
The amendment is entirely unnecessary. The regime described by the hon. Member for Hertsmere is far too complex, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department, who is replying to the debate. I have enjoyed his contributions up to now. I would like to be able to say that I enjoyed the contribution that he has just made, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will be the first to admit that he has not given me much cause for doing so. 
<P>
I felt a slight frisson of surprise when the hon. Gentleman rose to answer to the debate on the amendment. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) normally speaks on these matters; he has told us that he has been involved in discussions and has taken the lead in discussions and measures to promote better security. 
<P>
The Minister of State said that the amendment was terribly complex and that he could not accept it. I have heard that before when Ministers respond to amendments under both the present and the previous Government. Indeed, some proposals which are described as too complex have been accepted in any event. 
<P>
What I really want to know is what the Government are doing about the problem. It is no good the Government telling lorry drivers, lorry firms and hauliers that the proposal is too complex and would destroy the competitiveness of ports. Lorry drivers are interested in the competitive position of British lorry drivers, not of overseas ports. If one port was commended as being secure, would not that be competitive? It would be a desirable state of affairs. 
<P>
I was simply asking what the Government are doing about the problem. Perhaps it is my fault for not putting the question plainly enough, because I think that the Minister's reply will be disappointing for those who study our proceedings and want to see the Government doing something themselves, rather than lecturing other people. I am so disappointed by what the Minister said that I almost feel inclined to press the amendment to a vote. Although he claimed that it was terribly complex, he did not say why.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> It is possible that because the Minister represents the Lord Chancellor's Department, he was taking a rather narrow definition of the scope of the answer that he was allowed to give. We may need to return to the issus on clause stand part and find out what the Government, in partnership with neighbouring states, tare doing about ports where life is easy and there is virtually no security control over lorries before they are loaded on to ships, or on to trains for the channel tunnel crossing. that is possible that the Minister has been intimidated--quite properly--by you, Mr. Maxton. We need him to say a little more about the underlying issue, which is what my hon. Friend was talking about. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable contribution. In fact, I hope that the Home Office Minister answers the stand part debate. Perhaps we shall return to the subject in due course. In the meantime, notwithstanding my disappointment, to make progress--but for that reason and no other--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 13, line 30, after "of", insert "half of". 
<P>
The amendment concerns the extent of the penalties faced by a person responsible for the entry of clandestine entrants. Under subsection (2), a person responsible for the entry of a clandestine entrant is liable to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a penalty of the prescribed amount"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as well as to an extra penalty of the prescribed amount for 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"each person who was concealed with the clandestine person"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the transporter. 
<P>
The amendment is designed to explore certain issues arising from the provision. It would reduce by half the penalty for each additional person. We understand that the prescribed penalty will be £2,000. We have heard that figure so many times before that we believe it to be correct, but I cannot remember if or when the Minister quoted it. Will he therefore confirm the sum of £2,000? Can he also tell us whether the Secretary of State will be able to vary that sum, and if so, in what way and by what method? 
<P>
An important function of the amendment is to ascertain the rationale for making the additional penalty the same as the prescribed amount. Again we ask whether that is fair to lorry drivers. The Government appear to be saying that lorry drivers are culpable if the grounds for defence under clause 20 are not available to them because they have been negligent. 
<P>
The Minister earlier referred to lorry drivers who take bribes or who are negligent. For two reasons, I would prefer to debate the case of lorry drivers who are allegedly negligent. First, I hope that most lorry drivers are not dishonest. It is wrong and unfair to the majority of honest lorry drivers to speak of them in such terms when only a small minority are dishonest. I know that the Minister always qualified his comments, but to talk repeatedly about lorry drivers taking bribes is unfair to most lorry drivers. 
<P>
Secondly, I hope that if lorry drivers do take bribes, they are properly prosecuted before the courts. I was a little perplexed when the Minister said earlier that it was too hard to prosecute them. Issues in connection with the European convention on human rights will arise from what he said. Moreover, if a lorry driver has taken a bribe, he should be prosecuted. I heard what the Minister said about it being difficult to prove a bribe, but that would apply to every case of bribery and people are prosecuted for taking bribes, corruption and fraud. The police manage to find the evidence from time to time, and people are prosecuted and brought to justice. Some lorry drivers are prosecuted under section 25 of the Immigration Act, which I believe is the section that deals with facilitating illegal entry. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. About 130 persons were convicted of the offence last year, about 100 of whom were given custodial sentences. Therefore, it is possible to prosecute people under that section. Certainly, those who represent the lorry drivers have made it clear that they have no time for drivers who take bribes. 
<P>
Let me take the argument that lorry drivers are culpable if they do not have the defence available to them under section 20. Although we believe that that defence and the process adopted by the Government are unsatisfactory, let us say for the sake of argument that the lorry driver is culpable. The culpability of a lorry driver who has one clandestine entrant in his vehicle is just as great as the driver who has five or 10. 
<P>
I remind the Committee of the evidence of Steven Norris of the Road Haulage Association on that point. He told us: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There was a very famous case involving 100 people who were detected at Chatham. It was much talked about. I heard the Minister say that it was preposterous that any person could drive a truck with 100 people in it and not know that they were there. In fact, that was exactly the point: they were in an unaccompanied trailer, which would have been delivered to the dock by one driver, taken by a tug driver from the dock to the boat, taken by another tug driver from the boat to the dock on the disembarkation side and would then have been collected by a subsequent driver who would take it on to its destination. Those people were in an unaccompanied trailer."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee; 18 March 1999, c.413.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>I have received confirmation since then--I think that it is the same case--of a report in The Times of 5 December last year about 103 illegal migrants who hid in a 40-foot lorry. Apparently, they were so hungry that they started to eat dental cleaner. 
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that the culpability of lorry drivers is determined in that way? If so, it would be interesting to know whether the responsible person in those circumstances is the owner or the hirer. Can the Minister confirm that, under subsection (2), the responsible person would have to pay a penalty of £200,000, because he has brought in 100 clandestine entrants? 
<P>
Let me adopt that example of more than 100 illegal entrants found in a trailer and suppose that alongside the unaccompanied trailer was another unaccompanied trailer going through a similar process, as such trailers often do. Let us suppose that the same circumstances prevailed, but, by chance, a single clandestine entrant concealed himself in the second trailer. The responsible person would face a penalty of £2,000 in the second case, but £200,000 in the first. Can the Minister explain why, in a case like that, which was specifically referred to us by the Road Haulage Association, the penalties should be different? 
<P>
Can the Minister also say a little more about who is a clandestine entrant for these purposes? I think that that point has been anticipated. Does a child count as a clandestine entrant, or a baby? If so, would a baby attract a penalty of £2,000? Sad to say, there have been such entrants in recent weeks due to the great upheavals. When those happen happen, members of extended families often have to flee together. People take their babies and children, their grandparents and other relatives. 
<P>
In the context of additional penalties, we should consider both fairness for lorry drivers and the welfare of clandestine entrants. The provisions are a disincentive for lorry drivers to co-operate with the authorities, as I said on Second Reading. 
<P>
Labour Members claim that the provisions will act as such a deterrent that lorry drivers will take even greater precautions to ensure that people do not hide in their vehicles. However, lorry drivers have described the great lengths to which they already go. The provision may create a disincentive for lorry drivers to report the presence of a clandestine entrant in the vehicle. That may have adverse consequences for the health and well-being of the clandestine entrant. 
<P>
I remind the Committee of the evidence that Steve Norris gave. He said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The extraordinary proposition in the Bill is that any haulier who detects an illegal immigrant in his truck, especially once the truck has arrived in the United Kingdom, is under a massive disincentive to co-operate with the authorities. Hauliers would immediately face a completely unacceptable choice between doing their civic duty by declaring the existence of these clandestines to the police and then facing the prospect of a fine, or simply releasing them in some lay-by in the middle of nowhere. Surely that would only add to the problem, and it is why we regard the situation as unacceptable."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 412.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We should also take account of the relationship between drivers and their employers. The driver may have good intentions, but the employer may take a different view. The driver has to make an on-the-spot decision. The amendment would vary the amount of the fine and thus, perhaps, tackle such problems. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The lorry driver might feel a strong obligation to behave humanely towards the clandestine entrants, but his view of others' perception of the matter may cause problems. We run a risk of stacking up disincentives for lorry drivers, who may be put in an invidious position. The amounts of the additional penalties contribute to the problem--the greater the penalty, the greater the disincentive. There is a big difference between a £2,000 fine for an individual and a £10,000 or £15,000 fine for a family. I shall not even consider the outrageously large fines for exceptional cases of 100 people being found in a lorry. However, I stress that it is common for people to travel in extended families. 
<P>
The larger the group of clandestine entrants, the more likely it is that some of them will need help. Extended family groups will include young children, babies or elderly people. I do not need to speak at length about that.

<P>

<B>Dr Julian Lewis:</B> I thought that my hon. Friend was about to make the related point that larger groups are more likely to be detected. Therefore, the fining of carriers and traffickers for every additional member of the group that is carried will act as a disincentive against them carrying large groups. However, if they are fined a flat rate for each incident rather than fined on the basis of the number of people involved, it is more likely that illegal entrants would travel in larger groups. That would make detection much easier. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has an excellent point. in recent times, people have come to this country in a desperate state. A recent report told of a family's desperate bid to seek asylum. They had been camped out on a freezing Mountainside in Kosovo and made a gruelling journey to this country with 11 countrymen in the back of a container lorry. We are aware of such terrible circumstances, and we have seen such vivid scenes recently. In the desperate circumstances from which communities and whole minorities have to flee, it is more likely that big groups of people will come to this country. They are likely to be in need, so their claim for asylum will probably be recognised in the long run. However, that takes us back to the previous amendment. 
<P>
I am concerned about the incentives and disincentives that will be in the mind of lorry drivers. The type of clandestine entrant who is most in need of help will put a lorry driver in an invidious position. He will be under a great disincentive to report that person. In the main, lorry drivers are public-spirited people, but additional penalties of this size--and I question whether they are just--will increase the risk of clandestine entrants and their families being left in the dark in the early hours of the morning in an unfamiliar country. They may be left in an isolated spot when they are hungry, tired, frightened and desperate. When they are most in need of help, lorry 761 762 drivers will face the greatest disincentive to report their presence and obtain help for them. 
<P>
Even more dangerous scenarios may face clandestine entrants, given the size of the penalties. When we are put in an invidious position and have to make a difficult choice, we all have an instinct--I admit that I do--to ignore the problem, hoping that it will go away and become someone else's responsibility. The size of the penalties will not invite lorry drivers to face up to their responsibilities. The moment that they declare the presence of clandestine entrants in their vehicles, they line up for a potentially huge fine on either themselves or their firm. As we shall soon see, they will find it extremely difficult to escape liability. The penalties will be a big disincentive, so we need answers from the Minister. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I shall briefly support my hon. Friend's probing amendment. When he began his speech, I was not sure what line he would take. However, he has made important points and I too wanted to refer to the episode mentioned by Mr. Norris in column 413 of our fourth sitting. He described the incident at Chatham, which we read about in the newspapers, when 100 people were found in the back of a container that had been driven by different drivers at the various stages of its journey. Who would have had liability for that load? 
<P>
The Government want to heap additional penalties on the unwitting drivers of vehicles carrying illegal immigrants. I echo the staunch defence of the vast majority of drivers by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. They are not dishonest, or trying to defraud or take bribes. Once or twice in our debate the Minister came perilously close to tarnishing all drivers and others in the industry as being rotten apples. The truth--although we have no hard evidence--is that only a few are dishonest and the Bill seeks to dissuade them. 
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend that heaping additional penalties on drivers who unwittingly carry people in their lorries will do nothing to add to the disincentive, but merely add insult to the injury of the original penalty. 
<P>
My hon. Friend asked the Minister to confirm that the sum payable would be £2,000 per illegal immigrant. Earlier, he said that that was the intended amount but, in the same speech, he said that the going rate for taking in illegal immigrants was £2,000. Is there any correlation between the two figures? Why has £2,000 been picked as a suitable penalty? Is it a pro rata penalty for the profits made by drivers who really take bribes? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 18(2) provides for those persons who are responsible for a clandestine entrant as defined in subsection (1) to be liable for the civil penalty. Subsection (2)(a) provides for the responsible person or persons to be liable to a penalty of the prescribed amount in respect of the clandestine entrant. We expect the prescribed amount to be £2,000 at the outset. 
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) covers circumstances in which more than one clandestine is found in the same vehicle, ship or aircraft, providing for an additional penalty of the same prescribed amount to be payable in respect of each additional clandestine entrant. Thus, if three clandestine entrants are found, the civil penalty will be three times £2,000, which is £6,000. The effect of the amendment would be that the civil penalty imposed when only one clandestine is transported would be the prescribed amount--£2,000, the carriers' liability rate--but the additional penalty under subsection (2)(b) for further clandestines would be only half the prescribed amount. In the case of my example of three clandestines found in a lorry, the amount of the civil penalty would be only £4,000, composed of £2,000 for the first clandestine and £1,000 each for the others. The amendment would considerably reduce the deterrent effect of the civil penalty and undermine our proposals for tough immigration controls. There would be less incentive for owners, operators and drivers of vehicles to operate proper security arrangements. In the case of drivers, owners or operators who might be susceptible to bribery, reducing the penalty that they might face if caught would act as an incentive to accept inducements. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, I will not. 
<P>
Clandestine illegal entry into the United Kingdom is a considerable problem, which the civil penalty is intended to assist in combating. The amendment would reduce the effectiveness of the civil penalty and I urge the Committee to reject this further attempt by the Conservative party to undermine Government immigration controls. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I am not sure that the Minister spoke with much enthusiasm or conviction. Were the Opposition to have suggested that the amount should be doubled to £4,000, the Minister might have said that it was larger than he had in mind. Using his argument, the penalty would work better if the amount was £4,000 and even better if it was £8,000, £16,000, £32,000, £64,000 or £128,000. The Minister made a formula speech--perhaps, because it is past midnight, he is losing enthusiasm for the debate. Where in the provision is there a power to set the penalty and say whether it must be applied in every case and whether it would be possible for a Minister to have discretion--if, for example, 16 people were found in a vehicle--to say that some, but not all, of them could face a charge? Is there any discretion at all? 
<P>
If the Minister decides that the penalties should be changed in the way that the amendment suggests, what type of legislation would be needed? Would it be primary or secondary legislation, or could the penalty be imposed at the Minister's discretion? Other issues arise, but it would be helpful if the Minister confirmed that he has listened to the debate instead of merely failing to respond to the proposal in the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister intends to respond, he owes the Committee an explanation on those points because they are the same as those that I asked him. I asked where the power to vary the penalty was and how he would go about varying it, but he did not touch on that in his reply. Those are not outlandish questions; they are fairly usual. I hope that he will now answer them. People who were to be subject to a regime such as this would wish to know whether it was possible to vary it and how a variation would be brought about, and would want to know the circumstances in which that would happen, but so far we have not even got as far as finding out where the power is. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall the Minister earlier in the day mentioning the £2,000 that I believe he said was the going rate for lorry drivers who were bribed to bring over illegal immigrants, as compared to the £2,000 that appears to be sum of the penalty? Given the Minister's reluctance to comment on the issue himself, would my hon. Friend like to speculate on whether the two might be linked? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has touched on an important point. I asked the Minister about that in my opening remarks. As we are setting a penalty it is not unreasonable to ask how much it will be; indeed, it is a fairly obvious question to ask. I did not ask for a long exposition, merely confirmation from the Minister that the penalty would be £2,000. If he remains silent when we ask such questions he will make the Committee's job that much more difficult. It is difficult enough already because we do not have the code of practice before us. 
<P>
The Minister's standard reply that all this is part of a regime designed to deter people from carrying clandestine entrants in their vehicles will not do as an answer to the point about culpability. A lorry driver who leaves his vehicle unguarded, or with a hole in it, thus making it in some way vulnerable to clandestine entrants, is surely culpable, whether one person, 10 people or 100 people get into it. The system of penalties is draconian and outlandish. 
<P>
I regret that the Minister shows no willingness to intervene to respond even briefly. I am very unhappy with his approach. I remain concerned about the issue and in the circumstances I intend to press the amendment to a vote.

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Before we get to the end of the debate may I repeat that the Minister has been asked by two members of the Committee--admittedly neither was a Labour Member--to point to where in the Bill the provision for setting the penalty is written. It may be fairly obvious, but I have not found it yet. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend may wish to be reminded of another question from my original speech that the Minister did not answer: does a child count as a clandestine entrant? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I assume that the hon. Member for Hertsmere was intervening on the speech of the Member for Worthing, West. It is usual for the hon. Member on whom another hon. Member intervenes to respond to that intervention before taking another. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would answer those two questions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A baby would be treated in exactly the same way as any other clandestine entrant and would incur the same penalty, which would be set by regulation. If the hon. Gentleman cares to read clause 135 on page 84 of the Bill, he will see that provision. There is a discretion not to demand a penalty; there is no duty on any person to collect a penalty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Clause 135 on page 84 refers to interpretation of the 1971 Act. Will the Minister remind us what clause he was talking about? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was talking about clause 135.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is a reference to the charge, it must be spelt out more clearly. Committee members may have enjoyed the Minister trying to find the answer, but it would have been better if the parliamentary draftsman had made clear that "prescribed" refers to the charge in clause 18. The Minister's response was not as full or--to be gentle--as courteous as it could and should have been. 
<P>
If the Minister is saying that the Secretary of State has discretion about imposing the charge, will he clarify whether the Secretary of State has discretion to levy part of the charge, the full charge or no charge at all?

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am interested in the answer to that question. I do not think that a great deal of time or endeavour is required to give answers. We will be left with a mystery if the Minister does not provide an answer. "Prescribed" is the only word in clause 135 that might refer to clause 18. However, the clause merely states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no regulation-making power in clause 18, which does not mention the word "prescribed". The Minister could easily lay the matter to rest if he told us which part of clause 18 specifies such power. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 18(2)(a). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> In that case-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. With all due respect, Mr. Bottomley, the hon. Member for Hertsmere has the Committee's ear. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have arrived by a roundabout route. It would have been easier if the Minister had told us at the beginning that "prescribed" refers to clause 135. We might have saved time if the Minister had been more succinct. I am still unhappy with his answers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> "Offence" is too strong a word to use, but the discourtesy to the Committee is compounded by the explanatory notes, page 54 of which explains what clauses 132 and 133 do, before moving on to consequential amendments to schedule 12. 
<P>
The person on the Clapham omnibus would not have a clue about the measures that the Government are allowing to go through. The Government should revise clause 135 so that the prescribed amount or penalty is spelt out. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor's Department seems to have strong views on that matter: perhaps the Lord Chancellor is responsible for the drafting of clause 135. A point is made by the fact that the matter is omitted from the explanatory notes and by the time taken by the Minister to give a straight answer to the straight questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and I have asked. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is 12.30 at night, and the hon. Gentleman is obviously getting a little tetchy. It is wrong of him to attack the Parliamentary draftsman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The drafting, not the draftsman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Those who drafted the measure did the best that they could. The matter is straightforward. The hon. Gentleman can work out precisely what is going on if he examines clause 135, clause 18(2)(a) and clause 134(1). It does not take a genius to do that, and if the hon. Gentleman does it perhaps he would not attack those who drafted the clause, who are very experienced and probably have more knowledge than he does. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister is not altogether with it. I did not attack parliamentary draftsmen, but suggested that he could have given a direct answer to the direct question from my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere the first time that it was asked. The Minister could have given a direct reply the second time that it was asked. He eventually said that the answer was in clause 135, so let me follow that up and ask him another clear question. Does the word "prescribed" apply to anything other than the amount referred to in clause 18--yes or no? 
<P>
The Minister is not responding because he does not know or does not care to provide the answer. He is clearly ducking a straightforward question: does "prescribed" apply only to the amount prescribed in this clause or is it used in any of the other 134 clauses? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that a prescribed amount is an amount prescribed in regulations. I have already pointed to the relevant clauses, and the hon. Gentleman must be able to read them. He knows that the prescribed amount will be set, in due course, by secondary legislation. The amount could be set at £2,000 or at a different level. We propose the same amount as the CLA--£2,000. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister was asked a specific question. Does the word "prescribed" refer to anything other than the prescribed amount? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is taking the debate too far into clause 135 at this time. The debate has gone too wide of the specific amendment before us. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. We are debating whether the word "half" should be added between "of" and "that" in line 30. That is a proposed alteration to the additional penalty to the precribed amount. The word "prescribed" is therefore implicit in paragraphs (a) and (b) of of subsection (2). Asking the Minister whether he has the power to prescribe more than one amount necessarily requires a passing reference to "prescribed". I accept, however, that asking whether it applies to anything other than the amount in the clause is a matter for a clause stand part debate. 
<P>
The question whether the Minister has the power to set more than one prescribed amount relates directly to the amendment. If he were to say that the drafting of another clause prohibited him from setting a different or second prescribed amount, he would be accepting his responsibility for drafting his own Bill. We should ask whether the Minister is capable-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is now making a speech rather than raising a point of order. The Minister's replies are entirely a matter for the Minister and nothing to do with me. The hon. Member was straying from the amendment and was discussing another clause, which he will have a proper opportunity to debate at the appropriate time. I now ask that we return to the debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister's answer is unsatisfactory to Opposition Members. He is a greater optimist than I imagined if he thinks that the work of parliamentary draftsmen on a Bill such as this is immediately understandable--even for the average Member of Parliament, let alone the man on the Clapham omnibus. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Or the Minister. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will say the Minister with respect to myself because I did not always understand Bills, but I had better not say it for this Minister, who may have a better grasp of them than I did. However, I wish to press for a Division. 
<P>

</FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 13, line 31, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) A person is only liable to a penalty where the Secretary of State is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that a penalty may be imposed under this section.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment, which has been suggested by, among others who have given evidence, the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. It recommends: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the clause clearly specify the standard of proof to be applied and that the standard be the criminal standard of proof".
<P>
</UL></FONT>Here we move from the issue of fairness to lorry drivers to that of objective standards of justice and human rights compliance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury pointed out, these provisions have attracted concern, not just from those involved in the road haulage industry, but from those who have studied the matter independently from the human rights point of view. 
<P>
As the Bill stands, a responsible person--a person allegedly responsible for the entry of a clandestine entrant--is held liable by the Secretary of State and has a defence if he can show that all the conditions in clause 20(3) apply. However, the Bill is silent as to the standard of proof that the Secretary of State must apply in determining any issue that might arise in respect of liability for a penalty as a responsible person. 
<P>
Let me describe a possible scenario. What happens at a port when a clandestine entrant is found by the port authorities and claims asylum? There are two lorries in the part of the port in which he is found. His English may be poor or non-existent, so it will not be easy to establish from him what happened. Although it appears likely that he arrived in lorry A, he may have arrived in lorry B. 
<P>
Will the Minister from the Lord Chancellor's Department apply his legal expertise to these matters and tell us what happens in such a situation? Will the owner, hirer or driver of lorry A be made a responsible person when it appears likely that the clandestine entrant arrived in his vehicle? What will be the standard of proof? What will happen when it appears likely that a clandestine entrant arrived in one lorry but he could have arrived in another? 
<P>
There are other examples, and we need to explore whether the criminal standard of proof should apply in these circumstances. The Minister of State, who was assiduous in attending our sittings, will be aware of the evidence of Justice, which criticised the Bill for its lack of provision for due process. 
<P>
In the explanatory notes, the Government describe it as "a civil penalty", and the Minister may tell us that a safeguard of the criminal standard of proof is not appropriate in these circumstances. I am anticipating the Minister's reasoning. However, in the note provided to Justice by Ben Emmerson and Jessica Simor, doubt is cast on the Government's approach. Those lawyers consider that the penalties raise serious issues under article 6 of the European convention on human rights, the right to a fair trial, as well as under the first protocol, the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. 
<P>
With regard to the amendment and the appropriateness of the criminal standard, Justice says that a penalty can relate to a criminal charge for European convention on human rights purposes even if it is defined as a civil penalty in domestic law. Intuitively that seems right, and it is good to see the legal experts confirm intuition. It surely does not matter what label the state chooses to pin to a penalty; it is the nature and character of the charge that matter. In the view of Justice, clause 18 is obviously designed to have a deterrent effect and to be punitive rather than to be pecuniary compensation for damage. 
<P>
Justice would have been confirmed in that opinion if it had heard the Minister speak earlier this evening, because he said the same thing. He has not maintained for a moment that this was purely a form of civil compensation. He has told us time and again that it is intended to be a deterrent penalty. 
<P>
Justice refers to the case of Ozturk v. Germany in support of its argument. It says that this case should be read in connection with section 25 of the 1971 Act, which, as the Committee will know by now, creates the criminal offence of intentionally assisting illegal entrants. The gist of Justice's argument, which hon. Members will find in the analysis of human rights compliance in the Justice memorandum, is that the provisions introducing a new form of carrier's liability in the clause are alternative charges in respect of the existing section 25 criminal offence. Therefore, it follows that the normal safeguards of criminal law should also apply, which would include the criminal standard of proof required by the amendment. As Emmerson and Simor said, clauses 18 to 23 may be used to penalise individuals for conduct that also falls within the criminal sphere, thus frustrating the purpose of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. 
<P>
In 1997, there were 130 convictions for knowingly facilitating the entry of an illegal entrant. Because the matter is treated seriously by the courts more than 100 of those resulted in the imposition of a custodial sentence, and I think that a maximum sentence of seven years can be imposed. Therefore, we are talking about what is, rightly, a serious criminal penalty, because to facilitate any entry of an illegal entrant is a serious matter. As we have heard repeatedly, it is bound up with the illegal and unsavoury activities of gangs on the continent. 
<P>
Justice takes the view that this penalty could be an alternative to a criminal charge, which brings it within the ambit of criminal liability. It is, or could be, regarded as a criminal penalty rather than as a civil penalty, and therefore the criminal standard of proof should apply. 
<P>
Another major and obvious problem arises with regard to proper legal process. We have not touched on it yet, but I must include it here in the context of the available safeguards, although we shall refer to it later in more detail. Under the Bill the Secretary of State acts as a court, because such judicial functions as there are in the Bill are carried out by the Secretary of State. I do not need to address the Minister at length on this point, but it is a fundamental protection of the internationally recognised criminal process that criminal charges should be dealt with by a court, not by an executive arm of the state. 
<P>
The Government, and probably the Minister, will contend that this is a civil penalty, but, as I hope that I have demonstrated reasonably succinctly, the learned lawyers who looked at this matter on behalf of Justice consider that the provisions of article 6 of the European convention on human rights in relation to the determination of civil obligations are not fulfilled. Article 6 requires individuals to have recourse to a court where there is a dispute as to such obligations. Therefore, even if the Government are right to maintain that it is a civil penalty--what I have said thus far is on the basis that it could be a criminal penalty and that criminal safeguards should be available--in the eyes of Justice it 769 770 still falls short of the internationally recognised requirements of justice for civil penalties. 
<P>
That is the gist of amendment No. 217. I look forward to the Minister's response. I hope that he will clarify the standard of proof that the Secretary of State will apply, and answer the critique developed by Justice, because it is important, where a question about compliance with the European convention on human rights arises, to have the debate now rather that to risk a breach of human rights and all the court proceedings that would follow as a result of finding liability. The amendment covers what Justice sees as one of the requirements of the convention. It is better to debate the matter now and make the Bill as compliant with the convention as possible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to support amendment No. 217, to which I have added my name. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, in particular in regard to section 25(1) of the 1971 Act. Our fear is that there may be an abandonment of prosecutions under that section in favour of using the penalties in the Bill, if they are deemed to make it easier to bring a successful case. Where people are engaged in criminal racketeering, we want them to be prosecuted under section 25(1) as criminals. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I may not have developd that point sufficiently, and I wanted to make the same point. Those who engage in such activity should be prosecuted and should face the rigours of the penalty that exists in criminal law--imprisonment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. I have two points to make. First, people should be treated as criminals if they are engaged in a criminal activity. Secondly, as the hon. Gentleman says, the penalties are much more rigorous, with the possibility of imprisonment for up to seven years. The other specific point relates to possible consequences, which must make us wary. As the hon. Gentleman said when we debated a previous set of amendments, they could be quite severe. 
<P>
If a number of illegal entrants are found on a vehicle, obviously that will threaten a person's livelihood. Where a fine of £2,000 is imposed in other areas of criminal law--let alone a fine of £10,000 or, in extreme cases, £200,000--it is often for quite a serious offence in criminal terms. Therefore, the consequences are severe. We want a case to be brought in such a way that we can be certain that it has been correctly brought, so it is important to test the standard of proof in that respect. 
<P>
If a case with consequences of such magnitude were brought on the basis of the balance of probabilities, that would cause major concern. We could expect it to be challenged under the provisions on due process in the European convention on human rights. If carriers risk going out of business and face considerable penalties, we can expect them to challenge the provision in law. Such a challenge may bring about the changes proposed in the amendment, but the Government should now spell out the seriousness with which they treat due process. They should not wait for the messy process of testing the provisions under the Human Rights Act 1998, which may find them wanting. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The aim of amendment No. 217 is to impose on the Secretary of State a requirement that he satisfies beyond reasonable doubt that a civil penalty may be imposed. I refer to the example cited by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. It is clear that if the Secretary of State, who will have to prove liability for civil penalty to a civil standard, could not satisfy himself which of the two lorries was responsible for carrying clandestine entrants, he would not have satisfied the civil standard of proof. 
<P>
The civil penalty will be largely based on objective, verifiable facts. It will be based on the presence of a person or persons, the circumstances of their arrival, or attempt to arrive, in the United Kingdom and their actions in either seeking asylum or evading immigration control. 
<P>
We consulted the transport industries when preparing the Bill and listened to their concerns about the difficult circumstances in which lorry drivers and others in the transport industry sometimes operate. Therefore the Bill provides a carefully structured system of defences, which will be underpinned by a code a practice. In addition, clause 21 provides for the notice of imposition of a civil penalty to include the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding liability for the penalty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall give way when I have finished my point. 
<P>
Clause 21 also provides for a system under which notice of objections to a penalty must be given and considered by the Secretary of State. When a transporter is detained, clause 23 contains a provision for the courts to intervene when necessary. Of course, it is open to the person on whom the penalty is served to pursue his objections to the penalty in the civil court by refusing to pay. 
<P>
The Bill contains a significant structure of safeguards to ensure that civil penalties are imposed only after proper evaluation of all the relevant circumstances and with routes of challenge and appeal available to the person involved. The amendment is unnecessary to protect the interests of the person or persons on whom a penalty might be imposed. 
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the arguments made about the European convention. I draw the Committee's attention to the certification that appears on the front of the Bill, which makes it clear that the Government are entirely satisfied that all aspects of the Bill conform with the European convention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to ask the Minister an unfair question, but he mentioned discussions with the road haulage industry. I do not know whether he was involved in them, but they have not appeared from the outside to be the smooth discussions that they have been characterised to be. Has this provision been discussed with the road haulage industry and has it approved it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I said that we have consulted the industry throughout our preparations for the Bill. The discussions were amicable, but not every point made by the industry was accepted. However, we listened to what it said. 771 772 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is an appropriate point to suspend the Committee for 20 minutes. I shall resume the Chair at 1.20 am. 
<P>
<H5>1 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
