<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move 
amendment No. 26, in page 4, line 10, after `(1)', insert 
`Subject to subsection (7) below,'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> We are starting today with the first of the 
Liberal Democrat amendments. I promised, at the start of 
the sitting, that we would introduce some probing 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): On a 
point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise to the hon. 
Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) for interrupting, but 
some members of the public have now arrived and it 
seems unreasonable and unfair to place them at the end 
of such a vast Room, as they will have difficulty in 
following the proceedings. That is not how Parliament 
should treat the people who send us here. Would it be 
possible to ask the Serjeant at Arms to produce the rope 
that he produced at an earlier sitting, so that the Bar can 
be moved closer to the Committee? That would allow the 
public to move forward.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot disrupt our 
proceedings now, but inquiries will be made about an 
alteration for our sitting this afternoon. Meanwhile, if 
honourable Members keep their voices raised they will be 
heard in all parts of the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I shall ensure that my voice is heard even 
in the far corners of the Room.
<P>
Clause 4 deals with the inspection that may be required 
of the premises of firms that are, or should be, setting up 
pension schemes. That was discussed at our previous 
sitting, and concern has been expressed on both sides of 
the Committee about the level of expenditure that may be 
needed for businesses particularly small businesses to 
comply with the terms of the provision. We have tabled 
our first probing amendment to ask the Government to 
discuss in greater detail the exposure to cost that 
businesses may face as a result of the inspections.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 in my name and that of 
my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) 
are closely linked. I feel no need to speak to them 
separately, so I shall discuss them together. They are 
probing amendments and if they receive a satisfactory 
response from the Minister I shall ask the Committee for 
permission to withdraw amendment No. 26. I want to 
know how the Government expect the inspectorate to 
work, what difficulties they expect businesses to face as 
a result of the inspections, what costs those businesses 
will face, and how they may best be able to reduce the 
necessary expenditure.
<P>
There is considerable worry that, if the inspections are 
draconian, they may prove over-burdensome to the 
businesses concerned. We do not want that to happen. 
However, what often happens in such cases is that the 
inspection powers may initially be over-burdensome 
while the inspectors are finding out how best to carry out 
their inspections, what action they need to take, and how 
long they need to spend on the inspections. For that 
reason, we propose that the Government should consider a 
review of the inspection powers after a year, and annually 
thereafter. The Government would thus have the 
opportunity to assess whether the inspection powers are 
causing problems for businesses, whether all the powers 
that inspectors are given are necessary, and whether those 
powers are being used in a way that causes unnecessary 
problems. An annual review would give us the 
opportunity to assess regularly how the powers are being 
used and whether we could relieve businesses of some of 
the unnecessary burdens that they might otherwise face.
<P>
The Government should explain in greater detail how 
they expect the inspections to be carried out, what sort of 
burdens they expect to impose on businesses and how 
those burdens could best be reduced. Do they accept that 
the inspectors' powers should be reviewed annually?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I shall speak to the amendments 
that stand in my name and the names of my colleagues 
amendments Nos. 15 and 33.
<P>
We have previously discussed the additional and in 
some cases gratuitous burdens that stakeholder pensions 
will place on employers. In that connection, I made a 
strong case that was not refuted by the Government. There 
is a danger that the need for small employers to provide 
a stakeholder pension may be a disincentive to taking on 
their first few employees, which would be a perverse and 
sad consequence. The Government gave an assurance that 
the regulations that they will make under powers that are 
contained in the Bill will establish a threshold relating to the number of employees below which the obligation to provide a stakeholder pension will not apply. I greatly 
welcome that valuable concession.
<P>
I return to the specialised burden on employers of 
inspections, which are contained in clause 4. We all know 
that we currently have an extremely interfering, nannying 
and over-regulating Government. Businesses in my 
constituency increasingly complain about that. Although 
they complained about the burden of excessive 
Government regulation under the previous Administration, 
they all say that a bad situation has become a great deal 
worse over the past two years, and that they do not want it 
to go on. One of the many burdens faced by employers is 
that of inspections that are carried out by bureaucrats 
operating on behalf of central or local government, or on 
behalf of one of the agencies. The Inland Revenue the 
Contributions Agency, and Customs and Excise have the 
power to carry out inspections, and they regularly do so. 
Traditionally, Customs and Excise have extremely 
intrusive powers to search without a warrant, which is a 
power to which they are very attached. Those inspections 
cause great problems for businesses they hold up their 
operation and take up the management's time. Businesses 
are also increasingly at the mercy of other forms of 
inspection, such as those made by health and safety and 
environmental inspectors. A vast number of people in this 
country earn their living by inspecting others, not by 
contributing to the gross domestic product. The nanny state 
is built by stealth. It is much easier to bring forward new 
ideas for regulation than it is to take a stand against creeping 
bureaucracy and regulation. We live in an over-regulated 
society.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is almost 
making a clause stand part speech. This is a very narrow 
amendment and I should be grateful if he would stay 
within its confines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The object of the two amendments is to 
place some restrictions, and therefore some discipline, on 
inspections. There are circumstances in which the 
financial services regulators whether they be the 
Financial Services Authority or the Occupational Pensions 
Regulatory Authority will need to inspect businesses, 
but the bureaucracy should not indulge in vast 
empire-building. The job of its teams of inspectors is 
simply to inspect: it is not their job to disrupt the 
operations of people who are conducting their business 
correctly and reasonably, and about whom there is no 
suspicion of wrongdoing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): Does the hon. 
Gentleman agree that a good company, which is putting 
in place good practice, would welcome an inspection 
process? It would be encouraged that the bad practice of 
some of its competitors was being inspected in a proper 
and robust way. Surely the Government's suggestion 
should be welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is 
important that those who are not conducting their business 
properly and about whom there is some suspicion about the integrity or efficiency of their pension arrangements should be open to inspection. If the hon. Gentleman does 
me the compliment of reading amendment No. 33, he will 
see that it would ensure that people who are the subject 
of inspections are people about whom there is reasonable 
suspicion that things are not as they should be or that 
the employer concerned has behaved unreasonably by not 
answering written inquiries.
<P>
The object of the two amendments is to establish that 
if undue costs are imposed on employers by virtue of the 
inspection, the regulator will have to meet those costs. 
Clearly, as a matter of common law, the regulator would 
not have to meet those costs if he discovered that an abuse 
was taking place. But if a burden is placed on an innocent 
business for no good reason, the regulator should pay, 
which is the purpose of amendment No. 15.
<P>
When inspectors visit premises and delay matters or 
make unreasonable demands for example, by involving 
actuaries or accountants which cause a firm to run up 
expenses, and then discover that there is nothing wrong 
with the way in which the firm has been running its 
stakeholder pension scheme, the regulator would be held 
to account. All bureaucracies have their own budgets 
within which their employees are supposed to stay. A real 
sanction would be to make the regulatory body aware that 
undue costs that are imposed on an innocent employer 
would be to the account of the regulator. To avoid de 
minimis issues, amendment No. 15 provides for a cost of 
more than £100 to fall on the regulator.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 is even more important. It goes to 
the heart of the rationale of the inspections. Clause 4 is 
widely drafted by a bureaucrat who wants to give himself 
and his colleagues the widest possible scope for carrying 
out inspections of everyone at all times and for any 
particular purpose, and to go on a fishing expedition, 
which will, no doubt, incur expenses. That is not good 
enough. It is elementary that an inspection should not take 
place unless there are grounds for it. If an inspector wants 
to find out whether a pension scheme is being run 
properly, he should first write a letter and ask questions, 
to which the employer should respond within 30 days. 
Failure to do so would be unreasonable and, in such a 
circumstance, amendment No. 33 would enable inspection 
to take place. If unsatisfactory answers were given or if, 
through other means, prima facie evidence of abuse came 
to light, inspection could then take place regardless of the 
30-day limit.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clearly, in the event of serious misbehaviour, the 
regulator must be empowered to carry out a dawn raid to 
seize evidence and he would retain that power under the 
amendment. In such a circumstance, it would be a 
complete defence for the regulator to plead that the 
inspection was conducted on the basis of prima facie 
evidence held in good faith.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am listening to the 
hon. Gentleman's thesis. Is he saying that inspections 
should take place only after an apparent misdeed has been 
committed? Would not it be sensible instead to carry out 
inspections to prevent the committing of misdeeds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We should be grateful to the hon. Lady 
for one of the most revealing interventions so far. She 
spoke from the heart and put forward in a few lucid 
sentences the new Labour philosophy of the nanny state, 
which argues that to prevent someone doing something 
wrong on a particular day, the whole country should be 
subject to regular inspection by bureaucrats. Clearly, she 
believes that the Government should run a kindergarten 
state, although I doubt whether even kindergartens are run 
in that way. When one thinks about it 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was an interesting 
diversion, which I allowed to continue for a moment or 
two. We must now return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was responding to the broad point, 
Mr. Malins. I leave it to your imagination and the 
imaginations of Committee members as to how that 
principle would work. In every walk of life, honest and 
honourable people going about their daily business would 
be inspected to prevent their doing something wrong. 
I shall move on, but there was something distinctly 
Orwellian about the intervention by the hon. Member for 
Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). I recognise that Labour 
Committee members are sincere democrats who do not 
want an horrific, totalitarian state 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that all Committee 
members are democrats. We must stay within the terms 
of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Member for Colne Caley has in 
any case made my point. We must prune in the bud the 
tendencies that she expressed so graphically. We must 
ensure that powers of inspection are not abused or used 
excessively onerously. Such powers should be the 
exception not the rule, and should be held in reserve. They 
should be used only when exceptional interventions are 
warranted. Inspectors should not look over the shoulders 
of every honest working man and woman in the hope 
I am almost inclined to say that they can spot mistakes 
and claim credit for their correction.
<P>
The amendment would define more sharply the powers 
that the clause will grant to inspectors. First, those who 
conduct inspections without reasonable grounds and who 
impose burdens and costs on the inspected, would have to 
pay. That is a useful principle that could be widely applied 
elsewhere. Secondly, there must be prima facie evidence 
of abuse or unreasonable behaviour and/or failure to 
answer questions in writing, and the inspection must be 
the second or third stage, not the first stage, as it appears 
to be in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I can understand 
why the Government felt that the clause was necessary. 
There must be comeback to force employers who are not 
prepared to fulfil their statutory duties to do so, whether 
we agree with those duties or not.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 tabled by our Liberal 
Democrat colleagues and amendment No. 33 in the name 
of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford (Mr. Davies) are sensible because they give the 
Secretary of State flexibility to keep the powers under 
review. Amendment No. 33 in particular is a fall-back 
position. It is common ground between both sides of the 
Committee that we do not want to impose undue burdens 
on business. Therefore, an inspection should take place 
only when an employer has failed, as the amendment says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within 30 days to give satisfactory responses to written enquiries"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will say that it is not a new 
power. In the light of the amendments, what is contained 
in similar legislation? I look up the explanatory notes that 
the Government have helpfully provided and I see that 
under section 99 of the Pensions Act 1995, OPRA is given 
power to inspect documents. Is that power on all fours 
with the power in the clause? Is it a similar sort of 
regulatory burden?
<P>
The clause involves a major new undertaking for a 
small employer. Given the Government's majority, clearly 
they will have their will and the clause will stand part of 
the Bill. How does the Minister see it operating on the 
ground with small employers? They already have to cope 
with the increased burden of the working families tax 
credit and, as they have always done, with national 
insurance contributions and the minimum wage. Whatever 
one's views on the minimum wage, one could argue that 
those duties are relatively simple for the employer to 
cope with.
<P>
If we go back to clause 3 for an explanation of 
employer's duties, the explanatory notes, for which again 
I am grateful, say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the employer must allow the scheme `reasonable access' to the 
relevant employees...What is `reasonable' is likely to vary 
according to the nature and size of the employer's business, but this 
could involve the holding of workplace meetings or the distribution 
of information through pay packets."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why I am worried about the provision and why I 
think that we need further information from the Minister 
ron how he thinks a very small employer will be able to 
cope with a burden of that sort.
<P>
In my constituency very few employers employ more 
than 50 or 100 people, apart from the public sector. The 
majority employ perhaps half a dozen people, or even 
fewer. Employers will not merely have to comply with 
the clause, which may include visits to their premises 
when they have apparently done nothing wrong. 
Amendment No. 33 is relevant here, because it will lock 
into place only when the employer has been unreasonable 
in complying with his statutory duties. To avoid the threat 
that the authorities can come in and look at all the 
employer's documentation, a very small employer a 
small farmer, for instance will apparently have to have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"workplace meetings or the distribution of information through 
pay packets."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Then, according to the explanatory note on subsection (5),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the employer must deduct the employee's contributions from his 
wages and pay them to the chosen scheme".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To be fair, the Minister makes it clear in the explanatory 
notes that the intention is to strike a balance between the 
cost to the employer and flexibility to the member. There 
is also a regulation-making power to prescribe restrictions 
on that requirement. If the Minister is telling us that that 
does not place an undue burden on business, this may be 
an opportunity for him to explain to the Committee why 
he thinks that my honourable Friend's amendment is 
unnecessary, and that authorities will not climb over 
employers and their documentation and go through their 
filing systems. As is set out in clause 3 (5) and in the 
explanatory notes, the Minister will have a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"regulation-making power to prescribe restrictions on this 
requirement."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says in the explanatory notes that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There will be consultation, for example, on the establishment of 
a clearing house to receive contributions. If a clearing house were 
established, this power could be used to enable employers to pass 
contributions to it rather than direct to schemes"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister thinks that the amendments are 
unnecessary, it is incumbent on him to explain to the 
Committee exactly how the clearing house will be used 
to help very small employers to cope with the regulatory 
burdens that are undoubtedly being imposed on them.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> First, may I welcome you back to presiding over our proceedings this morning, Mr. 
Malins, in this rather splendid Committee Room?
<P>
At the outset, I should respond to a couple of points 
made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. 
The Government are committed to lifting the burdens on 
business, many of which were imposed by the previous 
Administration. It is ironic that, only two or three weeks 
ago, we were in this Committee Room debating the 
proposed transfer of the Contributions Agency from the 
Department of Social Security to the Inland Revenue. As 
the shadow Chancellor rightly said, that is a significant 
step towards reducing the burdens on business. He 
opposed that significant deregulatory move. Fortunately, 
the Opposition were unsuccessful on that occasion and 
that Bill has now received Royal Assent. The Government 
have a very good record in that regard.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that I had given a 
commitment during our previous sitting to incorporate an 
exclusion for employers from the access requirements to 
stakeholder pensions based on the number of employees. 
I did not actually say that. I said that we would seek to 
minimise the impact on business of that requirement. At 
column 193, I made the point that the case for excluding 
very small employers with one or two employees is a 
great deal stronger than the case that he advanced for 
excluding those with nine employees. I said that the issue 
would be resolved through further consultation, but I do 
not want to give him or the Committee the impression 
that I went further than that in my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This is a serious matter because it 
goes to the heart of how our proceedings ought to be 
conducted. When the Minister made the remarks to which 
he has just referred, I assumed that the Government 
accepted the principle that there should be some exclusion. 
However, his remarks made it clear that the Government 
had not decided when that exclusion should apply to 
employers with two, four or six employees. We cannot 
proceed on the basis that the Government say that but do 
not mean it at all. Those remarks have no meaning if the 
Government do not propose to use regulations to provide an 
exclusion for employers with a very small number of 
employees. I shall be extraordinarily disappointed if the 
Government do not provide for that, and will feel 
short-changed if the regulations do not reflect our clear 
understanding of what the Minister said at the previous 
sitting.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can only refer the hon. Gentleman to 
what I said in the previous sitting. At column 193, I made 
the point that the case for an organisation employing one 
person is much stronger than that for an organisation 
employing nine people. The question of where the barrier 
should fall will be resolved by consultation. I understand 
that the Government were not committed to where the 
barrier should fall, but that they were committed to having 
a barrier. The sentence that the Minister read out clarifies 
the matter for the whole Committee there can be no 
other interpretation of it than that the principle of the 
barrier has been accepted. We are simply arguing about 
where the barrier should fall.
<P>
I am reminded of Bernard Shaw and the actress. The 
principle has been conceded; it is now a question of 
degree. That is how the matter was left, and I hope that 
the hon. gentleman will not undermine the atmosphere of 
mutual trust that exists in this Committee by telling us 
retrospectively that his remarks should not be interpreted 
in accordance with the normal use of the English 
language.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am happy to reaffirm what I said. 
I simply want to ensure that hon. Members do not read 
more into what I said than was there to be inferred. The 
matter will be resolved in the consultation process.
<P>
I want to respond to all three of the speeches that were 
made on the four amendments together, as they all related 
to OPRA's powers to investigate compliance. I shall begin 
by explaining why we need the provisions that are set out 
in clause 4. We need them to underpin the obligations on 
employers to provide access to the stakeholder pension 
schemes under the previous clause. The requirements will 
significantly improve access to second pensions and will 
help stakeholder pension schemes to deliver better value 
than most currently available personal pensions. They 
therefore form a key element of our proposals for 
encouraging many more people to save for their 
retirement. Clause 4 provides support by giving OPRA 
powers to investigate employers' compliance with their 
obligations under clause 3.
<P>
Clause 4 does not provide a new type of power. I can 
confirm the suspicion of the hon. Member for 
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). OPRA already has similar 
powers to investigate whether certain regulatory 
provisions of the Pensions Act 1995 are being complied 
with. The powers in respect of occupational schemes that 
are outlined here are to use the hon. Gentleman's 
expression "on all fours"	 with those in the 1995 Act. 
Clause 4 mirrors those provisions and extends them to the 
employer access requirements in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister explain how OPRA 
carries out its duties under existing powers? Does it, as 
my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford 
suggests in his amendment, intervene only where there is 
a clear breach, or does it sometimes conduct random 
inspections?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is the former OPRA becomes 
involved when it has good reason to do so. I shall speak 
in more detail about how that works in practice. It is an 
important point, because OPRA's record will reassure the 
Committee about how it will use its new powers.
<P>
Clause 4 mirrors the provisions of section 99 of the 
1995 Act, but modifies them so that they are appropriate 
to employer access requirements. The main difference is 
that the premises of any relevant employer can be 
inspected if relevant documents are kept there rather than 
just those of an occupational scheme employer. The 
approach to enforcement and inspection is similar, 
although the substantive obligation to be regulated is 
specific to the stakeholder framework.
<P>
OPRA will not be expected to use its powers of 
inspection on a routine basis. I reassure the hon. Member 
for Newbury that nothing draconian is envisaged. It is 
worth pointing out that OPRA is funded by a levy on the 
industry. It enjoys wide support in the industry because 
of the extra reassurance that it provides to pension scheme 
members. OPRA is tightly funded and there is no question 
of its embarking on spurious raids and inspections without 
good cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I find that 
response reassuring. Will the Minister spell out why he 
does not believe that what are sometimes called "fishing 
trips"	 or "mystery shopping trips"	 will take place? 
I thought for a minute that he said that they would not 
take place because OPRA is poorly funded and its 
finances prevent it, but I am sure that that was not his 
intention. What in law prevents OPRA from embarking on 
that course of action? What will prevent an over-officious 
official from deciding to embark on a series of "mystery 
shops"	?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman should consider 
OPRA's record so far. It already has discretion over the 
way in which it uses its powers. In practice, it has adopted 
a pragmatic and proportionate approach to breaches of the 
legislation. It treats persistent and deliberate disregard of 
the rules and fraudulent or dishonest action seriously. 
However, its overall aim is and has to be given its 
nature to develop constructive links with the bodies that 
it regulates. That is the best assurance that I can provide.
<P>
One of my concerns about amendment No. 33 is that it 
would remove the flexibility that OPRA currently enjoys. 
Like every other public authority, it is under a general 
duty to use its powers appropriately and not in an arbitrary 
fashion. Therefore, there are general safeguards in law to 
cover that.
<P>
We expect OPRA to regulate the conduct of 
stakeholder pension schemes and employers' compliance 
with clause 3 provisions in much the same way as it 
currently regulates occupational pension schemes. 
Broadly speaking, that means dealing with problems as 
they arise, seeking to resolve reported breaches by making 
inquiries and obtaining information on a voluntary basis. 
Experience so far has shown that enforcement powers for 
OPRA's current activities in regulating occupational 
schemes are used as a last resort only where there is 
evidence that those involved in running the schemes are 
not meeting their obligations and where other means of 
obtaining necessary information have failed. In nearly two 
years of operation, OPRA has needed to enter premises to 
inspect documents on only a handful of occasions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am pleased to hear that the powers that 
are already in place have so far been used in a sensible 
and not over-draconian manner. How often do the 
Government review how the powers are used? That was 
the point of my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I was coming to that point because I 
accept that that concern is important.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 would require the 
Secretary of State to review the powers on an annual basis 
as a matter of routine, and the hon. Member for Newbury 
reminded the Committee of that.
<P>
All Committee members will be concerned about the 
potential impact of the proposals on employers. As the 
Green Paper made clear, we want to minimise the effect 
on employers, especially small businesses. It is right that 
there should be proper scrutiny and evaluation of how the 
powers will be used. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, 
but the amendments are not necessary to achieve that aim. 
The stakeholder pension provisions as a whole, including 
this element, will be kept under review to ensure that they 
work as we intend. I can give the Committee that 
commitment. When appropriate, the Secretary of State can 
amend provisions to restore our aims if, in practice, it 
emerges that something different is happening.
<P>
There is already a track record that may encourage the 
hon. Gentleman. Close liaison between OPRA and 
officials in the Department of Social Security has enabled 
some difficulties with the operation of the 1995 Act to be 
identified at an early stage. Clause 9, which we shall 
discuss later today, introduces new and more 
proportionate measures to deal with non-compliance with 
the requirement on employers to pay employees' 
contributions to occupational pension schemes on time. 
I shall discuss the difficulties that have arisen from 
applying the 1995 Act when we reach clause 9, but the 
Bill introduces new measures to deal with those problems. 
In future, if we need to review this aspect of the current 
legislation, we will.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 would require OPRA to pay 
compensation when an employer incurs losses or costs 
exceeding £100 because of the actions of one of the 
authority's inspectors. The hon. Member for Brentwood 
and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) might have wanted reassurance 
about the scope of OPRA's powers and the supervision 
of its activities. There must be a process to ensure that 
public bodies do not exceed their statutory powers; they 
must give reassurance on that general issue. The 
amendment does not offer the most appropriate or 
effective way of resolving disputes that arise from the 
misuse of powers.
<P>
I spoke earlier abut the Contributions Agency, which 
provides a good example. For many years, it has had 
enforcement powers similar to those of OPRA. 
The arrangements for the Contributions Agency impose 
neither a statutory obligation to reimburse costs, nor a 
requirement for a routine review of its powers. In 
addition, they do not restrict the organisation's discretion 
over the use of its powers. Such arrangements would be 
unduly prescriptive. Introducing them for stakeholder 
pension schemes would be out of step with existing 
arrangements that cover other bodies. which have worked 
well over a long period. It would also be out of step with 
the powers given to OPRA under the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
OPRA already has a well established procedure for 
handling complaints about how it operates. When 
appropriate it can make ex-gratia payments to employers 
and others for whom it has caused unnecessary expense. 
Complaints that cannot be resolved internally are referred 
to an independent complaints investigator. OPRA is 
responsible for the regulation of 155,000 occupational 
schemes, and received six complaints in 1997-98; all but 
one of those were resolved without referral to the 
independent complaints adjudicator. The system is 
working well and, of course, it is important that it 
continues to do so.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the Committee on the 
matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not know if the Minister intends to 
deal with the points that I asked about they are relevant 
to our debate about the duties that will be placed on 
employers. He may remember that I asked about the 
explanatory notes, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The intention is to strike a balance between costs to the employer 
and flexibility for the member, so there is also a regulation-making 
power to prescribe restrictions on this requirement."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That requirement would be for employers to provide 
employees with access to schemes.
<P>
That reference is relevant because, if the Minister is to 
make regulations to ease the burdens on small employers, 
much of the debate might be unnecessary. We can be 
creative and help small employers by making the scheme 
employer-friendly. I hope that the Minister sees my point; 
I do not know whether he wants to respond to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I see the point and I take it. At this stage, 
there is no need to issue regulations to restrict the power 
further. If, in the light of experience, that proves 
necessary, such a measure will be possible. In practice, 
OPRA has worked well with the organisations that it 
regulates. From the experience of OPRA's work in the 
past couple of years, thee is no basis for concern that it 
will act in anything other than a proportionate and 
pragmatic way. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough 
looked at the record, he would see that there were no 
grounds for concern. Regulations will not be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but it is 
important. I am not clear about the type of scheme that 
OPRA deals with. I would like reassurance about the 
amount of experience that OPRA has of dealing with 
complex pension arrangements for very small employers. 
I suspect that it might have less experience in those 
matters than in dealing with the arrangements for larger 
employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> OPRA is responsible for the regulation 
of all occupational pension schemes. Some are for small 
companies, although many occupational schemes are very 
large. There are 155,000 schemes all told, and some are 
small. However, OPRA's duty is to ensure that employers 
provide access to a stakeholder pension scheme. We are 
not discussing employers who run their own pension 
schemes, unlike the others for which OPRA is 
responsible. OPRA has a tightly defined area of interest 
in the employers' concerns.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to intervene, but I want to make 
an important point. The relevant employers must provide 
reasonable access to information about the schemes. 
I agree with the Minister that very small employers we 
do not know the cut-off point, but, for example, those 
employing two, three or four people must have 
information about the schemes and pass it on to their 
employees. How much help will they be given to lessen 
the burden? It appears that it will be a complicated 
process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It need not be complicated. Employers are 
required only to draw the attention of their employees to 
a stakeholder scheme, a full list of which will be on a 
register to be maintained by OPRA. Employers will not 
have to provide their employees with difficult or 
complicated information. They must arrange for 
deductions from the payroll to the scheme. It is much less 
complicated than the present scheme for the existing 
155,000 employers, which is regulated by OPRA.
<P>
I do not minimise the importance of the matter that the 
hon. Gentleman raised, but here are no grounds for his 
anxiety about how the scheme will work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait (Beckenham):</B> I am sorry to pursue 
the matter, but there is a slight difference in the wording 
of the Pensions Act 1995 and the clause. Clause 4(2)(c) 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the administration of the employer's business",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whereas the 1995 Act refers to the administration of the 
scheme. By using the much broader definition of 
"employer's business"	, the Government may be trying to 
bring in the smaller businesses, assuming that their 
operations are smaller, whereas in the 1995 Act the 
scheme is administered from outside the employer's 
business. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough 
referred to the burden on small businesses and I wonder 
whether what the clause proposes will be the most 
effective way for OPRA to operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Lady is right: there is a 
difference in the wording. As I said to the hon. Member 
for Gainsborough, the reason is that the clause is about 
not where the scheme is being administered but where the 
business of the employer who is giving access is 
conducted. There is a difference in the wording for that 
reason, because the purpose is to ensure that the employer 
provides access to the stakeholder scheme. That is a small, 
but inevitable, difference given the nature of the 
requirement envisaged.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the Committee about how 
the powers in the clause will be used and explained why 
the amendments are unnecessary. I gladly recognise 
Opposition Members' valid anxieties but I hope that in 
the light of my reassurance they will ask leave to 
withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I do not intend to hit the panic 
button on the assurance given in a previous sitting about 
the threshold of employees. I know the hon. Gentleman: 
he would not be happy for an assurance that was given 
and accepted in good faith by both sides of the Committee 
retrospectively to be made invalid. I hope that there will 
be no problems and I shall say no more about the matter 
on this occasion.
<P>
There are three things wrong with the Government's 
position. The Minister put forward two arguments for not 
accepting our amendments, which do not stand up to 
scrutiny. In addition, there is a third thing wrong with the 
Government's position, which is the most serious matter 
of all. The Minister said that he was merely replicating 
the wording of the 1995 Act. However, stakeholder 
pensions are different. Unlike most occupational pensions 
and final salary schemes, they will in many cases involve 
small companies.
<P>
As a general principle, that is a bad way for a 
Government to proceed. We should make use of the 
Committee's deliberation to improve pensions law. We 
should not simply say that as provisions have been made 
in a 1995 or 1895 Act, the matter is sacrosanct and 
therefore should be left alone. That is an appalling way to 
legislate. It means that in many cases legislation becomes 
an encrustation of inappropriate and excessively 
complicated measures measures are never properly 
revised or looked at afresh and every Bill that comes 
before the House only adds to the coral reef of legislation. 
That is a great mistake. We should improve pensions 
measures, if possible.
<P>
I am a great believer in a zero-based approach to 
legislating; clearly, the Government are not. Time spent 
on measures such as the Welfare Reform and Pensions 
Bill should be used to improve them. Labour Members 
are not interested in Committee proceedings, as none of 
them are taking part in our discussions, although one of 
them intervened earlier.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is off the 
mark, as far as the amendments are concerned. Will he 
please restrict his remarks to the amendments and not 
make a general argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am addressing the Government's 
argument for not accepting our amendment, which they 
said would produce a text different to that of the 1995 
Act. Pointing out that that is not an acceptable excuse is 
pertinent. Indeed, the argument may work the other way 
and it is the Government's reasoning that is irrelevant. We 
should take the opportunity to examine matters afresh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that 
there have been problems with the 1995 Act. However, 
there have not been any problems in the area that we are 
discussing. As the measure has worked well the hon. 
Gentleman has not argued that it has not done so there 
is no need for change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his stab 
at the matter, which brings me to his argument that 
matters should be left alone. That is because OPRA has 
conducted itself perfectly sensibly and has not taken 
advantage of excessively widely drawn powers in the 
1995 Act.
<P>
I share the Minister's view of OPRA. Since assuming 
my present responsibilities, I have visited the organisation 
in Brighton. It made a good impression on me. It was not 
vast bureaucracy, as I had feared and the people who 
worked for it seemed to be extremely sensible. The 
Minister said that only six complaints have been made in 
the past year. I do not suppose and I have not heard 
otherwise that OPRA goes in for onerous, vexatious or 
abusive inspections.
<P>
The Minister's argument collapses at this point. The 
existing measure is broadly drafted. However, it has been 
found unnecessary in practice for OPRA to have such 
widely drawn and potentially autocratic powers. In 
considering the Bill, why not take the opportunity to 
redraw the powers of inspection to correspond with the 
reality, jurisprudence and practice of the powers required 
by OPRA? We should take advantage of past experience 
and reform and simplify the legislation to make it less 
onerous.
<P>
Of course, that is precisely what a deregulatory 
Government would do and precisely what I would do if I 
were the Minister. It is unfortunate that the Minister does 
not want to do that. The difference between us is 
represented in the amendment.
<P>
The third seriously wrong aspect of the provision is 
probably the main reason why the Government do not 
want to accept our amendment. It reflects a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the pensions industry on the part of 
the Government. OPRA was established to supervise 
traditional occupational schemes, not personal pension 
schemes. Traditional schemes have largely been 
salary-related. At present, no final salary schemes are 
being created. Some have been wound up or replaced by 
group personal pensions or money purchase schemes, 
which is unfortunate. OPRA was originally designed to 
supervise and inspect

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. What ORPA was originally 
designed for has nothing to do with the amendments. 
I have had to remind the hon. Gentleman to stay in order 
on four or five occasions this morning He will have noted 
that and he must stay within the narrow terms of the 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This goes to heart of the difference 
between the 1995 Act and the present situation, 
Mr. Malins, which is precisely what the Government 
have misunderstood. Stakeholder pensions are not final 
salary schemes. Therefore, the risks that apply to final 
salary occupational schemes cannot, by definition, apply 
to money purchase arrangements. We lost our amendment 
on clause 1. As a result of that loss, stakeholder pensions 
can only be money purchase schemes. I regret that, but 
that is what applies now. It follows that OPRA's task in 
supervising and inspecting money purchase schemes will 
be different from its task for salary-related schemes.
<P>
The Government have not understood that one of the 
major concerns of OPRA is the solvency of final salary 
schemes and whether employers have made sufficient 
contributions to maintain it. That does not apply to 
stakeholder schemes. Therefore, however necessary 
inspections are for final salary schemes, they are less 
required for money purchase schemes. However onerous, 
complicated and widely drawn were the powers in the 
1995 Act, there is no reason to carry them forward in the 
Bill. The Government should recognise that difference 
and cut back on the inspection powers in the Bill. Some 
aspects of OPRA's responsibilities may be the same as 
for final salary schemes, but not others. By definition, 
some of the major elements of final salary schemes that 
need inspecting cannot arise in relation to stakeholder 
schemes, yet we are now designing an inspection regime 
for stakeholder schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to ensure that no misunderstanding 
is taking place. OPRA is already responsible for 
regulating occupational money purchase schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed it is, but the Minister knows 
perfectly well that the 1995 Act was intended to create a 
framework that would preserve employee rights in final 
salary schemes and prevent Maxwell-type malversation 
from taking place. The Minister knows that chapters of 
that Act dealt with the obligations of employers to 
maintain the solvency of schemes and with what would 
happen if they did not. Many draconian powers flowed 
from that Act, but they are irrelevant to stakeholder 
pensions, which can only be money purchase schemes. 
Therefore, by definition, the inspection regime should not 
be the same: it does not need to be.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We come back again to the Government's fundamental 
misunderstanding, which lies at the heart of the 
stakeholder concept, that the same kind of structure, that 
applies naturally to the final salary occupational scheme 
with trusts and OPRA inspections, should apply to a 
stakeholder scheme. That is the third thing that is wrong 
with the Government's approach and it is why we do not 
think that the Government have done a proper job.
<P>
I am not getting at the Minister personally. I know that 
he inherited the Bill from his predecessor, who produced 
the Green Paper. As the Government had no intention of 
making a reality of the consultation exercise, they had 
presumably largely drafted the Bill before the Minister 
took over. The Bill is based on a fundamental confusion 
in the Government's mind, which has emerged here. The 
stakeholder is a different animal, so a different and lighter 
form of inspection is required. Even with a more complex 
animal, such as the final salary scheme, where a much 
wider range of things can go wrong, on the Minister's 
own testimony this morning there has been little need for 
inspection. Therefore, why have the Government 
proposed this extremely complicated structure? They have 
not thought it through properly.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that this whole 
clause smacks of a presumption of the need for regulation 
as opposed to a lighter hand that would allow employers 
to minimise the amount of regulation?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are again straying into 
clause stand part territory. Judging by the general nature 
of this debate, I am minded to consider whether we should 
debate clause stand part. I hope that we can stay within 
the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The points that I have been making under 
our amendments, Mr. Malins, which attempt to change 
fundamentally the inspection regime, are the only major 
points that Opposition Members seek to make on the 
clause. If you would prefer us to regard this as a clause 
stand part debate, if that makes for more rapid 
progress I am happy with that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not what I said, I simply 
indicated to the Committee that I was minded to consider 
the point in due course. We are currently within the 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I understand, Mr. Malins. I want to 
explain what we shall do about the amendments.
<P>
Perhaps I may first respond to the sensible intervention 
by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait). 
She is right to say that there are only two possible 
explanations for what the Government have done. The first 
is regulatory madness to regulate for the sake of 
regulating and, quite unnecessarily, to draft the widest 
possible powers for all the inspectors, bureaucrats and 
regulators. That is probably a reflection of new Labour's 
general approach excessive regulation in the nanny state. 
The second explanation is that it is a fundamental 
misunderstanding. After several sittings of the Committee 
the Government still have not understood they might 
have done if they had had a proper consultation period 
that there is a fundamental difference between the proposed 
stakeholder scheme and the occupational schemes that 
OPRA was originally set up to regulate and inspect. The 
sooner the Government realise that, the better.
<P>
What are we to do abut it? Liberal Members often table 
amendments not intending to press them, but if the hon. 
Member for Newbury is minded to press his amendment 
to a vote, we shall support it. It is not good enough for 
the Minister simply to say that from time to time the 
Government will consider the matter. We want disciplines 
in place under which the Secretary of State will have to 
consider it every year and, if the Liberal amendment is 
accepted, he will have to ask OPRA how many 
inspections there were, what they found and what the 
reasons for the inspection were the prima facie issues 
addressed in my amendment. All that will come out. It is 
a necessary discipline. There should be a countervailing 
check and balance in the system, rather than a regulator 
being given carte blanche, even if, as has been the case 
up to now with OPRA and I pray will always be the case, 
the officials running the show have not made use of those 
excessive powers.
<P>
The amendment that was moved by the hon. Member 
for Newbury shows that even Liberal Democrats have 
sensible ideas from time to time. I am happy to endorse 
amendment No. 27. Perhaps it should be pressed to a 
vote if he does not do so, I might even do so myself.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 is a probing amendment. I see 
some difficulties in incorporating the £100 rule in 
legislation in practice, and we shall not press it to a vote. 
We tabled it in the hope that it would provoke the kind 
of discussion that we have had.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 goes to the heart of the matter. It 
raises questions about when and why inspections should 
take place, and about the disciplines that will apply to the 
regulator to ensure that there is no abuse. I do not accuse 
OPRA of abuse or of vexatious use of its current powers 
but, even if it is a saint so far as regulators go, it is not 
right to draft excessive powers for use by anyone, 
anywhere, at any time. All hon. Members must be 
restrained in the powers that we create, especially if those 
powers can be used to interfere with the way in which 
people run their lives and their businesses in a free 
society. I hope that my hon. Friends will join me in 
supporting that important amendment.
<P>
 I should like to withdraw amendment No. 15, but I 
want to press amendment No. 33 to the vote. I shall leave 
it to the hon. Member for Newbury to decide what to do 
with amendment No. 27 I have already explained our 
view of it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Procedurally, the hon. 
Gentleman cannot withdraw amendment No. 15. It is for 
the Committee to decide whether amendments Nos. 15 
and 33 will be voted on in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I shall be briefer than the hon. Member 
for Grantham and Stamford. I am grateful to the Minister 
for the reassurances that he gave. He said that he will 
keep powers of inspection under review, and that he 
already has OPRA's powers under review. The examples 
that he cited in that context give considerable reassurance 
that the Government will act in a sensible and reasonable 
manner. The powers are clearly not being over-used at 
present.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it the Committee's wish that the 
amendment be withdrawn?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> No.
<P>
On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I seek your advice. 
The hon. member for Newbury is about to withdraw 
amendment No. 26. How can we ensure that we vote on 
amendments that are grouped with that amendment? I am 
interested in amendment No. 27, on which there should 
be a vote. The Liberal Democrats may be under 
instructions from their bosses not to do anything to upset 
the Government, with whom they are in a de facto 
coalition. The hon. Gentleman came up with a sensible 
amendment, and we believe that it should be voted on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are considering amendment 
No. 26. I shall now seek the Committee's views on that 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. What is 
happening? I am at a loss. We hope and intend to vote on 
amendments No. 33 and 27. Can you give me guidance 
on how we should do that?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Those matters can be voted on when 
we reach them. We are following the order in the 
amendment paper, and we have not currently reached 
the appropriate stage at which to vote on those 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move Government amendment 
No. 18, in page 4, line 11, leave out `of relevant 
employees'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government 
amendments Nos. 21 and 23.
<P>
<B> Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment, and those grouped with 
it, correct minor errors in the clause's drafting. I shall 
explain the background.
<P>
Clause 3, which will establish the access requirement, 
will apply the requirements in respect of an employer's 
"relevant employees"	, the concept of which we have 
already discussed. They include all employees except 
those who are eligible to join an occupational pension 
scheme or who earn less than the lower limit for 
national insurance.
<P>
We intend that the authority can use those powers in 
respect of employers who no longer employ any "relevant 
employees"	, but who should have complied with the 
requirement in the past. Such a circumstance is 
conceivable. The authority should also be able to check 
whether employers have "relevant employees"	 and 
should, therefore, comply with the requirements. As it is 
drafted, the reference to "relevant employees"	 would 
enable the authority to take action only where an 
employer is known to have "relevant employees"	 at the 
time of the investigation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I may have misunderstood the hon. 
Gentleman, but will the provision apply retrospectively to 
those employers who, in the past, would have been 
required to comply with the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that the hon. Lady has 
misunderstood, although that may well be my fault. We 
want OPRA to be empowered to investigate employers 
who have employed relevant employees in the past, 
even if they do not employ relevant employees at the 
time of the investigation. I hope that that explains the 
purpose of the amendments, which is simply to restore 
the intention behind the clause. They would bring about 
the original aims of the clause and I commend them to 
the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I understand it, the amendment 
corrects what was simply a drafting error in the Bill. We 
all make drafting amendments I shall doubtless make 
some myself and we shall therefore vote for the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move Government amendment 
No. 19, in page 4, line 18, leave out `provisions' and 
insert `requirements'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
Government amendment No. 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This amendment is technical. 
Subsection (1) refers to obligations imposed on 
employers in clause 3 as "requirements"	, but refers to 
them as "provisions"	 in paragraphs (b) and (c). The 
amendments would replace the word, "provisions"	 with 
the word, "requirements"	, which would ensure that 
references to the employer access requirements are 
consistent throughout the clause. I commend the 
amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I was slightly intrigued by the 
amendment, because I could not see the difference 
between "provisions"	 and "requirements"	. I expected a 
philosophical or linguistic dissertation from the Minister 
on the difference between the two terms. I agree that, if 
the two words have different meanings, one should be 
used consistently for the avoidance of doubt. However, 
perhaps he would provide an explanation before we vote 
on the amendment, so that I shall understand the 
difference as he sees it when the problem arises again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The concern is simply to use one term 
rather than two. I shall resist the tempting invitation to 
embark on a philosophical discourse on the difference 
between "provisions"	 and "requirements"	.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I, too, was interested in this change of 
terminology. I wondered whether it was of a piece with 
our theory that a presumption has been made in favour of 
inspection and, therefore, of heavy-handedness. Given 
that the clause is broadly copied from the Pensions Act 
1995, why is the Bill's wording to be changed? Does the 
1995 Act also contain the word, "requirement"	?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am pretty sure, although I do not have 
the relevant part of the Act in front of me, that the two 
are consistent. If the hon. Lady has the relevant section, 
perhaps she will draw it to my attention if that is not the 
case. The Government are concerned that the terms used 
in legislation should be consistent, even if the previous 
Government were less punctilious in that respect. That 
concern underlies the two amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

<P>
No. 21, in page 4, line 26, leave out `relevant', [Mr. Timms.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following: Government amendments Nos. 24 and 25.
<P>
Government new clause 1 Obtaining information with 
respect to compliance with section 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> With this group of amendments, we make 
it explicit that a power that is already available to OPRA 
under the 1995 Act is also available in relation to 
stakeholder pensions. Amendment No. 22 removes parts 
of clause 4 that are now included in new clause 1. 
Amendment No. 24 amends a drafting error, which meant 
that part of schedule 1 referred erroneously to the current 
Bill rather than to the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 ensures that OPRA will have the 
power to investigate breaches of corresponding legislation 
in Northern Ireland. OPRA already has similar powers to 
investigate breaches of the 1993 and 1995 Acts in 
Northern Ireland. The amendment also provides for 
OPRA to use its powers to investigate whether an 
occupational pension scheme complies with the basic 
conditions for stakeholder pension schemes, so as to 
decide whether a scheme should be on the register, 
whether penalties might apply and whether an offence 
might have been committed. Paragraph 2 of the schedule 
already provides for OPRA to have those powers in 
relation to other types of stakeholder pension.
<P>
New clause 1 gives OPRA a power to require the 
production of documents that are relevant to the issue of 
whether an employer is complying, or has complied, with 
the employer access requirements. It also enables OPRA 
to obtain a warrant to investigate where a person has not 
produced the required documents, or in certain other 
circumstances. That mirrors the powers that OPRA 
already has in relation to occupational pension schemes.
<P>
OPRA currently has considerable powers of 
investigation in relation to occupational pension schemes. 
Those powers allow it to carry out the functions given to 
it by Parliament and by the 1995 Act. If the need arises 
during the course of an investigation, it can inspect 
premises, interview individuals, require the production of 
documents and obtain warrants enabling it to seize and 
retain documents. It does not use those powers lightly, but 
it is right that it should have them, so that it can properly 
investigate cases of wrongdoing.
<P>
We want similar powers to apply to stakeholder 
pension schemes and to the new processes involved. We 
are confident that OPRA will exercise similar restraint in 
the use of those powers but, again, it is important that it 
has them, so that it can protect the interests of members 
of stakeholder pension schemes and ensure that there are 
not the problems with stakeholder pensions that have 
occurred in the past. I commend the amendments to the 
Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause applies a number of sections 
of the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Pension Schemes 
Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995 to stakeholder 
pension schemes. It also brings schedule 1 into force.
<P>
Powers in the Employment Rights Act 1996 will 
protect individuals who act as trustees for this stakeholder 
pension scheme that has been nominated by their 
employer for example, they must be given a reasonable 
amount of time off to perform their trustee duties. The 
protections are important because we want to encourage 
people to be trustees, and they should not be penalised by 
their employer for doing so.
<P>
Schedule 1 applies sections of the Pensions Schemes 
Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995 to trust-based 
stakeholder pension schemes. The requirements that it 
places on trustees of stakeholder pension schemes are 
similar to those that apply to trustees of occupational 
pensions schemes. It allows OPRA to supervise the 
conduct of stakeholder pensions schemes trustees in much 
the same way as it supervises trustees of occupational 
pension schemes. The schedule also allows the Pensions 
Compensation Board to impose a levy on trust-based 
stakeholder pension schemes.
<P>
We see trust-based arrangements as a good, 
well-established way of ensuring that schemes are run in 
the interests of members. The schedule extends relevant 
trustee legislation to trust-based stakeholder pension 
schemes. It also gives OPRA the power to investigate 
compliance with conditions that were set out in clause 1. 
OPRA will decide whether steps have been taken to 
comply with those conditions or whether anyone has 
misled it in applying for registration. The Committee is 
aware that we have not ruled out the possibility that 
non-trust-based schemes may be set up as long as they 
offer a comparable outcome for members. The schedule 
extends OPRA's powers of investigation to those 
schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This is a fascinating clause. Once 
again, the Government do not know what they are doing. 
They have decided to set up stakeholder pensions and 
have heard that occupational pension schemes are a good 
idea, so they have designed the stakeholder scheme as an 
occupational pension scheme. However, the complicated, 
top-heavy structure of trusts is inappropriate for pensions 
in the modern world unless they are company 
salary-related schemes, which the Government excluded 
from the stakeholder regime in clause 1. Although some 
stakeholder pensions might be company schemes, it is 
unlikely that smaller employers, whom the Bill targets, 
will have enough employees to warrant such a scheme.
<P>
It is becoming clear that the Minister of State inherited 
an ill-thought-out idea from his predecessor. The Green 
Paper was compiled in a great hurry references to 
compulsory pensions for people earning more than £9,000 
a year were not removed in time for the printer and the 
Government treated the consultation exercise with 
contempt. It is not surprising that we have a shambolic 
Bill, and nowhere is that more apparent than in this clause.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides that trustees can have time off. 
It mimics provisions in those Acts that established the 
framework for occupational pension schemes, which were 
largely final salary schemes. It is clear that the Minister's 
predecessor based the stakeholder pension on schemes run 
by BP or ICI. That set an inappropriate precedent. It is as 
if someone who designed passenger motor cars started to 
design an aircraft and decided that it needed an exhaust 
and four tyres but no wings. It is a shoddy job. Let me 
ask the Minister a few questions about it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
What are the trustees for? On clause 1 we discussed the 
reasons why we needed trusts and the fact that the 
Treasury does not think that they are necessary to 
establish a lifelong individual savings account, which is 
probably much more sensibly conceived as a pension 
vehicle than the stakeholder pension. What will the 
trustees do? What do they need time off for? We have 
already established that the charges for administering 
stakeholder pension schemes will be fixed by regulations, 
although the Government refuse, once again, to tell us in 
advance what they will say. We do not know what level 
the charges will be fixed at, but we know that they will 
be fixed. Therefore, the trustees will not negotiate charges 
with the managers of the pension scheme. That is a 
traditional job for trustees making sure that the charges 
are not unduly onerous and that, where a pension fund 
manager is expensive, other offers are solicited and 
competition brought into play. That is not relevant here, 
because the Government are fixing the charges.
<P>
You heard me poke fun at that. Mr. Malins, as did 
Mr. McWilliam, and say how absurd it was that the 
Government should fix prices in the economy: why do 
they not fix the price of ice creams or television sets? 
Whether it is absurd or not, the Government will fix 
prices, so the trustees will not need time off to do so. 
What will they do?
<P>
Will the fund managers be chosen on the basis of the 
portfolio management policy that the Government think 
is appropriate for the scheme? That is a traditional role 
for trustees, and time off is necessary for that purpose. 
The inappropriate analogy that the Minister's predecessor 
was working on for stakeholder schemes was that if 
trustees of a pension scheme have to interview some 
extremely sophisticated fund managers and Warburg, 
Merrill Lynch, J P Morgan and so forth are all competing 
to manage the fund, they must take some time off. They 
must make sure that they are up to speed with modern 
portfolio management and the performance of comparable 
pension funds and are not too easily misled by the clever 
and aggressive marketing in which such fund managers 
have developed a speciality. Trustees certainly need time 
off for that kind of thing.
<P>
We have discovered that the stakeholder schemes will 
be tracker schemes. It is plain that there will be no scope 
for discretionary fund management, because the charges 
will not allow it. One does not need a fund manager to 
run a tracker scheme; all one needs is a computer. In a 
tracker scheme, one invests with the index. One decides 
on the index and that is the end of the decision. It does 
not matter who runs it: one simply needs a computer. The 
scheme does not need sophisticated fund managers to fly 
in from New York, Frankfurt or wherever and make 
competing presentations, while the trustees sit there and 
ask intelligent questions. It is absurd to apply that model 
to stakeholder pension schemes. Such issues do not begin 
to arise.
<P>
Here we have subsection (2) I have not invented it, 
Mr. Marlins; if I had, you would have called me to order 
by now which says that the trustees must take time off 
to fulfil their duties. It is a direct and inappropriate 
analogy to borrow this system of trusts and trustees from 
a totally different type of scheme.
<P>
Another thing that trustees do in large company 
schemes as I said earlier, they do it in the House of 
Commons scheme is talk to members about their 
pension, about how things are going if it is a money 
purchase scheme, or whether there is a chance of getting 
better benefits if it is a final salary scheme. The trustees 
act as intermediaries between the beneficiaries in a large 
Company's scheme and the management of the scheme 
or the company providing the final salary-related scheme, 
if it is a salary-related scheme. That makes complete 
sense. It is right that the Employment Rights Act 1996 
provides for trustees to have time off for such a purpose. 
It is irrelevant in this context, however, we have already 
agreed that the schemes will not be company-wide. People 
will not know the trustees unless it is purely by accident. 
Goodness knows where the trustees will come from and 
how they will be chosen. Will they be paid for no purpose 
at all? If they are not paid, why would they want to do 
the job?
<P>
Someone from the House of Commons or ICI might 
in the interests of their colleagues and the institution to 
which they are proud to belong want to serve as a trustee 
on a scheme, as it is an important role. Such an analogy 
would not be appropriate for stakeholder pensions, 
however, as they will be set up by an insurance company 
or life office and will be sold to 2,000 employers with an 
average of seven and a half employees. Clearly, trustees 
will not have a role as intermediaries.
<P>
What do trustees of occupational pension schemes do? 
In final salary schemes, they are the counterweight to the 
employer. It is their job to point out to an employer that 
a scheme's benefits are not as good as they could be, for 
example, if the scheme was based on fiftieths rather than 
sixtieths. Alternatively, they might suggest that a scheme 
with a good surplus might be able to provide better 
benefits for widows within the Revenue rules. That is an 
important and honourable role for trustees. I pay tribute 
to the thousands of trustees in this country who play such 
a role. It is largely a result of their efforts as well as 
the far-sighted and judicious commitment of many major 
employers, and some smaller employers, to the final 
salary principle that such a good occupational pension 
scheme structure exists in this country.
<P>
Employees who are trustees must be given time off for 
that purpose. If they are negotiating with their employer 
on behalf of their colleagues, they cannot be put in a 
situation in which they can be told, "Back to work, Jack. 
The shift hasn't finished"	. If the employer does not like 
what the trustees are saying to him, he can threaten to fire 
them if they are not back at their desk or bench in two 
minutes. We do not want that to happen it does not arise 
frequently in the humanely managed companies that 
provide such final salary schemes and that is why 
employment protection for trustees is in place.
<P>
None of that is relevant to the stakeholder structure, 
however, because the Government excluded final salary 
schemes from that structure in clause 1. We tried to 
reintroduce them as you will recall, Mr. Malins but 
failed because of the Labour party's vast majority in 
Parliament and, therefore, in this Committee. As a result, 
the structure is completely inappropriate.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is 
speaking at length about matters that are not relevant to 
the clause. He should restrict his remarks to clause 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I submit that trustees having time off is 
premised on the assumption that they have something to 
do. My point I know that you will have listened to me 
with your usual rigorous attention, Mr. Malins concerns 
the contrast between the tasks of trustees in trust-based 
schemes where trusts are appropriate and trustees have 
a genuine role, and the complete irrelevance of trusts in 
stakeholder schemes. They will not only be irrelevant, but 
expensive and encumbering, and trustees will have 
nothing to do. Why do we need to provide for time off 
for trustees who will not be able to fulfil the classic 
functions of a trustee in the schemes for which trusts and 
trustees were designed?
<P>
There can be only one explanation for this 
extraordinary anomaly that, in plain language, the 
Government simply do not know what they are doing. 
They had a stakeholder pension scheme commitment in 
the Labour manifesto; they spent 20 months thrashing 
around deciding what to do about it; they could not make 
up their minds; they produced a document that was 
evidently cobbled together at the last minute without due 
thought; and they have not consulted. As a result, they 
have ended up with nonsensical provisions. The clause is 
one more symptom. We have already seen others and we 
will see even more as we progress through the Bill.
<P>
Will the Minister rise and explain what the trustees are 
supposed to be doing that requires them to take time off 
work? If trustees in stakeholder trusts are required for any 
useful purpose I do not believe that they are what 
precisely is it? I have already argued that, by definition, 
they will be unable to perform the four or five essential 
functions that they can perform in the quite different 
world of salary-related occupational pension schemes.
<P>
The Government have done shoddy work. They have 
drawn a rapid and inappropriate analogy from 
occupational pension schemes to stakeholder schemes. As 
a result, we are confronted with the nonsense that we are 
debating this morning.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend in 
everything that he said. There is a real problem with how 
the Government's stakeholder schemes will affect small 
businesses. Some employees working in small businesses 
may believe that they have their own pension scheme as 
stakeholders and that they will be able to influence it as 
trustees. They may not automatically think in terms of 
becoming trustees to have time off work, but they may 
well be disappointed because a stakeholder scheme will 
not be set up for one company or business. Their 
stakeholder contributions will be put into a much larger 
scheme run, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham 
and Stamford said, by an insurance company or other 
large City institutions.
<P>
Employees of smaller companies might dream of 
influencing the pension that they will receive at the end 
of their working lives, but they will be sorely 
disappointed. They will not have time off to choose fund 
managers. They will not be able to decide whether they 
want more ethical investments perhaps not in tobacco 
companies, or, going back to the bad old days, in 
Barclay's because of its dealings in South Africa. Those 
and other issues may continue to be live, but employees 
will not be able to engage with them because they cannot 
be trustees of pension funds.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend that the clause is 
unnecessary and could potentially mislead stakeholders 
into believing that they will be able to exert real influence 
and have time off work to do so. Our long debate has 
demonstrated that the Government fundamentally 
misunderstand the way in which stakeholder pension 
schemes will affect work. It will greatly disappoint 
employees of small businesses when they find that they 
will not have the control over their pension funds that 
they assumed they would have by virtue of their 
becoming stakeholders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have been around this course a few 
times already, so I shall be brief. It is essential to have an 
effective mechanism the trust mechanism at the heart 
of the Government's regime for stakeholder pensions to 
ensure that members' interests are protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman 
contending that in the case of personal pensions, the 
majority of which are not established on a trust system, or 
of the Treasury's proposals for LISAs, there is inadequate 
protection for the investor or the pensioner because of 
the absence of a trust? It that what the hon. Gentleman 
is saying?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows well that 
there were serious problems in the early days of personal 
pensions because of mis-selling. I was disappointed that 
he did not mention the matter earlier, as he has done in 
previous sittings unlike his hon. Friends who have not 
mentioned it at all. The hon. Gentleman rightly 
acknowledged the scale of the problem and, by 
implication, recognised the importance of a stakeholder 
pension mechanism to ensure that the disaster of 
mis-selling is not repeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Either, the Minister is deliberately 
throwing up a smoke screen of irrelevancies or he has not 
understood a fundamental matter: trustees are not relevant 
to the selling of a pension scheme in any circumstances. 
They are relevant to the management of that scheme on 
behalf of the beneficiaries. Trustees are in no sense a 
protection against mis-selling. If that is what the hon. 
Gentleman is saying, it is absurd. He cannot seriously be 
saying that the mis-selling would not have occurred if 
personal pensions had been established on the basis of 
a trust. The intermediaries and the life offices mis-sold. 
Whether trusts were responsible for the continuing 
management of the schemes is neither here nor there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Trustees will be responsible for the entire 
operation of a pension scheme. They will ensure that the 
scheme is operated to protect the interests of its members 
and those who join it. That factor was absent from 
personal pensions; we are building that protection into the 
heart of stakeholder pensions from the outset. We are 
confident that it will protect members' interests in a way 
that was not achieved with personal pensions. That is why 
it is important.
<P>
I was pleased that the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford paid tribute to occupational scheme trustees. His 
view differs from that of his hon. Friends, who earlier 
made insulting remarks about pension fund trustees, 
saying that they were conservative and inept octogenarian 
solicitors. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman re-stated 
his support for the work of occupational fund trustees. 
The virtues that he extolled should be available to those 
who join a stakeholder pension scheme because there is 
no occupational scheme for them to join.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman fails to acknowledge that there are 
already trust-based, money-purchase schemes. I assure 
him that, contrary to what he believes, the trustees 
responsible for those schemes have plenty to do. In the 
stakeholder arrangement, they will be responsible for 
appointing administrators and fund managers to the 
scheme. They will negotiate with service providers to 
drive down charges for members; although it is true that 
we will set a limit on the charges, we will not set in 
regulation the precise level of charges. That will be a 
matter for negotiation and the trustees will have a 
responsibility in that respect. They will have a role in 
determining the scheme's investment strategy, including 
whether they should use tracker funds or active managers, 
or a mix of the two. They will be responsible for ensuring 
that scheme members receive appropriate information 
about the scheme and their rights within it. They will have 
a very big job.
<P>
I again draw the attention of the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford to the report of independent 
Pension Provision Group the hon. Gentleman attended 
the launch a couple of weeks ago which welcomed the 
trustee basis for stakeholder pensions schemes. We 
resolved the matter some time ago and I hope that we 
shall not spend too much time repeating previous 
discussions in this debate. The measures in clause 5 are 
an entirely logical consequence of our earlier agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must seek leave to address the 
Committee again because what the Minister has just said 
will be hung around his neck. It is a terrible reflection of 
the Government's incompetence that they are proceeding 
on such a basis. We speak in Committee, knowing that 
our words will be recorded in Hansard and read by the 
outside world some members of that world are sitting in 
this Room which will judge whether the Minister has 
begun to understand how British pensions work.
<P>
It is extraordinary to suggest that the absence of trustees 
was a reason for the mis-selling of personal pensions. The 
Minister is wrong about that. Trustees do not get 
commission as they do not sell pensions. They should not 
be involved in such matters. Had trustees been involved 
in personal pension schemes, they would have been 
responsible for appointing fund managers and for certain 
administrative aspects of the schemes. Under no 
circumstances do trustees have a role in selling; therefore, 
they have no role in mis-selling or preventing mis-selling.
<P>
The Minister continues to put on record that the role of 
trustees is to negotiate charges with providers that is 
why they need time off. The Government say that they 
will fix charges at a low level. There is nothing to be 
gained from quoting the Green Paper, in which a 
commitment is made that charges will be much lower than 
at present. Anyone who knows the first thing about 
pensions knows that fixing low charges means that such 
schemes will have to be managed through tracker funds.
<P>
Therefore, charges will not be negotiated. If charges set 
as a maximum by Government regulations are low, that 
will leave no room for going below that level. That will 
certainly be the case if such charges are set at the 
individual savings account cap level of 1 per cent. There 
will probably be no competition between the providers 
of stakeholder schemes on the basis of cost, and that is 
undesirable. Inevitably, maxima become minima.
<P>
About all, there will be no scope for discretionary fund 
management. The Minister said that the trustees will 
decide whether stakeholder schemes will be managed on 
an active or passive basis. That reveals the Government's 
fundamental ignorance about the pensions market. Of 
course, money purchase pension schemes often have 
trustees, who have the role although, in final salary 
schemes, it is not all their role of negotiating charges 
with fund managers and discussing with them the 
principles of management. Such schemes have higher 
costs, so it is economic to do that.
<P>
The Minister's words will be hung around his neck. 
Should the Government go ahead with the stakeholder 
pension scheme, those who take it up will do so on a 
tracker basis. Therefore there will be no role of trustees 
in the choice of fund management strategy or in pushing 
down charges further. It will be impossible to push down 
such charges further. Page 53 of the Green Paper deals 
with the level of charges. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The permitted charge level will be set later".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So it is clear that the level will be set, as the Minister 
confirmed when we discussed clause 1. The Green paper 
also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"But we think the reassurance of a fixed standard is needed to 
enable stakeholder pension schemes to meet their aims."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the standard will be fixed. Paragraph 31 of the Green 
Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The minimum standards will be built on the `CAT' standards 
(cost, access and terms), which are to be used for Individual 
Savings Accounts".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government produced a CAT standard for ISAs of 
1 per cent. per annum, but that is at risk from the changes 
to the stamp duty regime announced in the Budget. It is 
possible that no one will deliver ISAs on the basis of that 
standard. There is certainly no scope within the 1 per cent. 
standard for discretionary fund management. Again, what 
the Minister said reflects the Government's fundamental 
ignorance of the pensions industry. They have the 
pretension and foolishness to try to regulate it without 
doing their homework, without waiting for the end of the 
consultation period, and without listening to anyone the 
industry, outside experts or the Opposition. On that basis, 
we shall have to vote against this thoroughly 
ill-thought-through clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The clause concerns the protection of 
trustees and, in that sense, it is valuable. I have listened 
to the debate and what has concerned me is that few 
employees will be involved as trustees. As my hon. Friend 
the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, the 
stakeholder pension will be a very conservative 
investment: it will be on a tracker basis.
<P>
The Minister should assure us that there will be 
opportunities for active management of the schemes. I 
make no apology for making that vital point again. No one 
suggests that we should return to the high-risk ventures of 
the past, or that employees should not be protected; no 
one denies that there was pension mis-selling. Everyone 
is concerned to ensure active protection of employees, but 
it is in our interests to make stakeholder pensions 
attractive. The Minister must convince us that there will 
be opportunities for managers to take some risks to ensure 
that the pensions are competitive and that people can 
receive the same rate of return from a stakeholder pension 
as from traditional private sector pensions.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be 
the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I want to take the opportunity 
to ask the Minister a question. Most of the schedule is 
unexceptionable, although we do not accept that 
stakeholder pensions should be set up as trusts, which is 
a provision made in paragraph 1. Paragraph 1(2) (b) 
provides for the authority, in this case OPRA, to make 
levies on stakeholder pension schemes of the same type 
as, or in parallel to, the powers that they have to make 
levies on occupational pension schemes under the 
Pensions Acts.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not sure whether the Minister wanted to rise to 
introduce the schedule, and I hope that he is not returning 
to the bad habit of not making his intentions clear. 
Perhaps that shows his slight feeling of embarrassment 
about the Bill, much of which is, I concede, caused by 
over-hasty or ill-informed drafting by his predecessor. He 
now has the invidious task of defending the Bill and 
making excuses for its shortcoming and contradictions.
<P>
If the Minister did not want to introduce the schedule, 
that fact is interesting. I do not think that he was rising to 
try to catch your eye, Mr. Malins; if he was, I apologise. 
Out of courtesy, I would have allowed him to speak first 
on his own schedule and I thought that he wanted to.
<P>
Levies are provided for in the schedule. We have 
already discussed the different nature of the regulatory 
function in relation to money purchase stakeholder 
schemes and occupational pension schemes, the bulk of 
which remain based on final salary. Is the same levy 
appropriate?
<P>
Stakeholder pensions schemes will arise only in the 
case of firms that do not have an occupational scheme. In 
many cases, employers may simply not have provided for 
their employees as generously as firms of a comparable 
size. However, some of them may be small and may not 
be able to cope with the burden of paying for or 
administering a pension scheme. As we discuss the Bill, 
we must be wary and to keep the additional burdens and 
costs on them to a minimum. At least the Government 
appear to share some of that concern and have endorsed 
it on one or two occasions.
<P>
In the case of small employers, will the levy be in 
proportion to the size of the firm or the number of 
employees? Will it be proportionate to the number of 
employees who use the stakeholder pension facility? As 
we have noted, some employees may prefer to remain 
with their own personal pension scheme or make other 
arrangements, perhaps through the Treasury's LISAs. 
Will the levies be based on the value of the funds invested 
in the scheme? What is the basis of charging and will the 
Minister tell us if he does not know the answer or has not 
thought about the matter?
<P>
If the Minister does not want to be as frank as that, will 
he say, "We will think about it"	? Will he say that he will 
consult on the matter having learned the error of his ways 
in not allowing the consultation period on the Bill to end 
before it was brought before the House? Has the Minister 
learned that lesson? Will he now consult, and if so, who 
with and for how long? What can he say to remove the 
fear that might reasonably arise in the mind of anyone 
who reads the schedule, that it places yet another potential 
burden on employers? We have discussed the many 
burdens on them expenses, inspections and the need to 
take technical advice from actuaries and accountants. 
Now, there will be additional levies.
<P>
We have to accept the basic principle of regulation, 
which is that those who are regulated pay for the 
regulator. As the regulator is in a monopoly position 
vis-a-vis the regulated, it is important that there are 
controls and that the regulator cannot simply pass on to 
the regulated any costs or charges that he or she chooses 
to run up. We all know that regulators are bureaucracies. 
They may be fine bureaucracies, but they do not depend 
on market competition to remain in business. There is a 
great temptation to build up overhead, even if they do not 
deliberately set out to do that, because overhead has a way 
of building up in any organisation that is not subject to the 
disciplines of a competitive market. Then, if the regulator 
knows that he can lay off any charges that are incurred 
on the regulated by way of compulsory levies, for which 
Parliament has provided as proposed in schedule 1 the 
burdens on the regulated could be excessive, with 
deleterious economic consequences and unfairness. The 
other side of the coin is that one can create bloated and 
excessively onerous regulatory systems. We do not want 
that, so let us at least have some straightforward 
assurances from the Minister on which we can rely, so we 
know that such fears are no more than theoretical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is an extremely good Bill based on 
an extremely good Green Paper. I am happy to put that 
point on the record. Most of the hon. Gentleman's 
remarks rest on a misunderstanding. First, I did not rise 
to speak to schedule 1 because I had already spoken about 
it in my speech on clause 5, which was the appropriate 
place to do so.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's other misunderstanding was that 
he seemed to be under the impression that we were 
proposing a levy on employers when we are proposing a 
levy on stakeholder schemes. No contribution will be 
required from employers, who will simply give their 
employees access to the scheme. There is a difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> There is a fascinating aspect to this. If the 
levy is paid by the scheme, and the employer will not 
reimburse the scheme for the levy, will the levy come 
within the CAT marked or limited costs of the scheme, 
so that if the Government put forward a 1 per cent. CAT 
marking proposal that seems to be the way that they 
have been thinking until now, although they will not 
reveal the colour of their money will the additional levy 
come within that or be additional to it? Pensioners need 
to know how much of the money that they pay is invested 
for their benefit and how much is abstracted for other 
purposes. Whether it is abstracted for the benefit of the 
regulator or for the benefit of managers makes no 
difference to the poor pensioner who is losing money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clearly, the levy will be contained within 
the cost of the scheme, which will be within the levels set 
by regulation. We have just revised the levy for OPRA. 
The amount paid depends on the size of the scheme; it is 
not a flat sum. The same arrangement applies to OPRA 
as applies for compensation and it works well. Of course, 
occupational money purchase schemes already pay the 
levy and stakeholder schemes will pay it in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the Minister answer my question? 
When he says that the levy will depend on the size of the 
scheme, does he mean that it will depend on the number 
of employees or the amount of money invested in it? In 
addition, can he tell us the current range of OPRA levies 
that are imposed on the schemes that it regulates 
occupational pension schemes because he just said that 
stakeholder pension schemes would have to pay the 
same charges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The charge varies according to the 
number of people in the scheme: that is the criterion that 
determines the charge. I shall gladly write to the hon. 
Gentleman and set out the current schedule of charges.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause is about the treatment of 
national insurance contributions for members of 
stakeholder pension schemes.
<P>
As members of the Committee will know, people 
whose membership of a pension scheme contracts them 
out of the state earnings related pension scheme are liable 
for a lower rate of national insurance contributions. The 
way in which that happens varies according to the type of 
scheme. Some members pay a lower rate of contributions. 
Others pay the normal rate but have part of their 
contributions rebated to the scheme. In some schemes, 
there is an element of both. I propose to refer simply to 
rebates, although the mechanisms will vary according to 
the type of contracted-out scheme.
<P>
Stakeholder pension schemes will fall, in legislative 
terms, into one of the two existing general categories of 
pension schemes. They will either be occupational 
pension stakeholder schemes or personal pension 
stakeholder schemes. As a result, many of the existing 
legislative arrangements for contracting-out will apply to 
them automatically. So there is already provision, in the 
Pension Schemes Act 1993, for the arrangements for 
contracting out and for rebates to be paid.
<P>
However, existing legislation provides only for a single 
rate of rebate to apply to money purchase occupational 
schemes and for a separate single rate of rebate to apply to 
personal pension schemes. Currently, it does not of course 
make further separate provision for stakeholder schemes, 
because they are a novelty. The clause provides a power 
to set different rebates for schemes that are stakeholder 
schemes as opposed to those that are not.
<P>
Rebate rates are set by the Secretary of State in the 
light of advice from the Government Actuary. The rates 
of rebate reflect the value of the state benefit forgone by 
contracting-out. The Government Actuary takes into 
account, among other things, the expense levels of 
schemes, which affect the cost of providing an equivalent 
benefit to that which has been given up.
<P>
The expenses that are associated with a scheme are the 
crucial factor in determining the different rates of rebate 
that will be applied.
<P>
The clause will enable a different rate of rebate to be 
set for stakeholder pension schemes, if it turns out that it 
is appropriate to do so. The presence of that power does 
not mean that we will necessarily set different rebates. 
Decisions on rebate rates for stakeholder pension schemes 
will be taken later. We expect to lay the appropriate orders 
by April 2000 a year in advance of their introduction 
as is required under existing legislation. However, the 
clause ensures that a different rate could be set for 
stakeholder pension schemes if it was judged appropriate 
to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister mentioned the laying of 
orders. Will they involve the affirmative or negative 
procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The normal procedure with regulations 
for pensions legislation is to use the negative procedure. 
We envisage that it will apply in this case.
<P>
The clause also allows different rebate rates to be set 
for personal pensions, whether or not they qualify as 
stakeholder pensions, according to the date at which the 
member joined the scheme. That provides a new element 
of flexibility in setting rebate rates where the typical costs 
of schemes change over time for example, following the 
introduction of stakeholder pension schemes. It would 
allow a different rate of rebate to be set for those who had 
already committed themselves to a pension scheme than 
for new members of schemes, if that was judged 
appropriate.
<P>
The clause provides an important flexibility for setting 
rebate rates in the future. Its powers may not always need 
to be used in practice. However, it is prudent to include 
them in the Bill that will allow the most effective use to 
be made of significant public resources in the form of 
national insurance rebates.
<P>
I am informed that the information that I gave to the 
hon. Member for Newbury is not correct. Rebate orders 
involve the affirmative procedure and we expect them to 
do so in relation to stakeholder pensions. I apologise to 
the hon. Gentleman for misleading him earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is a complex clause. I hope that the 
Minister will forgive me if, being equipped with only one 
brain, I did not understand all that he said. Can he help me 
by giving me an example? The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The reduced rates reflect the cost of providing members with 
benefits of an equivalent value to the SERPS benefits they are 
giving up."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I understand that, somebody will give up an element of 
a SERPS benefit I do not know how much and will 
be recompensed.
<P>
To explain that to me, can the Minister give a practical 
example? If he cannot do so now, can his civil servants 
help me by providing us with an example of a person who 
is on SERPS now and is joining a stakeholder scheme? 
Will the Minister explain some of the figures showing 
how he will be recompensed under the clause for any loss 
that he will suffer through the loss of his SERPS benefit?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman some
help. The essential difference is between three types
of contacted-out scheme contracted-out salary-related 
schemes, contracted-out money purchase schemes and 
personal pensions. A person who contracts out of SERPS 
foregoes all the benefits that he would have gained by 
staying in, but the amount of national insurance rebate 
given in respect of that contracting out depends on which 
of the three routes he takes. As I have said, the costs 
associated with each are different, so the costs of 
achieving comparable benefits in future are also different.
<P>
Let me give one example. The arrangement in the 
contracted-out salary-related scheme, which is the 
standard occupational scheme, is straightforward a 
4.6 per cent. national insurance rebate, which can then be 
paid into the salary-related scheme with any additional 
contributions from the employer and the employee. 
However, the arrangements for contracted-out money 
purchase schemes and personal pensions schemes are 
different. In the former there are two elements in the 
rebate a flat rate and an age-related element. For 
personal pensions the rebate is determined on an 
age-related basis.
<P>
I should be happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with 
further detail on those points if he would like me to, but 
I think that that gives an indication of the three different 
bases that are in use.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have a quick question for the Minister so 
that it is clear in my mind, as I agree with my hon. Friend 
the Member for Gainsborough. Can a person who 
contracts out of SERPS to go into one of the schemes 
transfer his values from SERPS into that scheme or are 
they frozen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, he cannot. If a person has been in 
SERPS for a period, when he reaches retirement age he 
will gain the benefit from that, but having contracted out, 
he receives no additional benefit from SERPS. All future 
benefit will come through the contracted-out scheme.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> There is no transfer of values.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is no transfer back, no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am a little concerned about the clause. 
Clearly the Bill must contain a clause of this kind, as it 
would be wrong to allow stakeholder pensions to work 
without any rebates when other forms of pension have 
them. I am pleased to hear the Minister confirm that 
orders will be laid under the affirmative procedure, 
because to some extent that allays my fears.
<P>
The clause may tempt the Government to skew the 
attractiveness of stakeholder pensions compared to other 
forms of pension by setting the rebate at a different level 
from that set for personal pensions or occupational 
pensions outside the stakeholder system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to intervene. The hon. 
Gentleman is making a good point, but presumably the 
answer is that that must be determined by Government 
actuaries and not by politicians.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope that that is the answer, but I shall 
leave it to the Minister to supply the answer to my 
question, rather than try to supply it myself in answer 
to the hon. Gentleman. Certainly I should welcome more 
explanation from the Government about how they expect 
to use this power, if they are given it. Do they intend to 
skew things in favour of stakeholder pensions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
raising this matter and, indeed, to the hon. Member for 
Gainsborough for providing an excellent answer. There is 
good reason to worry. There was concern that rebates had 
been skewed, in particular to favour the new personal 
pensions. There is no intention to skew the system for 
stakeholder pensions. We will await the advice of the 
Government Actuary, which we will apply even-handedly 
transparently to ensure that there is a level playing field 
so that people can make the decision that is in their best 
interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Perhaps I may divide my 
comments between the contributions and rebate aspects of 
the clause, which introduces incredible complexity into 
the prospective management by employers of their 
liability to make class 1 contributions. It is likely, as I am 
sure the Minister will confirm, that employers will have 
to distinguish between four different categories of 
employee and to provide four different levels of 
contribution, all of which will be calculated on a different 
basis. The first category covers contracted-in employees 
who have contracted into SERPS or its replacement, the 
state second pension. The second category relates to 
contracted-out employees who have moved into a final 
salary scheme, if the employer has one. The third category 
covers employees who have contracted out of a scheme 
into a stakeholder scheme a money purchase scheme. 
The two schemes can co-exist because not all employees 
will have access to an occupational pension scheme, 
which may be wound up and replaced by a stakeholder 
scheme for new employees. That is a particular problem 
with the project.
<P>
The third category covers employees who are 
contracted out into a non-stakeholder, money purchase 
scheme,. That could be a personal pension a defined 
contributions scheme or a group personal pension. As 
the Government have not accepted our principle that 
group personal pensions should automatically become 
stakeholder schemes if they satisfy the criteria, some 
employers may continue their group personal pension 
schemes while they run the new stakeholder scheme, 
which they are obliged by law to establish. The group 
personal pension scheme, unlike the occupational pension 
scheme, is not exempted, although the emphasis seems to 
be changing.
<P>
If my analysis is correct, it is plausible that some 
employers will have to calculate their class 1 contribution 
liabilities in four different ways for different categories of 
employee. That is complex. It has implications for 
systems, software and costs. If things go wrong there will 
be inspections by the Contributions Agency and ORPA. 
The issue is serious. The Government are in a muddle 
because they resisted our sensible idea of an open, 
permissive stakeholder structure, which includes group 
personal pensions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is talking 
too generally. He must restrict himself to the clause stand 
part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You are being very severe towards me this 
morning, Mr. Malins. I hope that you will agree that the 
need to have four different methods of calculating class 1 
contributions is germane to the clause it arises directly 
from it and all the problems that I have outlined are 
associated with it. I hope that I am permitted to say that, 
had the Government adopted our conception of the 
stakeholder pension, they could have avoided that 
complexity. For example, according to our definition, 
group personal pensions would have been stakeholder 
pensions. That would have reduced to three the number 
of possible ways of calculating class 1 contributions under 
the clause.
<P>
It would be wrong for Parliament to pass such a clause 
without touching on its implications for the costs and 
difficulties associated with the administration of class 1 
employers' insurance liabilities. I make no apology for 
saying that, in legislation, complexity itself is 
problematic. Wherever we can, we should avoid it and 
adopt simpler solutions. Perhaps the Government's failure 
to accept our solutions has got them into such a mess that 
they have no alternative. Perhaps we must accept the 
clause, along with our defeat on clause 1, in the wider 
national interest. However, as a result of those defeats, 
complexity is inevitable. I look forward to the Minister's 
response to that point.
<P>
So far, I have considered the part of the clause that 
deals with contributions, but I now turn to rebates. The 
clause was introduced against a background of disgraceful 
behaviour in respect of rebates. The Government's 
abolition of the dividend tax credit after the general 
election imposed a tax on pension funds of £5 billion a 
year that is directly related to rebates. Given that benefits 
anticipated on the basis of existing rebate levels could no 
longer be achieved because money had been removed 
from pension schemes by the abolition of the dividend 
tax credit or, as the Opposition like to describe it, the 
imposition of the pension tax the question arose whether 
contributions through the SERPS rebate to occupational 
or personal pension schemes should be revalued.
<P>
The Government responded by producing a differential 
rebate, which set a disgraceful precedent. I make the point 
forcefully because I do not want them to use the clause 
as a basis for repeating that mistake. Regrettably, the 
Government struck yet another blow to traditional, 
occupational pension schemes and to the principle of final 
salary schemes by failing to increase SERPS rebates paid 
to contracted-out, final salary schemes.
<P>
Next, the Government significantly increased the 
SERPS rebate to personal pension schemes. They did so 
because there was a danger that, in circumstances where 
personal pensions would represent a less good deal in 
relation to SERPS because of the reduction in investment 
return from a personal pension vehicle, people would 
respond to the imposition of the pension tax and the 
abolition of the dividend tax credit by contracting back 
into SERPS. That would have had budgetary 
consequences for the Minister's masters in the Treasury. 
Therefore, the Government had to increase the rebate to 
the personal pension.
<P>
However, no such competition with SERPS in respect 
of contracting back applied in the case of the 
contracted-out money purchase schemes. I doubt whether 
the public realise that, to save money and compensate for 
additional moneys paid to personal pensions by way of 
increased SERPS rebate, the Government actually reduced 
the rebate to the contracted-out money purchase schemes. 
That was a disgraceful act, based on the spurious 
argument that the provision of administrative costs 
applying to the calculation of SERPS rebate to 
contracted-out money purchase schemes was excessively 
generous. If that were the case, the Government Actuary 
should have advised accordingly and made the change 
irrespective of the introduction of the pension tax. 
However, the Government were caught out.
