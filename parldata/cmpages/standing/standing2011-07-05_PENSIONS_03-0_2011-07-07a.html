                  </span> I am glad to have the
opportunity to resume our debate under your chairmanship, Miss Clark.
The amendment asks us to consider a different way of arriving at an
appropriate retirement age. It is aimed not only at women, on whom we
spent a good deal of our previous debate, but men. As we know, life
expectancy has indeed improved substantially over a number of years,
and has even improved quite substantially during the past decade.
Between 2003-05 and 2007-09, life expectancy at birth improved from
76.5 years to 77.9 years for men, and from 80.9 years to 82 years for
women. However, life expectancy at the age of 65, which is crucial for
pension purposes, has also improved and, during that same period, the
time that men expect to live after the age of 65 increased from 16.7
years to 17.8 years. For women, it increased from 19.4 years to 20.4
years, so we are seeing considerable changes in the length of time
people
live.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000012">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
as my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North explained on
Tuesday, life expectancy varies considerably from one part of the
country to another. The lowest life expectancies both at birth and at
the age of 65 when such matters were last examined were in Greater
Glasgow and Clyde, where I spent 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 96<a class="bkMark" name="Column96">&#160;</a>
                  </div>considerable time over the past few weeks in Greenock and Inverclyde.
Obviously, wonderful views do not necessarily improve health greatly.
Perhaps that life expectancy is due to the hills that one has to go up
and down, although I suspect that it is due to more basic issues such
as income and life
chances.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000013">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
area is not the only place that shows such a differential.
Interestingly, the Western Isles also have a relatively low life
expectancy, so even living in an idyllic rural setting is not
necessarily the answer. Other places, as we would expect, are often
industrial or ex-industrial heartlands such as Liverpool, Hartlepool
and Blackburn. It is worrying that the gap between the highest life
expectancies and the lowest grew even during the past decade. The
advantages that we are seeing of longer life do not seem to be
increasing at the same rate. Those who already had greater health and
life expectancy have not been galloping ahead, but certainly cantering
ahead faster than those in areas and social groups that already had the
lower increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is a
matter of great concern to the Government, as it was to the previous
Government, that numerous reports have shown that the increase in life
expectancy is speeding up, although the differential remains and
appears to be growing. A figure that is quite striking from the various
reports shows that it took 70 years—from 1920 to 1990—for
average life expectancy at age 65 in the UK to rise by 5 years, but the
next 5-year increase took just 20 years between 1990 and 2010. The
class of 2010 are not, as some of us might like to think, those who
became MPs in 2010, but the retiring class of 2010 who were born in
1945—sometimes referred to as the cod liver oil and orange juice
generation, because as children they benefited from cod liver oil and
orange
juice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
who have not have experienced cod liver oil capsules at school do not
know what they have missed. I am sure the orange juice had lots of
oranges in it, but it had a slightly odd taste that I have never
experienced in any commercial brand. However, it does not appear to
have done us any great harm. I was not born in 1945, but I remember the
cod liver oil and orange juice. The 2010 class were the beneficiaries
of child welfare clinics, the new NHS and better
housing—markedly so for many families. That is of interest when
we consider what is going to happen to longevity later, and indeed how
we improve longevity for those who are not quite seeing the benefits.
Was it those early experiences that contributed to that longevity? Is
this genuinely the product—the final product—of that
welfare state
generation?<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
who reached 65 in 1990—the class born in 1925—were the
children of the depression. They had considerably poorer housing and
living standards, and there was no NHS. I am not sure whether what we
have seen recently is purely a result of the big improvements in the
immediate post-war period, or whether something more recent is driving
the improvements. To see such big changes within a decade suggests that
something quite significant is happening. The Government assume that
life expectancy will continue to rise at the same rate, and that
assumption has driven a lot of the reforms. If it continues to rise,
how are we as a country going to afford the financial obligations? If
we cannot afford to meet the financial obligations, we have to start
planning now.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000017">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We will not
know for some considerable time, but I suspect that the rapid increase
may not be replicated over the next 20 years. Someone has probably
researched this, but I do not see it necessarily replicated in the
assumptions in the Government documents that we have been looking at.
It might be unwise to assume that it will increase, although we are
assuming that. We know that many of us are living longer, but that is
not shared equally across the population. The Minister has spoken
strongly and passionately about intergenerational fairness, which is
important, but one aspect of fairness is horizontal fairness—the
fairness within
generations.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have already given examples of the big differences that can arise
between one part of the country and another. Many of us will be aware
of considerable variations within our own towns and cities. I am aware
of variations in Edinburgh in areas that are not a million miles away
from each other. Our local newspaper illustrated the problem by showing
two areas that were cheek by jowl, so it is not something to do with
the climate. The two areas are close to one another, but show
considerable variation in both life expectancy and healthy life
expectancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
years ago, the introduction of flexible retirement ages was much
discussed, although it seems to have disappeared from the horizon in
the current debate, with people having provision to retire on a sliding
scale between, say, 60 and 70—that was often the
suggestion—and to draw state pension, possibly reduced if people
had not completed enough years, at a variety of ages. The abolition of
the default retirement age, which I welcome, has gone some way to
improve flexibility, but the other aspect—people being able to
draw a pension at a variety of ages—appears to have disappeared
from the debate and been replaced by blanket increases, which do not
take into account individual or group circumstances. In those days, I
also seem to remember a fairly serious proposition about achieving
gender equality in retirement ages: we should reduce the male age
slightly and bring them together at 63. That did not happen, but it was
an
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000020">&#160;</a>

                  </span> My hon. Friend’s train
of thought is interesting. When we come to the private and occupational
pension sector, most of us are against one set age for
retirement—we want flexibility about working and when we can
draw that pension. The amendment tries to bring a little more
flexibility to the state pension age which, at the moment, the
Government still see as a set age, regardless of circumstance or
socio-economic
background.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000021">&#160;</a>

to give way because of the intervention by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon North. In occupational pension schemes, when people
choose to take their pension before the normal retirement age, it is
often actuarially reduced, usually based on the average life expectancy
in the scheme. Given people’s 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>different life expectancies, if one could take one’s state
pension early, might it be possible to reflect somehow one’s
life expectancy, based on contribution history or social class? Might
that be a possible way forward or worth looking
at?<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000023">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clearly, it is not always possible to look at
everyone’s individual circumstances. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon North is looking at a proxy for some of those
circumstances, rather than having to dig into everyone’s
particular health situation. On the general assumption that those who
started work earlier and perhaps have been in the kind of work that has
had a more deleterious effect on their health and are much more likely
to be suffering ill health in late middle age, the proxy of the number
of years of contributions takes us some way forwards. Obviously, others
who have made that number of contributions might not be in any way
affected but, until the number of contribution years was reduced
recently, some of us even were finding it difficult to meet the maximum
contributions in our working life, because of a relatively late start
and perhaps some time taken out of
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000024">&#160;</a>

that, as we discussed on Tuesday, the facility to defer one’s
pension, which has been around a long time, and the added facility to
take that deferment as a cash lump sum, which came in under the
Pensions Act 2004, when we were in a slightly
different—better—place, bring that flexibility if people
want to defer their pension. The amendment would introduce a bit of
flexibility earlier on when we start to raise the state pension

                  </strong> It is a useful way of seeing how the sliding
scale might work in giving people that degree of choice. There are
people who feel, having reached the current state pension
age—and potentially, into the future—that they are not
ready to leave work, and who have the opportunity to stay in work. With
the rules having changed and the default retirement age having been
abolished, it will be much easier for people to do that if they are fit
and able, and want to. Not everybody does have that opportunity, either
because of the type of job they do or the type of employment
arrangements that can be made. Some degree of flexibility could allow
us to reflect the reality that group and individual experiences are
very different. There are substantial numbers of men and women who are
economically inactive before state pension age, and this is a group
which is perhaps surprisingly larger than we might imagine. Among
those, some are people whom we would not see as being in any great
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are two
groups of people who are economically inactive in those years leading
up to state pension age. There are those who have made a positive
choice to retire early, possibly because they were in employment with
an earlier retirement age—which has been common in certain
occupations in the recent past, although this is changing—and
who had sufficient occupational pension provision to be able to retire
before their state pension came in. If the state pension is a
relatively small part of their replacement income in retirement, this
is quite a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 99<a class="bkMark" name="Column99">&#160;</a>
                  </div>rational and desirable option. For some people who have good
occupational cover, the state pension is additional income—to
which they have a clear right—but is not something upon which
they depend. They can make a choice, to say, “If I retire at 63,
and pick my occupational pension up at that age, I don’t get my
state pension for two years, but that doesn’t matter because
it’s really not that crucial to my income replacement.”
Indeed, when the cost of travel to work and other costs associated with
employment are factored in, it may well be that people are making an
extremely rational choice. That is one group: those who retire early,
before state pension age, because they have the financial ability to do
so, and want an opportunity to travel, or volunteer. These people are
often the backbone of organisations such as citizens advice bureaux,
for example. Obviously, this will change slightly as occupational
schemes and employers change their rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the second group who are economically inactive in this period and,
perhaps, the people at whom this amendment is directed, are those who
are not making a positive choice, but are involuntarily inactive. They
may have been made redundant later in life. I think we all know that it
is not easy for people who are made redundant in their late 50s or
early 60s to find other employment. That has been a reality for a
considerable number of years. Although age and experience have a lot to
offer employers, in certain types of occupation youth and
fitness—and sometimes cheapness—may well be what the
employer is looking for. There are also people whose health is, to a
degree, compromised. Ill-health often starts to affect people at that
particular point; there is a real increase in the number of people who
have substantial health problems as they approach retirement. It is not
the answer simply to say, “Out-of-work benefits are an adequate
substitute for the state pension, so people are provided for. If they
cannot work because they have been made redundant and haven’t
been able to find another job, or they’ve had an illness from
which they are recovering but they are not restored to full fitness,
there are other benefits that they can claim.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All those
other benefits, however, are subject to various conditions, some of
which are stringent. People must meet many conditions to claim
jobseeker’s allowance—they must attend job interviews and
show willingness to apply for jobs. Such conditions are extremely
important, particularly for younger people who become unemployed,
because it is crucial that they be encouraged and assisted to get back
into employment. However, the position is onerous for many people. I
have spoken to constituents, such as men in their early 60s who have
lost their employment. In their view, the conditionality—filling
in forms, writing CVs, attending job interviews—is humiliating
and is a pointless
occupation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Employment
and support allowance, to which people might be entitled if they become
ill, has various requirements, too. Unless people are in the support
group, they must go through various reassessments, which they find
stressful and difficult. Again, there is a significant difference
between someone of, say, 62 or 63, who has worked for most of their
life until illness has hit them; and someone who has become ill in
their 30s, who we all think should not stay on incapacity benefit for
ever. The previous Government introduced employment and support
allowance to tackle that, but we must look 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 100<a class="bkMark" name="Column100">&#160;</a>
                  </div>at its edges to see how it might affect some people particularly badly.
Crucially, the conditions that apply to other benefits will still apply
when universal credit is introduced—universal credit will not
alter that situation; it will re-badge it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Out-of-work
benefits are significantly lower than the state pension, which is
£30 a week more than jobseeker’s allowance. That is a
significant amount of money—it is a 40% increase in the income
that someone receives. Perhaps £30 a week does not sound
much—some people might say, “I spend £30 on a
couple of meals in the week; it is not much money to be
without.” However, for people who have left employment without
resources, savings, or an occupational pension, £30 is a
significant sum of money, and it must be taken into account. Although
people will receive means-tested benefits if they are on their own and
are unsupported, such benefits will not apply to others, such as those
who have a partner in
employment—<em>[</em>

data on economic inactivity rates, to use that quaint term, 39% of men
aged 62 are inactive; by age 63 it is 46%; and by 64, the year before
they receive their state pension, it is as much as 52%. Would it help
the Committee if the Minister told us how many of those people seeking
work in their final years before state pension age are successful in
getting jobs? Such data must be available to the Department and would
aid the Committee. Those people who are unsuccessful are left in a
twilight area, relying on benefits for other purposes as a kind of
pre-retirement pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000032">&#160;</a>

people—particularly men—in that age group who are
economically inactive. As I have said, some such people will be those
who have made a positive choice to get work. The figures before us do
not break down their ability to do so, and I would be interested to see
that. We all know people who have made exactly that choice and feel
that it is appropriate for them and gives them the opportunity to do
more while they are fit and well. In recent years, particularly in the
public sector but in the private sector as well, people have sometimes
been given nudges of encouragement to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
Member who spoke on Tuesday gave an example of someone who had taken a
package from a local authority that was calculated on the basis of how
long it would be until their state pension began and how affordable
such a package would be. The Minister said he found it surprising that
people should be endorsing choices not to work, but in my experience,
many people—certainly those who work in the university
sector—are given a lot of nudges of encouragement when budgets
are tight. Employers have not been unwelcoming to people who have
wanted to accelerate their retirement, because of the cost to the
department. The employer calculates the cost, and so does the local
authority. The slightly early retirement of certain senior members can
help the department’s budget, at which point it can hire a
younger person; it is not a redundancy. Calculations must be carried
out to show that such a move will not incur greater costs. All such
organisations must make those calculations.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000034">&#160;</a>

right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North just did, but it says
that 41.9% of men aged 60 to 64 are inactive, and of those who are
inactive in that age group, 38.8% are sick, injured or disabled. A
significant number simply are not in a position to seek work
actively.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000036">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is the group that we must be concerned
about. There will also be people who might not trigger the criteria for
employment and support allowance, given that many are found fit for
work. Some might be on ESA, some might be required to claim
jobseeker’s allowance and some might not be able to claim
anything much, for example if they have a partner who is working. One
need not earn a substantial amount to be ineligible.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
also significant issues about the need to use up savings, although it
is true that that stops after people’s savings have decreased to
below the threshold. However, the only amount untouched is
£6,000. Above that, savings are offset against the benefit to be
received. People will dig into their savings during that period if they
have any; not all of them do. Given that people have often worked hard
to save money and see it as money to enhance their retirement and help
them in case they suffer significant health problems or need care,
having to use it up is a double aggravation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Someone who
has worked for the substantial number of years that would entitle them
to a full pension but who cannot draw it for some external
reason—either because of their health or due to a loss of
employment—will find it difficult to have to claim the other
benefits available. They are not as good as the state pension, which
people feel they have earned and have a right to, without being
required to attend loads of interviews and prove that they are making
lots of job applications and sit through courses that are probably of
little relevance. It might be sensible for existing programmes to focus
on younger age groups to ensure that they work, and there is a cost to
all of that, which is not always factored
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000039">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">If
it is accepted that there is an issue about people who are not easily
able to continue working even up to age 65 now, let alone when the
pension age increases, and they have worked continuously and therefore
have a good record of contributing to and having earned their pension,
the system should allow greater flexibility. It would be the
counterpoint of what my right hon. Friend described, in that someone
wishing to defer their state pension has an incentive to do so and has
the opportunity to take it as a lump sum or to earn a larger pension.
For people who desire that, such an opportunity represents an
attractive
incentive.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000040">&#160;</a>

fairness across generations and social groups. However much we all hope
that such things will change and however much we have an aspiration
that differences in health, life expectancy and life chances will be
overcome, we know, if we are realistic, that that will not happen
terrifically quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000041">&#160;</a>

are embedded in early life, which can have a significant impact, it
will take several years to make an impact. As I have argued, if the
welfare state provisions in the immediate post-war period are still
flowing through and having an impact, anything done now will not
necessarily help this generation of people approaching retirement or,
indeed, people in a slightly younger age group. We would all want that
to change, but to say that we have an aspiration to remove the
differences and that everything will therefore be well is a little
unrealistic. Successive Governments have attempted to do that, and one
irony is that improvements in health seem to accrue to those who are
already healthier and wealthier than
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000042">&#160;</a>

people. Does she agree that, just as the 1945 Government in many
respects set the scene for what came decades later—we are still
discussing it today—the Government’s ideas on state
pension ages will set the scene for much of this century and the
discussion about what is fair for manual workers, as opposed to what is

                  </strong> Obviously it is my right hon. Friend’s
amendment and I will leave him to deal with this in due course when he
replies. These things are important because if we do not look seriously
at how we deal with people we could find ourselves in a few
years’ time realising that we have damaged the later-life
chances of some of our population. While I personally can see no
particular difficulty in being able to be in employment at 66, 67,
68—and indeed, the electorate willing, who

know from my constituents that very many people are not easily able to
continue in employment at that crucial age, into their 60s. Sometimes
they want to work but cannot do so because the jobs are not there and
they have lost the employment they have had, but very often their
health is compromised. It is useful to look at whether there are
arrangements that could give us that flexibility. That was under
serious discussion some years ago and we have lost something in moving
away from that to a blanket increase regardless of people’s

                  </strong> I am pleased to speak in support of the
amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North
because he raises a vital issue, which goes to the heart of the problem
of sharing the costs of longevity—how we ensure that those costs
are shared fairly. He very generously conceded that he is asking the
Pensions Minister to give careful thought to an issue that my right
hon. Friend did not find the opportunity to address adequately while
serving as Pensions Minister in the Labour Government. But my right
hon. Friend should not be too hard on himself because he did, of
course, deal with other important areas of policy, including setting up
the Pension Protection Fund and possibly—if my memory serves me
correctly—initiating discussions about the reform of public
sector pensions, which we did only a few years ago. Suffice it to say
that my right hon. Friend is very well respected in this field, and as
he has spent his time on the Back Benches giving it much thought I am
sure that hon. Members, particularly the Pensions Minister, will give
serious consideration to his proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My right hon.
Friend’s amendment has immediate attractions for several
reasons. It struck me very strongly, when reading the letters that I
received from women constituents affected by the changes proposed to
state pension age, how many of them had been working since leaving
school at age 15 or 16. I should like to have looked up the statistic
revealing how many of the cohort worst affected by those changes
actually did leave school and join the Labour market at such a young
age, but I am sure we are all aware that when those women reached age
15 or 16, in the late 1960s, far fewer young people went on to higher
education than do today. I also suspect—although I do not
know—that at that time the proportion of women going on to
higher education may have been substantially lower than that of men of
the same age.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Happily, that
situation has changed and far more young people are going on to higher
education—at least for now. I am not confident about future
trends when the education maintenance allowance ceases in a few weeks
and tuition fees rise to £9,000 a year. I do not know whether
that will still apply, but I am fairly confident that young women as
well as young men are taking advantage of the opportunities for further
or higher education, perhaps taking gap years and undertaking
postgraduate study, with the result that probably a substantial
minority of them do not, as my right hon. Friend noted on Tuesday,
start paying regular national insurance contributions until they are
well into their 20s.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>

			Column number: 104<a class="bkMark" name="Column104">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Returning to
the point about the women affected by changes to the state pension
ages, it struck me that one reason why they felt so aggrieved was that
they had been paying into the system for a long time. Some of them, if
they work up to their new retirement age of 65 or 66, will
have been paying those contributions for 51 years—many more
years than I expect to pay my contributions for if I retire in my mid
to late 60s.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I acknowledge
that one of the difficulties that the Minister would face in dealing
with the principle in the amendment and turning it into a practical
proposition would be the disjointed character of women’s
participation in the labour market. As we know, when a full state
pension depends on completing 40 years of national insurance
contributions, many women do not qualify because they have substantial
gaps in their contribution records, having taken breaks to have
children and to care for them when they were young. Increasingly, many
women have to care for partners, elderly parents or other relatives.
Therefore, as my right hon. Friend suggested on Tuesday, it might be
necessary to look at the date of entering the labour market—it
would have to be a proper entry rather than the occasional holiday
job—rather than at the total number of years of contributions. I
acknowledge that that is far from straightforward, but as we have
already noted in Committee, many hon. Members place a great deal of
faith in the Minister, so I assume that he is capable of meeting such a
challenge. I think that many hon. Members will think it is a challenge
worth meeting, because it recognises the importance of the contributory
principle that underpins our welfare state. People should receive some
recognition that they have worked hard, paid in and earned their
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, we cannot have a straightforward contributory principle because
not only those who have paid should receive a pension. We rightly take
account of those who are unable to pay due to caring responsibilities,
disability or unemployment. However, that principle has an element of
basic fairness, which people wish to see in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second attraction of the proposal is that it would start to address the
inequality in pension received. As both my right hon. Friend and the
hon. Member for Arfon noted when speaking to an earlier amendment,
there are still substantial differences in life expectancy according to
both location and social class. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
East also illustrated that point with reference to her own
constituency. Such differences are well known and acknowledged in the
Department’s own impact assessment. Figures from the Office for
National Statistics show that between 2002 and 2005, life expectancy
for men at age 65 varied from 18.3 years for those in social class I to
14.1 years for those in social class V. Among women, the difference is
similarly stark. Women professionals who retire at 65 can
expect to live 22 years after they retire, compared with 17.7 years for
women undertaking routine unskilled
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
differences are significant. A man or woman in the highest social
class, who perhaps enjoyed many years of education and probably worked
in fairly pleasant surroundings, can expect to enjoy more than four and
a half years of retirement more than a school friend who started work
at 16 and did a physically demanding job, perhaps in less pleasant
environments. I am sure that we all remember the women spoken about by
many of my hon. Friends, both in Committee and on Second

described only as back-breaking jobs, whether it was at a

making cigarettes for Player’s or working at the Raleigh

               <p class="tabbed">Thinking
about Nottingham brings me to the issue of regional variation, which
reflects historical employment opportunities in an area. I did not grow
up in Nottingham so I am not sure it if is absolutely true, but people
tell me that people who worked at the Player’s factory got free
cigarettes alongside their weekly pay packet. That sounds plausible and
may be one of the reasons why Nottingham has high levels of smoking,
chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease and cancer. Certainly, life
expectancy in our city, 75.1 years for men and 80.1 years for women, is
lower than the east midlands averages of 77.8 and 81.8
respectively, and the national averages for England and Wales of 77.8
and 81.9.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
differences in life expectancy between social classes and regions
prompt the question of whether it is fair for those who pay into the
system for the longest—having done some of the most physically
demanding, monotonous and probably low paid jobs—should retire
and receive their state pension at the same time as those who have
contributed for fewer years, especially when those same people are
likely to enjoy a longer retirement. Not just a longer retirement but,
as my hon. Friend mentioned, a healthier retirement, an issue that is
perhaps not fully explored in my right hon. Friend’s excellent
paper, which I am sure we have all read.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">According to
the Office for National Statistics general lifestyle survey of 2008,
33% of people aged 65 to 74 have a limiting, long-standing
illness. As I noted on Tuesday in response to some of the concerns
raised by the hon. Member for Arfon about the Welsh experience,
disability-free life expectancy varies enormously by social class and
location as well. ONS figures for disability-free life expectancy at
age 65 by local authority area in England and Wales—I am not
able to comment on the Scottish experience—show that for men
this ranges from 10.5 years in Hart, to 4.2 years in Easington, and for
women from 11.7 years in Epsom and Ewell to 5.3 years in
Merthyr Tydfil.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000060">&#160;</a>

                  </div>that we do not have to look at the extremes in order to see the size of
this difference. While many of those will still live longer in
retirement, their ability to enjoy that retirement may be markedly
less.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill accelerates the increase in state pension age to 66. The
Government’s Green Paper “A state pension for the 21st
century”, contemplates going further, either creating a
mechanism to link further rises in state pension age to increases in
life expectancy, or introducing the idea of regular reviews. Figures
produced by Nigel Stanley at the TUC show that if the state pension age
went up to 70, professionals in social class I would loose 27% of their
current expected retirement, whereas for unskilled workers the loss
would be 35%. We need to consider how to mitigate the discriminatory
impacts of future state pension age changes if we are to retain
fairness in the system. My right hon. Friend’s amendment
provides a suggestion for a way to do that, and I hope the Minister
will respond positively to the dialogue and discussion it
provokes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000063">&#160;</a>

to hear my hon. Friend for Edinburgh West say that, due to mortality
rates and the fact that people from more affluent backgrounds live
longer as a rule, they can decide to defer their pensions. That is
something my sister has done. She has her own business, she continues
to work, and she does not want to retire. She has deferred her pension
and is very pleased because, as she explained to me, if she took her
pension now and invested it she would get a tiny amount back, but by
leaving it in the pot, it increases by a considerable amount. She is in
a lucky position where she can make that decision and get a greater
amount—probably for the same amount of time—than somebody
who took their pension now and did not have the prospective number of
years ahead. I have just realised I have outed my sister as a pensioner

association between health and social class has always been there and
has always been accepted. I remember when he was the Secretary of State
for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and
St Pancras (Frank Dobson) said that health was the greatest
class issue of all. Someone from the lower classes does not have a long
life; they have a more hard-working life. He said that the biggest
discrimination between the classes is health, because someone from the
lower classes is more likely to die at a younger age. That is true

towards closing it and the people who write to us are often at the
sharp end of things—others would claim that as long as those
premises are improving at all levels of society and people are living
longer, there is no cause for concern. I think that there is, because
it depends what is meant by “living”. A person may be
alive, but is it a life? My mother began work in a bakery when she was
15. She is still alive and she claims her pension, but she would say
that her quality of life is poor, because she was one of those who
worked in an unregulated industry and she now has emphysema. Those
work-related illnesses tend to affect working class people, rather than
those from the middle or upper classes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000066">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">From
the research that has been done and the Office for National Statistics
figures that came out last month, it is clear that a good job and a
good home in a nice district are likely to bring someone an extra 10
years of life. The life expectancy gap between the middle classes in
comfortable suburbs and the low paid in the areas that I represent is
widening. Boys born in the wealthier part of the country can expect to
live 11.3 years longer than those in the least favoured cities in
Britain. For girls that gap is 10.1 years. In the districts with the
greatest life expectancy, such as wealthy Kensington and Chelsea in
London, a newborn girl is likely to live almost 90 years. A century
ago, people did not reach anywhere near that. The 1911 census showed
that the average woman lived to 54. I am two years beyond that now.
Men, on average, lived to
50.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
figures that came out last month showed that boys in this country can,
on average, expect to live for 77.9 years and girls for 82 years. In
Kensington, however, a newborn boy can hope to reach 84 and a newborn
girl can hope to reach 89. In the least healthy areas of Glasgow and
Clyde, the ONS figures, based on evidence from 2007 to 2009, said that
the expectation was that a boy would live to 73 and girl to 79. That
showed that the life expectancy gap between the upper and lower classes
has broken the 10-year mark for the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Office for National Statistics said in its report that the greatest
growth in male life expectancy at birth was experienced by those in
lower managerial and professional classes. It added that neighbourhood
characteristics also have an effect on life expectancy, and that people
in rural areas live longer. Michelle Mitchell of Age UK
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“As

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The variation
in life expectancy is recognised in all studies including, in a
converse way, by annuity providers. A conventional annuity is the
simplest type of pension income plan on the market. A person gives the
pension  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 108<a class="bkMark" name="Column108">&#160;</a>
                  </div>provider a lump sum, and the provider works out how long that person is
likely to live based on their health, lifestyle and gender. It then
provides an annuity for that number of years. Because of the
discrepancy in life expectancy between wealthy and less privileged
parts of the UK, an element of risk is factored into those
calculations. Advanced IT systems can now make more accurate
predictions about how long someone will live using data that goes right
down to their local postcode.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Annuity
providers would say that an elderly man living in a prestigious part of
west London such as Kensington and Chelsea will on average have a much
longer life expectancy than a man living in the most deprived part of
Glasgow. That gap can be as high as 13 years. According to
annuity providers, areas where life expectancy is highest include
places such as east Dorset, Wokingham, south Norfolk, the Chilterns,
Horsham, Brentwood and—unexpectedly—Crawley.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are
discussing the whole issue of the welfare state. Pensions are a key
area of that, and the contributory principle of pensions was referred
to earlier. People may live longer, but if that is due to medical
advances we need to look at people’s lifestyles. Do they have a
healthy life? Will they have an enjoyable retirement? The amendment is
important because somebody who pays into their pension for 49 years
will contribute for 49 years to the pensions of other generations. That
is the principle of the national insurance system: people pay when they
do not need support so that support is available when they do need it.
The Minister accepts, welcomes and even celebrates that principle; he
mentioned it on Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
Government’s mantras is that of making work pay. I agree: work
should pay. If someone has worked for 49 years, they should be sure
that they are paying to provide pensions for others, but also that they
are contributing towards the pension on which they will need to draw
when they stop working. It seems now that those who start work at 16
could work for their whole life but will receive the least when they
reach retirement. The Bill seeks to encourage and improve pensions, and
make sure that more people have them. Fairness is integral to that. If
someone starts working at an early age, works hard and for a long time
but is not able to retire for as long as other people and cannot defer
their pension and get an increased amount because of their life
expectancy, the public will see that that is unfair. I welcome the
amendment; it has been interesting to listen to the different aspects

two aspects to lifecycle inequalities. We are mainly talking about
people who may have left school aged 15 or 16 which, in a sense, means
that they will have consumed fewer public resources than many of us who
stayed on in the education system for rather longer. At the other end
of the lifecycle, however, those people are also consuming fewer state

proportionality. If someone has worked for 49 years, the
proportion of their income that they will have paid into the pensions
of other people is quite high. They may then have to wait longer and
receive less money

               <p class="tabbed">I was
speaking about my constituency in Wales. I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham South, who spoke about the role of
women. It is all very well saying that women will live longer, but the
statistics give no idea of their roles. I think of my mother, who is
one of those born in 1954. She will kill me for revealing her age; I
will not be able to go home tonight or speak to her for a week, because
she will probably shout about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I shall tell
the Committee about my mother’s career. After we were born
mother brought us up, so she has a gap in her pension record. She then
worked as a sewing machinist and her hands are already starting to go.
She now works as a receptionist. Before that, she worked on the
railways and was jumping down off the trains, and her knees started to
go. I think of her quality of life; perhaps there will come a
point—she reaches the age of 60 the year after next—when
she will no longer be able to work.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is very
well saying that women tend to work on until the age of 62, but what is
the rationale for that? The Government go on an awful lot about
fairness. We often accuse them of stealing our clothes, but where is
the fairness in saying to people born in 1954 that all of a sudden they
have to make some sort of preparation? It comes out of the blue; like
many Government policies it is dropped on us. They use statistics and
the wonderful phrase “evidence-based”. That is all that
we ever hear from them. However, I see people in my constituency, and
women who have worked hard all their lives getting—  
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>I was about to say something wrong, there Ms Clark; I was going to say
that they were getting the “something” end of the stick.
I see them getting the pain. To be honest, we need to support the
amendment. Those who have worked from the age of 15 need a guarantee
that at the end of the 49 years they have something at the end of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
seriously believe that the Government are setting a precedent. If we
keep increasing the pension age—at the moment, we propose making
it 66—because people are living longer and we have had the worst
recession in living memory, what will happen in 10 years’ time?
What if the Government’s big gamble does not pay off? What if
they do not pay off the deficit? Who will get the pain then? Are we
going to see the pension age being moved up to 70 in 10 years’
time? Will it go up to 75 in 25 years, with no safeguard? I wonder.
That is why I support the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000088">&#160;</a>

your chairmanship again, Miss Clark. I thank my right hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon North for tabling the amendment and for offering us
the opportunity to debate an alternative means of increasing the state
pension age. It is clear that there is significant unease about the
plans under the Bill that will affect so many women—as we
discussed on Tuesday—as well as those men and women who have
worked in manual jobs, often since the ages of 15 or 16, which is why
the amendment is so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000090">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Government will be pleased with the suggestion of my right
hon. Friend, who has great experience in such matters. No doubt his
amendment will carry substantial weight in their minds. It asks the
Government to ensure that the pensionable age is reached no later than
49 years after entry into employment. I believe that my right hon.
Friend wants them to consider the amendment in the spirit in which it
is intended, which is to ensure fairness within a generation or a year
group, as well as between
generations.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
story told by my right hon. Friend on Tuesday of his constituent should
ring true in all our constituencies, as should the understanding that
many people in manual employment face markedly different life
expectancy from those in the professional and managerial classes. It is
for that reason that the Government should seriously consider the
spirit of the amendment, because the issues of social class raised by
my right hon. Friend, as well as regional differences, are vital. I
want to set out the facts that make the amendment important, and I hope
that members of the Committee consider it valuable to consider the pros
and cons of the
suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000092">&#160;</a>

my right hon. Friend highlighted and knows from his time as Pensions
Minister, such an issue is not an easy fix. Turner acknowledged the
problem in his report in chapter 8, part 5, when he stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“it
remains the case that men in socio-economic class V face life
expectancy in retirement that is about five years lower than
socio-economic class I (for women the difference is about three years),
and that as a percentage of expected life in retirement, a one year
increase in SPA has a bigger impact on people in the lower
socio-economic groups than in the
highest.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Minister acknowledged that on Second Reading, when he thanked my right
hon. Friend for his characteristically thoughtful speech. In his
winding-up

			Column number: 111<a class="bkMark" name="Column111">&#160;</a>
                  </div>statement on Second Reading, he also referred to missing national
insurance records. It will be good to hear the hon. Gentleman’s
further thoughts about the practical steps involved under the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
spirit of this morning’s discussion has shown a similar interest
in the issue to that shown on Second Reading. Such facts will be based
on the various differences in life expectancies within and between

Friend the Member for Croydon North said. It is a vital issue, so let
us examine the facts now. The difference in life expectancy between
socio-economic groups and geographical areas is linked to the types of
work done by people, their lifestyles and their options. For example,
there are significant differences between rural and urban areas, as
highlighted by the Oxford Institute of Ageing in its ageing study in
January this

important that every Member of the House engages with the issue, and it

issues raised, not just by the amendment but by the spirit of the

                  </strong> I thought I heard a peep, but I did not. A key
factor that the amendment seeks to address is the differences in when
people start working. Many people still leave school at the ages of 16
and 18 to start work, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 113<a class="bkMark" name="Column113">&#160;</a>
                  </div>but we all know—Opposition members of the Committee have given
examples from their own families and constituencies—about the
different ages at which people start work, particularly in the
generation under discussion. When I was at school, some of us left at
16 while others went on to study until our early or mid-20s. Time spent
in work differs across socio-economic groups. It has also changed over
time, as Members have attested to this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
the time that many people, especially those in manual work, come to
retirement age, they are often worn out. Today, a 65-year-old man may
have worked for 50 years, as is clear from the stories recorded in
Committee and on Second Reading. For a 65-year-old who has worked in a
physically demanding job for five years less, the difference is stark.
Perhaps that is also one of the reasons that explains the differential
life expectancies and healthy life expectancies at age 65. As we ask
people to work longer, it is important to look at the alternatives to
periodic increases for everyone in the state pension age, and to
understand what we are demanding of those who are affected by
politicians’ choices—that is, to look at the impact on
our
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000110">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Before
looking at life expectancy by social group, I want to touch on another
issue highlighted by hon. Members—healthy life expectancy, which
is not rising as quickly as life expectancy, as the Government
assessment of the Bill indicates. In 2006, men and women of 65, on
average, could expect to enjoy about three extra years of healthy life
compared with 1981. Life expectancy has increased by around 4.6 years
during the same time, so we can see a difference between healthy life
expectancy and life expectancy of about 1.5 years over that period.
When we look at the state pension age, particularly how people in
different socio-economic groups are affected, it is important to look
not only at how long people live but at what sort of life they live in
retirement. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead made
that point extremely well when speaking about her own
family.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">According
to the Office for National Statistics spring 2010 <em>Health Statistics
Quarterly</em>, at age 65 a gap of 6.54 years in healthy life
expectancy was present between professionals and the unskilled class.
Professional men had significantly higher healthy life expectancy and
unskilled men significantly lower health expectancy compared with the
intervening social classes, both at birth and at age 65. As we increase
the state pension age, we should look into how we are potentially
differentially impacting different social
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I have alluded to already, what makes the amendment so important is the
stark differences in life expectancies at state pension age, which can
be seen in income and class terms and in geographical terms. The
differences bear setting out in detail. First, looking at life
expectancy by socio-economic group, if we take men in social class
I—higher managers and professionals—7% died before the
age of 65, whereas, of men in routine occupations, 19% or almost one
fifth did so; that is a ratio of 2.6:1 between the two class
groups. Men are more than two and a half times more likely to die
before their 65th birthday if they do a routine job,
compared with a higher managerial or professional worker. Of all the
statistics we have heard, to me that is probably the most 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 114<a class="bkMark" name="Column114">&#160;</a>
                  </div>shocking. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North
highlighted on Tuesday, that is a significant
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Going
through the class groups, of high managerial and professional men, 7%
die before their 65th birthday; for women in that class, the figure is
4%. In the lower managerial and professional class, 10% of men die
before their 65th birthday, and 5% of women; in the third or
intermediate social group, 11% of men and 5% of women; in the fourth
group, of small employers and own account workers, 12% of men and 6% of
women; of lower supervisory and technical workers, 14% of men and 7% of
women; of those in semi-routine jobs, 17% of men and 7% of women; and,
of those in the routine jobs who I mentioned earlier, 19% of men and
10% of women. The data come from the
ONS.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
shorter life expectancy is not only a devastating reality but also
means that the pension years, in which different social classes can
expect to draw their pension, are vastly different as well. A
longitudinal study from the ONS shows that, at age 65, men in the
professional class are expected to live an extra 18.3 years, and the
women 22 years; in the managerial and technical class, men 18 years and
women 21 years; for skilled and non-manual workers, men 17.4 years and
women 19.9 years; for skilled and manual men, 16.3 years,
and the women 18.7 years; for partly skilled men, 15.7 years, and the
women 18.9 years; and for unskilled men, 14.1 years, and the women 17.7
years. We can see from those statistics the big differences in life
expectancy at age
65.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
does that mean for the pensions of the different groups? The difference
in life expectancy between men in unskilled work and men in
professional jobs at the age of 65 is 4.3 years. Claiming a state
pension for 4.3 years amounts to a difference of
£21,500. These men not only die earlier, but get less out during
their lifetime in retirement. Therefore, they spend more time in the
labour market and draw their pension for fewer years in retirement.
Moreover, the professional retiree is much less likely to rely on the
state pension in their retirement. Such facts are worth taking into
account when we look at the state pension age to see whether it is fair
to people from different socio-economic groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
there has been an increase in longevity at the age of 65 across all
socio-economic groups, there remain big differences between manual and
non-manual workers and also big differences in healthy life expectancy.
Some 87% of men in manual jobs at the age of 50 can expect to live
until they are 66, while the figure for men in non-manual jobs is
91%.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is
great diversity between areas, which was highlighted by my hon. Friends
the Members for Erith and Thamesmead, for Nottingham South and for
Edinburgh East. The statistic highlighted most regularly and used by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North is that while life
expectancy at 65 in Glasgow is 78.8, it is 87.7 in Kensington and
Chelsea. That is a difference between two cities in different parts of
the country. Why do statistics show a similar story? Life expectancy in
the UK at age 65 for men is 17.8 years, while for women it
is 20.4 years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us now
break those figures down into the different nations in the UK. In
England, life expectancy at 65 for men is 18 years, while it is 20.6
years for women. In Wales at age 65, men are expected to live for an
additional 17.4 years and women an additional 20.1 years. I am 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 115<a class="bkMark" name="Column115">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sorry to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East that in
Scotland, men are expected to live for 16.6 years and women
for 19.1 years. We do not have any hon. Members from Northern Ireland
here, but men in Northern Ireland at age 65 are expected to live for an
additional 17.2 years while women are expected to live for 20
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we look at the south-east, the area with the highest life expectancy at
age 65, men are expected to live for an additional 18.7 years while
women are expected to live for an additional 21.3 years. In the
north-east and the north-west, the area in England with the lowest life
expectancy, men are expected to live for an additional 17 years and
women for an additional 19.5
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are well aware of the differences between regions, but there are also
stark differences in the prospects of people who live just streets away
from each other, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East
highlighted. In Leeds, where I am a Member of Parliament, life
expectancy is 12.2 years lower for men and 8.3 years lower for women at
age 65 in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived
areas. When those areas sit just a few miles apart, for example New
Wortley in my constituency or Harewood, it is clear that we have a
significant issue. The reasons for that are manifold. One relates to
the types of work that people do. Many 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 116<a class="bkMark" name="Column116">&#160;</a>
                  </div>people who worked at the Roberts factory in my constituency over the
past 30 years have contracted asbestosis and mesothelioma and died
early deaths, and that was as a direct result of the work that they
did. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead touched on that
point earlier
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11070735000121">&#160;</a>

with a blizzard of figures and statistics, so it is hard to keep up

equalised as time goes on as different forms of health and safety
measures are brought in, such as regulations? The gaps are decreasing
