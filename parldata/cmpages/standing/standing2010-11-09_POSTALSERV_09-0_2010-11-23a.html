                           </strong> I do not wish to repeat myself, but I have said
several times that there are differences between the 2009
Bill and this one, the most important being the public ownership stake.
The 2009 Bill clearly kept the majority stake in public ownership while
seeking a private partner to inject cash at some point. That is totally
different from a completely privatised Royal Mail. The circumstances
are very different.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000017">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We need more
information. What happened in the 1980s left people cynical about the
way shares were dangled around with the idea of enticing people to buy
them who had perhaps never bought shares before. It was seen by
many––and who can blame them?––as a way to
make a quick few pounds. How many employees still possess shares in the
companies that they work for? What is the average length of time that
employees kept their shares? I can see that few members of the
Committee are old enough to remember the “Tell Sid”
campaign. It was characterised by a worm-like creature with its head
held high. I see that puzzled look on the face of the hon. Member for
Folkestone and Hythe, so he is clearly far too young to remember.
Unfortunately, all that left us with a slightly cynical view. We very
much hope that this employee share scheme will be very different and
much more positive.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000018">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I learn things by the day. I always admired the
father of the hon. Member for Worcester, who of course had a very
important role in Wales. Let us return to the detail of the Bill, or
perhaps rather the lack of detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We accept the
principle of employee shares, but employees need to know a lot more
about exactly how any scheme would work. We would like a proportion
larger than 10% in the employee share scheme and greater certainty
about the eligibility criteria. Who would be entitled to shares or
share options and what would it mean in practice? In fact, there is
still much that we need to know about the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me turn
to subsection (2) of our amendments. Clause 3 says that it is only when
nothing is left in public ownership that the employee share scheme will
be at least 10% of the privatised Royal Mail. What if only part of
Royal Mail is sold off? Supposing a proportion was left in public
ownership, what would happen with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 297<a class="bkMark" name="Column297">&#160;</a>
                           </div>employee shares? Amendment 23 proposes a sliding scale so that at least
10% of what is privatised would go to an employee share scheme;
amendment 22 proposes a figure of at least 20%. I shall consider the
question of 10 or 20%
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of subsection (2) in each amendment is to enshrine the
principle of employee shares no matter what proportion of Royal Mail is
sold off. We could envisage the Government retaining only a small
proportion in public ownership, perhaps as little as 10%, 5% or 1%. As
the Bill is drafted, that would mean not having an employee share
scheme. We would like a much clearer indication that if a small
proportion of Royal Mail were privatised, there would still be an
obligation to have an employee share
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know from our previous debates that there is as yet considerable
uncertainty as to exactly how privatisation of Royal Mail will proceed.
Whatever the intention is, the amendments provide an option that would
ensure that there were still employee shares if less than 100% was
privatised. Amendment 23 proposes a sliding scale so that 10% of
whatever is privatised would go to an employee share scheme; the figure
is 20% in amendment 22. This is about enshrining the
principle of employee shares no matter what proportion of Royal Mail is
sold off. Subsection (2) is important to ensure that there are no
excuses for not setting up a scheme. No matter how small a proportion
of Royal Mail is sold off, we expect to see one. To us, that is very
important. Any change in the status of the ownership of Royal Mail
should provide an ideal opportunity for setting up a scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our preferred
amendment, amendment 22, specifies that the employee share scheme
should consist of at least 20% of the proportion of the company that is
not owned by the Crown. Over the past 20 years in the industrialised
world, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of
employees who own shares in their own firms. That has happened in the
UK, other European Union countries and the USA. By 2004, a fifth of
British workplaces had share ownership schemes, covering a third of all
private sector employees. The benefits of such schemes have been widely
recognised. They can include motivating employees to become more
productive, helping to align the employees’ interests with those
of shareholders, remunerating employees in a tax-efficient way,
increasing loyalty and reducing staff turnover.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, employee share schemes cannot do that on their own. They have
to be part of a wider approach to good industrial relations. Given the
more generalised benefits of such schemes and the very significant
efforts made by employees to implement the modernisation programme, it
seems appropriate to reward that effort by making available an
increased proportion of the company for an employee share scheme. That
is why the amendment proposes that 20% of the company be made available
for such a scheme. We know that any privatisation of Royal Mail will
inevitably entail a lot of change and upheaval. Its success will rely
heavily on the good will of the work force and on improved industrial
relations—and on those relations remaining improved. It would
therefore be appropriate to try to give a greater proportion of the
company shares to the work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is still a relatively modest proposal. It would not radically
change the balance of power between employee shareholders and other
shareholders. I would be interested to know what consideration the

                           </div>Minister has given to allowing proportions of employee ownership that
are higher than 10%. If such levels have been considered, why have they
been rejected in favour of keeping the maximum as “at least
10%”? Of course, that phrase leaves the door open to keeping the
level at only 10%. It allows for more, but we are left wondering why
the level has been set at “at least 10%” and not
higher.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000027">&#160;</a>

want to reinforce that point. I think that 10% is quite low and I think
that there is a danger that if it is just shares and there isn’t
a participation culture that goes with it, it won’t change a
lot. We see real results in companies where the whole of the company
feel that they have a sense of ownership. They feel that they
participate in decisions. They discuss decisions and when they make a
decision they stick with it. It was interesting watching some of our
members through the recession. Employee-owned companies are affected
the same as everybody else. They would have gone through an awful lot
of agony about how you manage through different times but, because
those decisions were made in a very participative way, once the
decisions were made they were stuck to, and bought into, by everybody.
Our members have gone through the recession in a very resilient way and
I think that is down to the way you manage the

benefits for the Royal Mail in considering employee ownership would be
giving employees who work in that organisation a real stake in the
company, a real interest in delivering an excellent service to the
customers and service users, finding, as Peter said, the right way to
solve problems. They look at it not as something that is done to them,
but as something they own and have a bit of control and influence over.

are very strong reasons for strengthening the employee share scheme by

Bill, in contrast to earlier Bills, tries to enshrine some employee
share ownership, which is welcome. Obviously, however, whether the
level is 10% or 20% would affect the amount of value transfer from the
taxpayer to employees. Does the hon. Lady expect that, if her amendment
were agreed to, employees would have to contribute to that transfer of
value, which would have increased from 10% to 20%, or would they be
given it for

new subsection (3) proposes an equitable division of shares and the
dividends that accrue from them. The amendment proposes that equal
dividends must be paid to all participants. This may be obvious, but
schemes can be set up in which the division is not so equitable and
some receive more than others. There are various models. For example, a
scheme can be limited to certain key employees, who may have scarce
managerial or technical skills. Alternatively, the system could consist
of a combination of schemes providing more favourable terms for
directors. It is possible to have an enterprise management incentive
scheme for directors and a share incentive plan for other
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000035">&#160;</a>

know what type of scheme is envisaged. We would like to see the most
equitable type possible, in which people feel that they are being
treated as valuable individuals no matter who they are, and in which no
hierarchy is attached to the whole procedure. In terms of employee
motivation and participation, that is an extremely important issue that
will need to be thoroughly dealt with before any such scheme is
acceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new subsection (4) relates to the detail of the employee scheme. The
clause provides very little such detail. It is also vague about how far
advanced arrangements are for the establishment of an employee share
scheme. Current legislation could, for example, allow the creation of
an option-based incentive scheme restricted to management. In order to
ensure that the employee share scheme performs as we should like to see
it do and genuinely encourages share ownership across Royal
Mail’s employees, more information on the scheme will be
required. That is the reason why we have included proposed
new subsection (4) in amendments 22 and 23. It would require
the Secretary of State to make a report to Parliament which would
include the precise terms of the scheme and the expected time scale for
its introduction.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000037">&#160;</a>

considerably more clarity and information, as there can be widely
differing interpretations of what an employee share scheme means.

touched briefly on some of the different models. As Carole Leslie told

need to think carefully about the model that you want to go for. The
benefit of an employee benefit trust is that it is very stable. It is
easy to administer, you do not have the turnover of shares, you do not
have to think about people buying and then

difficult to give people a tangible sense of ownership if they do not
have the bit of paper that says that they are an owner of the company,
but companies such as John Lewis Partnership and others do a great job
with that. A lot of it comes down to how you enshrine the employee
voice, and how governance of the trust is implemented...If you go for
individual share ownership, there are mechanisms such as the share
incentive plan, which gives tax benefits to employees. Even if you do
not see a lot of growth in the shares, the tax benefits themselves can
be rewarding and worth while. If you are going down the individual
shareholding route, you want to think about who would be eligible to
benefit from it. I would argue that you want it to be open to all
employees of the organisation, not just executives and

new subsection (4) seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State is
obliged to comment on the details of the proposed employee share plan.
First, there is the matter of eligibility. Obviously, some eligibility
restrictions can be useful, to ensure the scheme’s smooth
operation, for example by requiring a minimum period of employment or
restricting its benefits to a subset of employees. To our way of
thinking, that would be against the spirit of the type of scheme that
we would like to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000039">&#160;</a>

issue is what restrictions there might be on trading. If the shares are
not publicly traded, what facilities will be available to employees
wishing to buy or sell shares? If the shares are publicly traded or
employees have decided to sell their shares to non-employees, will the
scheme encourage long-lasting employee share
ownership?<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000040">&#160;</a>

tax treatment, what tax advantages are likely to result for Royal Mail

much improving the employee opportunity of access to shares. As the

moving on to each of those points, first I will say why I support the
principle of employee share schemes. The benefits of such schemes are
widely utilised and can be seen to be working well in other companies
in this country. Indeed, as highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member

use.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000047">&#160;</a>

are specific reasons why the employee share scheme provisions in the

share schemes are an effective tool for motivating staff. They provide
a long-term and tax-efficient financial incentive. Their widespread use

provide.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000048">&#160;</a>

schemes, therefore, should be a serious consideration for many
businesses. However, they are of particular advantage to Royal Mail,
bearing in mind its long history of management and employee disputes.
Share schemes afford employees a real stake in the company—I
emphasise “real.” Such a scheme could be an aid in
preventing possible future
disputes.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Establishing
an employee share ownership scheme is not only the sensible thing to
do, but the right thing to do. Royal Mail employees have made
significant efforts to modernise the business to secure its long-term
future. They therefore deserve to be offered a stake in the business.
Witnesses at the evidence sessions and hon. Members in their speeches
have paid tribute to the hard work and the pride of Royal Mail staff in
ensuring that all customers receive the best possible service. The
proposals to privatise Royal Mail by 90% mean that there will be
further challenges to overcome. Undoubtedly, employees will face
further restructuring, which may put strain on the work force. It is
therefore crucial that employees have access to a strong employee share
scheme, under which they are afforded more than 10%, as proposed in the
amendments. That takes into account the work force’s efforts in
the past, present and
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government propose an employee share scheme of “at least
10%” in the Bill. That seems small compared with the 90% to be
privatised and might be considered patronising by Royal Mail employees
who have invested their working lives in this public service. That
point was intimated strongly in the evidence of the general secretary
of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes. I urge the Minister
strongly to consider raising the figure to 20%. That would not shift
the balance of power a great deal, but would greatly increase the
benefits that employees receive. As I said in my opening remarks, a
credible stake with proper benefits is the least that the Government
should provide for requiring employees to undergo modernisation and
upheaval. I agree with the argument of Malcolm Hurlston, the chairman
of the Employee Share Ownership Centre, in an article dated 23
September
2010:<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p>My hon. Friend the
Member for Llanelli mentioned that point. One wonders what the hon.
Member for Worcester’s Uncle Sid would say
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not
only is the amount too low, but the mechanism is faulty because there
is no obligation on the state to implement the 10% employee share
scheme until 90% is fully privatised. That provides for a situation
whereby the state can keep a minority share and not transfer any
ownership to Royal Mail employees. I beg the indulgence of the
Committee and hope that hon. Members will resist the temptation to
tweet, and instead concentrate their efforts on increasing the 10% that
is on offer. I urge them to summon the strength to ensure that the
mechanism for implementing the scheme does not remain as it is. It is
illogical that the state will not be under a statutory obligation to
implement the ownership scheme until it has completely privatised Royal
Mail. The clause allows for the possibility that the employee share
ownership scheme will never come to fruition. Ministers can promise to
guarantee its implementation until the cows come home, but everyone
would be more comfortable if it was enshrined in
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
see no reason why the employee share scheme should not be implemented
on a sliding scale, as my hon. Friend suggests, increasing every time a
piece of Royal Mail is sold off. It seems to be the logical route. It
ensures that employees are involved in the process rather than being
dragged along by the Government and their private sector
investors.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister is committed to the idea, why will he not consider placing
in legislation a provision that ensures that the employee share
ownership scheme rises relative to the percentage privatised? That
would ensure a good relationship with management. It would also
demonstrate to employees that this scheme is more than the token offer
to buy them off. The employee share scheme should not be used as a
substitute for ongoing and productive employee-management
relationships. The employees of Royal Mail are its best
asset.  An employee share owner scheme, although a useful tool,
is still heavily dependent on economic success. We know that TNT
experienced heavy losses despite intensive modernisation and
innovation. Employees are by no means guaranteed decent benefits as a
result of the scheme. One can see that from looking at that 
model.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should also like to support the provisions in the amendments that
ensure that equal dividends must be paid to all of the scheme’s
participants. I agree with my hon. Friend that this ensures fairness
and guarantees that no group profits from the scheme more than another.
My obvious fear is that the Bill lacks the regulatory framework to
protect employees from the risk of privatisation because it does not
specify that dividends are to be paid equally. It is clear that
amendments 22 or 23 would enhance the ownership significantly and make
it of real benefit to Royal Mail employees. It is vital that the amount
offered is not just a token gesture but a substantive offer, a real
opportunity for employees. The implementation must also be correct: it
should seek to include staff on the journey to privatisation. It is for
those reasons that I support the amendments and I respectfully urge
hon. Members on both sides to do the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000056">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Thank you for
giving me the opportunity to speak in support of amendments 22 and 23,
Mr Hood. I will not go into what they do in detail, but I will touch on
that. Hon. Members could be forgiven for not noticing the subtle change
in the amendments but, as the Minister will know, we are trying to be
helpful as we go through the Bill line by line. The employee share
scheme percentages in proposed new subsection (2) are at least 20% and
at least 10% of the proportion of the company that is disposed of. That
is very important and I will come back to that in a few
minutes.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have heard this morning and in earlier contributions, the staff of
Royal Mail are arguably its strongest asset. They have gone through a
great deal over the past decade or so as Royal Mail has remained high
on the political agenda for all of that time if not for longer. While
the Opposition are anxious to see the Government retain a controlling
share of Royal Mail and the subsidiaries, we are also keen to ensure
that if the future business of Royal Mail is sold off, as the Bill
proposes, the work force have as strong a voice as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In earlier
amendments we proposed that representatives of the work force should
have a seat on the board. The Government saw fit to oppose that, but to
facilitate strong employee participation in a fully privatised Royal
Mail, without the benefit of those earlier amendments, we need a strong
employee share scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli said,
we have no direct problem with subsection (1) in principle, which
sensibly places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that
arrangements for an employee share scheme are made prior to the first
relevant disposal. But subsection (2) onwards is where the problem lies
because the rest of the clause does not strengthen subsection (1) in
the way we would like to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
it stands, subsection (2) caters only for a situation of disposal to
employees where the Crown reduces its interest to nil—a point
made a couple of time this morning and one that I made a minute ago,
but it is important. There is no provision to cover the possibility of
the Crown retaining a proportion of its interest in Royal Mail or its
subsidiary companies, and, at the same time, preserving the concept of
the employee share scheme. The fact that the Government have not
legislated for that possibility speaks volumes to this side of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Quite
sensibly, we have again sought to help the Minister; in the event that
he sees the light and looks to retain Government interest in Royal Mail
and its subsidiaries, amendment 22 will ensure that if the Crown
reduces its interest in Royal Mail in any way, at least 20% of the
shares sold, given away, disposed of or allocated—however it
will be—would be allocated to the employee share scheme. The
Committee asked my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli about the cost
and so on, and this is one issue. We do not know anything about the
disposal of the shares. The employees will always have at least 20% of
whatever level of shares are sold to big business or privatised
differently.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
amendment 23, the Minister will notice that we are prepared to reduce
that to at least a 10% share, should the 20% be too hard for him to
stomach. However, we are not prepared to accept, in legislation
designed to sell 100% of Royal Mail into private hands, a situation in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 304<a class="bkMark" name="Column304">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which up to 99% of the Royal Mail is sold and no employee share scheme
is operating. In amendments 22 and 23, the Minister has not only a
choice over the percentage of the company, but a choice to show whether
he is committed to keeping the employee share scheme percentage in line
with the level of shares owned by the Crown at all stages in the
disposal.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have heard, the sale of Royal Mail could take some time, and there
is no requirement on the Government in the Bill to provide a
functioning employee share scheme, unless the Government share is
reduced to nil. It might take years to sell all the Crown assets in
Royal Mail; we do not know because the Minister has not told us that
yet. We want, as I am sure the Minister deep down inside wants, to keep
the employee share scheme ownership in line with shares owned by other
non-public
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may ask, as my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli was asked,
how we arrived at the figure of 20% in amendment 23. In our evidence
sessions, we heard from George Thomson, general secretary of the
National Federation of SubPostmasters, who also seems to agree with the
20% figure, and, incidentally, he also agreed with amendment 16, on the
location of the headquarters of the newly privatised Royal Mail.
However, returning to amendment 22, we also heard from Mr
Scott, assistant national secretary of Unite, who argued for 49% of
share ownership to be in employees’ hands, to give them what he
described
as<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister has no intention of agreeing to such a
percentage, and therefore we have been flexible—a word we keep
coming back to—and tabled a compromise. The 20% is less than
Unite wants and the same as the National Federation of SubPostmasters
wants, but, as well as the percentage, the timing of ownership is
important in the amendment. The Minister has refused all our other
reasonable amendments, but this one has wider support than just that of
the Opposition, so he could increase the share total to at least 20%
and do it in line with share disposal to give this area of the Bill a
degree of integrity.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed new
subsection (3) of amendment 22 would place in legislation the need to
ensure that an equal share of dividend is paid from earnings to
participants in the trust that we hope will be established to manage
the scheme. I refer the Committee to proposed new subsection (5) of the
amendment on establishing a trust. It may appear simple that all
shareholders should be treated equally, as has been alluded to, but we
know that they are not, and we heard this morning that there is nothing
in the Bill to ensure that they are, which is what the amendment is
designed to do. I am sure the Minister will want to engage and to
accept the amendment to ensure that there is a fairness to this part of
the Bill that is currently
lacking.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is my intention that not only all shareholders within the trust be
treated equally, but all shareholders in the business be treated
equally. I am sure the Minister can understand my reasoning on that. It
cannot be acceptable that employee share owners, in any guise, could be
treated differently from any other share owners. The Government need to
embrace the amendment to show that they are serious about their plans
for engaging the work force of the new company in such a way,

			Column number: 305<a class="bkMark" name="Column305">&#160;</a>
                           </div>especially as the Minister has refused to accept some of our earlier
suggestions that would have strengthened work force
engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
subsection (4) of amendment 22 places what the Minister will, no doubt,
see as a burden, but what my hon. Friends and I see as a duty on the
Secretary of State to report to Parliament when suitable arrangements
have been made for the establishment of the scheme. That report must
state the precise terms of the scheme and the expected time frame for
its introduction.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will say a
bit about each point if I may. First, there is a duty for the Secretary
of State to report to Parliament on this matter. In the Bill, the
Minister has already introduced a duty for the Secretary of State to
report at various different stages. If he considers that to be an
appropriate level of transparency, I am sure he will be able to support
the amendment. Like Mr Sibbick of the Mail Competition Forum, I will be
optimistic and hope that the Minister will see the error of his ways
and accept the proposal as a duty, not a burden. If the Secretary of
State has no responsibility to report to Parliament, MPs will have no
basis on which to question him on the matter. I am sure that the
Minister does not wish the role of Parliament to be sidelined on such
an important matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moving on to
what the report must include, we have stipulated that it must contain
details of the precise make up of the scheme. That is really important
for us, as legislators, to understand. Hearing the directive from the
Secretary of State first hand is the way that this should take place.
The way in which the Bill is written means that the Secretary of State
does not have to give anyone the details. I fear that if the Bill is
passed in that form, any range of reasons, excuses or
issues—call them whatever—may be used as reasons for not
disclosing certain levels of information. That would not be acceptable.
For the sake of transparency—that includes transparency about
the terms of the scheme as it affects employers and businesses
alike—it is vital that such a report is made to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the expected time scale of the introduction, the report has to be done
in advance of the first disposal. The way the Bill currently stands,
clause 2 may allow the delivery of some information on disposal. Our
amendment would ensure that employee share schemes are delivered in
line with all levels of disposal. That would mean the Secretary of
State would have to incorporate the concept of the employee share
scheme either into the report demanded by clause 2 or the report
demanded by the amendment. If the Secretary of State has to comply with
the amendment to subsections (2) to (4), it will ensure that
he has to do so at the start of the process, rather than at the end,
which we would find unacceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(5) of amendment 22 would ensure that the employee share scheme was
developed into a trust—this idea has not been developed much
this morning—to hold the shares or the rights on behalf of the
employees in the company. There is no mention of a trust in the Bill,
and we feel that that is lacking. To protect the ownership of the
shares in the scheme from being in the hands of employees,
such a trust would need to be established. Otherwise, there would be no
clarity on whether ownership would, indeed, be in the hands of
employees or whether it would be held on behalf of employees. It could
be that previous employees would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 306<a class="bkMark" name="Column306">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have a right to hold shares or that employees could hold on to their
shares when they leave the business. In theory, there is nothing wrong
with either of those suggestions. However, there is something wrong if
the scheme is meant to be an employee share scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing wrong with employees having the ownership rights to shares, but
there is if the Government consider employee share ownership to be some
kind of counterbalance to big business investment. Unless a trust is
established, there is a danger that the major shareholder could become
the only shareholder. The employee share scheme could, to use a phrase
already used in Committee, wither on the vine. If the Government are
not prepared to preserve the long-term integrity of such a scheme by
developing a trust, there will perhaps be people who will consider the
Bill to be a mechanism simply to allow for the sale of Royal Mail in
any way, shape or
form.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Labour Members have said, we would prefer Royal Mail to be in public
hands. The work force are arguably its best asset and it is only right
that they are allowed to have a major say in the future direction of
the company. These types of schemes are designed to encourage staff
loyalty, because only those working for the company are eligible for
the benefits, and any employee leaving the scheme must leave their
share behind in the trust for the common law benefit of those in the
scheme. The Bill does not offer such protections to the scheme, and
amendments 22 and 23 rectify that. We have given the Minister a choice
between at least 10% and at least 20%, but the drive of both amendments
is the same. There is not enough protection in the Bill for the
employee share scheme, and either amendment—we prefer
22—would improve the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000074">&#160;</a>

I take exception to the Minister’s lauding of the “at
least 10%” proposal as the greatest employee share scheme ever.
That was achieved in 1987 by the Rolls-Royce sale. In the Bill, the
interpretation of “at least” is negative. The Minister
said in the eighth

point, and to those of other Opposition Members, but I want to explore
the Opposition’s position. It is only last year that their Bill
was before the House and their position is muddled. The hon. Member for
Llanelli spoke about principles in her opening remarks, but their
principles appear to be mightily flexible. I, my party and the
Conservatives have argued for employee shares for many years and we are
delivering them in this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000094">&#160;</a>

effect of the clause 3 moment amendments, amendment 22 in particular,
would be to reduce the Government’s ability to attract private
capital and their flexibility to get the right deal for the company and
for taxpayers. We have designed the measures to ensure that there is
flexibility. That is why there is a minimum commitment to 10% and why
we are not being as specific as the Opposition want. It is important to
retain flexibility in such complicated transactions in which the best
way to make the sale to get the maximum value for the company and the
most benefit for Royal Mail is not clear. It is only Labour Members who
want to put shackles on the Government and to undermine the way in
which we go about the transaction. That militates against the sensible
decision making that is in

to answer that and some of the other questions that the hon. Lady and
her hon. Friends have asked. In deciding the size of the stake going to
employees, a number of things must be balanced. We want to ensure that
we are giving a meaningful stake to employees, without getting in the
way of attracting private capital—we have established the need
for private capital, and we do not want to harm our ability to attract
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000097">&#160;</a>

minimum 10% share requirement in the Bill is the largest statutory
employee scheme of any major privatisation. In response to the hon.
Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, I should say that I
know about Rolls-Royce—I have looked at all the different
privatisations over the years, and at the percentages of employee
shares. We could have a long debate about that—I am keen to have
that debate, if he wants it, but he should listen to what I said. It is
the largest statutory employee share scheme: in other words, the
Rolls-Royce scheme did not require 100% in the legislation, but we are
putting a minimum—“at least”—in the Bill,
and that is a strong
statement.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000098">&#160;</a>

is no doubt that the share is meaningful. The hon. Member for Llanelli

things suggesting that 10% was quite a good figure. For

                           </strong> I will try to deal with some of the questions asked
by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends as I proceed. However, I
want to stress that we need the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 310<a class="bkMark" name="Column310">&#160;</a>
                           </div>flexibility because we must attract private capital—there will
not be a company to work in, or for employees to have a share in,
unless we have that critical private investment. We must ensure that
what we put into law and hardwire into the transaction retains
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must also consider value for money. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Bedford made clear, it is important that taxpayers get a return on the
money that they put into the business, as well as ensuring that the
Royal Mail gets the capital it needs. There are several things to weigh
up here. We have drafted the clause to allow us huge amounts of
flexibility in making some of those judgments. At the same time, unlike
in the Bill last year, the clause guarantees that employees will have
at least 10%, which is a significant step
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Llanelli, in one of her amendments, talks about
employees owning at least 20% of the company, once the Government have
sold all their shares. The danger of hardwiring the higher figure into
the Bill is that it will reduce the likelihood of getting the
investment that the company needs. It will be a difficult judgment.
When we engage with investors, potentially as we approach an initial
public offering, it is very important to have that flexibility. If
engaging in a trade sale or with a private equity buyer, or preparing
for an IPO, as soon as one starts thinking about the processes one
would go through, one realises the need for
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Parts
of the hon. Lady’s amendments, and some of the comments of the
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East, were about the design of the
scheme and what form it would take. Again, I am keen at this stage to
keep open options on the design. When I gave evidence to the Committee,
I made it clear that I see the attractions of an employee share trust,
not least because such an arrangement ensures the longevity of the
employee
shareholding.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had references to BT and the “Tell Sid” campaign.
One of the lessons from that was how quickly some employees sold their
shares. Some of the benefits that we see in long-term employee share
ownership were therefore lost. However, that is not to say that some BT
employees do not still have their shares, so let us not speak too
strongly against individual employee share ownership. That, too, has
merits, but there is a balance to be struck. I made it clear in my
evidence that to say now that it must all be in a trust or it must all
be individual employee shares or there must be a mix—to
hard-wire that into the Bill—is not the right thing to do. We
need to develop our thinking on which of those options is correct. I
have made it clear quite strongly that I see the attractions of an
employee share trust, but hard-wiring that sort of thing into the Bill
is not
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000107">&#160;</a>

concern that an employee share scheme may be an employee share scheme
on day one, but by day 10 it may well not be an employee share scheme.
It was to preserve and strengthen the concept of an employee share
scheme—to do what it says on the tin—that the amendments
were tabled. They are designed to preserve the employee side of the
share
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000108">&#160;</a>

we seem to be coming together on support for employee shares. Let me be
clear that I think that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 311<a class="bkMark" name="Column311">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some of the sentiments and ideas behind some of the amendments are very
laudable and certainly attractive, particularly, for example, the
requirement for the trust, if there were a trust, to pay equal
dividends to all its members. That is a laudable approach, but again it
would be dangerous to set in stone the form of the employee share
scheme before we have more certainty on the nature and level of private
sector
involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are other worthy methods for determining the allocation of shares and
therefore dividends. One could think of length of service. I am sure
that if hon. Members have been round the delivery sites in their
constituencies, or a sorting centre if they have one, they have talked
to Royal Mail employees who have been employed in the business for 20,
30, 40 or even 50 years. We therefore want to ensure that we think
about and weigh properly the different approaches to allocating shares
without hard-wiring something in the Bill and restricting how we might
go about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000110">&#160;</a>

to other amendments, but if the Minister recognises some of the issues
relating to long service and so on, Opposition Members would have no

that. We are trying to give hon. Members and people who read the record
of our proceedings—God bless ’em—clarity about the
fact that we want to engage on the design of these schemes. We are not
closed-minded. We have some thoughts, which I have been articulating
today and which I articulated in evidence, about the best way of going
about that. We do want to hear from the experts, be they at ifs
ProShare or the Employee Ownership Association, and from other
stakeholders. That is the right way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000112">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is the strongest commitment that I am aware of mandating an employee
share scheme in a Bill. Given that, the clarity of direction could not
be stronger and the strength of the Government’s commitment
could not be clearer. The strength of my personal commitment could not
be clearer. The commitment in the Bill is, historically, extremely
strong. Some of the concerns of hon. Members have to be seen in that
light.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am trying to be as helpful as possible, so let me move on to talk about
the requirement for a report that hon. Members wish to see. I am very
keen to keep Parliament abreast of how we develop these ideas. That is
precisely why we have provision for a report in clause 2.
That would cover the issue of how shares are transferred or issued into
a Royal Mail company, including an employee share scheme. The provision
is already there and we are keen to do that. Again, there is shared
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
hon. Members have been concerned about how the proportion of shares
will be allocated into the employee share scheme. Let me explain why we
have phrased that part of the clause in such a way. We wanted to keep
our options open while also making a strong commitment, and the phrase
“arrangements in place” achieves the flexibility that we
need. There may be a complicated sequencing once one gets to the
transaction, but it ensures that no sale can go ahead until the
arrangements are in place and clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000115">&#160;</a>

Committee that we will put shares into the scheme on day one. We still
want to retain flexibility on the question of how much, and of when we
will arrive at the figure of at least 10%. That is a critical point. We
are keen to get the scheme going from day one, but we must remember
what is in the interests of the employees. That has been uppermost in
my mind. I know that the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
thinks that there is some sort of conspiracy to do employees out of
their shares, but nothing could be further from my mind. I want to
ensure that when the shares come from the Crown and go into the
employee share scheme, we will get a good deal for employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000117">&#160;</a>

committed now to putting all the shares, the whole 10%, in on day one,
and wrote that into the Bill, the upside of private investment staged
in phases, going into Royal Mail and improving its performance, could
mean that the share values are reduced. I want to ensure that we get
the best deal for employees. The flexibility in the legislation is not
to do employees out of anything, but to ensure that we get them a good
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000118">&#160;</a>

commitment to have the share scheme in operation from day one. We are
not saying that the end result of however many millions or billions of
shares—10%, 20%, or whatever—must be placed into the
scheme on day one. The amendment would mean that if 20%—or
whatever proportion—is disposed of from the Crown, and if we are
talking about the figure of 10%, then 2% should be placed into the
trust. We are not saying that all the shares must be up front, but
rather that there should be a proportionate amount at every step along
the way.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000119">&#160;</a>

object in principle to the concept of phasing in the introduction of
shares to employees as we sell the shares in the company. That would be
a sensible and transparent way of doing the transfer. However, I do not
want to hard-wire that into the Bill because one can imagine situations
where that could undermine value for employees. That is why I want to
keep flexibility, not to try to create problems in some way. This will
be a complicated transaction; lots of things are happening. We must
deal with removing the £8 billion pension deficit. That is a
complicated matter, as we will no doubt see when we consider the
relevant clauses. We must ensure that the scheme is created in a
sensible way that is in the best interests of the taxpayer, the company
and the employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000120">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 313<a class="bkMark" name="Column313">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about this clause—my overriding conclusion is the need for
flexibility. For the record, I repeat that it is not flexibility
somehow to cheat the employees. We are being pretty positive about the
future role of employees in this business. We want them to be engaged,
to take a share in Rail Mail’s future success and to contribute
to Royal Mail’s better performance, better productivity and
growth. That is why we have included the scheme in the Bill and opted
for a minimum of 10%.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, that
is also why it would be wrong to include constraints. We could, for
example, have said, “We want to give 10% to employees on day
one.” I considered that option, but I thought that it would have
been against the employees’ interests. As amendment 22 proposes,
we could also have done things proportionally. I considered that option
as well, but I did not think that it was in the employees’
interests. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will understand

                           </strong> To a certain extent, the Minister talks in a
paternalistic fashion about what is in employees’ interests, and
it might be fruitful to talk to the employees now about what type of

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps I can
deal with some of the other comments that were made in the debate. The
hon. Member for Llanelli worried that employee shares might replace
wages. Let me make it absolutely clear that employees would receive
their awards, including any additional awards under the modernisation
agreement, in line with their original terms of employment. Separately,
employees would then receive their share of any dividends as owners of
the company, depending on the way in which we decide to structure the
employee shares. There is no intent to do what the hon. Lady mentions,
so let me completely quash that idea, which comes out of neither the
Bill nor the Government’s policy statement.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At one
stage—I will have to respond to him on this—the hon.
Member for Ochil and South Perthshire intimated that he supported
Unite’s statement in favour of a 49% employee share scheme. The
Opposition might really be doing a volte-face on these
issues—this clause 3 moment is becoming quite
dramatic. The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he is an expert on
arithmetic, but if he and his hon. Friends want to retain a majority
stake, give 49% to employees and get private capital, they have a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000133">&#160;</a>

agreed to 49%, which is why we compromised and went for 20%, along with
the national

                           </strong> Sometimes, one wishes one could share all
one’s thoughts about how one went about preparing this
legislation, but I would probably get into trouble if I did that. I
will simply say that we looked at a lot of different options in
relation to what the level of employee shares should be, how they
should be structured and so on. We have put a lot of thought and effort
into it, which I hope will reassure colleagues of our complete
commitment. This is not simply about Royal Mail employees and the
future of Royal Mail, critical though they are to the Bill. Recent
evidence includes reports, sponsored by the Employee Ownership
Association and independent academics, such as the recent report by the
Cass business school. Other evidence has pulled together all the
published works that look at how employee shares can impact upon the
performance and productivity of companies and upon things such as
absenteeism, and how they can improve the sustainability of business
performance over difficult economic
periods.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
one cannot say that they always work in all cases—business and
the economy are not like that—there is a strong evidence base,
not only in the UK or in recent years, but over the world and over
time, that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 315<a class="bkMark" name="Column315">&#160;</a>
                           </div>employee shares can help companies motor and can be very good for
long-term productivity and performance. That is why I am so supportive
of the provision and why I, along with my hon. and right hon. Friends,
want to promote such an approach more widely in the economy. Moreover,
making it such a big part of the Bill sends a strong signal of this
Government’s longer-term policy intent. I cannot stress enough
how strongly we support the provision and how determined we are to make
it
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
will only work if two things hold. First, it must be in the interests
of employees, and we will make sure that it is. Secondly, both the
current management, who are doing a very good job in this area, and the
future owners must understand that the benefits of employee shares or
profit-related pay and all the different incentive schemes will only
work when they engage with employees so that they are involved and can
participate in the day-to-day business of the company. That is why,
when I gave evidence to the Committee, I talked about the world-class
mail projects in a number of sorting centres, which are engaging
employees in how they work. The employees in the Gatwick and Cardiff
centres, which are the two leading exponents in the Royal Mail sorting
network, think about their work in a completely different way and talk
about enjoying it more than ever before. They are more committed, and
that is even before employee shares. The combination of putting trust
in employees, engaging them and giving them a financial benefit can be
powerful for Royal Mail, corporate Britain and the UK economy, which is
why I think this is an important economic
development.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000137">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with the Minister. When he says that
employees feel better at work and more engaged, that is because the
modernisation process—from its very inception through to its
end—engaged with the employees. The problem with the Bill is
that employee engagement appears somewhere in the mid to end-part of
the process and not at the very beginning. Can the Minister conceive of
a situation whereby applying a number without engaging with the
employees at this stage means that employees do not actually buy into
the share scheme later on down the line, unless they are engaged with
it at the beginning?<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can confirm to the Committee that I have spoken
to the general secretary of the CWU and his deputy about the share
scheme. I am very keen to continue to engage, as I am in many areas of
the Bill, with the CWU, as the representatives of employees, and indeed
with other representatives of employees, such as Unite.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Taking
employees along with this thinking is important. For now, however, as
Royal Mail management get on with the challenge of modernising the
company in anticipation that it will then also have access to private
capital and the other freedoms that the Bill gives them, I think that
they understand the need to take the employees with them. When I have
spoken to Royal Mail’s senior managers, and of course to Moya
Greene and Donald Brydon, I have been very impressed about how they see
the employees being at the centre of their business plans. They know
that they have some tough decisions to make about the future of the
business, but they also know that they will only succeed if they engage
and take the employees with them.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000140">&#160;</a>

type of question that I was asking of the chief operational officer,
Mark Higson, when I went around the Gatwick site was, “Well,
this is great, you’ve got a bit of a roll-out here at Gatwick,
Cardiff and one or two other sorting centres. What about rolling out
world-class mail and engaging with the employees on the delivery
side?” In a way, one can see it more easily at a sorting site,
because there are the machines and a type of factory process, but there
is another aspect—where the actual labour is—and it is on
the delivery side. We have to see these new techniques at that level
and on that side of the operation too.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000141">&#160;</a>

hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw her amendments and understand
that the share scheme we are proposing is vital to the future of Royal

convinced that everything that we want to see in the Bill will be put

about and quite a lot of, “Well, you’ve got to trust us,

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall not detain the Committee too long, because the Minister will be
anxious to make progress. I hope that he and the Government recognise
that the early part of the Bill contains a lot of important matters
that require our attention. That is not to say that what comes later is
less important, but perhaps it will be less contentious. Who
knows?<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is designed to omit the words “or include”. It will take
us back to a debate that we have already had. The Bill as currently
drafted gives rise to concern that the employee share scheme could hold
for someone other than employees. I tried to make that point to the
Minister earlier. I understand that it could be appear to be a
contradiction in terms, but there is a degree of confusion in the
clause as it is written. I see that it may be possible to hold shares
for past employees, but that depends on the nature of the scheme. Of
course, we still know little about this issue, despite the
Minister’s comments on previous
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have talked about the scheme’s ability to create a mechanism to
hold shares in trust for employees, from which they would accrue the
benefits but not outright ownership. It is disappointing that the
Minister did not see fit to vote with us on that. However, in such a
case, are the words “or include” really necessary? Do we
take it, from the wording of the Bill, that the Minister does not
regard that as the way forward and regards employees as being able to
hold individual ownership through their employment and beyond? I am not
saying that the system is not workable—in the past I have
benefited from such a scheme—but we are guessing what the
Minister means by the current wording. As we discussed earlier, there
is a real worry that an employee share scheme that is not protected, in
the way that such a trust would protect it, could result in the major
shareholder

                        <p class="tabbed">Many
people have argued for a trust to be established, as I referred to a
little earlier, and some of our witnesses have already been quoted. Mr
Hooper made similar comments. He said that he thought
that<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000190">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>We
heard the reference to BT earlier. In fact, Mr Hooper made reference to
the BT privatisation in 1984 and to some of the difficulties that he
thought came about from that. I wonder whether the Minister agrees with
Mr Hooper about that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr Hooper
went on to advise us that a trust would be more engaging, but that that
was his personal view. In relation to the amendment, I am confused
about what format that would operate under and what added value the
words “or include” really offer. Does the Minister share
my concern that the scheme must be related to employees and that the
clue is in the title—the employee share scheme? What
opportunities does the wording, as it currently stands, create for
non-employees, and indeed people who have never been employees, to hold
shares through the scheme? I genuinely seek his clarification on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister no doubt feels that engaging the work force through an
employee share scheme is all that is necessary to get the work force on
side. However, the question is how, and with what regulations, will the
shares be distributed, and whether the Bill is strengthened by taking
out the words “or include”? As I said earlier, an
employee share scheme without a trust would give rise to the
possibility of shares delivered through this mechanism falling into the
hands of other private investors, or indeed investor, who already have
the possibility of owning the remaining 90%. The words “or
include” do not assist in that matter at all, because they do
not protect the employee share scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The employee
share scheme may be well-intentioned, but without safeguards we may
find that those shares can very easily be purchased from employees. In
doing so, the aspiration of the Government could, in fact, result in a
scheme that is worthless. By agreeing to the amendment, the Minister
could break a bad habit that he has got into—I am trying to coax
him out of it; I nearly got him there on the last one, but we are
hoping—and at the same time prevent the scheme becoming
worthless and, in doing so, protect the objective of this part of the
Bill, which is to keep work force engagement. Of course, he could do
that through a John Lewis-style trust, as we debated on the previous
amendment. There is, however, no such mechanism to make that happen, so
we must do all that we can to improve the Bill. Although the
Minister’s words are well-intentioned, he might not be the
Minister at that point. Someone else might be delivering some of the
solutions further down the line. Who knows?<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I said in
my first Committee speech and will say again, we really are trying to
help the Minister. The removal of the words “or include”
strengthens the Bill and strengthens the employee share scheme concept.
I do not want to detain the Committee much longer.

                           </div>To conclude, the amendment protects the share scheme to be
just that—an employee share scheme. There is a raft of
information missing from the Bill, some of which we have discussed in
the previous amendment, and the Minister alluded to some assistance in
his remarks. If there is going to be an employee share scheme, it must
do what it says on the tin. The amendment protects the concept that I
think the Minister is trying to promote in the Bill with the employee
share
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
31 relates to the scope of the employee share scheme. The words
“or include” allow the scheme to encompass employees of
Royal Mail who work for its subsidiaries, even those subsidiaries that
do not fall within the strict definition of a Royal Mail company in
clause 2. It is one of our flexibility points, but I hope that the hon.

order to ensure the benefits of
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000198">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman knows, Royal Mail has a number of subsidiaries that
do not directly provide the universal service but are nevertheless
considered part of the overall company infrastructure. During our
debate on subsidiaries last week, a number of them were
listed—for example, Royal Mail Estates Ltd. Clause 3 is explicit
that all those who work for a Royal Mail company—the company
providing the universal service—must be part of the employee
share scheme. Without the words “or include” in
subsection (4), the Government cannot extend employee shares to
employees of companies that do not strictly fall within the definition
of a Royal Mail company.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000199">&#160;</a>

“or include” could also indicate some other intention?
They might allow a decision not to create a trust, so that people other

more precise and exemplary fashion.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000200">&#160;</a>

if we went down his route there would be a danger that some staff in

incentives to engage with the business for which they work and to share
in its future success. Let us be absolutely clear that clause 3 ensures
that we introduce an employee share scheme for the benefit of Royal
Mail employees. It is not the intention to make the shares available to
anybody and everybody in the world; it is

the Minister consider a stronger wording for the clause, which would
explain the intention? On this side of the Committee, we think that the
words “or include” could result in a small number of
participants in the scheme being employees and a large number being all
sorts of other people. If the scheme will be available to a specific
group that is defined by the Minister, could a definition of that group
not be provided? Could the clause not be tightened up—perhaps
referenced somewhere else and defined in another clause that links back
to this one—so that it is absolutely clear whom we mean? The
Minister has clearly defined the intended group of employees for us,
and that needs to be somewhere in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000203">&#160;</a>

for tabling the probing amendment, because it enables me to put the
intention beyond doubt. The Bill is about Royal Mail, and the clauses
about employee share schemes contain definitions. It would be difficult
to draw the conclusions that Labour Members are trying to draw, but I
have made it absolutely clear that the intention is for the shares to
be made available via the scheme to those who are connected to the
Royal Mail family of companies. I am repeating myself to ensure that
the record is clear on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear the Minister’s words. He says that
shares will be made available to members of the Royal Mail family, but
people will not necessarily always be a member of that family. As the
Minister has not accepted the amendment with the trust in it, the two
words included here—“or include”—may
provide the opportunity for a trust to not be set up and for employees
to retain their shares when they move on. It would then no longer be an
employee share scheme, but an employee and ex-employee share
scheme—something other than what the Minister aspires to
create.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000205">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In a way, we are returning to the previous debate.
If we chose to go down the trust model route for whole or part of the
employee share scheme, the rules of that employee share trust would
determine whether someone who has left the trust would be able to take
the shares with them. The general assumption—certainly, my
assumption—given the policy intention of trying to have
longevity in employee-shared ownership, is that they would not be able
to take the shares from the trust; the shares would remain in the
trust. Again, I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that if one
thinks back to the previous debate and brings those ideas to this one,
some of the concerns fall
away.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000206">&#160;</a>

retaining the words in the legislation would override them and could

able to participate in the employee share scheme, which I am sure that
Labour Members do not want to occur. I therefore urge them to withdraw
their amendment. I am grateful that they have probed us on the matter,
so that we have had to make it absolutely clear that the words are

                        </p>‘(5) Any employee
share scheme will be entitled to have at least one representative from
the scheme on the board of any company operating the
scheme.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Llanelli, takes us back to the debate on amendment 16, and I do not
want to repeat myself. The Minister did not see fit to accept our
proposal to include a representative of the work force on
the board of the newly privatised company. Amendment 24
takes that philosophy forward to the employee share scheme, and it
would entitle the share scheme to have at least one representative on
the board of the newly privatised Royal Mail. The objective is to
ensure that the scheme is at the heart of each, every, and any decision
that the company may make that might impact on the existence of the
scheme. The opportunities to impact on such matters would be many and
varied, but I want to take a minute to run through one or two
possibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
instance, if the worst fears of my hon. Friends and I were realised,
the lack of a trust designed to protect a particular shareholding on
behalf of employees—if 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 322<a class="bkMark" name="Column322">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the Government failed to establish it—might result in the erosion
and elimination of such an employee share scheme. We do not want that,
and we think that it is something that a representative on the board
would be able to try and preserve. Perhaps the employee share scheme
would become something else, as I have alluded to in other
contributions this morning. An employee or past employee share scheme
in which shares could be sold to the main shareholder would allow the
scheme to be eroded, and with it a key point of the legislation and
something that the Minister is very keen
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of a scheme representative on the board would be to argue that
every decision taken by the new business should not impact negatively
on the very employee share scheme that the representative is there to
protect. With that in mind, there would always be an argument being
made at board level on the impact of decisions on the scheme. As the
Government do not yet accept the need for a trust to be established
through the content of the Bill, it is not impossible that decisions on
the longevity of the employee share scheme could be taken by the board
of the operating company to which the scheme has relevance. I am quite
sure that no one would like to see an erosion of the Minister’s
intentions, which he has set out today.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
provides some comfort to employees in the scheme, as there would be
someone fighting their corner at the highest level of the company.
Perhaps it would also be possible for the structure of share
distribution, such as quantity or parity with other shareholders, to be
less than equal, which is something that we touched on this morning.
None of us in the Committee has a burning desire to see that, but it is
something that the legislation, in the way it is presented, allows for
as an outcome. The amendment would ensure that someone arguing for the
benefit, strength and longevity of the employee share scheme would be
able to fight their corner at the highest level of the company.
Shareholders are less than equal, in many ways, with any such changes
that may be proposed by the new company, and therefore a strong voice
from the scheme on the company board is the least that should be
expected, and it is the least that employees should expect of us. We
have the employees’ interests and the employee share
scheme’s interests at heart and, because of that, we have the
Minister’s best interests at heart. If the employee share scheme
is such a strong part of the Bill, I cannot see a reason for the
Minister to refuse the amendment—after all, we only wish to
protect the scheme, as I have said. The scheme is built into the
legislation, and it is a creation of it.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We heard a
lot during our evidence sessions about employee-owned companies, and
reference has been made this morning to the contributions of Carol
Leslie, the policy director of the Employee Ownership Association, and
Alexy Armitage, the head of employee share ownership at ifs ProShare.
We must recognise, however, that a privately owned Royal Mail will not
be an employee-owned company. It will perhaps be owned by an
overseas-based global company in which employees have ownership of
possibly as little as 10% of the share capital, because the Minister
did not embrace our earlier amendments. We are still not clear whether
that holding will reach 10% only when the Crown has reduced its own
holding to zero, and we are still not clear what form that staging will
take. I accept that the Minister is well-intentioned, but he has not
taken up my challenge to do something 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 323<a class="bkMark" name="Column323">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about that on Report. In such a situation, there must be a
representative on the board with the sole interest of the scheme at
heart, and the amendment would do just
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
was also evident that, although it was asked to give evidence to the
Committee, and there has been reference to its evidence not only in my
contribution but in the contributions of others, ifs ProShare has not
been involved with any of the Government’s discussions of the
scheme. The Minister mentioned an intention to engage with ifs ProShare
in the future, so I hope that he will take up the kind offer that was
made to him during the evidence session to do just
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is no mention in the Bill of how the ESS will work—the idea has
been touched on, and even the Minister raised this in one of his
contributions. Would every employee receive a one-off comparable amount
on their first day or after 12 months’ service? We do not know
whether long service would be rewarded with a share allocation. The
details are extremely sketchy, so we are being asked to put our faith
in something that does not contain a lot of
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
propose that we put our faith in somebody on the board, that we put our
faith in somebody who has the best of intentions for the employee share
scheme and that we put faith in that person’s ability to stand
up for the share scheme in every decision that is taken within the new
company. We understand that every decision that is taken within the
company might affect the employee share scheme, and having someone on
the board arguing the case for the scheme and for the employees would
be a significant step forward. That is the least that we can accept.
The presence on the board of a representative from the scheme would
ensure that any changes to the scheme would always have a voice of the
scheme’s members at the decision-making heart. Although the
Minister presents the scheme as it appears in the Bill, there is no
guarantee that the Minister’s concept of the scheme today will
be the same as the scheme that is in operation in, say, five
months’ time, five years’ time or 10 years’
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000239">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention. During the Committee’s deliberations we have moved
a number of amendments that would have strengthened the representation
of the employees throughout the new company should the Bill receive
Royal Assent and should the business be sold off, but the Government
have seen fit not the embrace those amendments. So here we go again
trying to do it at another level. My hon. Friend’s point is
important, because it empowers employees. Sadly, we were unable to
secure representation at a high level during earlier stages of
Committee
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000241">&#160;</a>

would ensure that the validity of decisions could be evaluated. If
advice and opinions were ignored by the rest of the board, a record of
decision making could be kept so the impacts of decisions could be

                           </div>assessed. That is an important point to make. We
have had a number of votes in the Committee and seen how people can be
outvoted. It is unlikely that one representative on the board would be
able to outvote the rest of the board, but we would be able to see, and
the representative could ensure, that they stood up for the benefit of
the employee share scheme and the employees in it when any decision was
debated and voted on in the new company.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
transparency and accountability should not be the worry of the employee
share scheme representative; it should be the concern of other members
of the newly created board. We would not want them to make decisions
detrimental to the employee share scheme without some as yet unknown
reason that would make that tolerable; I cannot see it myself. The
employee share scheme representative would be there to evaluate and
determine whether the decision-making process and any decisions that
came from it were in the best interests of the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think “in your dreams” probably
means no. However, if the Minister could embrace such representation
for employees, customers and the share scheme, there would be a strong
voice concerned with work practices, the customer experience and the
longevity and fairness of the employee share scheme. That could be
useful in preventing the scheme’s assets from falling into the
hands of big business, as was discussed earlier. If a trust does not
exist, there is a fear that the shares might find their way on to the
open market and be gobbled up by the major shareholder.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept
fully that there are no guarantees in life, and that such
representation would not be a panacea for all ills, as I have said, but
it would allow remaining board members to be briefed on the impact of
every decision that they make in relation to the employee share scheme
and to have regular information that would empower better and more
informed decisions. I have been a company director for many years. It
is important when running a company to run it for the company’s
benefit. We are arguing that the company’s benefit is also the
benefit of the employee share scheme. Directors can lose sight of what
is for the overall benefit of the company, its employees, its customers
and the people engaged in it. The amendment would ensure that the
business’s directors did not lose sight of what is beneficial to
the employee share scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000247">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not much more
needs to be said about the amendment. It is straightforward. Previous
contributions discussed some of the arguments, and as far as we can
see, they stand the test, whether they are arguments for
amendment 16, amendment 22 or other amendments. My hon. Friends and I
support the amendment—and its ambitions; they, too, are
important. I understand that the Minister does not like the drafting of
the amendment, but if he comes back with something that represents the
same sentiment, we would be happy to support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000248">&#160;</a>

trust that the Minister will be supportive—although I doubt
it—because refusing such an engagement would challenge his
commitment to the longevity of the employee share scheme. He has not
agreed to embrace the creation of a trust by including it in the Bill.
If he does not embrace those at the heart of this new business, arguing
for longevity in the best interests of the employee share scheme,
people will draw their own conclusions on what he really means by such
a scheme. It is important to preserve the share scheme on behalf of the
employees in it. I would be interested to hear the Minister’s

that debate, however, such ideas have some merit.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000250">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have never
been opposed to the idea of employee representatives being on boards,
or on board committees. However, it is for the company—in this
case, Royal Mail and its shareholders—to decide how to structure
its board. The point is—we had the same discussion last time
around—that however much the Committee or the Government think
it a good idea to engage with employees, with share options and shares,
and even employee participation schemes, the notion that we hard-wire
into the legislation a particular board structure seems wrong. It is
not appropriate to impose it through legislation, and I am not aware of
a precedent for such an imposition being made by
statute.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000251">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear what the Minister says about the hard-wiring
analogy on the make-up of the board. We do not wish to prescribe its
make-up. The amendment merely asks that at least one person should be
designated as a personal representative of the employee share scheme.
The Minister did not see fit to embrace our earlier amendments, so we
are talking about only one board member. That is hardly prescriptive as
to the board’s
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000252">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, and I
have made our position clear. Assuming that an employee share trust is
set up, it is highly likely—indeed, desirable, given its
importance—that the employees’ voice should be properly
heard and represented. However, the hon. Gentleman must answer this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000253">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If the
amendment were passed, and if the legislation were uniquely to
prescribe the structure of the board, a fully independent Royal Mail
with no Government shareholding that wanted to change the structure of
its board would have to come back to the House and request legislation.
That would be an onerous regulation to impose on a private company. It
could cause the company problems that it might be difficult to
envisage.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000254">&#160;</a>

be heard, if not at board level? Can he tell the Committee how he will
ensure that it is heard if he does not embrace the

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are
many examples of ways in which different companies ensure that the
voice of their employees is heard, in particular in the employee share
ownership sector. There are many ways in which those kinds of companies
ensure that the voice of their employees is heard, and that they
increase employee participation. I have made it clear to
this Committee that I am extremely keen on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000256">&#160;</a>

previous Government could have done a great deal more on that—in
fact, they did almost nothing. We want to start with this Bill and
other things that we are doing to put that right. I make it clear that
this is not about whether the principle of representation on the board
is worth while—I think we can agree on that. The question is
whether we should bind the company for ever in respect of the structure
of its
board.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
time ago, if my recollection is correct, the Minister spoke about the
Bullock report of 1978, which dealt with industrial democracy and
employee representation on boards. He was critical that the then Labour
Government did not enshrine it in legislation, which would have
hard-wired in companies those things that he now seems to oppose. There
seems to be a lack of
consistency.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000259">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right, in that I did refer to
the Bullock commission, but he is absolutely wrong to suggest that I
thought that the Labour Government who set it up should have accepted
all its recommendations in full and hard-wired them in legislation. I
certainly never said that, and I am not saying it
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
point I was seeking to make was that this debate had occurred in the
past but had disappeared from general debate in the politics of this
country. Aspects of the Bullock report are not places where I would
like to go: nevertheless, some of the concepts and the philosophy
behind it are things that should be encouraged in the workplace of a
modern company in the 21st century. Engagement between employers and
employees is a good thing, and I have paid tribute in the past to a
Secretary of State in the previous Government, the right hon. Patricia
Hewitt, then MP for Leicester, West, for introducing the right to
request flexible working. Why am I bringing that into the debate? It is
because that progress in employee rights helped to trigger
conversations between employees and employers that previously were not
taking place, for whatever
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the objectives of Government policy needs to be to break down the
barriers that prevent those reasonable conversations from taking place,
so that employees and employers can come together. By and large, their
interests are actually much more closely aligned than is often thought.
If the hon. Gentleman is pointing to the fact that I referred earlier
in our debates to the philosophy behind the Bullock commission, he is
right. We do need greater engagement, and I think that the proposals
will result in that, but the amendment goes too far because it is
trying to put into statute something that should not be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000262">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for what he has just said, but
he seems to think that an amendment that prescribes one representative
on the board of a company which might have 10, 20, 12 or six—who
knows how many?—members of its board is a particularly onerous
thing for a private business to cope with. I come from private
business, and I put it to him that it is not. It is something that the
owners of the new Royal Mail could and should easily embrace, and
therefore the Minister should not worry about the impact on the private
company or even whether there would be a possibility of them selling
off the
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000263">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman, who always tries to be helpful, even if he sometimes
does not succeed. I understand what he is saying, but there is a reason
why I am not aware of any precedent for such a proposal in British
company law, which is that it is too restrictive. It might even work
against the interests of employees, and I am sure that he would not
want
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000265">&#160;</a>

am also sure that he would not want to set in stone a law that would
lead to a private company banging on the doors of a future Government
to demand new legislation, because what was passed in 2010 was far too
restrictive and inflexible. That does not make for good law, and that
is why we are resisting it, while making it clear that we are keen to
have employees’ voices heard not only in law, but more
generally. That makes for good workplaces and, more importantly for
Britain plc, improves productivity. There is strong evidence, which I
mentioned earlier and could go on at length about, for the need to
improve productivity and how greater employee-employer engagement can
be part of that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000266">&#160;</a>

is power. People can deceive, hoodwink, bamboozle and confuse if they
use the appropriate language. Some politicians in the recent past have
been accused of spinning. However, none have been quite as
breathtakingly shameless as those who portray the Bill as friendly to
postmasters, postmistresses and customers. Let us consider the
hijacking of language. “Mutual”, like
“communities,” has a comforting, warming-of-the-heart 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 330<a class="bkMark" name="Column330">&#160;</a>
                           </div>feeling about it. When the press try to explain “mutual,”
in most cases there is a reference to John Lewis. That
characteristically Welsh surname naturally inspires confidence,
conjuring images of Welsh cakes by the hearth. Nothing could be further
from
reality.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000307">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
focus a little bit more on specifics, the Government’s proposals
on mutualisation are vague. They do not give us a clear idea of exactly
what form the mutualisation will take, although we are aware that there
have been considerable discussions on this issue with sub-postmasters;
they do not guarantee direct employee involvement; and they leave
rather a loose definition that could allow many different
interpretations of
“mutual”.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
25—particularly paragraph (g)—deals with a number of
issues that we would like to explore in detail. Some of the points that
we make in paragraphs (a) to (f) will be familiar to
Committee members from previous discussions. Paragraph (a) deals with
worker representation. Many of the arguments that my hon. Friend the
Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has advanced relating to the
employee share scheme are equally appropriate in respect of the future
of the post office network. Those who are involved most closely need to
be best represented. We would like there to be a great deal more
clarity about how that representation will take place and who will have
a voice, because this is a major new step forward and a terrific
adventure that is exciting in many ways. None the less, it will bring
with it fears and concerns about what the future holds for the post
office network. The maximum amount of involvement is critical, which is
why we want to amend the Bill to that effect so that there is proper
worker
representation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me move on to discuss the UK headquarters. The Post Office may
be in a different situation to the Royal Mail. Nevertheless, people
feel strongly that whatever happens to the Post Office in
future—it may metamorphose in different ways—we want some
safeguards on the headquarters remaining in the UK. I will not repeat
my previous comments about the way that the sub-postmasters gather
information from local communities. Quite clearly, they are very
concerned about keeping the headquarters in the UK. Proposed new
paragraph (c) of amendment 25 is pertinent here because we
do not quite know what is going to happen to the body once it has been
floated off. Therefore it is important that the headquarters remain in
the UK. That is intricately linked with the idea of proper
representation so that there can be proper decision-making
procedures.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
possible through consultation to tease out exactly what people want.
The clause does not give us a very clear idea of exactly what is
envisaged. We know that we are talking about an organisation that is
not uniform. When starting a mutual from scratch with a blank piece of
paper, everyone can pile in using exactly the same 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 331<a class="bkMark" name="Column331">&#160;</a>
                           </div>format. But the Post Office has a very different structure. We have all
sorts of people who have put different amounts of money in. There are
people with different types of post offices, some of which are viable,
some of which are not. So we have a whole range of different scenarios
for those people. Some people may be setting out in their careers. Some
may be looking to retire very shortly. Clearly there are going to be
different views. Indeed, we heard as much on Second Reading.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consultation
is critical before we set out on any structure at all and if this is
going to be a viable and successful organisation, we want that
consultation to be meaningful and we want it to have a proper response
from the Secretary of State. In other words, we want it to be listened
to. So that is the purpose of paragraph (e). We want to
ensure that the Secretary of State takes on board what is said in that
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph (f)
is critical. If the proposal is for a mutualisation, no mutual could
expect to succeed unless it had the full support of its members. That
is the very essence of a mutual. There has to be some form of vote or
democratic process in which those who are going to be directly affected
and involved show that they want to see the post office network become
a mutual and be separated off from the state. Clearly the democratic
process needs to take place and we need to have some proper evidence
that at least 51% of those who will be directly affected wish to see
the transfer into a mutual take place.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000315">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I should like
to focus my comments on paragraph (g) because it is critical to the
proposal. Whereas everybody would rush to be part of a money-making
enterprise that was clearly going to do well, our post office network
faces a difficult scenario with the declining mail volumes, the decline
in Government business and the declining footfall in many post offices
because so many people do things online. Some post offices manage to
combine other types of activity and are symbiotic with village shops or
garages. Everybody who might participate will want to know how viable
the post office network will be if it is made into a mutual, because
they will be making their whole livelihood part of the new
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000316">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Recently,
we had a very glossy document and an interesting announcement on the
funding for the post office network and the £1.34 billion
investment. For all those who are involved in the post office network,
the question will be how the £1.34 billion will be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000317">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Does the hon. Lady agree that one
problem with the mutual solution is that a mutual would become viable
only if the network was profitable and viable, as was clear from the
evidence that we received? The network is a long way from that. Does
she see any indication in the Bill of a time scale for getting it to
that
stage?<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000318">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> That is one of the big questions: what is the
time scale for getting things in place? A sum of money has been floated
for investment and we understand that that is for 2012 onwards. Funding
of £150 million was pledged for this year by the Labour
Government and there is £180 million for the year up to April
2012. The sum of money is for beyond that time, but a proportion of it
will be needed for direct subsidy, just like the current £150
million and £180 million. If costs rise, that may be more than
£180 million. If post offices close, it could be less than that.
We do not know at the moment exactly how much will be needed for a
running-cost
subsidy.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
we need to know what will be done with the remainder of the money.
Different things might be done. There could be modernisation that makes
post offices into very attractive places. That may be a good use of
money, but it might not create additional income streams. There could
be investment in equipment or the computer system. That may be
beneficial for people who use the post office and for the people who
serve them, but it might not create additional
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
want a report on the use of the £1.34 billion so that we know
what is done with it to make post offices more viable. If a number of
post office branches are not profitable or viable without considerable
cross-subsidy, which involves a considerable amount of Government
money, the question will be what has been done with that £1.34
billion to create new forms of custom. If something has been done,
there should be an evaluation of whether those new forms of custom have
materialised.<a class="bkMark" name="10112334000321">&#160;</a>
