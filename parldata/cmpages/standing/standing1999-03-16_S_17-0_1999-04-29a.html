Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 552, in page 33,  line 25, leave out "relevant" and insert  "dependent".--[Dr. Cable.] 
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be  made. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this  we are considering amendment No. 553, in page 33,  leave out lines 40 and 41. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I think that  the Minister was about to finish his answer to my  question. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I was  about to start my answer to the hon. Gentleman's  question. His question was entirely relevant. "Relevant"  is not defined in the Bill, but I am sure that, as he is asking  a relevant question, he will know that that word needs to  be in the Bill to ensure that the issue covered by the  clause is dealt with. 
<P>
No definition is given in the Bill of who a relevant  member of a family might be, but we interpret it as being  a family member who has been covered in a head of  family's application. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I shall return  briefly to the themes that surfaced in the minutes before  lunch. I want to clarify one point that the Minister had not  taken up because, probably, I did not make it clearly  enough. The Government probably would take such a  point, however, concerning the distinction between  relevant members of a family and dependent members of  a family. 
<P>
The Minister clarified the definition. A relevant  member of the family might have different grounds for  making an appeal, which would be protected by  confidentiality, from other members of the family. Our  concern is that the subsection currently begins: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State must serve on the applicant and on relevant  member of his family".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That formula seems to associate one relevant member of  a family with another in appeals that should and would be  distinct in law. We wish to clarify the issue by ensuring  that only dependent members of a family who are  properly associated with an appeal are being referred to. I  hope to have done that, but perhaps the Minister could  help in his reply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As I have said to other members of the  Committee, "relevant" is the appropriate word. We  would interpret it through the regulations under clause 55  (6) as a family member who had been covered in the head  of family's application. It is possible that a person has  dependents within the ordinary meaning of the term who  qualify to remain here independently. The power to  regulate would enable us to vary the definition if  necessary. 
<P>
We look to applicants to define in their application  who a relevant person is. If an applicant regards others as  members of his family, he will set out that information in  his application form. He would then seek to ask us to  examine his case together with those of other relevant  members of his family. The assumption is that the others  are not seeking an application in their own right. They  may, in other circumstances, make such an application;  that would be a matter for them to bring forward. 
<P>
The case of a person whom an applicant had indicated  as being a member of his family and whom he wished to  be considered as part of his own application would be for  the courts or the tribunal in the immigration service. That  person may or may not be a dependant. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West) The Minister  is trying to be helpful to the Committee. Between this  and subsequent stages of the Bill, he might like to reflect  on whether "relevant" is a better word. I can see that it is  both wider and more precise in its use to refer to people in  applications. He may also like to reflect on whether  relevant members who are turned down may make their  own applications independently of the person with  whom they were first considered. I do not ask the  Minister to respond now, but I suspect that the issue is  worth considering with the Parliamentary draftsman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman an  answer now. The immigration service, the Minister and,  in due course, any relevant courts, are asked to determine  any application that is before them and the outcome for  relevant family members. If a relevant family member  subsequently or simultaneously asks the Minister to  focus on a different application, he will able to do so. The  aim of the provision is to ensure as much as possible that  people do not make multiple attempts to apply. In theory,  people can discover, as they can now, that they have a  separate and distinct right of application and choose to  exercise it. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I can see that the Minister is trying to be  helpful to the Committee and to families. The problem  causes concern not merely to immigration  practitioners--the lawyers-- but to immigration rights  groups. It arises because someone may be involuntarily  nominated as a relevant relative, against his or her wishes  and interests. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Someone nominated by another person  as a relevant member would receive a notice requiring  the recipient to state additional grounds that he or she has  or may have for wanting to remain in the United  Kingdom. At that point, a person can say that he or she  does not wish the application to be considered with that  of the person who had defined him or her as a relevant  member. The issue can therefore be addressed. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurance. I beg  to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I do not want to tax the Committee's  patience by going over the clause 6 arguments all over  again. We had them this morning and many times before.  The Liberal Democrats are making a couple of attempts  to build into clauses 55 and 56 relatively small  protections for people who are administratively removed  from the country. The amendment would build into the  legislation provision to ensure that the grounds for  removal are made much more explicit. That is the  purpose of clause 6, so I hope that the amendment does  not violate its principle and that the Minister will accept  it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not know whether the hon.  Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) intends to speak  to his amendment, or whether he wishes me to address  the points that it raises. As he appears to be otherwise  engaged, I shall attempt to do so. 
<P>
The amendments relate to the statement made by an  applicant under the clause. I shall deal first with  amendment No. 121, which was moved by the hon.  Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). Clause 55 does  not apply to people covered by clause 6. It will be applied  by regulations to those dealt with under clause 6 who claim ECHR or asylum rights. In any event, there is little  point in requiring people to state on which particular  immigration law they are relying. What we need to know  is the substance of their claim; we will then identify the  rule that applies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister need not address  amendment No. 282 at length. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In that case, I would ask the hon.  Member for Twickenham to consider withdrawing  amendment No. 121, as these issues will be addressed in  regulations, in so far as they relate to ECHR and asylum  rights. In our view, it would not be appropriate to include  provisions on that in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I accept the Minister's advice and beg to  ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page  34, line 2, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8) The Secretary of State shall, in any statement of the rules  provided for under section 3(2) of the 1971 Act, include rules setting  out the relevant factors which the Secretary of State must take into  account before deciding to exercise his discretion to remove a person  and any family member of that person under section 6 of this Act.". <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This small amendment might attract the same answer  as my previous amendment did--that the Government  intend to cover the matter in regulations. It is another  attempt to pin the Government down on how they intend  to deal with clause 6 cases. They have said that, in  practice, they will take into account compassionate  grounds in these cases. The amendment is an attempt to  ensure that that commitment is built into the legislation. I  should be grateful for the Minister's assurance that that is  possible, or that he intends to achieve the same end by  other means. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware from  Hansard that when we examined clause 6 in an earlier  sitting, I said that the factors to be considered when  deciding to remove a person under that clause would be  set out in the immigration rules. The amendment is  therefore unnecessary. Again, the immigration rules  rather than the Bill are the appropriate vehicle for dealing  with that matter and, as I indicated, the factors to be  considered when deciding to remove a person under that  clause would be in those rules. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not wish to delay the Committee.  We touched on some of these matters in earlier debates,  so the fact that I am not speaking on them does not reflect  a lack of concern. We made all the points that we wanted  to make when we discussed clause 6, which we covered  with a degree of thoroughness.   
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I appreciate that we now have the  Minister's answer on the record. I too, do not want to  delay the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw  the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended,  stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I said, we all share the objective of  a one-stop shop, but the key question is, does the clause  achieve that objective? We can call it a one-stop shop,  but is it really that? 
<P>
Having read the Government's notes on a case study  under the old and new systems, I should like to put an  example to the Minister. The case that was given was of a  person who had, under the old system, obtained leave to  enter as a visitor for six months. Shortly before the six  months expire, he applies for an extension of stay as a  student. Under the new system, his application is  refused. He appeals and makes no mention of any other  grounds, as he should under clause 51. 
<P>
The appeal takes about three months, which I was told  in a written answer is the time that it usually takes for  these appeals to be dealt with--six to eight weeks for the  appeal to be listed and five weeks for the decision to be  typed up and sent off. His appeal is turned down. After  that, it would be open to him to allege that the Secretary  of State had breached his human rights and to appeal  under clause 47. I think that we established that in earlier  debates. Again, he might not mention any other grounds. 
<P>
The Minister referred us to clause 55(6). 1 believe that  he meant clause 56(6), which states that the Secretary of  State may certify that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in his opinion the sole purpose of such an appeal would be to delay the  removal from the United Kingdom of the applicant".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Will the Minister clarify whether a person who has an  appeal turned down, seeks to to appeal under clause 47  on the basis of human rights and has his appeal certified  by the Secretary of State under clause 56(6) can then seek  leave for judicial review? 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether a person can seek leave for  judicial review, there is nothing to prevent him from  applying for asylum, even if he has not mentioned it  before. The fact that he has not mentioned it before might  affect his right of appeal if the asylum claim is turned  down, but there is nothing to prevent him from claiming  asylum in the first place and the matter then going for  determination by the Secretary of State. I understand  that, in the past year, it took some 17 months for an  asylum claim to be determined. I suspect that the period  might now be slightly longer--certainly the backlog of  cases is much longer than it was last year. 
<P>
A claim for asylum might be refused, and the  Secretary of State might certify the case under clause 56  (4) . Even then, the person concerned could seek leave  for judicial review, according to the Government's note,  which states that under the new system such a person 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"could seek leave to move for judicial review of the Secretary of  State's decision."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Only after such a judicial review has been disposed of  would it be possible for the person to be removed. I am  not sure whether he would have the right to appeal  against a specific destination--that has not been made  clear. Even so, the person has three or four stages under  the one-stop procedure. 
<P>
I may have got some of that wrong I look to the  Minister to correct me if so--but it seems to me that the  one-stop procedure encompasses a number of stops,  possibly including the new stop of an appeal under clause  47. It is good to talk about one-stop shops, but we should  like to see something that approximates more to a  one-stop shop in practice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to  take the view that because matters can be judicially  reviewed, the appeals system will not be unable deliver  the one-stop shop appeal that we hope to create. The  courts have developed a system of judicial review that  seeks to ensure that administrative and judicial  procedure and decisions are carried out according to the  law. The courts are clearly anxious to protect their right  to ensure that things are done properly. The fact that  matters can be judicially reviewed is not in itself  detrimental to good Government administration or  efficient administration of the immigration service  provided that the procedures are applied with reasonable  efficiency and speed. 
<P>
At the moment, there is the opportunity for a whole  series of appeals and judicial reviews. The purpose of the  Bill is to cut down on the possibilities of various appeals  following one after another. By giving people every  chance to make their case early on, our proposals will  make it very unlikely that a judicial review will be  granted. There is a leave phase for the judicial review,  and I would expect judges who considered the judicial  reviews not to be disposed, by and large, to allow matters  to proceed unless a substantial point of law justified that.  My right and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has made  it clear that he wants judges to be robust in ensuring that  the judicial review procedure is not abused and that it is  for them to ensure that their courts are properly and  efficiently run. I am sure that High Court judges will do  so. 
<P>
Of course, someone can always claim asylum and we  will always have to consider the case, but we will do so  quickly. That is the objective of the strategy that we are  developing. We are also tightening up on the abuse of  legal aid. That will obviously have an impact on the way  in which judicial review operates, the extent to which it  can be abused and therefore, on current waiting times for  judicial review. We will reduce the level of abuse--the  number of unjustified judicial reviews--and ensure that  our courts are run more efficiently and effectively. 
<P>
The Bill is part of a strategy for speeding up the way in  which the judicial and administrative system deals with  cases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): Is not it the case  that quite a small proportion of those who apply for leave  for judicial review actually get it? I am afraid that  solicitors often tell clients whose case is reaching the end  of the road that they have applied for judicial review  [Mr. Neil Gerrard] 
<P>
when they know that there is little chance of anything  being achieved. The clients end up paying. Frequently,  the person who has received that pretty poor advice ends  up in my surgery or in that of some other Member of  Parliament when he has reached the end of the road and  his solicitor wants to get rid of him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend is right. All too often,  the procedures have been abused. Part of the process of  reforming the system is to ensure not only that we have  effective regulation of unscrupulous immigration  advisers, to which we will come in due course, but that  the Law Society and the Bar recognise that they have a  role to play in cracking down on those in the legal  profession who deliberately protract unmeritorious cases  and ensure that the asylum system is abused.  Unfortunately, there are lawyers who do that and we  need to restrict their ability to do so. We hope that the  professions will work with us. Up to now, my hon.  Friend and I have experienced some reluctance and  failure on the part of the professional bodies in delivering  on that. We have now received assurances from them  that they will deliver, and we very much hope that they  do. 
<P>
The regulation clauses to which we will come in due  course, the way in which the legal aid system is being  changed and the more robust approach that we hope that  judges will take to unmeritorious claims for judicial  review will have an effect on reducing numbers and,  therefore, waiting times. Those steps will make the  system more efficient. They will ensure that the abuse  and the undermining of the quality of our asylum system  are substantially reduced. 
<P>
We must admit that we will never entirely end some  lawyers' abuse of the system, but it is possible, through a  combined effort on the part of the professions, ourselves  and the law to reduce the level of abuse. If we do that, it  will be to the benefit of all genuine refugees who seek  protection under the 1951 convention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to what the  Minister said. He did not dispute any of the stages that I  outlined. I appreciate that we are going over procedural  ground fairly quickly. If the Minister wants to study what  I have put to him and dispute the existence of any of those  stages of an appeal through the so-called one-stop shop  system, I should be happy to receive a letter from him  telling me that I have got it wrong, or pointing out that  one of those stages does not exist. There seem to be three  or four stages. The Minister looks confident and I look  forward to receiving his letter. I took that information  from the Government's document, but if the Minister  tells me that that is wrong, I shall be happy to hear it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me to  write to him on the detail of how the procedures will  work and I am happy to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In his document, the Minister  helpfully set out a comparison between the old and new  systems. One of the things that the Government  complain about in the current system is the existence of  judicial review. The document says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The above appeal procedures can take several years, particularly if  X seeks judicial review at any stage."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is what is said to be wrong with the present system.  Under the system that I outlined to the Minister,  excluding the judicial review it would take 20 months on  average. The Government have said in a written answer  that waiting times consist of three months for the initial  appeal and 17 months for the application for asylum.  That is the 1998 figure. The backlog of asylum cases has  become much worse in the past few months. It has gone  up by 10,000 cases in the last three months for which  figures have been given. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I was not arguing that judicial review  was wrong in all circumstances. I think that it is an  essential part of safeguarding the law. What causes  annoyance, and more, is that solicitors promise judicial  reviews that have no chance of success and delay the  process. It is a bit extreme to look at every stage of the  procedure where a judicial review might be possible and  then assume that those happen every time, because that is  clearly not the case. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's  point. I took this information from the Government's  literature. They have taken examples of the current  system and presented it as though a person will exercise  every right of appeal and pursue every avenue each time.  I was being fair and dealing with the Government's  proposed system in the same way that they dealt with the  current one. 
<P>
Is it fair to describe this as a one-stop shop when  people can pursue more than one stop if they want to?  Perhaps the Minister will give me the answer to my  question on judicial review on which, I gathered from his  comments, the Government were not entirely keen. Is  there the opportunity for a judicial review--a new stage  of judicial review--if there is a human rights appeal that  the Home Secretary certifies? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman was  referring to the backlog. I am sure that he will accept that  it has developed because of a contract, laws that we  inherited and the developing situation in Kosovo. I am  sure that he would not seek to make political points out of  that. He knows that the Government are dealing with  each of those issues in turn. 
<P>
On judicial reviews, the hon. Gentleman is aware that  as a result of the human rights legislation a body of law  will develop in time and a substantial number of cases  will no doubt be involved to develop the full body of that  jurisprudence. In due course, it will be to the benefit of  the human rights of all our citizens. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is anxious to get on to  the question of Kosovo and the backlog. The  Government, including the Minister, have spoken a lot in  the past about the backlog of cases that they inherited, as  they put it. They made great play of the fact that they  inherited a backlog of 50,000 cases. It now stands at  70,000 cases; it has increased by 10,000 in the past three  months. 
<P>
I received a Parliamentary answer from the Minister--I am speaking from  memory here, but I will look for it later--which referred to the backlog in terms of the  reorganisation of Lunar house. I suggest that it is not the pressure of applications that has  caused the figure to rise by 10,000 in three months, but the way in which those applications  are being dealt with, given the present chaos at Lunar House. A leap of 10,000 cases in three  months is striking. 
<P>
Without going down the avenue of who is to blame, what has happened and contracts--a  side road for these purposes, although we will come to it in due course--the fact is that it takes  17 months for an asylum claim to be determined. At any stage in the so--called  one-stop-shop process, someone can claim asylum and prolong their stay in the country by 17  months. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not saying whether that is right or wrong; I am not saying whether judicial review is  right or wrong. I question whether the Government can seriously claim that the  one--stop-shop system will speed everything up, when many more stops than one and  considerable waiting time are clearly involved. 
<P>
If I were cynical, I should say if people say something often enough, loud enough and with  a sufficiently catchy slogan, others may start to believe them. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of Government amendment No. 679 is to place some important  limitations on the application of clause 56(2). As the Committee will be aware, subsection (2)  concerns an important aspect of the new appeals procedure--the requirement that, if people  want to appeal against a refusal of leave to enter or remain, they must also state any additional  grounds that they may have for wishing to enter or remain. Subsection (2) explains that if an  applicant's statement does not mention a particular ground or grounds of which they are  aware at the time that they make their statement, they will not have a right of appeal in respect  of those grounds. 
<P>
Amendment No. 679 sets out three important exceptions to that general rule. The first two  concern asylum and ECHR claims. The Government are committed to a strong human rights  policy, and to protecting the rights of those who have claimed asylum in this country. We  intend to treat asylum and ECHR claims made subsequent to the notice stage in a way that  ensures that applicants are treated fairly, and that is compatible with our international  obligations. The amendment therefore proposes that subsection (2) will not apply if the  ground that was not mentioned in the statement was a claim on the basis of human rights. In  other words, such a claim could he submitted outside the required notice period, but would  continue to attract a right of appeal in the event that it was refused. 
<P>
Likewise, a claim for asylum submitted out of time will also attract a right of  appeal--unless the Secretary of State certifies that the applicant has made it solely in the hope  of frustrating his removal from the country. That provision is made in subsection (4). The  Committee will note that that sets a high threshold. We intend to use it to catch only those who  deliberately abuse the system, not those with good reason for not having applied for asylum  earlier. 
<P>
Finally, the amendment would allow an appeal in respect of a ground even if it had not been  mentioned at the notice stage if the Secretary of State believed that there was reasonable  excuse for its omission from the applicant's statement. That wording can already be found in  clause 56(9) as drafted, but it would be more logical to include it with the other exceptions to  subsection (2). 
<P>
Amendment No. 683 is a clarifying amendment consequential on the earlier Government  amendments Nos. 674 and 671. I invite the Committee to agree that technical amendment and  amendment No. 679. 
<P>
I come to amendment No. 283, which I expect will in due course be moved by the hon.  Member for Hertsmere.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can save time here, because I think that I have anticipated those points  and covered them in my earlier remarks.   
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does that include amendment No. 284? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for  his assistance. 
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 635, which deals with many  of the same points as those in the amendments tabled by  the Conservatives. Our intention is to discourage late  claims by denying access to the appellate authorities. We  will have given appellants every opportunity to put their  case and the line must be drawn somewhere. We intend  to be reasonable in assessing what is a reasonable excuse,  but shall be prepared if necessary to defend the  rationality of our decisions at judicial review. We do not  accept the amendment. We want the system to work  much more efficiently, and the Liberal Democrat  amendment would prevent that. We want to deny some  access to the appellate authorities, and consider that the  possibility of judicial review is an acceptable price to pay  in the interests of greater efficiency. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the  amendment. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that the only  amendment that has been moved is the first; the others  are only for debate. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No.  635, which raises important issues of what is a  reasonable definition of a reasonable error and where  lines are being drawn. I understand the Minister's  reasonable objectives; to prevent undue late  submissions, negligence and people not taking the  process seriously. Of course we want to discourage that,  and to that extent I agree with the Minister, but there are  many reasons why applications may be submitted late.  We are discussing a sophisticated area of law, and  quality of representation may well have much to do with  that. 
<P>
Of course the line should be drawn somewhere, we  accept that premise. However, the person who should  decide whether an excuse is reasonable is the  adjudicator, rather than the Home Office. As the  adjudicator is more impartial, that would be a proper way  to strike the balance and draw the line in a reasonable  way. So we accept the Minister's premise, but the  decision should be made in a different place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman's  amendment is on the basis that if the applicant  "contends", the whole issue of whether the appellate  authority should set aside the certificate will be raised.  All he needs to do is contend--that is, raise the argument.  That threshold is not very high. It would enable the  person to start voicing arguments, which were not  necessarily sound. The amendment is technically  questionable. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman appears to be suggesting that if  someone has not advanced grounds that he ought to have  earlier--he says that that may be because of bad  representation--he should still be allowed to advance his  case whenever he wants. If he is seeking to abuse the system and advances multiple cases on different  grounds, the hon. Gentleman appears satisfied with that.  The Government are not. 
<P>
The applicant will be told clearly that he needs to raise  at the earliest possible stage any ground on which he  seeks to further his claim or appeal. That notice will be  clear. Providing him with the opportunity to do so  later--when he happens to get round to it and decides  that he wants to advance a different claim or  appeal--would be to set far too low a threshold. 
<P>
Let me deal with the issue of quality of representation.  Hon. Members often raise cases with me in which they  say--I understand the argument very well--that a  constituent of theirs was badly advised by an  unscrupulous immigration adviser, an incompetent  solicitor or, sometimes, a friend. We really cannot base  our whole immigration and asylum system on the  contention that we need constantly to protect every  person who seeks advice from an incompetent adviser,  gets it wrong, or deliberately goes to someone  unscrupulous--no doubt some will because they think  that that such a person might be able to achieve some  advantage for them. We cannot base all our decisions and  procedures on trying to ensure that no person is ever  disadvantaged by the incompetence of their adviser. 
<P>
We need a system that, in so far as we can make it do  so, establishes high standards and ensures efficiency and  fairness and that justice is delivered. We cannot keep  giving more and more opportunities for delay because  that of itself creates injustice. The whole way in which  our asylum and immigration system operates is a basis  for injustice because of the delays. 
<P>
One of the lawyers' arguments has always been that  there need to be multiple opportunities for appeal just in  case someone somewhere gets something wrong or has  been badly advised by their previous adviser. We cannot  run things in that way. We must tell people that there is an  obligation on them to shop around and ensure that they  get good advice. The Government must try to ensure, in  so far as we can, that there are opportunities, through the  legal aid system and otherwise, for people to access good  advice. We must also clear out some incompetent and  unscrupulous people who cause the problems. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham suggests that we  should create a system that enables someone to raise an  issue later, at their discretion simply because they have  been badly advised or becaue they did not raise an issue  when they ought to have. I do not think that we should  pander to that sort of thing. The delays in the system  create injustice; we need to reduce injustice and create  efficiency. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We covered very similar ground in  discussions on a previous set of amendments and we  covered it thoroughly. We made it clear then that we  share the Government's objective of seeking to avoid  delay. The system must be fair, but no one wants to see  delay. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I am aware that we have covered this  ground and I do not want to perpetuate the debate, but the  Minister seems to rely heavily on his fear, which is partly  justified, of abusive claims and deliberate delay. 
<P>
We are concerned about the concept of a reasonable  excuse. There are reasonable excuses--indeed, that  language is incorporated in the clause. But who should  decide what is reasonable in such cases? We propose that  the definition of what is reasonable should be made by  the appeal. Clearly, if the excuse was not reasonable, it  could be summarily dismissed. There is no reason why  the mechanism that we suggest should be a cause for  delay. I understand that we have been over this ground. I  have made my point and the Government have heard it. I  do not therefore intend to press my amendment.

<P>

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 557, in page  35, line 29, leave out "has no merit" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is an abuse of the process of the Court".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Although I am not a lawyer, there would seem to be an  important issue of principle involved in the clause. A  system is being introduced, effectively, of fining people  who wish to pursue an appeal. I am sure that there are  lawyers in the Committee who can find a wider  significance to the clause. To me as a layman, that  concept seems alarming. 
<P>
I shall narrow the discussion to the particular concerns  that we have with the Bill. Continuing an earlier  discussion, the Government are clearly concerned with  the need to prevent abusive appeals. I shall say again that  we understand that need. Following the logic of that  concern, we think that the clause should be more tightly  drafted and have suggested another test.  [Dr. Cable] 
<P>
People should be fined not for trying to pursue an  appeal that, in the Government's assessment, has no  merit--even if those people believe that it has--but  when they are abusing the processes of the court. That  would seem to be more consonant with the spirit of what  the Government are trying to achieve; it would not work  against it. I hope that they will consider softening their  language in that respect. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are again on familiar ground. I  invite the Minister to deal with one point: there is a  reference in subsection 2(b) of the clause to paragraph 15  of schedule 4. However, there is no such paragraph in  that schedule. That may be another of the mistakes that  has crept into the Bill, which does not make things easier.  It is also a bit of a mystery why the provision is necessary  at the moment because, as I understand it, leave to appeal  is already required. That being the case, we do not need  to detain the Committee for long on this point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As the hon. Gentleman pointed out,  clause 59(3) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subsection (1) does not apply if leave for appeal to the Tribunal  was required."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
One of the issues that we are examining is whether leave  to appeal to the tribunal is a procedure with which we  will need to continue. The clause will not apply until  such time as that matter is dealt with. One of the options  for change that is open to us is to dispense with the whole  issue of leave. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's  suggestion that there may be a drafting error. We shall no  doubt discover in due course whether he is right, and if so  correct it. 
<P>
Amendment No. 557 was moved by the hon. Member  for Twickenham. If a procedure for an appeal is open, it  is not an abuse to use it in legal terms, but may be an  abuse in common parlance. We want to ensure that even  though we keep various options open they are used  properly. The problem is that abuse of the system has  developed to such an extent that mechanisms are needed  to control the making of worthless applications for  appeal. 
<P>
Amendment No. 557 would raise the test that would  need to be applied by the Government to try to deter  abuse, and would make our attempt to do that much less  effective. Indeed, it would undermine the whole aim of  clause 59. Without a requirement to apply for leave to  appeal, there has to be another way to deter worthless  cases. Applying the test only to cases which represent  abuse of the system--and that is a very strong  test--would not deter the abusive claim. The amendment  would play straight into the hands of those who want to  spin things out, because while it is not necessarily an  abuse of process to bring a claim that the tribunal  believes has no merit, it would not normally be possible  to say that there had been an abuse until a history of  time-wasting and non-compliance with the rules and  directions had developed. 
<P>
The purpose of the procedure is to enable the tribunal  to give an early warning that the appeal is doomed to  failure and ought not to proceed. It is an attempt to nip in  the bud, before it gets too far, the whole process of dragging out the appeal system. If the hon. Member for  Twickenham insisted on pressing the amendment, it  would make our attempt to prevent the level of abuse  much less effective, and would encourage and enable  those who are currently abusing the system to continue to  do so. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to think long  and hard. I have already made the point that the level of  abuse of the asylum and immigration system is damaging  to genuine refugees and people who have genuine  immigration cases. It is in their interests, as much as in  the interests of the taxpayer and effective law  enforcement, that we seek to reduce the level of abuse in  the system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I agree with the Minister's  response to the amendment. In other areas of  immigration, I have been involved in one or two High  Court actions in which the other side has made constant  bids to have the action struck out and do various other  things that I regard as a total abuse of process. A better  test is not abuse of process but whether there is a lack of  merit. 
<P>
When notice has not been given, presumably it will  not be open to the tribunal to make the specified charge.  It must say in advance if it believes that there is a lack of  merit. If it has given such notice, and yet later on  dismisses an appeal that has been pursued, I hope that it  will not feel obliged to impose the charge, because an  arguable case sometimes becomes rather more obvious.  In that way, it will not be an absolute requirement that the  tribunal makes the charge if notice has previously been  given and the appeal is dismissed. 
<P>
My final question, which I will just throw into the air,  goes back to some of the debates that we had a week or  two ago. Does the specified amount that may be charged  have to be fixed or is there flexibility between a high  charge and no charge? That last issue does not  necessarily come under this amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's  question about whether there is an obligation to impose a  charge. The wording of clause 59(5) is: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Tribunal may impose on the appellant, or on his  representative, a penalty of the specified amount".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is, therefore, permissive, and the tribunal would  have to make a judgment as to whether imposing a  charge was appropriate in a particular case. I hope that  that deals with the hon. Gentleman's point. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I do not propose to press the amendment; I  simply want to register the point that I found that  exchange very helpful and enlightening. Our objective  was not to raise the test but to change it. What has  happened is that we have used "abuse" as it would be  used in common parlance as opposed in its purely legal  sense. I heard the Minister's reply, and I beg to ask leave  to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss  Government amendments Nos. 697, 698 and 700. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Although these are essentially  technical amendments, I think it right that I alert the  Committee to what they do. 
<P>
Amendment No. 697 amends the definition of  immigration advice for the purposes of part V. The  amendment clarifies the fact that immigration advice  does not include representing an individual before a  court in criminal proceedings or matters ancillary to  criminal proceedings. It ensures that those persons  representing a foreign national in criminal proceedings  may offer immigration advice as part of their overall  advice without being registered under part V, or being  exempt from its requirements. 
<P>
In such proceedings, the adviser needs knowledge of  criminal law and procedure rather than the minutiae of  immigration and asylum law. Therefore, we see no need  to subject such practitioners to the requirements of  part V. 
<P>
Amendment No. 698 makes it clear that proceedings  to which the definition of immigration services refers in  clause 61 are civil and not criminal. 
<P>
Amendment No. 700 removes from relevant matters  the exclusion of criminal proceedings in relation to an  unlawful entry into the United Kingdom as a  consequence of amendments Nos. 696 and 698. 
<P>
Although these are essentially technical amendments,  I know that some in the legal profession have been  concerned to ensure that we make these points clear in  the Bill, and for the purposes of the record I thought that  it was right to set out exactly what they do.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not know whether the hon.  Member for Twickenham intends to speak to his  amendment, but on the assumption that he does, I will  deal with it then. Let me deal first with the two  Government amendments. 
<P>
Amendment No. 699 will remove support under  clause 74 from the definition of "relevant matters" under  clause 61. We tabled the amendment in response to  concerns from the voluntary sector that many of those  giving advice on housing and benefits have no expertise  in immigration matters, and that we might create a  shortage of quality advice on welfare by retaining the  current definition of "relevant matters".

Amendment No. 701 will amend the scope of  "relevant matters" to include advice on bail applications  made under the Immigration Acts or under the Special  Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. I am sure  that members of the Committee would agree that such  bail applications require a considerable degree of  expertise in, and knowledge of, immigration law, and  require representatives of quality, given that the issue is  one of liberty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I am pleased to speak to the  amendments. I would not want to express a view about  whether their wording is precisely correct, but they raise  serious issues. If the Minister understands their point and  is minded to acknowledge their intentions, perhaps he  will tell us either that they are acceptable or that he will  return to the Committee with better proposals. 
<P>
There is a danger that organisations that are not  primarily trying to give immigration advice or services  may be caught unnecessarily or may not be caught  properly by the clause. Amendment No. 309 seeks to  ensure that the clause does not catch Members of  Parliament, members of our staff or councillors who are  not qualified providers of immigration advice or services  but who are asked for help. Those points are relatively  straightforward, and I am sure that the Minister has a  brief on them. 
<P>
It may also be helpful for the Minister's advisers to  recognise that the amendments cover similar points to  those which will be considered during debate of  amendments Nos. 138 and 139, which would alter clause  63 and schedule 6. I am not trying to speak to those  amendments as well, although a question such as that of  how universities or charities are dealt with covers much  of the same ground as that covered by the amendment. It  may help our progress if the Minister thinks that such  issues could be dealt with in the same way, although the  crucial point is spelt out in the amendments. 
<P>
Is the drafting sufficient to exclude from being caught  by the clause what the Minister, myself, many other  Committee members and others hon Members will do  when a constituent asks for advice or help? Are we  caught by the clause, if we are should we be, and if we  should not be caught, can we ensure that we are  excluded? Opposition Members do not believe that the  wording of amendment No. 309 is necessarily right,  because it would insert a "not" rather than an "are" . The  Committee will listen with interest to the Minister's  response.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some  important points to which I am pleased to respond. When  I read the initial text of the Bill I shared some of his  concerns. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises some  important points to which I am pleased to respond. When  I read the initial text of the Bill, I shared some of his  concerns. I have since been reassured by our legal  advisers that the points are covered appropriately. 
<P>
The Bill stipulates that references to the provision of  immigration advice or services are to references to the  provision of such advice or services in the course of a  business carried on--whether or not for profit--by the  person concerned or by another person. Amendment No.  310 would extend that definition in an attempt to ensure  that only those providing immigration advice or services  in a business mainly or exclusively concerned with the  giving of immigration advice or services could be  caught. 
<P>
The amendment would not be workable; it is  open-ended and provides a defence for the unscrupulous.  They would merely need to ensure that a significant part  of their business was concerned with other matters, and  they could practice in the immigration field without  regulations. That is a technical point in a sense, but in  terms of the amendment it is worth making. 
<P>
Amendment No. 309 would specifically exempt  Members of Parliament, their staff and councillors from  the prohibition on providing immigration advice or  services. Members of Parliament, their staff and  councillors have already been excluded from the  prohibition when carrying out their functions in that  capacity, as they are not providing advice or service in  the course of a business. The amendment would also  exclude Members of Parliament who may provide advice  and services outside their function as a Member. We  believe that Members of Parliament are already  excluded, as in the proper course of their parliamentary  duties they give advice, as do councillors, because that is  their civic duty, although not their business. However,  the amendment would exclude Members of Parliament  who may provide those services outside their  Parliamentary functions and in the course of business. In  the circumstances, we consider that Members of  Parliament should not be exempt from the prohibition of  providing advice in the course of business. It cannot be  right to allow Members who have private practices to be  immune from that. I am sure that that was not the hon.  Gentleman's intention. So, we can provide such  reassurances as are possible that it is not our intention to  include Members of Parliament. 
<P>
There is a broader and more difficult issue which in a  sense amendment No. 310 addresses: what about others  who give advice? In due course we shall consider other  amendments that relate to universities. It is a very  difficult matter on which we have had a great deal of  work done. It is clear that some genuine organisations  which are scrupulous in the sense that they do not try to  be dishonest or misadvise, or attempt to gain from giving  advice, are not competent to give advice. They may be  scrupulous, but they are incompetent. This is a difficult  area. The broad issue with which we are dealing is the  unscrupulous, and, to some extent, we are trying to  encourage an improvement in competence and  awareness. I shall deal with the university issue later, but  the concerns that we face are complex: to what extent are  we dealing with the unscrupulous and to what extent with  the merely incompetent but not dishonest? We must  ensure that we set up a regulatory system that makes  some attempt to deal with the unscrupulous but that also,  I hope, attempts to improve the standard and quality of  advice available to often vulnerable people. I hope in due  course to be able to deal with some of the other issues that  have been raised, but I am happy to take this important  issue further if the hon. Gentleman or others have more  questions about it. 
<P>
I have listened carefully to the points raised in  Committee. The issues are difficult and complex, and we  would take seriously any steering guidance from the  Committee about how to address the problem. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> There are various interactions.  I do not wish to deal with them at great length as the  Committee is making progress, which all sides would  like to continue. Clause 60 dealt with the opportunity of  getting grants: the Government have no obligation to  provide them to all groups. Later we will reach clause 63,  which is about general prohibitions and exemptions.  There is a distinction between those who are competent  and those who are "qualified"--in its technical  meaning--those who pay fees to be registered and those  who may be qualified because they are members of  another body, such as solicitors. 
<P>
I accept the Minister's technical points about drafting.  It would be wrong to exempt a Member of Parliament  who also practises as a solicitor. Otherwise, we would  make an exemption for being registered with the Law  Society or another indirect qualification. I accept the  Minister's point about that. I also accept that the Minister  does not want incompetent people to give advice. The  Minister is genuine when he says that he is paying  attention to the Committee. 
<P>
Let us consider education. There could be a way of  providing qualifications indirectly--with the help of the  Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals--as we  do for solicitors and others. That may be a way of dealing  with the student unions and university advice. That may  not necessarily be what the Minister intends, but it could  be considered as way of achieving it in practice, rather  than requiring full registration and fees. 
<P>
There is also the issue of business. Many people may  not believe that the Minister's views are right about that.  It would be open to a court to say that a Member of  Parliament is in the business of getting re-elected, which  involves a service to constituents. The Minister and I  may believe that we provide that service because it is part  of what a Member of Parliament  ought to do: it is not  designed to bring us popularity and we can lose  popularity as well as have successes--a side issue. 
<P>
The Minister should think further about his assurance  that Members of Parliament would not be regarded as  being in business for profit and he should remember that  [Mr. Peter Bottomley] 
<P>
councillors might be in the same situation. I am very  concerned about the position of not-for-profit  organisations and charities. The Minister should  consider whether indirect qualifications could be used  for some charities. The main charities in immigration  advice and health do not mind being registered: it is part  of the reason for their existence. Others may be  competent, but not qualified in terms of registration. The  Minister should consider, as I said, whether indirect  qualifications could be allowed so that people do not fall  under the general disqualification in clause 63. 
<P>
These matters are complicated and involved. The  Committee accepts that the amendments are technically  defective, but may not believe that all the issues have yet  been resolved.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the  issues have not yet been resolved. Some of the matters  that he raised are addressed in later clauses. However, let  me deal with Members of Parliament--an issue that I  would like to knock on the head quickly. The hon.  Gentleman will be aware that clause 63(4)(d) enables the  Secretary of State to exempt certain categories of persons  specified in an order for purposes of this part of the Bill. 
<P>
Let me make it clear that for Members of Parliament or  councillors carrying out their proper civic duties as part  of their office, we could bring forward a regulation to  ensure exemption. There is no intention for Members of  Parliament or councillors to be covered by the  legislation. Should there be any question--our advice so  far is that there is no question, but I understand the hon.  Gentleman's point and know that lawyers disagree--we  have the power under clause 63(4)(d) to ensure  exemption. We would act accordingly, if necessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> That is satisfactory. I beg to  ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 311, in  page 37, leave out lines 35 and 36 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) The Commissioner is to be appointed by the Lord Chancellor".
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment  No. 312, in page 37, line 36, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) The appointment of the Commissioner is to be subject to the  approval of the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of  Commons". <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Systems for registering immigration  advisers have been implemented in different countries  with varying success. We hope that the Government's  system here will be successful and will bring about high  standards of immigration advice, which is so important to many people. It would increase the chances of success  if the Government showed a willingness to consult and  listen to those active in representing providers of  immigration advice, especially professional bodies. 
<P>
The Bill provides for separate, but overlapping,  systems of regulation. There is regulation of immigration  advisers who register with the immigration  commissioner and thereby become qualified persons.  There is also the system that covers those within the  designated professional and other bodies mentioned in  clause 63. It is particularly important to listen to the  views of designated professional bodies, including the  Law Society, many of whose members are interested in  this area of law. The systems overlap at the point of  disciplinary functions, which makes consultation and  co-operation even more important. 
<P>
Amendment No. 311 concerns a subject of particular  interest to the Law Society, which believes that the  commissioner, who is responsible for many important  regulatory functions, should be appointed by the Lord  Chancellor rather than the Home Secretary. The Law  Society states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This would ensure the independence of the commissioner . . . it  would be perverse for the Secretary of State to have power to regulate  the Commissioner, who effectively controls his or her opponents in  immigration and asylum cases."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Much can be said for the Law Society's views and it  would assist the appearance of independence and  fairness if the commissioner were appointed by the Lord  Chancellor. 
<P>
I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to  respond affirmatively today, but I hope that he will show  a willingness to listen to what the Law Society has to say,  which could help the system off to a good start. 
<P>
Amendment No. 312 covers a different subject and, in  its own way, seeks to strike a blow for parliamentary  democracy. However, I will not speak to it today. I would  like a response to amendment No. 311, which relates to  an important issue. We want to make some progress. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I support my hon. Friend on a  point that will not make much difference in terms of  government, but will make a significant difference to  how matters are seen. I know that the Minister will refer  to consultation with the Lord Chancellor, but unless he  can point to a series of precedents, he should follow what  my hon. Friend proposes in the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Lord Chancellor does not  want the job and it would be inappropriate for him to  have it. The Secretary of State is responsible only for  appointing the commissioner who is effectively a  non-Departmental public body, independent of the  Government. The Secretary of State has no  responsibility for the commissioner's handling of  individual cases. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for judicial  appointments and for the way in which the courts  operate. The immigration services commissioner,  however, is not a judicial officer and has no power to hear  appeals. He will be responsible for the administration of a scheme to regulate immigration advisers. He is there essentially to administer the scheme. Members of the  Immigration Appeal Tribunal, however, which is the  body that will hear appeals against any of the decisions,  will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor. That is an  appropriate balance. 
<P>
I emphasise that the commissioner's role is  administrative and not judicial, so I hope that the hon.  Member for Hertsmere will seek to withdraw the  amendment. He can be assured that the commissioner's  independence is covered by the provisions of part II of  schedule 5, in particular the length of his term of  appointment. It is an administrative, non-departmental  post with a fixed-term appointment to enable him to  carry out his administrative duties properly. It is  appropriate that the Secretary of State should appoint  that person. However, I would understand the hon.  Gentleman's objection if we were saying that the tribunal  should be appointed by the Home Office, in which case  there might be an alternative argument--indeed, there  is--because we have taken the view that the Lord  Chancellor should properly appoint a body to hear  appeals against the commissioner's decisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister must go part way to  accepting the argument. The Bill says that the Secretary  of State must consult the Lord Chancellor, so there is  clearly something for Lord Chancellor to be involved in  or have an interest in. The words that the Minister read  out perhaps presented only one side of the argument. 
<P>
The Minister referred to part II of schedule 5, which  states that the commissioner will be "a corporation sole".  Lord Woolf might have been brought in here: although it  is English, it does not sound like plain English to me. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> "A corporation sole" is a phrase that  will be well known to the Law Society in particular and  to various other organisations. It will enable the  commissioner to have the requisite degree of  independence. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor will want to be properly  consulted; it is right that he should be, and there is  provision for that. However, it is the Immigration Appeal  Tribunal that hears appeals against decisions, therefore it  is consistent with what we do elsewhere that the Lord  Chancellor should appoint its members. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the  Minister's response, and I do not expect him to change  his mind this evening. However, I shall put something to  him that follows from it, which I hope he will take away  and consider. 
<P>
The Minister said that the commissioner has an  administrative rather than a judicial function, but, as I  said in my opening remarks, the disciplinary machinery  overlaps at some point between designated professional  bodies such as the Law Society and the immigration  advisers, who are registered. One point at which it  overlaps is apparently the complaints scheme under the  schedule, as the commissioner is responsible for  professional bodies. The Minister will see from  paragraph 7 of schedule 5 that the commissioner must  give a decision on a complaint and a written statement  and, under paragraph 8(c): 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the person to whom the complaint relates falls within paragraph (c),  (d) or (e) of section 63(2)"--
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
that includes solicitors, because they are in a "designated  professional body" under clause 63(c),--the  commissioner may 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"refer the complaint and his decision on it to the relevant regulatory  body".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The role is therefore more than just administrative  because the commissioner has to deliberate at least on the  question of referring a complaint and he has to give a  decision on the complaint. 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
There is an obligation on the commissioner to  deliberate on complaints that have been made against  solicitors. What concerns the Law Society as much as  anything else is the appearance of this. In general terms,  much of the time members of the Law Society working  on immigration cases have the Secretary of State on the  other side. Yet here, the person who is responsible for  investigating complaints and who carries out the  regulatory function is to be appointed by the Secretary of  State. There is the appearance of this to consider. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> For the sake of completeness, my  hon. Friend could have gone on to paragraphs (d) and (e).  Paragraph (d) allows the commissioner to recommend  the withdrawal of a person's exemption which means  that he is out of the business and paragraph (e) allows  him to lay a disciplinary charge. My hon. Friend slightly  understated his case. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I  appreciate the Minister's argument and I do not want to  he discordant, but I hope that he will at least be prepared  to take this away to look at it in the light of my comments  and write to me. I do not expect him to change his  position this afternoon, but if he did that it would take  things forward a little.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.  The points that he has made are quite right and are clearly  in the Bill. It is precisely for that reason that we took the  view that the Lord Chancellor should be consulted, but  we still feel that the dominant area for which the  commissioner will be responsible involves not a judicial  but an administrative role. Although in the course of  taking these actions, he will arguably impinge in an area  of the Lord Chancellor's responsibility in relation to the  legal profession, he will not in effect adjudicate,  although he will take a view. He will lay cases before the  tribunal and he will take a view about complaints. He has  a role in making decisions, but anything of any  consequence that would happen to a member of the legal  profession will be a matter for others who will be  appointed by the Lord Chancellor. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point, but  as a generality it will be important to listen to the views of  the Law Society and others on this. The Law Society  obviously must represent the interests of its members,  but its evidence to us showed clearly that it was also  putting forward the independent public interest. It has a  valuable contribution to make and I hope that the 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> At this point, it is appropriate to say just a few words about the broad context  of what we are doing here and the role of the immigration services commissioner. He has an  important position in ensuring that what we deliver here is effective. We have a manifesto  commitment to control unscrupulous immigration advisers. We aim to stop the exploitation  of vulnerable people by so-called advisers who are fraudulent, incompetent, dishonest or  completely unqualified to do anything and can set themselves up to advise vulnerable people,  often to their detriment. 
<P>
Many cases which might have gone a different way have been destroyed by the behaviour  of these people. Some of them have deliberately set out to break the law. They have sought to  undermine the immigration and asylum system. They are the worst enemies of genuine  immigrants and genuine asylum seekers because they prey on their vulnerabilities. They  promise things which are often not delivered and destroy lives in the process. They do so by  submitting false or inadequate applications often in the knowledge that to do so will prolong  the application process so that more fees can be claimed. They make misleading claims about  expertise, past successes or membership of professional organisations. They fail to inform  clients that they can obtain advice free of charge from reputable organisations and then  charge them for work which they do inadequately, or not at all. 
<P>
The way that the system has operated has for a long time been a matter of great concern to  many hon. Members. We want to set up a system of registration that will in almost all cases  exclude the unscrupulous adviser or create mechanisms to that effect. The only effective way  to control such people is through a system of regulation. We have decided that non-legally  qualified persons should be effectively regulated and that legally qualified persons should be  able to offer advice if authorised to do so by their professional body. However, it would be  unlawful for any person to provide immigration advice in or from the UK unless registered to  do so by a member of a professional body or a European equivalent. 
<P>
The previous Government declined to take action to deal with this. We are now delivering  on our manifesto commitment. 
<P>
Clause 62 provides for the appointment of the immigration services commissioner and  enables him to carry out his duties in creating and delivering a system that will deal with the  unscrupulous immigration advisers who have wrecked so many lives. I urge the Committee  to support it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I thank the Minister for speaking on clause stand part. I will not go  back over the previous debate as it overlaps with the first parts of the clause. Subsection (5)  states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The Commissioner must exercise his functions so as to secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that those who  provide immigration advice or immigration services"
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
 and then lists a series of requirements. Can the Minister confirm that the commissioner could  consider whether it is appropriate for those giving advice or services for money to be allowed  to do so on a contingency fee basis? 
<P>
Ever since the time of democracy in Greece many thousands of years ago, lawyers have  had the obligation not only to put forward the best possible case for their clients, but to act as  advisers to the courts. I imagine that there will be the same implicit responsibility here: those  who are qualified in the law will have the same freedom to put the best possible case for their  clients so long as they do not actively encourage or repeat something that they know to be  untrue. As a non-lawyer, I have only a secondhand knowledge of the limits to advocacy. In  general, lawyers can be expected to find the right path of acting in their client's interests  without going beyond their professional limits. 
<P>
I do not think that the Committee wants to go into the other issues relating to the second  part of schedule 5 at great length. The Committee has been grateful to the Minister for  spelling out what the commissioner system is designed to achieve. There is general  agreement that it is worthwhile. Many people give their time and talents whether working for  charities or as professional lawyers or others in a very difficult field. It is difficult for the  Minister and his officials and for those giving advice and it is certainly difficult for those with  a genuine desire, wish, need--or even qualification--to remain in this country under one or  other of the permissible categories. We are trying to find proper ways of addressing the  problem. The Minister's general approach should be supported. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked about contingency fees--an interesting  question, which I had not considered. Nothing in the clause prevents the commissioner from  allowing advice to be given on a contingency fee basis. It would probably be for the  commissioner--and, in due course, the professional bodies--to consider the propriety of  that. It would be worth reflecting on that matter and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for  raising it.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that the Commissioner has obtained a warrant issued under  sub-paragraph (3A) below. 
<P>
"(3A) If on an application made by the Commissioner a circuit  judge is satisfied that reasonable grounds for believing that--

(c) that it does not consist of items subject to legal privilege

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment raises an important issue--the need  for judicial oversight of searches initiated by the  commissioner. The premises of a solicitor could be  entered and access given to confidential files without the  sort of judicial oversight that would normally be  expected of the police. I am surprised that Conservative  Members did not proceed with their amendment, which  expressed the same sentiments--that a circuit judge  should be involved. 
<P>
I am not arguing about the specifics of the language.  The change could be achieved simply, as the  Conservative amendment originally suggested, or it  could be done in the more highly specified way  embodied in my amendment. The basic principle is what  is important--that the opportunity to enter premises,  especially solicitors' premises which often contain  confidential material, should not be allowed without  some form of legal check. That is why we want a circuit  judge to authorise it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I assume that the Conservatives  did not move their amendment because they realised that  no force was involved in the process of entering premises  and that there was therefore no need for judicial  oversight. The commissioner, or a member of his staff if  authorised in writing by the commissioner to do so, is  permitted to enter premises. He or she is not permitted to  use force if obstructed. Moreover, the sanctions for  resistance depend on there being no reasonable excuse  for failure to admit. I do not see the necessity for a  judicial safeguard. The commissioner is not permitted to  enter any private residence. Because no force is involved  and because a proper administrative procedure is used to deal with such cases, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will  seek to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It might also be helpful to say that  paragraph 6(7) of schedule 5 says

<P>

<P>
It may be sensible to consider whether cancelling the  registration includes removing the exemption. I am not  sure whether that is as tight as it should be, but I leave that  for consideration later. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall take the hon. Gentleman's point  on board. He rightly identifies an issue that we should  perhaps address.

<P>
This is another subject that caught our eye. The  commissioner's annual report must set out the  commissioner's opinion as to how well designated  professional bodies have done in regulating their  members. The amendment is designed to highlight the  position of professional bodies in another European  Economic Area state, because, under the Bill, a person  registered with such a body can provide immigration  advice. 
<P>
We are asking the Government and, through them, the  commission, to be vigilant in ensuring that people do not  find a loophole in this system of regulation and get round  it by being registered in another EEA state. We want high  standards of advice all round and to anticipate any  possible loopholes. I appreciate that this is an early stage  in the development of the scheme, but it is worth bearing  in mind for the future. This point also covers some  subsequent amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> This is a helpful amendment, although I  cannot accept it in its present form. We viewed the  annual report as part of the mechanism in the Bill to keep  the designation of professional bodies under periodic  review, but I agree that the Secretary of State should be  made aware of the failings of professional bodies in other  EEA states, particularly in cases where someone who is  registered abroad attempts to operate here. 
<P>
We want to consider how we can best address this  issue. I am not sure that there needs to be a provision in  the Bill, but it may be appropriate to deal with it in  regulations. The hon. Gentleman's point is well made.  We want time to evaluate it properly and consider how to  move forward on it.

The amendment would enable the commissioner to  exempt a person from the requirement to register with  him in respect of certain types of immigration advice or  services and not others. It has been requested by  voluntary organisations whom we have consulted, who  may have expertise in certain areas, but not others and  who may not therefore meet the commissioner's criteria  for complete exemption. 
<P>

<P>
( ) No fee is to be prescribed for the registration of a university,  college of further education or students' union.".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Let me say in passing, in case the  Minister moves amendment No. 74 formally, that he  knows that we welcome it, but let us say so on the record.  We are glad that he proposes in a future amendment to  meet many of the wishes of charities and others who  provide advice services. 
<P>
I turn now to what I regard as one of the major issues,  on which the Minister may be able to say more now than  when I first raised it. A large number of overseas students  come to this country, a proportion of whom may have  difficulties over their leave to remain. Also many people  who are not students receive advice from charities. They  might find that, although their primary purpose is not to  give immigration advice, the charities are either  competent to do so or, like many student unions and  universities, able to respond to requests for help or  information from those who require leave to be in this  country. 
<P>
I do not want to make a long speech, because the  Minister may say that he has reached some agreement  with representative educational or charitable  organisations, but I propose to include those  organisations in the list of exemptions in the clause.  Clause 63(1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No person may provide immigration advice or immigration  services unless he is a qualified person.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Subsection (3) provides a limitation of registration.  Subsection (4) states that subsection (1), the general  prohibition. 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "does not apply to a person who-- 
<P>
(a) is certified by the Commissioner as exempt . . . 
<P>
(b) is employed by an exempt person; 
<P>
(c) works under the supervision"--
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I think that the word "of" is missing, and we may need to  add it-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an exempt person or an employee of an exempt person".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
My amendment, which may not be the best means of  achieving my objective, would include in the exemption  a person who 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is employed by a university, college of further education or students'  union either primarily or incidentally as an international student  adviser"--
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
 or who-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is employed by a registered charity engaged either primarily or  incidentally in the provision of immigration advice or immigration  services."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 139 to schedule 6 would add that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No fee is to be prescribed for the registration of registered charities  engaged either primarily or incidentally in the provision of  immigration advice or immigration service"--
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and that-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No fee is to be prescribed for the registration of a university,  college of further education or students' union."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The intention behind the amendments can be  approached in various ways. If the Minister says that  they are technically defective, that is in the nature of our  discussion. However, the point behind them is important.  If we imagine that no university, college of further  education or students' union would be troubled by giving  advice--or, more, rationally, if we assume that all of  them will at some stage provide such advice--is it  possible that registration of the university, college of  further education or students' union could be regarded as  registration for the purpose of the Bill? 
<P>
That may not be a fully satisfactory approach, but it is  a possible one. If every college from Northbrook college  in my constituency to the university of London will be  involved--the same will apply to the charities covered  by the second paragraphs of my two amendments--the  Minister ought to consult to find a way to deal with the  fee issue. Perhaps he has already done so. We should not  make it difficult for people to get advice from those who  will either want to advise them or will do so because of  proximity or propinquity. I do not want the deterrent of  fees or difficult registration. I do not want people to have  to say, "I am sorry; I cannot help you." I want to find a  practical way forward; I know that UKCOSA and others  want to do the same, as do many charities. I look forward  to hearing the Minister's response to the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 138 would  exempt employees of universities, colleges or students'  unions and employees of charities engaged in the  provision of immigration advice or services from the  prohibition on the provision of immigration advice and  services. The problem is that the voluntary sector have  informed us that some advisers in the voluntary and  university sectors were frankly incompetent to provide  advice. That brings us back to a difficult issue. We all  agree that we should deal with the unscrupulous and the  dishonest; that is not a matter of contention. What is  more contentious is the fact that some should not be  giving advice at all. 
<P>
It is essential that we have some means of ensuring  that those who provide advice adhere to basic standards  and have a basic competence. I hope that we can ensure  that the universities and other organisations deliver a  reasonable level of competence and advice. If they can  show that they can meet the minimum standards, they  may well find that they are exempt. They can apply for  exemption as individuals or as a body. It is intended that  in appropriate cases, the commissioner will use his  power to grant individual exemptions or to exempt  certain voluntary bodies, which might include certain  university organisations. 
<P>
Amendment No. 139 would exempt registered  charities or the employees of universities, colleges or  student unions from the payment of a fee for registration.  One of the difficulties with that is that the alternative to  them paying for a decision on whether they are exempt or  whether they ought to be registered is the taxpayer  paying for it. Universities get most of their money from  the taxpayer, but some comes from other sources,  including from the fees of students who come from  abroad. Many of them are likely to seek advice on     [Mr. Mike O'Brien] immigration matters. We must be careful that we do not  say that they should all be subsidised by the British  taxpayer in the advice that they receive some may be  wealthy and some may not. As I say these things, I am  conscious of the importance of the education industry, as  we have described it in past debates. 
<P>
The Bill makes no provision for the payment of a fee  by those who are exempt from the prohibition on the  provision of immigration advice unless qualified to do  so. We envisage that the majority of charities and  advisers in the educational establishment will be  exempted as organisations or individually by the  commissioner. Thus, the position is not as straightfoward  as we might wish. If the relevant interest group  convinced us of the need to exclude it from the operation  of this provision, it would be possible to achieve that by  an order under clause 63(4)(d). 
<P>
Given the hon. Gentleman's comments, the best way  forward is for us to talk further with the university and  student organisations and those in the voluntary sector,  to see whether they can convince us that they have the  sort of minimum standards that would guard against  incompetence and enable us to consider an exemption  under clause 63(4)(d). I therefore advise the various  organisations to put to us proposals to ensure that some  level of competence is maintained, and we will consider  them. I am happy to meet those organisations to discuss  the issue. 
<P>
I emphasise, however, that we have taken the course  that we have not only because these are difficult issues,  but because the voluntary sector itself expressed its  concern that some honest and decent organisations are  incompetent at giving this sort of advice and can cause  serious problems for individuals who go to them, without  having the unscrupulous motives that we are seeking to  regulate elsewhere. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Those of us who have been  following the Annunciator will have noticed that  Members in the House are now back on to the main  debate, but for some reason that was not indicated. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Perhaps someone should tell the  Whip. 
<P>
The Minister has responded in a practical and  constructive way. He has reminded the Committee that  both the Secretary of State and the commissioner can  provide for exemptions. The Government can propose  that classes be exempt and the commissioner can propose  that a person or body be exempt. What the Minister said  about the possibility of an educational institution being  not competent or proper to offer this sort of advice is  self-evident. There are areas of abuse--for example,  some institutions recruit students and do not expect them  to turn up. The Minister's comments were reassuring,  especially his indication that he is willing to consult  different bodies. I recommend that he considers the  possibility of an indirect endorsement of an application  for exemption. If, for example, the Committee of  Vice-Chancellors and Principals were to be used to some  degree for recognised educational institutions, that might  be a way forward. 
<P>
The way in which the Minister responded to the debate  shows that he understands the realities. The suggestion  that many of what I would call proper charities and  educational institutions may be able to be covered by the  exemptions, either by the Secretary of State's  classification or that of the commissioner, is worthwhile.  I am glad that he has repeated that those who are exempt  are not required to pay fees. In the light of what I have  said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(  ) A certificate under subsection (4)(a) may relate only to a  specified description of immigration advice or immigration  services.".--[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended,  stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I wish to raise a question that I believe is  more appropriate to the clause stand part debate than to  the amendments that have been moved. Will the Minister  clarify why certain categories have been exempted so  that they will be allowed to offer unregulated advice? I  refer to two categories in particular, the first of which is  employees. It is easy to envisage circumstances in which  employees of an exempt employer could operate in a  freelance manner and offer bad and capricious advice.  To what extent are the Government aware of that  problem, and how do they propose to deal with it? 
<P>
The other category relates to Crown exemption, which  I take to be the conventional exemption of civil servants.  It has particular relevance in this context, because Home  Office officials offer advice in the course of their jobs. In  fact, we often encounter that as Members of Parliament.  It can often turn out to be bad advice. Such officials  appear to be able to offer advice and get an exemption.  Will the Minister confirm whether the Government have  thought about the problem? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> As far as employees are  concerned, some people will be exempt or registered as a  member of a body that is self-regulating. The employees  of those people are the responsibility of their employer.  If employers cannot supervise their employees properly,  that comes down to the employer's competence. For  example, solicitors will employ legal executives who are  not the direct subjects of regulation by the relevant  professional organisation--the Law Society or the  Bar--although they have their own Institute of Legal  Executives. The aim would be that regulation would be  done through the Law Society or the Bar. We need to  ensure that it is clear in the Bill that people are covered  although they may be dealt with other than directly by the  commissioner. Employees should be included because  some work for organisations that provide advice but are  not legally qualified. If the organisation is reputable, well  run and properly regulated, it is right that such  employees should carry out their duties and give advice.  We do not wish to deter people who are giving advice to a  reputable standard.   
<P>
Employees of organisations such as the Immigration  Advisory Service and the Refugee Legal Centre should  also be covered by the rules. At the same time, there are  particular ways of dealing with the need to regulate them.  I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 63, as amended, ordered to stand part of the  Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 6 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Registration </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended,  be the Sixth schedule to the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> This may be the appropriate  moment to make a suggestion to the Minister. When  advisers fill in a form that goes to the tribunal, it may be  desirable to require them to assert that they are either  registered or exempt. If advisers are taking part in the  application process, a positive assertion allows them to  be controlled, rather than assuming that they fulfil the  requirement to be registered or exempt. The Minister  may not wish to respond now, but if it is on the record, he  can consider it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am not sure that I have quite  grasped the hon. Gentleman's point. Is he saying that  there should be a way of identifying a person who is  properly regulated? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should not have called the  hon. Gentleman before we had dealt with clause 64. 
<H4><center>Clause 64 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Registration and exemption by the  Commissioner </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Clause 64 provides that the  commissioner must prepare and maintain a register. Will  my hon. Friend the Minister clarify the public status of  that register? In clause 62, the commissioner has the  powers to arrange for the publication of information  about his functions and matters falling within the scope  of his functions. Clause 64 does not say explicitly that  this will be a public register. What matters is not simply  that there is regulation, but that people seeking advice  have a simple mechanism whereby they can check that  the person they are going to for advice is qualified to give  it. I suspect that it will take some time before the clause  really bites, and that some of the con men who operate  now will have disappeared.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> When the Minister responds,  he may want to draw our attention to schedule 6(6). I  think that the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr.  Gerrard) has raised an important point that, in a way,  flows from what I was, perhaps ineloquently, saying in  my mistaken belief that we were discussing schedule 6. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Are  we discussing schedule 6?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are addressing the question that  clause 64 stand part of the Bill, and we should stick to  that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> There are two simple but distinct  points. First, people will have to fill in application forms.  If an application is filled in or endorsed by someone who  is required to be registered or required to be exempt, I  believe that as well as having the register--whether it is  public or not, the Minister will explain--the form should  require people to say positively that they are either  registered or exempted and that they are qualified and  recognised as being qualified by either registration or  exemption, rather than just taking it for granted. That  would be a worthwhile requirement, which could be  made in regulations. 
<P>
My second point is completely separate. Would it be  possible for an appellant to ask to be represented at a  tribunal hearing by a friend who is not registered or  exempt but who may be able to help in clarity of  language and to act almost as a translator or interpreter  and confirm what is going on? Could such a person be a  trade union officer, whether lay or paid, or a member of  the same faith as the person in front of the tribunal? 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am trying to support the Minister's aims in respect of  ensuring that only competent and qualified people give  advice. A different question arises with regard to simply  accompanying someone in a tribunal. I shall cite a  parallel example. A constituent of mine received a major  reduction in her rateable value. The Inland Revenue and  the council then appealed. She went to the tribunal,  where friends were not allowed to speak for her. They  had to keep pushing notes to her suggesting questions  that she should ask the barrister for the other side to  answer. The Minister may not be briefed on the issue, but  there is a distinction between being qualified or exempt  and being with a person at a tribunal. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In answer to the hon. Member for  Walthamstow, I should point out that paragraph 6 of  schedule 6 provides for inspection of the register. He has  now found that provision. 
<P>
Identifying whether someone is registered on a form is  a good idea that might best be dealt with in regulations. I  should like to consider the suggestion. Perhaps  identification could most easily be achieved by a  registration number to be entered on any documents. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked about  being represented by a friend. Part V covers only people  providing services as part of a business, and does not  cover friends who represent an appellant. The  Government will consider the issue, and will perhaps  discuss it with the commissioner when he is appointed  and with universities, voluntary sector organisations and  trade unions, which may also be involved in giving such  advice. Those are some of the detailed matters that will  have to be worked out, but they are good points that will  form the subject of later discussions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I thank the Minister for his response.  I should like to leave a suggestion in the air--I do not ask  him for another immediate response. Either such people     [Mr. Bottomley] 
<P>
are barred by the Bill from representing others at  hearings or they are not. If they are not barred, the  commissioner may need powers to exclude some people.  If they are barred, he may need powers to include them;  the matter may need to be reviewed.

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The Opposition recognise that  one of the amendments allows a body to be removed  from the clause if a request is made to the Secretary of  State. The Bill may have been moving faster than my  mind, but I have not spotted whether the Secretary of  State has power to add a body. If he has not, a regulatory  power should enable him to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I understand that the Secretary of  State is able to add a body and I am sure that the hon.  Gentleman will find the relevant provision in subsection  (5) of the clause. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I should like to address amendment No.  744, which relates to the procedures that are required for  the removal of the designated professional bodies by the  Secretary of State. If one looks down the list, one sees  that it contains a distinguished group of bodies, such as  the Bar Council and the Law Society. It is a little difficult  to envisage the circumstances in which they would be  deemed incompetent in exercising their regulatory  authority, but clearly the situation could arise. There  must always be the suspicion that the circumstances-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman reads clause  134(3)(b), he will find that the issue is already covered.  That might assist him. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> My amendment and the Conservative  amendment would appear to be unnecessary, and I  apologise for not having spotted that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Only one issue follows from the  Minister's comprehensive reply. If he wanted to, could  he regard the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals as a professional body? All the professional  bodies in the clause are legal bodies, but that does not  have to be the case for them to come within the  definitions in clause 61 on interpretation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is not my current intention to do what  the hon. Gentleman suggested, but I will take the matter,  as they say, under advice.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I should like to make one comment, to which the Minister need not  reply. I hope that he will check that the powers in clause 69 are compatible with the royal  charters, which many of the bodies will have. I do not believe that the clause will contradict  them, but it is worth double checking.
