							<b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I want to make a few comments
about the clause. We recognise that it introduces an inflationary
increase to maintain the price of cigarettes and hand-rolled tobacco,
and we support that. However, will the Minister give us an update for
the record on where we are in terms of duty in relation to tax revenue
maximisation, and how the proposed increase relates to that?</div>

the rates of tobacco duty will reduce revenue and increase smuggling,
so that is a central consideration for us as we weigh up these duty
decisions.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Finance Public
Bill Committee, </i>10 May 2007; c.
73.]</div>
					<a name="08051572000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful to have
the Minister&#146;s statement on whether that is still the
Government&#146;s position and whether the aim of this inflationary
increase is to continue to be somewhere close to the tax revenue
maximisation point. In addition, will the Minister give us a brief
update on the Revenue&#146;s understanding of the impact of the
smoking ban on consumption and
duty?</div>
					<a name="08051572000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key point is
that the Government are considering their smuggling strategy, having
had one in 2003-04, but it seems that progress on
bearing down on smuggling has plateaued, although I recognise that
there was some progress. I understand that that is why the Government
are considering the matter again. However, the Tobacco
Manufacturers&#146; Association
said:</div>
					<a name="08051572000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
increase in tobacco tax announced today will do little to reduce the
level of tobacco smuggling and cross border shopping which lost the
Treasury &#163;4.5 billion in revenue last year. The decision helps
to maintain the UK&#146;s position as one of the world&#146;s most
profitable destinations for tobacco smugglers and this is of great
concern to the TMA and its member companies.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>
					<a name="08051572000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can put those
comments in the context of who is making them, but smuggling takes a
hell of a lot of money that would have gone to Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs in duty. The latest estimates show that up
to 18 per cent. of cigarettes and 62 per cent. of hand-rolled tobacco
consumption is smuggled, and that 70 per cent. of all large-scale
cigarette seizures are counterfeit. On top of that, many other
smokers choose to buy their tobacco products from elsewhere in the EU
where taxes and prices are considerably lower. That is another
statistic provided by the Tobacco Manufacturers&#146;
Association.</div>
					<a name="08051572000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Smuggling
is not an issue only for the Treasury, and I am interested in
the Minister&#146;s response because of my broader concerns. Other
people who are hit by smuggling are smaller tobacconists and
shopkeepers, and those who trade in legitimate cigarettes but are often
undercut by those who do not.</div>
					<a name="08051572000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that much of the
smuggling strategy is focused on border control and some of the more
major mainstream franchises or smuggling outfits&#151;the big
business involved in smuggling. The end destination of cigarettes and
hand-rolled tobacco is often small traders, and I want to find out
whether the reworked smuggling strategy will have more focus on
tackling smaller traders who are happy to sell
smuggled products and often undercut competitors and small shopkeepers
who prefer to sell only legitimate cigarettes. Can the Minister give us
some clarity on that?</div>
					<a name="08051572000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to follow up some
parliamentary questions that I tabled a few months ago and perhaps to
get some clarity from the Minister on the issues raised in
them. I tried to find out the level of
resourcing for the smuggling strategy and how many customs officers
there were in HMRC. I assumed that the answer would be quite
straightforward until I got an answer back
saying:</div>
					<a name="08051572000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

					<a name="08051572000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">To help me table
parliamentary questions that will get answers, let me say that I was
talking about the men who are generally at ports and airports and who
tend to be dressed in

							<a name="08051572000218"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> And women. As we go through customs, these
people tend to stop us and occasionally go through our luggage to see
whether we are smuggling cigarettes. My assumption was that they are
called customs officers, but if the Treasury does not agree, I would be
keen to know what they are called so that I can table parliamentary
questions that will get a proper answer. I look forward to hearing what
the Minister has to say.</div>
					<a name="08051572000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051572000219"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Good morning, Sir Nicholas.
Tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of my giving up smoking, so I do not
know whether I need to declare an interest any longer. If I might say
something unfashionable, however, I quite enjoyed smoking and I
sometimes regret that I gave it up in the first place. However, giving
up was no doubt good for my health.</div>
					<a name="08051572000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
brief points. First, will the Minister confirm that the purpose of
tobacco taxation is twofold&#151;to disincentivise people to buy the
product and to raise revenue? Will he also confirm that those two
objectives 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>are not incompatible? The second point has already
been touched on by the hon. Member for Putney. What is the
Government&#146;s assessment of the impact of tobacco taxation on the
smuggling of illegal tobacco products? What impact does that have in
turn on the legitimate retailing of tobacco
products?</div>
					<a name="08051572000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000220"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):
						</b> It is
a pleasure to respond to the debate. It is a pity that the day is dull,
although that was fairly predictable, given that this is the first day
of the test match between England and New Zealand. An awful lot of
disappointed people, myself included, will be looking at the skies this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08051572000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 10
increases the duty rates on all tobacco products in line with
inflation. Together with VAT, the increase is equivalent to 11p on the
price of a typical pack of 20 cigarettes and 4p on a pack of five
cigars. Our decision to raise duty rates, which the Committee does not
oppose, is in line with inflation in the Budget and will maintain the
real price of such products. It will thereby continue to encourage
people to smoke less or to give up, as the hon. Member for Taunton did,
and I congratulate him on his ability to break the habit.</div>
					<a name="08051572000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Duty rates
form an important part of the Government&#146;s strategy to reduce
smoking prevalence to 21 per cent. by 2010, alongside measures such as
NHS stop-smoking services, the ban on smoking in public places, which
came into effect on 1 July 2007, and raising the legal age for
purchasing tobacco from 16 to 18 in October 2007. Budget 2008 retains
the reduced rate of VAT that applies to smoking-cessation products.
That point has not been raised, but the measure should be
acknowledged. When it was originally introduced, it was time limited,
but it will now continue beyond 30 June 2008.</div>
					<a name="08051572000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we set duty rates for
tobacco, the potential impact on smuggling, which has
been on hon. Members&#146; minds this morning, is an important
consideration. As has been acknowledged this morning, the tackling
tobacco smuggling strategy, which was introduced in 2000 and refreshed
in 2006, was very successful in reducing the size of the illicit
markets for cigarettes over the five years to 2005-06 from 21 per cent.
to an estimated midpoint of 13 per cent. Since the start of the
strategy, we have seized nearly 17 billion illicit cigarettes and more
than 1,000 tonnes of hand-rolling tobacco.</div>
					<a name="08051572000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Putney is
right to say that we are looking at hand-rolling tobacco, where there
is clearly an issue that needs to be dealt with. However, to
answer her question about where we are in respect of revenue
maximisation, there is always a balance between excise duties and the
smuggling phenomenon, as Committee members know. As my predecessor said
in the debate on the 2007 Budget, duty rates are close to revenue
maximisation, which is why there has been no greater increase than
revalorisation in the Budget. That means that any large real increase
in the duty rate would increase smuggling and probably increase the
availability of cheap tobacco, which would obviously be a perverse
result. That is what HMRC&#146;s model
demonstrates.</div>
					<a name="08051572000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051572000221"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): As I
am sure the hon. Lady is aware, the issue in respect of smuggling and
counterfeit cigarettes is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>simply about revenue maximisation or otherwise from the
Treasury&#146;s point of view, but about the safety of those
products. Indeed, such products are often considerably less safe. Can
she give some detail on how the success rate has been measured? She
mentioned that smuggling was roundabout the 21 per cent. level four or
five years ago and fell to 13 per cent, following Government
initiatives. On what basis is she confident that those figures are
accurate?</div>
					<a name="08051572000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000222"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> That is the midpoint of a range; that is how HMRC
tried to measure something that is difficult to measure. It is clear,
from the level of seizures, that the percentages of smuggled goods are
down, but it is hard to be deadly accurate about such things, because
one does not know how much illicit product is targeted at us. However,
we can make estimates from the illicit product that we intercept and by
checking what is on sale and what can be picked up in the country.
There are ways of doing
this.</div>
					<a name="08051572000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to make the distinction between smuggling legally made
products&#151;our memorandums of understanding with
the tobacco-producing companies have greatly assisted us in dealing
with that&#151;and the increasing threat of counterfeit product,
which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, which in some cases can have the
most interesting things mixed in with it that would do nothing to
improve one&#146;s
health.</div>
					<a name="08051572000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Putney mentioned her asking further parliamentary questions
about Revenue and Customs officers. We do not have Revenue and Customs
officers at UK borders whose sole purpose is to tackle tobacco
smuggling: they multi-task and do other things as well. Those officers
perform numerous roles in protecting the UK from smuggling of all
types, be it drugs or other illicit substances, people, money or other
things. Such smuggling routes can be used to transfer all sorts of
things and it makes sense to have the border authority taking over this
aspect of the work to multi-task in that
way.</div>
					<a name="08051572000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
differentiate between HMRC officers at ports and
those who are working from elsewhere. However, I am happy to write to
the hon. Lady on the overall figures on officers, if she wants me to,
rather than pursue the matter through parliamentary
questions.</div>
					<a name="08051572000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000223"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> Obviously, one major change in the smuggling
strategy will be that the inland strategy is presumably largely
overseen by HMRC, whereas the border authority deals with smuggling
after items have entered the UK. Will the Minister tell us how the
Government plan to ensure that those two groups work together
effectively, given that I believe they will be in different
Departments? They will need to liaise closely and share
intelligence.</div>
					<a name="08051572000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="08051572000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000224"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> We have already put that in place&#151;in fact,
in the person of the Minister for Borders and Immigration, who now has
a post in the Treasury as well to examine the UK Border Agency. I
assure the hon. Lady that a great deal of organisational work is going
into ensuring that there is proper liaison between the agency, the
Serious Organised Crime Agency and the various other crime squads in
question.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>
					<a name="08051572000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of smuggling as a
phenomenon means that when one deals with it in a particular place, it
morphs into something else. There has been a marked increase in the
smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes, as the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster pointed out. Some 70 per cent. of
large seizures made by HMRC are now counterfeit.</div>
					<a name="08051572000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">To prevent counterfeit products
from penetrating the legitimate retail sector in a bottom-up
way, which would greatly increase smugglers&#146; profit, covert
anti-counterfeit markings were introduced for all cigarette packs from
October 2007. That will be extended to hand-rolling tobacco products

						</b> Separately, please. They have been selected
separately, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to address his remarks to
amendment No.
66.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000227"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I am grateful for your guidance, Sir Nicholas. The
amendments are related, but slightly
different.</div>
					<a name="08051572000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
amendments are concerned with biofuels, but amendment No. 66 is
specifically about off-road rebates. It would remove from the schedule
proposed new section 14B of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, which
would allow mainstream use of duty rebates for biofuels that are used
off-road.</div>
					<a name="08051572000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
tabled the amendment to explore a few matters, the first of which is
what the Government are trying to achieve with the off-road rebate. The
explanatory notes on the schedule state that they are trying
to</div>
					<a name="08051572000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encourage the wider
use of biofuels in off-road
applications&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051572000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister provide the Committee with a projection of the number of
litres of biofuel that will be
involved?</div>
					<a name="08051572000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee knows, there are concerns about the sustainability of biofuel
production. For example, the rebate mechanism in proposed new section
14B is completely indiscriminate, meaning that sustainable
biofuel production will not be differentiated from non-sustainable. If
the explanatory notes are accurate, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>the Government do not appear to be addressing
sustainability. It would be interesting for the
Committee to learn both how that is factored into the
Government&#146;s deliberations and an estimate of the net carbon
dioxide<span class="Sub"> </span>emission savings that the Government envisage being
achieved as a
result.</div>
					<a name="08051572000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also clarify whether the measure is a revenue raiser?
According to the economic and fiscal strategy report, the new rebate
will make money: &#163;5 million in 2009-10 and &#163;10
million in 2010-11. I appreciate that those are not large sums in the
grand scheme of things, but it is confusing to me how the Government
intend to make money from a rebate.</div>
					<a name="08051572000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful if the
Minister clarified whether the proposal also relates
to non-road transport. Committee members will no doubt recall that
Richard Branson&#146;s first biodiesel train, the Thames Voyager, was
converted to run on 80 per cent. petrodiesel, leading to an estimated
40 per cent. saving on direct emissions. As I understand it, the
Government&#146;s proposal requires only that the fuel not be used
for a road vehicle. There is no specific mention of other forms of
transport, such as planes, trains and sea vessels. I should be grateful
if the Minister touched on that issue; that was my purpose in tabling
the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08051572000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051572000228"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I rise to speak on the
mixed signals that the Government are sending about biofuel,
particularly bioethanol. As I understand it, the Government have taken
a decision to end the discount for the use of biofuel on roads, yet the
measure seems to encourage people to use it off roads. The Government
are saying, &#147;Let&#146;s encourage biofuel as long as it
isn&#146;t being used on the roads, but on the roads, we&#146;re
going to restore the duty to the same level as
petrol.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051572000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Huge
carbon savings could be made by using biofuel. The Government have not
quite made up their mind whether biofuel is a good thing, because of
its huge benefit in saving carbon, or whether they are against it,
because of its sustainability and impact on food prices. They are
sending terribly mixed messages, and we need some clarity about what
they are saying. Is biofuel a good thing or a bad thing? Are they
giving in to the petrol lobby, or are they as serious as our European
colleagues in Sweden, who have made a big effort to get vehicles to
switch to
biofuel?</div>
				
					<a name="08051572000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000229"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I rise to reiterate the points that
have been made. There seem to be a couple of
inconsistencies. One is the introduction of the off-road rebate at the
same time that the Government are signalling the removal of the road
rebate, although that will not take place for a couple of years. The
Renewable Energy Association has expressed concern about the unintended
consequences: good biofuels might stay within the renewable transport
fuel obligation, which applies to on-road use, but bad
biofuels&#151;those made in a less sustainable way&#151;might be
used off-road. I do not think that that will achieve the
Minister&#146;s aims.</div>
					<a name="08051572000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall take this opportunity
to ask the Government more broadly what their strategy is with regard
to biofuel. Although it is not covered in this Finance Bill, the
Government have signalled in the Red Book that they plan to remove the
fuel rebate in 2010. That will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>have no small financial impact: it will prevent the Treasury from losing
&#163;550 million in 2010-11, which means that the renewable
transport fuel obligation will become the Government&#146;s key
fiscal lever for increasing the amount of biofuels blended into the
petrol used on roads.</div>
					<a name="08051572000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a
similar debate when the statutory instrument on the renewable transport
fuel obligation went through Committee. The Conservatives are concerned
that the RTFO does not include fully outlined sustainability criteria
at the moment. In fact, my understanding is that the criteria will not
be put in place until 2010-11. Will the Minister explain, therefore,
why the Government are stepping away from the introduction of two
levers with which to encourage biofuels, instead relying on just one,
which many people do not think will be strong enough, soon enough? I am
sure that we will come on to the issues about the buy-out price in the
next amendment, so I shall conclude my remarks for the time
being.</div>
					<a name="08051572000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000230"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I, too, hope that we can alleviate the need for a
stand part debate, and join my hon. Friends the Members for
Putney and for Wellingborough in asking the Minister to go into some
detail about the Government&#146;s broader strategy
on biofuels. I appreciate that, from her perspective, the issue has
received a considerably higher profile in recent months, given the
problems with the sustainability of food growth, particularly in the
developing world.</div>
					<a name="08051572000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some Opposition Members have
always been very sceptical about the idea of biofuels being the grand
answer to the entire problem, and I would be interested to have some
sense of the Government&#146;s thinking. In fairness, I do not expect
them necessarily to have a full plan in place; the situation is very
fluid, given the huge increase in the price of staple food commodities
across the developing world. I appreciate that utilising biofuels for
the purposes of carbon-free fuel is likely to become considerably less
desirable, at least in the short term, but it would interesting to have
some sense of where the Government see this going in the decades to
come.</div>

						<a name="08051572000231"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
criticism of biofuels is fair enough, as long as he is talking about
the first generation, which is very land-hungry. Does he not
acknowledge, however, the strong evidence that second generation
biofuels would not fall into the same category and that they could have
a useful future, so they should be
encouraged?</div>
					<a name="08051572000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000232"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman knows considerably
more about that than I do, and I shall expose my ignorance if I go too
far down this path. As he rightly pointed out, however, the first
generation of biofuels are very land dependent and have had some
perverse effects that were not foreseen at the outset&#151;they were
regarded as the great new idea that would solve many of the problems
resulting from the desire and need for oil and fuel while fulfilling
the equally strong desire to keep carbon emissions to an absolute
minimum. I hope that the Minister will give us some idea of the
Government&#146;s thinking. Few Opposition Members expect grand
answers; we appreciate that it is quite a fluid and volatile situation,
and will remain so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>in the future, but it would be useful to have at least some sense of the
pathway that the Government have in
mind.</div>
					<a name="08051572000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000233"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> I am pleased to say that the hon. Member for Cities
of London and Westminster and my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford are
both right. If their goals could be achieved, second generation
biofuels would certainly be far more sustainable than the first
generation. They are not so land hungry and do not have the
disadvantages of carbon emissions resulting from the production of the
original fuel, whether corn, palm oil, wheat or whatever else people
decide to make fuel out of.</div>
					<a name="08051572000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cities of
London and Westminster is spot on in saying that the situation with
biofuels is very fluid&#151;forgive the pun. We are trying to develop
policies to incorporate the use of biofuels, which will cut carbon
emissions if they are the right biofuels produced in the right way. The
most obvious example is the fact that clearing a rainforest to produce
corn to make biofuels does not necessarily assist the fight against
climate change or reduce the planet&#146;s carbon emissions. My
understanding is that sugar beet is a far more viable biofuel and is
probably already produced
sustainably.</div>

							<a name="08051572000234"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I thought this would be an
appropriate time to bring in the subject of &#147;splash and
dash&#148;, of which I am sure the Minister is fully aware. The term
relates to shipping the core bio components that go into biofuel over
to the United States and adding them in. The biofuel is then shipped
back to the UK. That is done, because production subsidies mean that
production in the States is so much cheaper. What is the
Government&#146;s position on that?</div>
					<a name="08051572000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000235"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> We are dealing with much of that issue via the
European Union and the World Trade Organisation. Of course, I have also
been in touch with the biofuel industry in this country. We are well
aware of the issues. Unfortunately, the WTO is sometimes frustratingly
slow, but I assure the hon. Lady that the Government are well apprised
of the issues, as is the EU Commission. She should not worry about the
matter.</div>
					<a name="08051572000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 5 is
attached to, and introduced by, clause 12. Schedule 5 establishes a new
rebated rate for biodiesel and bioblend that is used other than as a
road fuel. It allows the commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs to determine the composition of a substance for
certain prescribed purposes. If accepted, the amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Taunton would prevent the introduction of a rebate on
bioblend used other than as a fuel for road vehicles. It would not
alter any of the other provisions in the Bill that relate to rebated
bioblends. As such, I hope that it is a probing
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08051572000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Budget
2007, the Government announced that they would encourage the use of
biofuels in off-road applications, such as the railways&#151;the hon.
Gentleman finally mentioned that when he talked about Virgin
trains&#151;by permanently reducing the duty rate
for those mixtures. That announcement followed the successful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>completion of a pilot trial undertaken by a rail company which, hon.
Members can probably guess, was Virgin. The rail pilot scheme was
successful, but it is not expected that there will be scope for the use
of biofuel in aeroplanes. There has been a well-publicised one-off
short-term experiment with the same company, but we do not expect it to
be used at this time.</div>
					<a name="08051572000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000236"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b> I thought Richard Branson said that all his future
profits would go into the development of biofuels for bioplanes to help
to massively reduce the carbon footprints of aircraft. That is
completely at odds with what the Minister has just
said.</div>
					<a name="08051572000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000237"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> One of the things for which I am extremely grateful
is the fact that I am not responsible for Sir Richard Branson&#146;s
pronouncements. I do not believe that I have to explain them to the
Committee, so the hon. Gentleman will have to ask Sir Richard Branson
what he
meant.</div>
					<a name="08051572000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000238"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> The Minister said that she does not believe that
aviation will go down the biofuel route. I understand that, but I
wondered whether there was a particular reason why she had reached that
conclusion, and if she could share it with the Committee. Is it based
on an assessment of which models of current fleet can be adapted, or is
it to do with economics? Can she outline her reasons in more
detail?</div>
					<a name="08051572000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000239"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> The comment that I made is about the short term. It
may well be that in the medium to long term, the redesign of aviation
engines can become as innovative as the redesign of car engines.
Certainly, for the purposes of this rebate in the short term, we are
expecting it to be of much greater use on trains than on other forms of
transport. Marine transport is another issue. We have an aging world
fleet as far as marine goes, and to be able to adapt to the use of
biofuels, the mechanics of ships would need to be re-engineered. I hope
in the fullness of time that that will begin to happen with other forms
of transport, as it has done with cars&#151;we all look forward to
that&#151;but it will not happen in the short term without
re-engineering. We do not expect that the positive introduction of
clause 12 and schedule 5 will drive that, although we hope to ensure
that the carbon footprint of many trains can be reduced. Successful
pilot projects running biofuel mixes have already taken place, and have
demonstrated that with the existing engines it is possible for trains
to reduce their carbon footprint considerably. In essence, that is what
schedule 5 seeks to
do.</div>
					<a name="08051572000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
believe that biofuel policy should support only sustainable biofuels,
which is why the Secretary of State for Transport announced that
Professor Ed Gallagher would lead a study on the wider environmental
and economic impacts of biofuels, including their impact on food
prices. The review will publish its report in June. Members who have
read the King report will remember that Professor King spent a great
deal of time on the way in which we define the life-cycle costs of
fuels, in particular biofuels. Understandably, that is an emerging
focus, and we have yet to develop the right methodologies to ensure
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>we can assess whether biofuels are sustainable.
Clearly, that work has to go on in parallel with the development of
potential biofuels, particularly second-generation
ones.</div>
					<a name="08051572000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can be
absolutely certain that if we do a great deal of re-engineering of
engines and infrastructure to accept biofuel mixes we will be doing
good rather than bad, and that work is proceeding. Previously, a
mixture of biodiesel and rebated heavy oil was liable to duty at the
punitive heavy oil rate. As announced last year, we are amending the
duty regime so that such mixtures become subject to duty at 9.69p per
litre. That is the same as the rate for red diesel,
which is the fuel commonly used in off-road applications. That is the
point of the schedule. I hope that, given those explanations, the hon.
Member for Taunton will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;27
In Article 21 of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;(12) The
Administrator shall undertake an annual review of the effectiveness of
the buy-out price level under sub-paragraph (7), including in
particular its impact on the level of incentive provided to suppliers
to invest in biofuels.</div>

Within two months of completing any review under paragraph (12), the
Administrator shall submit a report of its findings to the Secretary of

reasonably practicable after the Secretary of State has received a
report on a review under paragraph (12) the Secretary of State shall
lay a copy of the report before the House of
Commons.&#148;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08051572000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with an issue related to that raised by amendment No.
66. It, too, refers to schedule 5, but it deals with the on-road use of
biofuels. Because the wording of the amendment is fairly complicated,
it may be helpful to take the Committee through its intention. Article
21 of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 allows fuel
suppliers to pay a buy-out price to discharge their obligation to
replace a certain percentage of their annual fossil fuel sales with
biofuel. The so-called renewable transport fuel obligation, which has
been in force since April, will be run by the newly formed Renewable
Fuels Agency. At present, biofuels receive two forms of support: a 20p
per litre rebate and a 15p per litre buy-out price. If a supplier has a
litre of biofuel, he will get 20p off the duty rate, and avoid paying a
another 15p for not hitting the biofuel target. That creates a total
saving of 35p for the
supplier.</div>
					<a name="08051572000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, however, announced in the Budget that
from 2010-11, the rebate would be scrapped and replaced with a buy-out
price of 30p a litre. Consequently, my amendment would insert three new
paragraphs into the order. Proposed new paragraph (12) would require
the administrator of the buy-out mechanism to undertake an annual
review of the buy-out level, and its effect on incentivising biofuel
investment. New paragraphs (13) and (14) would require the review to be
presented to and approved by the
House.</div>
					<a name="08051572000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing amendment. Its purpose is to ascertain the Government&#146;s
motivation in respect of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>biofuels. How were the figures arrived at, and how will they be kept
under review? Has the Treasury taken account of present and future
rises in oil prices and agricultural commodities? Is 30p enough to
incentivise a sustainable UK biofuel production industry? That area was
touched on in the previous debate. How viable is biofuel production in
terms of our total energy requirements? How sustainable is biofuel
production, and how is its environmental value measured? Given the
EU&#146;s renewable energy directive, which means that 10 per cent.
of transport-related energy must be renewable by 2020, I want to
establish whether or not biofuel production is likely to make a
significant contribution to that target.</div>
					<a name="08051572000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
scrapping the 20p per litre rebate and replacing it with a higher
buy-out price is estimated, as I understand it, to net the Treasury a
saving of &#163;500 million a year. I suspect that this
particular schedule and these amendments do not feature
prominently on a list of the highlights of the Finance Bill Committee
for most Members. However, by my estimate, the proposals in this
schedule are the third-highest revenue raiser from the Budget after the
changes to vehicle excuse duty and the revenue raised from increased
alcohol duties. It is therefore worth the Committee examining these
proposals in detail, first to see whether they will achieve the
environmental objectives to which the Government aspire and claim that
they will achieve, but also because, as I understand it, they are a
significant method for raising additional revenue for the
Treasury.</div>

							<a name="08051572000242"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b> I should declare an interest at the start, as I
drive a biofuel car. The Minister said earlier that it will take some
time to get engines to adjust to the new biofuel, but the technology is
here already; it is a very simple mechanism and a car can run on
biofuel or petrol.</div>

clear.</div>
					<a name="08051572000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
something that has not emerged in the discussion so far. We have been
talking about the rebate and the fact that the rebate for biofuels will
be raised in due course to a level such that petrol duty and biofuel
duty will be the same. At the moment, a litre of biofuel is roughly 2p
cheaper than a litre of unleaded petrol. Unfortunately, it is 50 per
cent. more inefficient, so when someone drives a biofuel car, they are
paying substantially more to drive it than to drive a petrol car.
</div>
					<a name="08051572000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same time, the
Government are providing grants for forecourts to convert to biofuel
stations. There are only 17 or 19 biofuel stations in the country, so
we are talking about first-generation technology. We have already heard
the remarks by the hon. Member for Bedford and he is absolutely right
that second-generation biofuels will be much better. It is rather like
video recorders; if the first video recorders were what we were going
to end up with, we would never have had a video recorder at
all.</div>
					<a name="08051572000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my opinion,
the Government have got to make up their mind whether or not they want
to go down the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>biofuel route. The amendment clearly raises that issue again. I do not
want a detailed explanation; I just want to know whether or not the
Government want to encourage biofuel.</div>

Greening:
						</b> I rise to echo some comments I made in my first
contribution, and also to echo some of what has been said by other hon.
Members. We need to be very careful about what we are doing with the
buy-out price. There is no doubt that the interaction between the
buy-out price and the fuel rebate is absolutely critical to unlocking
this market to its full potential.</div>
					<a name="08051572000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">As things stand, in 2008-09 we
will have a 20p per litre rebate on biofuel, combined with a 15p per
litre buy-out price if we do not meet the renewable transport fuel
objectives. Effectively that means that if it costs companies less than
35p to produce a litre of biofuel, it will be economical to supply the
biofuel, but if it costs more, it is cheaper for them to buy out of the
obligation. When we reach 2010, however, the buy-out price will
increase to 30p per litre, but the biofuels duty rebate will end. That
means that companies need to produce biofuel for 30p per litre or less
for it to be more profitable than buying out. Furthermore, without the
rebate, all the cost will fall on the consumer. There is a real
danger that if companies buy out of their obligation on biofuels,
customers will pay for the policy, but we will not actually see the
carbon savings. That would be a real double whammy, not only for the
consumer, but for the environment.</div>

					<a name="08051572000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">How, therefore,
does the Treasury go about setting the buy-out price? How does it
arrive at a price of 30p per litre? To echo the comments of my hon.
Friend the Member for Wellingborough, how does the Minister see this
market developing? Are the Government doing enough to ensure that we
unlock the demand, which I am sure is there, for biofuels and biofuel
cars? At the moment, we are not really doing
that.</div>

Eagle:
						</b> It is good to have such simple questions to deal
with on a Thursday morning. Part of the issue in the re-engineering of
economies to reduce our carbon footprint is that there is no utter
certainty about the most sensible and carbon-efficient way through the
process&#151;as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster
said, this is a fluid situation. We are attempting to
put in place analytical approaches to allow us to establish what a good
or a bad biofuel is, and Professor Gallagher will do some of the work
on that and on the effects on fuel prices.</div>
					<a name="08051572000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Wellingborough was right to say&#151;as Professor King did in her
extremely good report&#151;that biofuels are less efficient in terms
of the power that they give to the car, so it would need more litres to
do the same number of miles. That is yet another complication that we
must take into account when we analyse whether to incorporate biofuels
into our fuel and what the effect will be. Clearly, the way in which
the biofuel originated also has an impact on whether it is a positive
or negative thing.</div>
					<a name="08051572000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
therefore many different variables&#151;all potentially moving in
different directions, but the analytical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>structure is only just coming into place. That is
the background against which all advanced economies have to see what
they can do to incorporate biofuels in the most environmentally
sustainable way, without that leading to perverse results such as
increased carbon emissions, and without putting food prices up to such
an extent that there are food riots in different parts of the
world.</div>
					<a name="08051572000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">If biofuels are
produced&#151;I used an extreme example earlier&#151;by knocking a
rain forest down, they will definitely not reduce our carbon footprint.
Other sources of biofuels are almost certainly sustainable, and I
mentioned sugar beet. People in academia are doing the work so that we
can identify where different biofuels come in that regard, and we must
try to develop policies in the light of developing knowledge and
analytical capabilities. The road transport fuel obligation is a better
way of taking account of different biofuels than a simple duty, which
does not allow us to distinguish between different biofuels and the way
in which they are produced.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000247"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I fully understand what the
Minister is saying, but the critical issue is the relationship between
the buy-out price and the cost to manufacturers of producing a litre of
biofuel. The Treasury must surely be talking with the industry, and it
must have made some assessment of how much it costs a manufacturer to
supply a litre of biofuel. That is the key question. If the buy-out
price is set above the cost of production, it will create one
incentive, but if it is set below it, it will create an entirely
different incentive. The modelling has as much to do with the future
costs to manufacturers of supplying biofuels as with anything else.
What is the Treasury doing to understand what those costs will
be?</div>
					<a name="08051572000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000248"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> We do a great deal of work to understand what they
will be, and to make the road transport fuel obligation buy-out price
bite at the appropriate place, but again, prices move up and down all
the time. The costs of alternatives to biofuel, as we
can see from the price of oil, move up and
down&#151;mainly up, if we are talking about oil. The Treasury is
keeping the price of the buy-out under review as evidence emerges of
the environmental and economic impacts of biofuels. We will consider it
with respect to the Gallagher report and make decisions on whether the
buy-out price is too low or too high as we go
on.</div>
					<a name="08051572000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are no easy
answers to those questions. I can only reassure the hon. Lady that the
buy-out price is meant to provide an appropriate incentive. The
Treasury is not particularly interested in having a completely
ineffective system. Nor, I suspect, is the Department for Transport,
which is responsible for the road transport fuel obligation, so work is
under way to set an effective buy-out price. If evidence emerges that
it has been set wrongly, I am sure that the Renewable Fuels Agency will
have some words to say about it. The Government will certainly
be open to emerging evidence of that kind. I am not sure what else I
can say, but I will give way to the hon. Lady if she wants to ask
another
question.</div>

							<a name="08051572000249"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s response. As this is an opportunity to discuss the
issue in the context of the Finance Bill, I have a further question. It

<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>looks as if the tipping point will be reduced in two years&#146; time
from 35p, which includes the rebate and the buy-out price, to 30p when
the rebate is gone and the buy-out price has risen. That suggests that
the Treasury suspects that the cost of producing biofuel will gradually
decrease over time, and that the buy-out price therefore will not need
to be as high, but that is set against a backdrop of rising food
prices. There might be a different world view about the price inflation
of many foodstuffs used to produce biofuels than when the Treasury
first worked out the buy-out price. I wanted to put that on record.
Does the Minister accept that it suggests that the proposed 30p buy-out
price for 2010-11 will need to be carefully
considered?</div>
					<a name="08051572000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000250"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> I have said that we are keeping it under constant
review as all those changes happen. The road transport fuel
obligation provides much more scope for reflecting
sustainability than a duty differential between different biofuels, and
without the risk of fraud. That has an impact on the sustainability
argument, which is why we want to shift the weight of delivering the
policy to the road transport fuel obligation rather than having the
duty differential.</div>
					<a name="08051572000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
RTFO&#146;s effectiveness will be monitored, as the
hon. Member for Taunton rightly said, by the
Renewable Fuels Agency, which administers the scheme. The agency will
be responsible for providing regular reports to Ministers and
Parliament on its implementation. Under the Renewable Transport Fuel
Obligations Order 2007, the Renewable Fuels Agency is duty-bound to
publish an annual report including details of the extent to which the
obligation has been met by buy-out payments. The Government will take
the reports into account when deciding on matters such as the future
level of the buy-out price. Any change to the buy-out price will
require a new road transport fuel obligation order, which will be
subject to consultation and debates in both Houses of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08051572000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is trying to put into the Finance Bill something that already
exists in the order that set up the road transport fuel obligation. The
arrangements will come back before Parliament in a report, not from Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury, but by the agency. I would ask him not to
press the amendment to a Division, because the arrangements that it
would put in place already exist, albeit not in a

							<a name="08051572000253"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> Before I speak on new clause 4, it is worth noting
the context within which the debate is taking place. When I proposed a
similar measure on 6 July 2005, I said that, according to the AA, the
price of unleaded petrol had risen to 86p a litre, up 6p in the
previous six months. Fuel is now priced at anything from &#163;1.10
to in excess of &#163;1.30 a litre.</div>
					<a name="08051572000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said then that Brent crude
had touched $60 a barrel, up from an average price across the piece of
$50. In the run-up to the recent Budget, the price was an average of
$83.60 a barrel, an increase from the $68 forecast in the pre-Budget
report. In the quarter before this year&#146;s Budget, the price of a
barrel averaged $94. In four of the five working days up to the Budget,
we saw record closing prices for North sea oil, and the Red Book
forecast &#163;56 billion of revenue in the next six years, which was
up from the previous six-year forecast of &#163;38 billion. Oil has
gone from $60 a barrel in 2005 to an annual average, up to the Budget,
of $83.60 via a last-quarter score of $94 a barrel. I checked the spot
price a couple of days ago: it was $123.97&#151;nearly $124 a barrel.
It is in the context of massively rising oil prices and high price
spikes for fuel at the pumps that I am proposing the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08051572000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact on
people is also worth noting. When we debated that similar
proposal in 2006, the AA estimated that the monthly increase in the
cost of fuel for a two-car household had risen by
&#163;13.18&#151;a 6p rise on the litre. By April this year, the
corresponding rise for a two-car household was &#163;32.97 a
month&#151;nearly &#163;33. The measure has been proposed in the
knowledge that the Treasury, not content with the normal indexed rises,
has proposed in the Budget an additional, above-indexation escalator
from 2010.</div>
					<a name="08051572000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would do three things: it would oblige the Chancellor to publish
a forecast yield figure at every Budget and pre-Budget for fuel duty
and associated VAT for a range of prices up to 50 per cent. above his
anticipated yield, and to develop a mechanism by which to use the
windfall on VAT gain to offset the duty; and allow the regulator to be
removed when the price drops back to the baseline, or when the new
yield forecast is made in subsequent Budget and pre-Budget statements.
The latter proposal is important because I have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>criticised in previous debates that the proposal was for a one-way
escalator and that it would not afford the opportunity to return. The
proposal makes it clear that the new yield forecast can be set to take
in qualitative rises in prices and not simply
spikes.</div>
					<a name="08051572000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="08051572000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
is partly probing, but it may come back in another form at a later
stage in the proceedings. I want to hear what the Government and the
Opposition think of the three elements of proposed new subsection (1AB)
to the Hydrocarbon Oils Duties Act 1979; namely, that an offset might
be introduced universally, that one might be introduced to assist
remote rural areas and, in particular, that one might be directed
towards the haulage industry, which is of massive concern to me. That
is probably why the Road Haulage Association is
backing the new clause and calling on MPs from all parties to set aside
political considerations and support that or a similar
measure.</div>
					<a name="08051572000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will all
have had representations from our constituents and from hauliers. We
know, certainly in Scotland, that the cost of all goods is driven up as
the cost of haulage increases. I know from my part of the country that
the competitiveness of Scottish business has been reduced because of
increased transportation costs. Even well known companies, such as
Ramage, are going into administration, citing, among
other things, the cost of fuel as a key factor. When a company such as
that, which in parts of the country was as well known as Eddie
Stobart&#151;people would look out for those wagons&#151;goes into
administration citing fuel costs as a factor in that decision,
something is seriously
wrong.</div>
					<a name="08051572000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to take up too much more time, but it is important that the Government
understand that this is not all someone else&#146;s problem. Of the
average &#163;37,000 that it costs each year to provide fuel for a
44-tonne truck, the Government already take
&#163;25,000&#151;of course, they take more when the price at the
pump rises. Therefore, the Government cannot abdicate responsibility
for some of the problems. They will be happy to force a typical
20-vehicle company to generate &#163;30,000 a year more to pay for a
2p rise in duty. They are happy to take the VAT windfall when the price
at the pump rises and they are happy to take the &#163;56 billion
that it has been forecast will come from higher oil prices over the
next six
years.</div>
					<a name="08051572000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fundamentally,
the new clause says that it is time for the Government to put something
back when prices not only bite a little but tip companies over the
edge, put too much pressure on remote rural areas and force ordinary
families to find hundreds of pounds extra a year simply to do the
basics. I cannot put it any better than Geoff
Dossetter, the Freight Transport Association&#146;s director of
external affairs. He was quoted in the <i class="I">Sunday Herald </i>on 13 April
as
saying:</div>
					<a name="08051572000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It&#146;s
barking mad. We&#146;ve already got the highest diesel taxes in
Europe.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051572000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that, I will conclude. I want to hear not only what the Government have
to say but what the other parties have to say, particularly on the
possibility of the fuel tax regulator concept being introduced to offer
at least some assistance to the road haulage
industry.</div>
					<a name="08051572000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051572000254"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I have a couple of
questions. First, although the hon. Member for Dundee, East has allowed
for the possibility of fuel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>prices falling back to a level originally envisaged,
he will be aware that current fuel prices are driven partly by the
limited supplies of fossil fuels in the world but also by considerable
political instability in countries such as Venezuela, Iraq, Iran and,
potentially, Russia, and it is at least possible, and some serious
analysts are suggesting, that there will be a substantial fall in fuel
prices at some point. We may think that unlikely, but the new clause
does not allow for any reaction at that point. It is still a ratchet:
if prices go up, the Government are forced in effect to reduce the
duty, but if prices go down, the beneficiaries simply pocket the
proceeds.</div>
					<a name="08051572000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that
extent, the measure seems slightly populist, because if there is a
sustained rise in fuel prices, the terms of trade will have moved
against Britain and there will be a collective problem for us all. If
we attempt to protect only the people immediately affected&#151;for
instance, the road haulage industry&#151;we are redistributing the
impact of the oil price rise on to everyone else. In particular, I do
not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal to protect rural
areas will work. If garages in certain postcodes were subject to lower
duty, there would be substantial fuel smuggling, as we see across the
border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is not
possible, within one country or in a remotely open economy, to have
selective duty in different
areas.</div>
					<a name="08051572000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, let us
consider the environmental impact of fuel duty. Many of my
constituents, like those of the hon. Member for Dundee, East, are
worried about the impact of rising fuel prices, but if our reaction to
a real world problem with the supply of fossil fuels is always
effectively to subsidise prices, in the long run we are avoiding
dealing with climate change and the decline in fossil fuels. There is a
tendency for all parties to talk the talk on these issues without
walking the walk. We need to consider the impact of the crucial
decision that is to be made on how world affairs affect the
environment in Britain and accept that, sometimes, a change in
behaviour is needed on the part of our consumers and our
Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000255"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I shall answer some of those points at the
end. However, on the latter point, I have no problem at all with
managed price rises to tackle climate change. I have said that before.
It is not the managed increases to tackle a particular problem that are
of concern, but price spiking, which is so serious and damaging, must
be addressed, as must the excessive increases that happen
quickly.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000256"></a>Dr.
Palmer:
						</b> I accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. However, if he refined his new clause to take
account of circumstances in the unlikely event of a price dip, we would
have a serious, rounded proposal to
consider.</div>
					<a name="08051572000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause skirts around how we are going to tackle dwindling fossil fuels;
it says, basically, that if there is a problem with
rising world prices the Exchequer will help. In the long run, that will
not be sufficient. Perhaps the Conservative spokesperson will confirm
that the Conservatives are considering reintroducing the fuel price
escalator. If that is done, the issue will arise even more acutely. I
do not necessarily disagree with that, but it is controversial and
needs serious discussion.</div>

							<a name="08051572000257"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I am conscious of what has already been said, so
I will keep my comments brief. Obviously, we support the belated
decision by the Chancellor to delay the 2p rise in fuel duty. We
understand, from interested stakeholders, including the AA, that rising
petrol and diesel prices have increased the total cost of running a
small family car from 55p a mile to 58p a mile. As the hon. Member for
Dundee, East said, that has an impact not just on families, but on
people who use petrol to carry out their day-to-day business, including
road hauliers.</div>
					<a name="08051572000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the Chancellor&#146;s drawing back from including his 2p duty
rise in the Budget in April and his proposal to delay it until October.
However, it was delayed not because of anything to do with road
hauliers or families who cannot afford to pay more fuel duty, but
mainly for self-interested political
reasons.</div>
					<a name="08051572000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
we welcome the deferral in itself and that is why we will support the
clause. I understand that the hon. Gentleman has introduced a new
clause to look at how we can perhaps have a more sensitive rate of tax
on fuel, one that takes into account the ups and downs of oil prices,
and that is something that we should
consider.</div>

							<a name="08051572000259"></a>Justine
Greening:
						</b> I think that I had only said about 15 words
before the Minister jumped up to intervene on me.</div>
					<a name="08051572000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not saying that,
actually. The point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East was that
there is clearly an issue that the Government themselves have
recognised, which is why they have had to delay the fuel duty rise.
Fuel, by necessity, fluctuates in price in line with the oil price.
That can mean that, at the same time as fuel prices are rising and fuel
duty is rising, VAT on fuel is also rising. Therefore, there is clearly
a double impact of the Treasury when fuel and oil prices go
up.</div>
					<a name="08051572000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am just
recognising that the hon. Member for Dundee, East pointed out the
impact of all these price rises and he was making a suggestion to deal
with them. I must say that it is not one that I agree with. None the
less, he was making a suggestion that we should look carefully to see
if there are ways to handle this situation more effectively than the
way we have at the moment, whereby the Government have proposed a 2p
rise in fuel duty and then, at the last moment, they have had to say
that they want to delay its introduction. I do not think that that is
good for families, but it is certainly not good for
businesses.</div>

need to be kept under review. The difficulty is that we have
dramatically escalating oil prices; as has been said, just six months
ago they were at a much lower level. In fact, the range of estimates
that experts have for what the price of a barrel of oil may be in the
next six months is, I understand, between &#163;80 and &#163;150,
even up to &#163;160.</div>

							<b class="B">Clive
Efford</b> (Eltham) (Lab): In talking about the fuel duty
escalator and rising petrol prices, the principle that the hon. Lady is
discussing is that the increase in price is desirable because it alters
behaviour and reduces the use of fossil fuels, and therefore it has a
positive impact on the environment. That is the green taxes that her
party has talked about.</div>
					<a name="08051572000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now we are getting to the
nitty-gritty of the debate, because this is where we have to take
decisions about whether to support policies that will change behaviour.
Is it the basic approach of the Conservatives that the cost of petrol
has to go up to change behaviour, whether that rise is as a result of
the market or the use of the fuel duty escalator? Is that the
Conservative
position?</div>

Greening:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is asking a question that is
not really appropriate, in the sense that he is asking if the cost of
petrol has to go up to change behaviour. Well, we have just had a
debate on biofuels, which is totally unrelated to the cost of petrol
but is related to changing
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="08051572000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say
that, if the hon. Gentleman and his party want to have a good debate
about environmental taxes, one that the public can participate in,
perhaps they can follow the polls that we have had recently and call an
election, to give people the chance to elect their Prime Minister and
have a choice on that
matter.</div>

<i class="I">[</i>

						<i class="I">]</i> Well, we are discussing a
clause that introduces a complete change of Government policy, so I do
not think that Opposition Members need to take any lectures about who
is dominating the debate. In fact, the clause backtracks on the rise in
fuel duty. What I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>saying&#151;and the Government should welcome this&#151;is that my

							<a name="08051572000271"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I shall not speak at great length, but as the
Conservative and Labour parties have agreed that
their policies have morphed into one, it seems
reasonable that the Committee should hear an alternative view. In fact,
if anyone is seeking an explanation as to why Labour has the worst poll
ratings in living memory, it may be because it is adopting too many
Conservative policies. That is clearly a way to go down the tubes very
quickly. It is not entirely relevant to the matter before us, but only
one party gained seats in each of the past three general elections, and
I had the good fortune to be a spokesman for that
party.</div>
					<a name="08051572000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000272"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. We are debating a clause in the Finance
Bill. We are not on the hustings in Crewe and Nantwich. Please direct
your remarks to the clause, Mr.
Browne.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000273"></a>Mr.

						</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I am sure that it is a
relief to everyone that we have an excuse&#151;being in this
Committee&#151;for not being on the hustings for the Crewe
by-election.</div>
					<a name="08051572000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am keen
to speak specifically on the subject, because the claims made for
postponing the 2p per litre duty are exaggerated. If somebody has a
50-litre car, for example, the saving from the postponement would be
&#163;1 every time they filled up. The saving to a motorist who
drives enough to fill up such a car a couple of times a month would be
&#163;12, so we should not make too many extravagant claims about the
financial benefits to consumers of delaying the
rise.</div>
					<a name="08051572000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, however, a wider point. When such proposals are postponed,
politicians are quick, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe said, to talk
the talk, but they are rather less quick to walk the walk. I direct
these comments to all parties but particularly to the Conservative
party: the party leader having photo opportunities with Zac Goldsmith
or other people of that sort is not a substitute for proper policy. My
concern is that we cannot have a serious conversation, and certainly
not a general election, until the Conservative party makes some serious
proposals on road haulage, duty on petrol, and environmental policy,
full
stop.</div>

political one rather than one on a Government Finance Bill. Opposition
policy may be peripheral to discussion of the clause, but we are not
debating it. It is the clause in this Government Bill to which we
should direct our attention. I believe that Mr. Bone is

Bone:
						</b> The hon. Member for Taunton misses the point. When a
Government prepare their Budget, they plan what they expect to receive
in VAT on the current or predicted future prices of oil. If those oil
prices go up enormously, there is a big windfall gain for the
Government. That is what this refers to. It is not part of the plan of
environmental taxes; it is a windfall gain and the clause seeks to deal
with that. What do the Liberal Democrats believe should happen when the
Government get a huge windfall from an increase in oil
prices?</div>

							<a name="08051572000277"></a>Mr.

that there is a lack of public

Nicholas, in trying to do your job and manage our
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08051572000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
first deal with the intervention by the hon. Member for Wellingborough.
One of the main reasons why there is public concern
about environmental taxation is that there is a
suspicion&#151;justified, in my view&#151;that the primary
motivation is raising revenue, rather than trying to benefit the
environment. I am keen that environmental taxes should be offset by
reductions in taxation elsewhere. That means people will be
disincentivised to use their cars, for example, but I hope that as a
result they will be incentivised to do other things, including working
harder.</div>
					<a name="08051572000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000280"></a>Mr.
Todd:
						</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman might find helpful a
little thought on the interaction between VAT and the price of fuel
because he has been challenged on that point. Consumers have a finite
amount of money to spend. If VAT has been increased sharply through an
increase in the price of fuel, logic therefore says that they will
spend less on other items in household expenditure that would otherwise
attract VAT to the Government. The net effect may well be
neutral.</div>
					<a name="08051572000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051572000281"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption</i>
						<i class="I">.]</i> Well, he was not making a
political point; he was making a consumer point. That would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>obviously depend on consumer patterns. The point has extra validity,
because VAT has gone up so much in my adult lifetime. However, that is
another matter, which is not directly related to our
conversation.</div>
					<a name="08051572000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
finish by making this observation which is specifically and directly
relevant. People are naturally concerned about petrol taxes: people who
need their cars for work have a professional concern, and most leisure
motorists would rather pay less than more. Very few people come up to
politicians and say, &#147;Please can I pay more for a service,
please will you raise the taxes?&#148; However, some people come to
politicians and express an interest in our offering leadership.

to our deliberations. There will be a short-term benefit for
politicians who try to follow public opinion but who are derelict in
the leadership that they offer on environmental issues. There ought to
be a reward for those who take a responsible attitude, and if we want a
planet which is as enjoyable for future generations as it is for us
today, we cannot continue backing off every time we see an adverse
