<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000499"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I thought, this morning,
that I might have to play a nightwatchman&#146;s innings in the short
period between the vote and 10.25 am. Instead, it is great to have the
opportunity to open the batting after the luncheon interval, and for
you to have kept one end blocked before I got to the wicket.</div>
<a name="0806136000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
196 is quite a simple amendment that carries on from this
morning&#146;s deliberations on schedule 41, paragraph 17 of which
allows for appeal against a decision by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs. The amendment would mean that an appeal would not be
against a decision but against a notice from HMRC that the relevant
person was liable to a penalty. It therefore addresses the same point
that I raised in amendment No. 181 to schedule 36&#151;that time
should start ticking when the recipient receives the notice rather than
when it is issued and sent, because there might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column676" />Column number: 676</div>some delay between its being sent and the recipient receiving it, and
they might be disadvantaged as a consequence. The Financial Secretary
was unwilling to concede that point earlier, and I suspect that she
will take the same view now, but we felt that it would be helpful to
table a probing amendment to give her the opportunity to consider this
concern.</div><a name="0806136000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806136000500"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): May I
welcome you back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas, to perform your role as
umpire&#151;to continue the cricketing analogy? The last time I heard
as tortuous a cricketing metaphor in Parliament was in Geoffrey
Howe&#146;s speech in 1990, shortly after which the Prime Minister
fell, although I do not know whether we should read too much into that.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Yes, let us not dwell on that any
longer.</div><a name="0806136000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have tabled the amendments as a consequence of representations received
from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which made the point that
taxpayers should have a right of appeal against any penalty notice
issued under paragraph 16 of the schedule, rather than against any
decision of HMRC to issue a penalty notice. The institute is supportive
of the approach taken in amendment No. 196, but we have made two small
amendments, so that rather than appeals against decisions of HMRC,
there are notices. There should be a right for taxpayers to appeal in
those circumstances.</div>
<a name="0806136000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000501"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> The
Bill states that the appeal is against a decision made by HMRC. That is
consistent both with how appeal provisions are worded in last
year&#146;s Finance Act for the new penalties for incorrect returns
and with the effect of other appeal provisions in tax legislation. The
three amendments would change that to an appeal against notice of the
penalty rather against the decision itself. I know concern has been
expressed that the time limit for an appeal against a penalty decision,
which is 30 days, may expire before the taxpayer has even received a
notice of the penalty&#151;that would clearly be wrong and would
undermine this important safeguard&#151;but the legislation already
prevents that from happening.</div>
<a name="0806136000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
18(2) of schedule 41 states that appeals against
penalties</div><a name="0806136000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
be treated for procedural purposes in the same way as an appeal against
an assessment to the tax&#148;</div>
<a name="0806136000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, the time
limit for an appeal against a direct tax assessment runs from the date
on which the assessment is issued. The taxpayer is aware of that date
because it is on the assessment notice. Therefore, I can assure the
Committee that, as now, taxpayers will always have 30 days in which to
appeal, beginning with the day on which HMRC issue the penalty notice.
The amendments are unfair.</div>
<a name="0806136000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Taunton asked why it does not start from the date of receipt
of the notice. The time limits run from the date on which HMRC sends a
document, because that is the date it can be certain of. There can be
no certainty about the date that a document was received. If an appeal
is late because of postal delays, for example, the cause of the late
receipt would be taken into account in considering whether there was a
reasonable excuse for the lateness. If there was a reasonable excuse,
the late appeal would be accepted. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column677" />Column number: 677</div>We have a sensible structure for dealing with appeals and notice and
penalty decisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the
explanation that I have given and not press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="0806136000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000502"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The Minister replied as I had anticipated. It was
not my intention to press the matter to a vote, because I merely wanted
to raise the issue&#151;I did not expect her to be accommodating. On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000505"></a>Mr.

122 relates to the enforcement by taking control of goods. Clause 124,
to which amendment No. 282 relates, is a consequential provision and,
for the benefit of the hon. Member for Wirral, West, it is entirely
sensible that these two matters be addressed at the same time. The
concern here is that under the existing provisions of the Taxes
Management Act 1970 section 61, with regard to destraint and the taking
control of goods, there are three taxpayer safeguards. First, no entry
to effect destraint without a court order. Secondly, HMRC must retain
the goods for at least five days to give the taxpayer a chance to find
the money. Thirdly, any sale must be made by public auction, with any
surplus being restored to the debtor.</div>
<a name="0806136000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
for this Committee is, what is the new procedure? There is nothing in
the Bill that gives us the answer. It is to be prescribed by
regulations under schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
Act 2007. In this Bill we are agreeing to remove these
taxpayers&#146; safeguards. What we are seeking in tabling these two
amendments and having this debate is assurances from the Financial
Secretary that the safeguards that have traditionally been in place
will continue to be in place and that the taxpayer will not lose some
of those safeguards, which are not specified in the Bill. Our question
is, what safeguards will there be and what oversight will Parliament
have in ensuring that they are
satisfactory?</div><a name="0806136000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000506"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The clause will allow HMRC officers to use the
procedure for taking control of goods outlined, as the hon. Gentleman
correctly says, in schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
Act 2007 when that comes into effect. The current safeguards on
destraint are not being weakened under the TCEA but rather the
opposite. It makes sense for officers of HMRC to be subject to the same
statutory rules as other enforcement agents rather than the present mix
of statute, common law and administrative discretion.</div>
<a name="0806136000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
281 is in two parts. The first would disapply HMRC&#146;s ability to
take control of goods where regulations made under section 12 of the
TCEA may require less than five days in which an action should take
place. I think it is premature to restrain HMRC in this way before the
regulations have been drawn up and consulted on, but I appreciate the
reasons why and I will explain what I anticipate will happen in the
coming weeks and
months.</div><a name="0806136000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the amendment concerns the right of any enforcement
agent, including officers of HMRC, to enter premises for the purposes
of taking control of goods. This point was also raised in
representations on the Bill, but I believe that the amendment is based
on a misinterpretation of paragraph 14 of schedule 12 to the Tribunals,
Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. That confers a right to be present on
those premises without prior judicial authority, for example, as a
defence against trespass. I can understand that the Committee might
believe that HMRC currently requires a warrant before entering any
premises, and that that protection is being removed. That is not so: a
warrant is required by HMRC only when it seeks to enter premises by
force, and that requirement will be extended to all enforcement agents
under TCEA.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column679" />Column number: 679</div><a name="0806136000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="0806136000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would prevent HMRC from bringing clause 122 into effect until
it had laid before the House a report on how it would use the
procedure. The 2007 Act is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Justice; it is not tax legislation. The enforcement law reforms in the
Act require the development of underpinning rules and regulations. The
Ministry of Justice is carrying out a scoping exercise involving a
series of meetings with relevant stakeholders, including HMRC, which is
closely involved in those
discussions.</div><a name="0806136000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
122 cannot be brought into effect until schedule 12 to the 2007 Act is
in effect. No order will be laid until the Ministry of Justice&#146;s
public consultation has run its course. The Ministry of Justice, not
HMRC, will make the regulations. Guidance will be drawn up and
published by HMRC in the light of the outcomes of the public
consultation. Under the circumstances, the amendment would add little
to the current situation. I hope that my explanation of where and when

We have touched on that theme before under part 7. I understand that
there is an ongoing consultation process in the Ministry of Justice,
but this is another example of the safeguards being left behind. We
have to take those safeguards on trust, which is regrettable, given

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000510"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> As I understand it, in June 2007 the Treasury
consulted on offset measures, which is the matter before us in clause
125. On 10 January 2008, a document was published entitled,
&#147;Payments, Repayments and Debt: Responses to Consultation and
Proposals&#148;, and the clause is the result of that process. It
allows HMRC to offset sums that it owes to a taxpayer against amounts
owed to HMRC by that taxpayer. It is logical that if HMRC owes the
taxpayer money and the taxpayer owes HMRC money, there is a facility to
offset those two arrangements. The clause throws up a few questions
that I would like the Minister&#146;s response to. Amendment No. 197
touches on one aspect of that. I will not speak to amendment No. 198
now, because it is in a separate group, but it touches on another
aspect of it.</div>
<a name="0806136000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
amendment, the taxpayer would also have the right to choose to offset.
At the moment, HMRC can decide that that is a desirable arrangement,
but it is not open to the taxpayer to make a similar decision if it is
convenient for them and it is possible to apply the rules in a way that
could be of mutual advantage to both parties. While I am on my feet,
may I ask the Minister to shed some light on a few related
issues?</div>
<a name="0806136000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, HMRC
has stated that it would not offset tax credit and child benefit
payments against a previous liability, but that is not in the Bill. Can
the Minister explain why, and say whether it could be made more
explicit for those who need to have that information readily
understandable to
them?</div><a name="0806136000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
why does the clause not include provisions regarding offset? The
Minister may be able to shed more light on that. If there are separate
debts, is it possible to consolidate and align them in such a way that
the offset mechanism can be used? It may be that I have misunderstood
and that that is a possible arrangement. Having more of an explanation
about how the measures will work in practice would be
helpful.</div>
<a name="0806136000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, will
HMRC be able to delay a payment due to a taxpayer if it expects tax
liability to arise? One can easily envisage a situation in which there
is a small amount of money owed by HMRC to the taxpayer, but, in
anticipation of an offset arrangement kicking in and taking effect in
the near future, HMRC could delay payment. In those circumstances, the
taxpayer could suffer cash-flow problems, for example. It would help to
understand whether HMRC is allowed to use the offset mechanism to
anticipate a taxpayer&#146;s future liabilities. If so, what period
would that process of anticipation be allowed to cover?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 681</div><a name="0806136000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are wider
points, which perhaps I should have raised in a stand part debate.
However, I have raised them now instead, so I do not need to contribute
then. I have also raised them as a way of introducing the amendment, so
that the Committee has the opportunity to discuss what is proposed in
it.</div>
<a name="0806136000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000511"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In speaking to amendment No. 197 I shall also
address amendments Nos. 283 to 285. The hon. Member for Taunton has set
out many of the issues, both in relation to his own amendments
and&#151;although he referred to this as perhaps being appropriate
for a stand part debate&#151;in touching on some issues in the other
amendments in this group, where we are looking at the rights of offset
between amounts owed to and from a taxpayer and HMRC.</div>
<a name="0806136000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the outset,
we are certainly sympathetic to amendment No. 197. If it is possible
for HMRC to offset, there needs to be a good reason why the taxpayer
should not be able to; the challenge is for the Financial Secretary to
provide that good reason or to accept the amendment. If offsetting is
to occur, it is only right and fair that it is done in the best
possible manner for the taxpayer. There is no particular reason why the
taxpayer should be disadvantaged by how offsetting occurs, as such
arrangements can sometimes be quite complicated, and how it is done can
make a substantial difference to the end financial result. If HMRC is
to make use of these powers, there should be an obligation on it to do
so in the best possible manner, which is the purpose behind amendment
No. 283.</div>
<a name="0806136000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 284, we are keen to ensure that a sum becomes payable only where it
is &#147;agreed between the parties&#148;. There is a real concern
that HMRC might try to use the power to offset amounts that it believes
to be owed by the taxpayer. That could, for example, be where HMRC has
made an error&#151;entirely innocently, but none the less not beyond
the realms of possibility&#151;or where there is still a valid
dispute. In those circumstances, given our debates on the various
appeal procedures and so on, it would clearly be unacceptable for those
procedures effectively to be overridden by an attempt to offset debts
at that point. I understand that HMRC has indicated that any debts
offset should be agreed, but we would like some assurance, ideally in
legislation.</div>
<a name="0806136000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the issue of tax credits that the hon. Member for Taunton touched on.
Again, the Government have said throughout that tax credits could not
be offset: quite an important point, yet it is not in the legislation,
and we suggest that it should be. Clearly, assurances from the
Government would assist on that, and we look forward to what the
Financial Secretary will say. At the outset, then, we are probably most
determined on amendment no. 284, but we will wait to hear what she
says.</div>
<a name="0806136000445"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0806136000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000512"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Before I respond on the amendment, perhaps I
might make some brief comments about what clause 125 seeks to achieve.
I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman said he was hoping for a stand
part debate on that, but if he is not then I may speak a little broadly
at this point.</div>
<a name="0806136000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Set-off is a
normal business principle. Under common law or by request, HMRC may
already set off sums payable to taxpayers against amounts they owe to
it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column682" />Column number: 682</div><i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Something other than cricket appears to be of
interest to Members of the Committee at this moment; hard to believe,
but that much seems to be the case. HMRC and its principle of set-off
sit easily within some taxes but less so across others. This clause
gives a specific power to HMRC to make set-off across all of the
different taxes and duties that it administers, at its discretion. HMRC
would set-off repayments only against established debt. An established
debt is one that is correctly payable, either based on a return from
the taxpayer or agreed, or as assessed, with the time for appeal having
passed or the appeal having been determined. A taxpayer can request
set-off to take place now, and HMRC considers each request on its
merits. That will remain
unchanged.</div><a name="0806136000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 197 would set in statute that taxpayers could also require the use
of set-off. However, the amendment does no more than restate the
existing position. Taxpayers can already request set-off, and nothing
in the clause would change that. An unfettered right to require
set-off, in whatever amount, risks tying up HMRC resources on small,
individual debts that are uneconomical to resolve in that
manner.</div><a name="0806136000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no objection in principle to the first part of amendment No. 283.
The purpose of the measure is to reduce indebtedness in a sensible way.
The majority of set-offs are likely to involve a single debt and a
single repayment where the issue would not arise. However, HMRC could
not be expected to know in every case what particular allocation of a
repayment might be to the debtor&#146;s advantage, as that might
depend on information that only the debtor held. Instead, HMRC will
continue to apply its long-established rules on appropriation, as it
does when making set-off now. Those rules are in HMRC&#146;s
published guidance and provide a framework that aims to ensure that
payments are allocated to the taxpayer&#146;s best
advantage.</div><a name="0806136000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
now, HMRC will consider particular circumstances where a taxpayer
raises concerns and where a set-off has been made and it will continue
to consider those circumstances on a case-by-case basis. That process
has not been changed by the measure. In light of our debate
today&#151;I knew that the clause would raise a degree of
interest&#151;HMRC will shortly publish its policy on set-off and, in
due course, the operational guidance for its
staff.</div><a name="0806136000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of amendment No. 283 would require HMRC to notify the
taxpayer in writing once the set-off is made. HMRC will confirm, as
now, that the taxpayer must always be told in writing that set-off has
taken
place.</div><a name="0806136000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I deal with amendment No. 284, may I address a couple of questions that
have been raised? First, I shall deal with the question that the hon.
Member for Taunton asked about the time periods. He is somewhat
distracted, Sir Nicholas, so I shall explain to you and to the other
Committee members. Tax repayments may be held back for a short
period&#151;usually only 14 days or so&#151;but they could be held
longer, depending on the tax concerned. The hon. Gentleman is right in
saying that that could
happen.</div><a name="0806136000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked what would happen if
HMRC made a mistake, but it is hard to imagine instances in which HMRC
might get it wrong. The same remedies would apply as now. For example,
if HMRC made a mistake, it would apologise, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 683</div>put things right and explain what went wrong, and consider refunding
reasonable costs directly caused by their mistakes or by unreasonable
delays.</div><a name="0806136000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 284 would set in statute that set-off will take place only where
the party concerned and HMRC agree that a sum is payable to the
commissioners or where the person concerned has exhausted all appeal
routes. I am not attracted by this amendment, as it would do no more
than restate the existing position. Set-off will be applied only where
both the repayment and debt are established. An established debt is one
that is beyond challenge, whether the appeal has been settled or the
time for appeal has passed. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> It seems to be my
phone, Sir Nicholas. I thought I had turned everything off. I
apologise.</div><a name="0806136000102"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000514"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It is hard to deny without
blushing.</div><a name="0806136000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concerns behind amendment No. 285 and why it
was tabled. I am conscious that questions were raised during the
consultation about the extent to which the provisions will apply to tax
credits and child benefit. I acknowledge that this is a matter of
concern for many who have made representations on the Bill. I want to
reassure the Committee that HMRC will not seek to use an ongoing tax
credit award or a child benefit award to satisfy other tax debts that
may have arisen. Section 45 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 and section 187
of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 make entitlement to tax
credits and child benefit an inalienable right. We have no intention
whatever of moving away from that
principle.</div><a name="0806136000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
except in very limited circumstances, which I will explain, HMRC will
not set a tax repayment against a tax credit or child benefit
overpayment. Where a tax credit or child benefit award has been made,
and an overpayment subsequently arises, HMRC will not accept procedures
for instalment plans or for recovery from an ongoing award. However, as
explained there may be certain circumstances, as now, where at the
request of the customer, HMRC will set off a tax repayment against a
tax credit or a child benefit overpayment. We have had requests for
that in the
past.</div><a name="0806136000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
set out in the discussion paper &#147;Tax Credits: Improving Delivery
and Choice&#148;, which I published last month, from next April, HMRC
will begin a small trial to offer tax credit customers in employment
the option of having their overpayment recovered by a deduction in
their wages through an adjustment of their pay-as-you-earn code. This
is a small pilot designed to improve choice for tax credit customers.
It is a suggestion that I have heard over the last year from tax credit
customers. It seemed a sensible idea to
trial.</div><a name="0806136000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will make no changes to the policy I have outlined without first coming
back to the House. I do believe, however, that there are circumstances
where a customer would like the flexibility to offset a tax repayment
against a tax credit overpayment and where that is the case it ought to
be possible for us to accommodate that. The discussion document
includes examples of other Administrations, such as those in New
Zealand and Australia, which use a similar arrangement. That is
something that we should consider offering to tax credit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 684</div>customers in the UK. I hope that I have reassured hon. Members on the
proper concerns that they have raised. I hope that they will not take
up time by pressing their amendments to a
vote.</div><a name="0806136000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806136000515"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
will detain you, Sir Nicholas, and the rest of the Committee only very
briefly. Some quite deep concerns have come out in the course of this
debate. Although the Minister has to an extent assuaged some of the
concerns where there is consent between the Revenue and taxpayer on
some sort of set-off arrangement, most taxpayers still have a deep
concern that all too often the authorities do not get this right. That
applies particularly in relation to the amendment where we discussed
the working tax credit system, which has become almost notorious for
its
unreliability.</div><a name="0806136000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
there is consent between a taxpayer and the authorities it is
absolutely fine, but this is not about consent. It is about imposing a
system. There is deep concern on the part of the taxpayer where there
is a lack of reliability or a perceived lack of reliability, as is
often the case, not least where there are potential interest payments.
It always seems to be a one-sided situation: late payments from the
Revenue do not seem to attract interest to the taxpayer, whereas they
do in the opposite direction. There is quite some concern about the
notion that set-off now becomes the norm, irrespective of the consent
or arrangements where there has been a complicated tax situation
between the taxpayer and the Revenue. It is not for me to suggest that
this might go to a Division, but these are deep concerns. For my part
at least, I am not sure that the Minister has been able to assuage
them.</div>

your
dictum.</div><a name="0806136000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary&#146;s remarks are helpful in assuaging our
concerns about tax credits. She has been very explicit on that,
although I am still not convinced that the proposal could not be put in
the Bill. I also note her comments on amendment No. 283, which is of a
practical nature. However, as I indicated in my opening remarks, we are
particularly concerned about the matter addressed in amendment No. 284,
which talks about sums being payable only when they are agreed. My hon.
Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster eloquently set
out the reasons for our concerns, and so we seek to press that
amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000523"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Unsurprisingly, the amendments overlap to a degree
and touch on some of the issues discussed in the previous group. I
shall be brief and specific. Amendment No. 198 would insert a new
subsection to allow a person to appeal to the first-tier tribunal
against a decision by HMRC to offset. Currently the clause gives no
right to the taxpayer to contest a decision by HMRC, and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants, and other bodies, have expressed concern that
offset could damage businesses and force insolvency if exercised in
inappropriate circumstances.</div>
<a name="0806136000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 126, to
which I shall not speak now, but which we shall come to shortly, would
prevent set-off where insolvency procedure has been applied already.
Providing an appeal route for the taxpayer, in clause 125, would allow
a taxpayer to raise concerns and prevent set-off causing insolvency. As
a safeguard, the amendment would allow an appeal only if the</div>
<a name="0806136000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decision can be

purpose of the amendment&#151;this is the same point that I sought to

Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster&#151;is to
address the balance between the power held by HMRC and that held by the
individual taxpayer, who should have the opportunity, should he or she
wish, to make a formal appeal if they feel that the behaviour and
procedures followed by HMRC are unfairly to their
disadvantage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000526"></a>Mr.

to. I am grateful to him for making it more
explicit.</div><a name="0806136000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 198 and 286 both essentially insert a right of appeal in the
context of set-off. Our amendment No. 286 provides slightly more detail
than No. 198 but both seek to achieve the same objective and provide
the safeguards that Opposition Members think may be necessary with
regard to matters of
set-off.</div><a name="0806136000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000527"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Set-off will initially take place manually rather
than as a bulk process, and the customer will be informed at the time
that set-off is made.</div>
<a name="0806136000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concerns expressed but set-off will be made in the course of
HMRC&#146;s day-to-day dealings with taxpayers in debt, so there will
be the opportunity for dialogue. It will be made only in respect of
established debt where the normal appeal routes concerning the amount
of debt have run their course.</div>
<a name="0806136000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
wrong to allow debtors a further opportunity to reopen a dialogue in
the courts on how much they have to pay. An appeal process as suggested
could undermine the whole benefit of set-off by unnecessarily
complicating and delaying the time it takes to collect debts and to
make repayments to taxpayers. It would prolong uncertainty and thereby
potentially add to the taxpayer&#146;s financial
instability.</div>
<a name="0806136000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appeals with
little prospect of success could be used as delaying tactics. A
successful appeal would leave a collectable debt which HMRC would then
pursue perhaps even through the civil courts. The debt would still be
collected but through a far more burdensome process. That is not fair
to the general taxpayer and HMRC.</div>
<a name="0806136000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, there
has to be some channel for discussion. As now, HMRC would consider
particular circumstances, where the taxpayer raises concerns where
set-off has been made. HMRC would continue to consider these on a
case-by-case basis. That has not been changed by this
measure.</div>
<a name="0806136000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I found this
debate helpful, Sir Nicholas, in understanding the concerns around
set-off and I want to keep this matter under review, but I think we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000554"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Amendment No. 287 is to some extent a probing
amendment. Clause 126(2) states:</div>
<a name="0806136000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioners may not use the power under section 125 to set that
post-insolvency credit against a pre-insolvency debit&#148;</div>
<a name="0806136000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">and I would be grateful
for an explanation as to why the word is &#147;that&#148;, as
opposed to &#147;a&#148; so that it would be &#147;a&#148; case
of post-insolvency
credit.</div><a name="0806136000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 288 is a consequence of representations received from the Institute
of Chartered Accountants, which expresses its concern that by
specifically excluding from set-off in this clause</div>
<a name="0806136000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;post-insolvency
credits against pre-insolvency debits, the rules are implicitly, (or
perhaps even explicitly) allowing the set-off of pre-insolvency credits
against post-insolvency
debits.&#148;</div><a name="0806136000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
makes the point that</div>
<a name="0806136000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while this may
not be particularly important in many corporate insolvencies, there
will be many cases (and all cases of personal insolvency) where such a
set-off would be detrimental to the creditors
generally&#148;.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 688</div><a name="0806136000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its words, this
would</div>
<a name="0806136000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fly in the face
of all the basic principles of insolvency.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806136000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I would be
grateful if the Minister would explain the wording of clause
126(2).</div><a name="0806136000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000555"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Clause 126 offers a safeguard. Without it,
HMRC&#146;s discretionary right of set-off under clause 125 would
take priority over set-off in insolvency, whereas it is not the
intention to disturb the normal insolvency rules. It also provides that
the earliest of a series of insolvency procedures brings that safeguard
into operation. However, the routes into and out of insolvency are many
and varied, and setting out all the circumstances that might apply
would result in inordinately lengthy legislation to address seldom-met
cases. The two amendments together would prevent HMRC setting-off a
pre-insolvency credit against a post-insolvency
debt.</div><a name="0806136000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are technically deficient, but I understand why they have
been tabled and am grateful for the opportunity to clarify further.
This is not a situation that HMRC often comes across in practice. The
power in clause 125 is discretionary, not mandatory. It is hard to
think of circumstances where HMRC would want to apply it in the way
that the amendment envisages. HMRC does not seek to set pre-insolvency
credits against post-insolvency debts under the current
legislation&#151;schedule 81 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. If such
a credit arose, HMRC would expect to pay it to the insolvent&#146;s
estate for the benefit of all creditors. HMRC will continually review
its guidance to ensure that commonly met circumstances are fully
addressed. The amendments would not be of benefit to the
Bill.</div><a name="0806136000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000556"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Will the Financial Secretary therefore explain the
purpose of clause 126, if set-off is almost inconceivable in an
insolvency situation? What is the purpose of the clause, other than to
codify what is already the case, unless a new regime has come about,
for example as a result of the change in insolvency law under the
Enterprise Act
2002?</div><a name="0806136000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000557"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Clause 125 broadens HMRC&#146;s set-off
abilities. Clause 126 limits those abilities in particular
circumstances, and makes it clear that the powers in clause 125, to
set-off sums payable to a taxpayer against an amount owed to HMRC by
that same taxpayer, limit those sums where there is insolvency. So, the
purpose of clause 126 is to underscore the current position. HMRC
applies set-off in insolvency cases according to legislation laid down
elsewhere. We do not seek to disturb the principles that underpin those
rules, but tax legislation is inconsistent and does not align precisely
with insolvency legislation. This clause makes that alignment. I hope
that that makes it clear that we have not included the clause for no
good purpose. It serves a useful purpose, and will be welcomed. Clearly
the guidance that will help practitioners to manage the legislation
will seek to give the clarity that perhaps is not immediately obvious
to the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="0806136000178"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000563"></a>Mr.

but I am sure that the Committee&#146;s wish is that we continue

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000565"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am indeed used to interruptions, but let there
be light, at least for the remainder of our proceedings.</div>
<a name="0806136000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is not hugely significant in the grand scheme of things, but it
addresses precisely the type of smaller concern that often leads people
to feel, when dealing with the state in many of its forms, that the
powers of the authorities are unfairly weighed against those of the
individual citizen. It provides for positive resolution when
determining fee levels under clause 130. It would be helpful to explain
to the Committee why my hon. Friends and I feel that that is an
appropriate way forward. Subsection (1) allows HMRC to make regulations
to charge a fee for payment by specified methods of a person&#146;s
financial obligations to HMRC. HMRC commissioners will be allowed to do
that only when they &#147;expect&#148; that they will have to pay a
fee or charge in connection with the payment they are
receiving.</div>
<a name="0806136000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, in
anticipation of additional transitional costs associated with the
payment by the taxpayer, HMRC will be able to levy a charge to
compensate itself financially for that payment, even if there is only
an expectation that it will have to meet that payment in the future.
Any regulations will be made under a statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 690</div>instrument and be subject to negative procedure, which the amendment
seeks to
address.</div><a name="0806136000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that credit cards are thought likely to become
the first specified method of payment, but I understand that currently
HMRC does not generally accept credit card payments. I have tabled the
amendment because there is a specific issue to discuss. It enables
greater discussion about the wide-ranging impact of the clause and
specifically seeks reassurance from the Minister on how HMRC will
address a number of questions.</div>
<a name="0806136000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have three
questions in particular. First, is legislation necessary for that to
occur? As I understand it, HMRC can decide to use credit card payments
or any other method for procuring the money owed to it by the taxpayer
without Parliament having to give it those powers through legislation.
Secondly, what kinds of payment does HMRC envisage extending those
powers to? Under the provisions of the clause as drafted, HMRC will be
able to levy charges in anticipation of those costs being incurred
later in proceedings. Does that mean that charges for handling cheques
or bank charges could be passed on to the taxpayer as part of the
procurement of their tax
liability?</div><a name="0806136000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
when HMRC takes money from taxpayers in anticipation of future charges,
does it expect to reimburse them if the charges are not as great as it
anticipated or if no charges arise? It is possible that HMRC will be
unduly pessimistic in assuming that charges will have to be
levied.</div><a name="0806136000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
matters are not hugely significant in the grand scheme of things. We
are almost certainly talking about rather modest sums of money, but
these sorts of issues provide symbolic demonstrations of HMRC holding
powers over taxpayers that they might regard as unreasonable. That is
particularly true if taxpayers have to deal with long, drawn-out
processes with HMRC in which they feel somewhat embattled. That is what
I am trying to get at with the amendment and in debating clause 130
more
widely.</div><a name="0806136000195"></a>

Kennedy:</b> I will battle on, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="0806136000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The normal
protocol for tax is to use negative resolution for regulations that
deal with routine administrative matters. Affirmative resolution is
usually reserved for more contentious matters. The Committee has seen a
draft of the regulations to be made under clause 130. They specify that
the payment method will be the use of a credit card and then set the
amount of the fee that HMRC will
charge.</div><a name="0806136000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton asked whether other methods beside credit cards
were being considered. HMRC will be able to pass on the fee for a
specified payment method only when it expects to be charged a fee for
the transaction. That is not the case for the normal cost of payment
processing. Any payment method must be specified in regulations
approved by Parliament. Draft regulations to pay a fee in connection
with the amounts paid by using a credit card have been published, but
there are currently no plans to pass on any charges other than credit
cards.</div><a name="0806136000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
ways of paying continually arise and it makes sense to future-proof the
legislation.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000569"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. No interruptions. <i class="I">Hansard </i>needs to
be able to hear the
Minister.</div>
<a name="0806136000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="0806136000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000570"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Legislation supports a range of payment methods,
but HMRC cannot accept payment by credit card other than in limited
circumstances such as at ports and airports. Early consultation by HMRC
has shown that many small businesses use credit cards to manage their
short-term cash flow and taxpayers regularly ask HMRC whether they can
pay by credit card. Clause 130, therefore, provides for HMRC to receive
payment and then to make regulations to charge a fee for payment made
by such methods.</div>
<a name="0806136000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
whether the taxpayer will have to bear the cost of paying by credit
card. Only those taxpayers who choose to pay in this way will bear the
cost of the transaction, rather than the cost falling on all taxpayers.
The hon. Gentleman asked a series of questions, one of which involved
the refund of transaction fees. Where either HMRC or the payer makes a
mistake, which is immediately corrected, both tax and transaction fees
will be refunded through the card to the card holder. For mistakes by
the taxpayer that are picked up later, or a change in taxpayer&#146;s
circumstances giving rise to a reduced liability, the fee is not
refundable. This is as advised at the time of payment, so repayment
will be made to the taxpayer through whatever repayment channel is
appropriate as happens now. For HMRC error, where it is decided to
refund the transaction fees, the refund will be paid out of
HMRC&#146;s redress budget through whatever repayment channel is
appropriate.</div>
<a name="0806136000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked the very sensible question whether legislation is
needed at all. The answer is that, because of the functions laid down
in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, collecting these

<div class="Column"><a name="Column692" />Column number: 692</div>fees is not included. They are not a tax so they are not specified by
that Act. We therefore have to legislate separately for it. As I have
said, HMRC accepts payment by credit card at ports and airports. This
is for customs duties at points of entry and road-fuel testing units up
to a transaction limit of &#163;1,000. In light of the
representations that HMRC has made, however, it is sensible to
introduce this opportunity for HMRC to respond to customer demand.
Having raised the level of my contribution to one of which our dear
departed Friend the former Member for Crewe and Nantwich, Gwyneth
Dunwoody would have been proud, I hope the hon. Gentleman will not
press these amendments to a vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000572"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 289, in
clause 132, page 83, line 36, at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000573"></a>The

&#145;enactment&#146; to end of line

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000574"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall also try to keep the volume up in order to
deal with the background noise. I venture to suggest that this may not
be the first occasion during these proceedings when the events in this
Committee Room are somewhat above the heads of Members of the
Committee, but I have two points to make with regard to certificates of
debt. First, proposed new section 25A to the CRCA in clause 132
states:</div><a name="0806136000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
certificate of an officer of Revenue and Customs that, to the best of
that officer&#146;s knowledge and belief, a relevant sum has not been
paid is sufficient evidence that the sum mentioned in the certificate
is
unpaid.&#148;</div><a name="0806136000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
see no reason why that should not be rebuttable. We therefore suggest
that we add to the clause the
words:</div><a name="0806136000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the absence of evidence to the
contrary&#148;.</div><a name="0806136000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is evidence to the contrary, it is common sense that such a
certificate should not be sufficient
evidence.</div><a name="0806136000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 290 relates to concerns about this provision that were raised by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants throughout the consultation
process. The proposal
will</div><a name="0806136000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extend
HMRC&#146;s right to proceed against goods to amounts due under a
contract settlement. There is no such right under current law and HMRC
has not indicated why it believes that powers which apply to tax should
be extended to purely civil debts.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column693" />Column number: 693</div><a name="0806136000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We look forward to the
Financial Secretary providing that
justification.</div><a name="0806136000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ICAEW goes on to
say:</div><a name="0806136000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that HMRC ought to rely on contract law to enforce contracts in
the same way as other parties to a
contract&#148;.</div><a name="0806136000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a technical point that the redefinition of a contract
settlement could give rise to certain arguments. An example given by
the ICAEW is
that</div><a name="0806136000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
taxpayer sometimes includes in an offer liabilities that are out of
time for assessment and we doubt that such an amount can be said to be
&#145;in connection with any person&#146;s liabilities&#146;. An
offer is also sometimes made as a pragmatic way to resolve a dispute
albeit that the taxpayer does not believe that any tax is due. We also
doubt that such an offer is in connection with a liability. We do not
think that taking goods is an appropriate remedy where there is a
possibility of a
dispute.&#148;</div><a name="0806136000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would be grateful for clarification from the Financial Secretary on why
contract settlements should be included in the clause. Does she
recognise any difficulties with the definition? Perhaps she could
identify how the definition will work in the examples that I have
given.</div><a name="0806136000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000575"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The clause defines a relevant sum
as</div><a name="0806136000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
sum payable to the Commissioners under or by virtue of an
enactment&#148;.</div><a name="0806136000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
includes debts arising from taxes, duties and so on imposed by statute.
Contract settlements are defined in clause 133 as contractual
agreements</div><a name="0806136000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made
in connection with any person&#146;s
liability&#148;.</div><a name="0806136000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is usually as a result of the recovery of tax during a number of
years.</div><a name="0806136000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 289, HMRC has legislation that permits evidence in
support of a claim for unpaid debts to be presented to the court in a
way that normally avoids the meaningful, lengthy documentation. While
not a necessary requirement, before HMRC takes action to recover a debt
it streamlines the evidence needed by the civil courts across the taxes
that HMRC collects. The amendment is unnecessary as a certificate is
sufficient, rather than conclusive, evidence that the debt is unpaid.
It may be challenged or it might be outweighed by other evidence
brought before the court. If a taxpayer produces evidence that the
facts in the certificate are incorrect, the court can use its
discretion on which evidence to
accept.</div><a name="0806136000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 290, contract settlements are subject to enforcement
under contract law, not tax law. Contract settlements are defined as
agreements</div><a name="0806136000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made
in connection with any person&#146;s liability to make a payment to
the Commissioners under or by virtue of an
enactment.&#148;</div><a name="0806136000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply
put, they are agreements to pay tax, interest, penalties and so on. It
seems sensible to apply the same HMRC recovery methods to unpaid
contract settlements as to unpaid tax. The extension of certificates to
all debts that HMRC currently collects, including those under a
contract settlement, will help court processes run more smoothly by
introducing greater consistency for HMRC officers and greater certainty
for the debtor. It will also be simpler for HMRC to
administer.</div><a name="0806136000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
made clear the purpose of the changes, I undertake to keep under review
all matters concerning the powers of HMRC. If, on testing the new
provisions, concerns raised here prove to have had more substance than
I gave them credit for, I will be prepared to revisit them, if
necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000577"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Just because we might run out of time, does not
mean that we should not scrutinise this Bill. I have some brief
questions about the clause. It is worth noting that clauses 134 and 135
tidy up provisions brought in two years ago under the Finance Act 2006.
The provisions were controversial having been produced after very
little, if any, consultation, and substantial amendments were tabled to
them. I served on that Committee, as one or two others here did, and it
was an educative experience. It is perhaps also worth noting the
difficulties that can arise with legislation on which there has not
been adequate consultation, and which provide for substantial changes.
I am sure that we will bear that in mind when we discuss schedule 7
later in our proceedings.</div>
<a name="0806136000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 134 addresses a
person&#146;s interest in possession in a trust where inheritance tax
treats them as having the property in a trust comprised in their
estate. When someone with an interest in possession dies, or if the
interest comes to an end, there is an IHT charge on all the property in
the trust payable by the trustees out of the trust&#146;s assets.
Section 53 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 provides some exceptions to
that general rule, and the new rules will allow trustees who become
entitled to an interest before or on 5 April 2008 to reorganise their
interest in possession of a trust without a charge arising. The purpose
of that was to allow the IIP to be changed to a disabled trust or to a
serial interest. For example, the IIP would carry on for the same
beneficiary if, at the age of 30, it was amended so that it rolled into
a new trust to run to the age of 40. However, that did not seem to work
properly and the HMRC&#146;s guidance on it fluctuated.</div>
<a name="0806136000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 134
rewrites the offending subsection. There is no problem with
that&#151;the accountancy profession has welcomed those
changes&#151;but are there any similar issues for which clarification
is needed regarding the operation of the 2006 rules? What is being done
to assess how well they are working, given their complexity? Will the
Minister give sympathetic consideration to the problems as they emerge?
That is all that I wish to say on clause 134, although I have a brief
remark to make on clause
135.</div><a name="0806136000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000578"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000579"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It would not be in the
interests of good government not to listen to reasonable
representations about the way in which legislation functions. The hon.
Gentleman rightly says that the measure in clause 134 has arisen out of
the two-year transition period that was introduced to enable trustees
to reorganise existing trusts without being subject to the new rules,
because the wording of the transitional provisions has left them open
to different interpretations where the existing trusts are replaced
with new trusts for the same beneficiaries. Clause 135, which we will
discuss in a moment, ensures, as was always intended, that the new
rules will not apply where a replacement of that kind is made in the
transitional period. I am not aware of any other areas that we need to
clarify, but I will keep the matter under review, and I am happy to
receive representations if it becomes clear that such a review is
necessary. The clarification has, as the hon. Gentleman said, been
welcomed by tax professionals as well as by representatives of other
groups.</div>

<a name="0806136000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000580"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I rise simply to ask about the extension to the
transitional period, which is welcome, but the Institute of Chartered
Accountants wanted a longer period. Why have the Government not
conceded to that request? Why have they chosen the time period in the
Bill?</div><a name="0806136000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000581"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> As I said earlier, the clauses relate to the
&#147;Inheritance tax: rules for trusts etc&#148; in schedule 20 to
the Finance Act 2006. Trustees who are inclined to make changes to
existing trusts will already have given a lot of thought to how they
might do so. However, we accept that the uncertainty regarding the
inheritance tax consequences of one particular course of action might,
in some cases, have prevented trustees from reaching a firm decision.
The six-month extension to the transitional period provides ample time
for them to do that. That step has also been welcomed by tax
professionals and representatives of other groups. I am aware of the
representations that have been made and, as I said earlier, we will
keep the matter under review to see whether six months is problematic.
However, we think that we have got things right, on
balance.</div><a name="0806136000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I beg to move amendment No. 351,

out &#145;electronic&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div><a name="0806136000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will try to
be heard above the din of the very annoying light bulb above us. I
shall go into my amendment No. 351 in detail, but, with your agreement,
Sir Nicholas, I will also cover the issues that I wanted to address in
the clause stand part debate. That way we can progress
faster.</div>
<a name="0806136000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I
can see, this clause is one of two that tackle anti-avoidance of some
form in relation to vehicle excise duty. Amendment No. 351 is a probing
amendment more than anything else, because I wish to understand whether
the phraseology in the clause would work as intended. At the same time,
I will also address a couple of other concerns that I have regarding
the clause, although I fully understand why it is being brought
forward.</div><a name="0806136000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
138 is designed to stop motorists from surrendering vehicle excise duty
licences early to get a rebate and then renewing the licence before the
rate goes up in the following 12-month period. The motorist would
apparently do that to avoid paying higher rates of vehicle excise duty
later. We understand why they might want to do that and, therefore, why
the Treasury want to bring forward measures to stop them. I have tabled
the amendment because I have concerns about how the measure will work
in practice and about some of the procedures that are in
place&#151;or are not, as the case may be&#151;to stop that sort of
practice from happening in the first place.</div>
<a name="0806136000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main
problem with clause 138 is that it makes applying for a rebate
unnecessarily restrictive, because it seems to suggest that it can be
done only</div>
<a name="0806136000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by such
electronic means as may be
specified&#148;.</div><a name="0806136000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 351 is a probing amendment to determine whether that approach is
favoured by the Government for a particular reason or whether it is
simply not clear what the Government intend by limiting communication
purely to electronic means. The clause allows the Secretary of State to
set certain conditions that a person applying for a rebate must comply
with. One condition includes the provision of information to the
Secretary of State by electronic means. Will the Minister clarify why
it has to be electronic, and whether it limits applicants to using
e-mail or whether applicants are allowed to post details or provide
them over the phone? We all know that systems breakdown, for whatever
reason, and, therefore, relying on electronic means is an unwise
risk.</div>
<a name="0806136000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ironically,
another part of clause 138 has the opposite effect to what the clause
intends to achieve, by providing&#151;in my opinion&#151;a
loophole. New subsection (3)(f) allows for a rebate on a vehicle that
has left the UK with a view to it remaining permanently outside the UK.
I understand exactly why the clause has that proviso for somebody being
able to claim a rebate, and it is fine. However, it seems very
difficult for the Treasury to enforce, so will an individual have to
provide proof of his or her move before being able to get the rebate,
and, if so, what kind of
proof?</div><a name="0806136000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somebody
may get the rebate for moving, and end up reapplying shortly afterwards
for a licence for the same car, which could happen easily. For example,
they may have thought that they were going to be able to sell their car
to a relative in a different country, back in Poland, for example, and
were planning to buy a new car in the UK, but, for whatever reason,
that purchase did not happen. Therefore, they end up keeping the car in
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>UK and want to establish road tax for it again&#151;quite properly. It
would be difficult for whoever was renewing the vehicle excise duty to
challenge that as an explanation for why it was being renewed early on
the same vehicle. To that extent, I question whether it is possible to
enforce this part of the clause, although I can see the sense of
putting it there in the first place. Perhaps the Minister can clarify
that.</div><a name="0806136000450"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0806136000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can readily understand why the Government think there is a risk of more
people wanting to try to avoid paying vehicle excise duty and higher
rates of it. One of the key measures brought forward in the Budget was
a massive rise in vehicle excise duty for some people. That is
demonstrated by the fact that the Government decided to put in two
clauses to tackle what it saw as a growing risk of people trying to
avoid paying higher road tax. Of course, I would never condone that
behaviour.</div>
<a name="0806136000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Treasury could explain why it feels that there is suddenly a need to
bring forward this and the following clause in terms of clamping down
on vehicle excise duty avoidance. Is it anything to do with these large
increases that we have
seen?</div><a name="0806136000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
can the Minister give the Committee an update on how big a problem this
is? How many people are now avoiding paying road tax? I understand that
in the past the Treasury has taken initiatives to try to tackle, with
some success, people who are avoiding paying road tax. Perhaps the
Minister can give an update on the Treasury&#146;s assessment of how
many drivers and cars are currently avoiding paying road tax and the
loss of revenue, specifically in terms of the Red Book figure of
&#163;735 million in 2010-11 from changes to road tax put forward in
the Budget. Next year those changes amount to &#163;435 million. Is
the impact of this anti-avoidance clause factored into that amount in
the Red Book or is this additional revenue that the Treasury expects to
gain by clamping down on anti-avoidance?</div>
<a name="0806136000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have asked
numerous questions on vehicle excise duty following the Budget that
have still not been answered by the Treasury. I hope Ministers will
answer questions tabled at the beginning of May in the near future. I
look forward to hearing what the Minister has to
say.</div><a name="0806136000260"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000583"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> It is a
pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="0806136000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
we are taking the clause stand part debate together with the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Putney, so I will deal with all the
questions that she asked. First, and perhaps most to the point, she
asked why the clause was being introduced at this time. She is right in
inferring that the purpose is to ensure that motorists pay the
appropriate level of VED when rates are pre-announced, which provides
an incentive for people to attempt to re-license before the date on
which higher rates are introduced. Our intention is to make that harder
in the interests of the taxpayer.</div>
<a name="0806136000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">She also asked
about the rate of evasion. We think it is about 1.1 per cent among
vehicles sighted in traffic, according to estimates in the 2007
roadside survey. That equates to a revenue loss of about &#163;79
million, so it is obviously an issue that is worth pursuing, and we
hope 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 698</div>that the measures before the Committee will help. I must apologise to
the hon. Lady, as she has not yet received answers to her written
questions: I will ensure that they are answered as speedily as
possible. Regarding her amendment, I suspect that there has been a
slight misunderstanding. It is not the intention nor, we think, the
legal effect of the clause to make electronic communication mandatory.
We are simply allowing it to be one of the forms of communication used.
We are not saying that people must communicate electronically, so I
hope that that reassures the hon. Lady. She also asked whether people
can apply for rebates over the phone. Submissions can currently be made
only on paper, but the clause allows for electronic
submissions.</div><a name="0806136000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000584"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her
explanation about communication via electronic means. However, the
clause suggests that that is the only means available. It does not
refer to other means. I press the hon. Lady on whether other means can
be used, because, as she said, most people do not use electronic means
to renew their
licence.</div><a name="0806136000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000585"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will quadruple-check that we are absolutely
sure. We have triple-checked, and are absolutely sure. For the record,
there is absolutely no intention to set conditions to make the take-up
of electronic services mandatory. Such take-up may occur&#151;perhaps
it is the use of the word &#147;may&#148; that is key&#151;and
those means should be used in parallel with existing paper-based
channels.</div><a name="0806136000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000586"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Will the Economic Secretary indicate whether an
administrative charge is paid by a licence holder when applying for a
rebate?</div><a name="0806136000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000587"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I understand that that is not the
case.</div><a name="0806136000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806136000588"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): There is effectively a
charge, because complete months are required. If a licence is
surrendered halfway through a month, half a month&#146;s rebate is
lost. People would not readily do that. I am interested to see whether
the Economic Secretary will go on to explain the anticipated loss of
revenue, if the existing conditions were to
continue.</div><a name="0806136000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000589"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary
could speak up a
little.</div><a name="0806136000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000590"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I shall shout over the light bulb. I am tempted to
make jokes about how many MPs it takes to change a light bulb.
Obviously we need more MPs than we have in Committee&#151;and the
Finance Bill Committee is a large one. I think that I answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about revenue loss by explaining what we
thought the evasion rate and losses were. That is why we are tightening
up the
measure.</div><a name="0806136000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000591"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I was not talking about evasion, which is
different&#151;it is an illegal act. I thought that the Economic
Secretary was talking about avoidance by surrendering early, which is
legal. That is the loss that I was trying to
quantify.</div><a name="0806136000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000592"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, as I
misunderstood him. I do not have that figure to hand, but I will
provide him with it if it is
available.</div><a name="0806136000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Putney asked how it is proved that a vehicle is
permanently exported. The DVLA must be notified of the export in
writing, and it would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>need to receive that before a rebate was considered. A statement of
proof is be needed. If the vehicle is re-imported, it is illegal for it
not to be licensed. We believe that that covers the points that she
raised. I believe that I have answered everything, so hopefully the
hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="0806136000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000593"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I find the Economic Secretary&#146;s reply, and
the underlying basis of the clause, insidious. In essence, it is in the
nature of taxation that individuals should be able to go about their
business, and avoid paying large amounts of taxation, if they wish to
do so. I accept that this is a small taxation measure, but none the
less a car owner who sees that there is to be a large increase in the
tax due as vehicle excise duty, should be entitled to make arrangements
accordingly. In other words, if that taxpayer is only seven twelfths of
the way through the mandatory year-long licence regime imposed by the
Government, it should be within their rights to seek a rebate for the
remainder, then take out a new 12-month licence just before the rise is
put in place. That insidious situation is one reason why I asked about
administration charges. It is insidious that the Government should
effectively blocking this off in the name of what they regard as
avoidance, or even evasion.</div>
<a name="0806136000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000594"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend is making a strong and powerful
point, with which I entirely agree. Since the Government could bring in
VED increases in immediately to avoid that situation if they wanted,
all this legislation is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="0806136000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000595"></a>Kitty

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000596"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough was
intervening on me, but I will give way to the
Minister.</div>
<a name="0806136000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000597"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> In responding to the intervention from his hon.
Friend, would the hon. Gentleman clarify whether it is Conservative
party policy to introduce VED rates
immediately?</div>
<a name="0806136000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000598"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Naturally, we are not here to make Conservative
party policy on the hoof&#151;particularly not my hon. Friend the
Member for Wellingborough or myself. We were trying to make a serious
point about our concerns: it is a relatively small financial issue, but
quite an important issue of principle.</div>
<a name="0806136000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
strict regime of a 12-month period, if people sell and buy cars
mid-year, the taxpayer has the right to be entitled&#151;I suspect
that a relatively small number of car owners would, from the
Government&#146;s perspective, seek to take advantage of the
measure&#151;to a rebate on their current tax disc, then take out a
new one to avoid paying a substantially higher charge under the new
duty regime. I am not terribly convinced that the Government would face
a massive administrative problem in that regard. A huge amount of money
would not necessarily be lost to the Government, from their own
perspective. This is yet another intrusion on the individual, who
should be allowed to ensure that they can organise their personal and
financial affairs in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div>a way that is not necessarily to the convenience of the Government, and
would not maximise Government revenue.</div>
<a name="0806136000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000599"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I endorse everything that my hon. Friend has said,
and I would resist the clause on the grounds that the Government have
given us no indication of the revenue implications. We are creating a
lot of totally unnecessary new regulations. The existing system works
perfectly well, and unless the Government intend in future years to
make massive VED increases, which would cause a significant loss of
revenue to the Exchequer, I can see no reason to proceed with the
measure. It is an unfair restriction on taxpayers&#146; ability to
plan how they pay their tax.</div>
<a name="0806136000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000600"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> We have had an interesting debate, and my hon.
Friends have raised some well-made points about the intention behind
the clause. I have no doubt that the massive rises in VED that some
people face this year will make them want to renew their vehicle excise
duty early to minimise the tax that they
pay.</div>
<a name="0806136000451"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0806136000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said in my opening comments, I am concerned that it will be quite
difficult for the Government properly to enforce the measure anyway,
and people will have all sorts of perfectly valid reasons that do not
come under these categories for renewing tax discs early. I do not
think that the Economic Secretary has set out the case particularly
well for going ahead with the measure. I am happy to withdraw the
amendment, but I would like to divide the Committee on clause stand
part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0806136000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000622"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> May I ask the Minister to quickly run through
the Government amendments? I can see that they possibly just tidy up
phraseology, but it would be helpful to get on the record the reason
why the Government have tabled them now, and why they were not
incorporated in the Bill when it was published.</div>
<a name="0806136000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
352 arises from my concerns about the schedule. On the face of it, it
is an anti-evasion measure that will increase the authorities&#146;
powers to remove cars that are off-road if road tax has not been paid
or if a statutory off-road notification has not been provided. I am
concerned about the extent of those powers and the absence of increased
responsibilities in the Bill for those who will exercise them. My
proposal seeks to encourage the Minister to be more prescriptive and
specific regarding the powers available to the enforcers of road tax
payment and to those who remove the
vehicles.</div><a name="0806136000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the purpose of the schedule is to catch motorists who
avoid the detection and prosecution of vehicle excise duty evasion by
keeping their unlicensed vehicles off the public road. Currently, the
licensing law applies only to vehicles kept on public roads, so the
rationale behind that change is sensible enough. It would be
interesting to know what assessment the Treasury has made of the extent
of the off-road detection-avoidance problem that it seeks to
resolve.</div><a name="0806136000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we recognise the need for local authorities and police forces to detect
vehicle excise duty evasion, amendment No. 352 would ensure that clause
139 and schedule 45 do not run the risk of producing a clampers charter
whereby over-zealous enforcement officers go beyond the spirit of the
schedule and what is intended and impinge on private property in an
entirely unacceptable way. Schedule 45 amends the definition of an
offending vehicle from one on the public road simply to &#147;a
vehicle&#148;. The schedule excludes nil licences, statutory off-road
notification vehicles and car dealerships, which seems to cover most
people who might be caught by the measure inadvertently. Nevertheless,
how much access does the Economic Secretary think enforcement officials
will have in detecting offenders&#146;
vehicles?</div><a name="0806136000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury&#146;s chosen language suggests that vehicles within the
curtilage of a dwelling or dwellings&#151;I understand that
amendments are being tabled to amend the word
&#147;dwelling&#148;&#151;are not subject to immobilisation,
removal or disposal. That is a sensible safeguard, to prevent
enforcers, clampers and people who impound vehicles from simply
strolling on to motorists&#146; driveways and impounding their
vehicles. I am concerned, however, that the powers under the schedule
are quite broad. There are legitimate off-limit areas that are not
covered by the Treasury definition, but which are covered by amendment
No. 352, thus narrowing the powers provided by the schedule. It would
be helpful to hear the Treasury&#146;s definition of
&#147;curtilage&#148; from the Economic Secretary. According to the
definition that I looked up, it is:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 702</div><a name="0806136000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
area of land occupied by a dwelling and its yard and outbuildings,
actually enclosed or considered as
enclosed.&#148;</div><a name="0806136000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to exclude private land away from a person&#146;s home. At the
moment, the schedule seems to protect people&#146;s right not to have
the authorities come on to their private property to impound a vehicle,
but it does not give rights to people who may keep their vehicle quite
legitimately further away from their property. I can certainly say, as
somebody who lives in London, that there are many people in cities who,
for all sorts of reasons to do with space, simply cannot house their
vehicle where they live, or anywhere near where they live, and may rent
private land or indeed a garage that is some way from their property.
Perhaps they have a second car, and there is no space at their
residence to keep a vehicle that is
untaxed.</div><a name="0806136000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
living on large council estates may end up parking their vehicle some
way from the block of flats that they live in. My reading of the rest
of schedule 45 suggests that the Government want to protect people with
such private property from having anyone come on to the land to impound
their cars. My concern with this schedule is not that I am worried that
enforcers will be able to impound cars of people who evade road
tax&#151;it is quite appropriate that we take action against people
who do so&#151;but that they will nevertheless have the right to go
on to private property, and they may, or may not, have a well-founded
reason for doing so. The car that they are aiming to detect and impound
may not be there when they arrive but, nevertheless, the schedule gives
people some serious powers to enter properties and areas when it is not
appropriate to do so. The schedule does not provide enough discussion
or setting-out of the increased responsibilities for authorities, which
they need if they are to have a rationale and a reasonable argument for
entering someone&#146;s private property. Property may therefore be
encroached on for erroneous reasons: the authorities may go to find a
car that they have reason to believe, or indeed did not have reason to
believe, had evaded road tax, but discover it is a different
vehicle.</div>
<a name="0806136000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting out
my argument, I want to press the Minister to tell the Committee a bit
more about the additional powers given to people enforcing the laws,
which I fully understand. I want road tax evasion to be tackled, but it
is worrying that the powers are not matched up with the due process to
be undertaken before they are exercised. Those are my concerns and I
hope the Minister will be able to address
them.</div><a name="0806136000321"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000623"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I find those questions and comments very useful
and I shall start as the hon. Member for Putney requested by outlining
the purpose behind the Government amendments, which are technical in
nature. I will then address her amendment and the broader points she
raised. Amendment No. 313 is intended to put beyond doubt the
Government&#146;s intention that the schedule should not apply to any
place within the curtilage of not only a dwelling house, but also a
mobile home or houseboat. That is because the word &#147;it&#148;
would be unequivocally inclusive of all those types of dwelling place,
whereas there is a risk that the existing drafting of &#147;the
dwelling&#148; could be incorrectly taken to mean only a dwelling
house. We hope that the hon. Lady will be able to support
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 703</div><a name="0806136000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
314 simply corrects a drafting error&#151;it is regrettable that we
have one, but a good idea to correct it. When a vehicle has been
incorrectly immobilised where a SORN is in force for it, the vehicle
will be released, but there is a discretionary condition under which
enforcement personnel can ask an individual to attest that SORN is in
effect for the vehicle. If there is a circumstance where this testimony
is sought and given, there should not be a need for the individual to
produce a testimony that they have already made, so the amendment
removes that requirement. I hope that that is
uncontroversial.</div><a name="0806136000452"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000624"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Can the Minister tell the Committee how many
vehicles have been incorrectly immobilised in the past 12 months by
enforcement
officials?</div><a name="0806136000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000625"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I hope to be able to tell her shortly.</div>
<a name="0806136000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
is right to say that amendment No. 315 is the most substantive of our
amendments. If it were not agreed to, the clause would give enforcement
personnel disjointed powers. They would have the power to immobilise a
vehicle, but they would not have the power to remove the vehicle if
immobilisation had failed to induce a response. Without the amendment,
the DVLA would be unable to deliver the policy intention as it relies
on a well established two-stage process of vehicle immobilisation and,
if required, subsequent removal, which is already practised on public
roads. It is not a change of policy but it should have been in the
original drafting.</div>
<a name="0806136000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendment No. 352, the clause offers protection against
vehicle excise duty enforcement in places that are intrinsically part
of a private dwelling. The amendment does not further define
&#147;privately owned&#148; and we feel that there are categories
of publicly accessible places that are privately owned. If the
amendment were permitted, we would not, for example, be able to enforce
on housing association roads or open land, including waste land, parks,
greens, retail facility car parks, municipal car parks and so on, which
are all privately owned yet publicly accessible. We feel that if a car
is left in a municipal car park, for example, it should be enforceable.
That is why we do not feel that the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment works.
It would not help us to achieve our aim. It would also be extremely
burdensome for the authorities and, therefore, ultimately for the
taxpayer by requiring the ownership of the land to be checked in every
eventuality when a car that does not have a tax disc is found in an odd
place.</div><a name="0806136000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000626"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> This is another example of the notion that it is
extremely burdensome for the authorities to make these checks in
advance. Surely the Government are looking at this in entirely the
wrong way. Citizens of this country have the right not to have a
privately owned motor car on private land immobilised, removed or
disposed of at the state&#146;s behest without certain safeguards.
The state should ensure that such a car should not be immobilised for a
range of different reasons or for behaving in a particular way.
Individuals should be entitled to the freedom of owning a motor car
without a set of arbitrary provisions being applied by the Revenue or
other instruments of the state according to a range of vague guidelines
and safeguards.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000627"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman is trying to make a moral point
but he is rather missing the point under discussion. We are discussing
the Government&#146;s policy&#151;I am sure that it is welcomed by
Opposition members&#151;that if a car is not used, no tax disc is
needed. The process for declaring whether a car is being used depends
on whether it is on or off the road. We are trying to define more
precisely how that policy is enforced. The hon. Member for Putney asked
some questions about our precise definition of
&#147;curtilage&#148; and about privately owned areas on which one
can park a car and consider it off-road. I am simply pointing out that
there is private land that is probably construed by any sensible person
as being on the road. It would not be sensible therefore to have
&#147;private land&#148; as our definition. We are using the word
&#147;curtilage&#148;, which I will define
shortly.</div><a name="0806136000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is perfectly reasonable that we should seek to enforce if a car is left
on land that happens to be privately owned by, for example, a company,
such as a car park. That is different from a yard outside
someone&#146;s house. That was my point.</div>
<a name="0806136000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000628"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> This is getting to the heart of the issue. None
of us has an issue about dealing with road tax evasion, but the Bill
says nothing about the duties on enforcers to request access to a
private car park, perhaps from the owner, before going on to that car
park.</div>
<a name="0806136000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
may see that as burdensome, but, given that there will be other cars
and other people&#146;s property in the car park, it does not seem
too much to ask for contact to be made before entry. I am sure that
most bona fide car park operators would be happy to co-operate in
bearing down on road tax
evasion.</div><a name="0806136000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000629"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I would be interested to know how companies such
as NCP would respond to the hon. Lady&#146;s suggestion. Such car
parks are publicly accessible. Other examples of privately owned land
that is publicly accessible include housing association land, waste
land, parks, greens and shopping centre car parks. If the hon. Lady is
suggesting that tax disc enforcement personnel should seek agreement
from the company before stepping on to such land, she is not displaying
her party&#146;s usual desire to reduce regulatory
burdens.</div><a name="0806136000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000630"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> This is a serious issue. I want to mention a
constituency case where someone went on holiday for about three months
and parked his car off-road on private land. Unfortunately, the
authorities took his car away and mashed into a metal box. He was
somewhat upset when he came back. He was more concerned about the tools
that were in the vehicle than the vehicle itself, but that is not the
point. There must be good safeguards against such things
happening.</div><a name="0806136000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000631"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising a
case on behalf of his constituent. I do not know whether he has raised
it with me in writing or with the Exchequer Secretary, but obviously we
will be happy to assist if we can. However, it is not quite the point
under discussion.</div>
<a name="0806136000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
how many vehicles currently evade vehicle excise duty by parking
off-road. The most recent figure is approximately 150,000. That is from
2005 when local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 705</div>authorities conducted a survey of unlicensed vehicles in local authority
car parks. In addition, DVLA frequently receives notification from
wheel-clamping partners informing it that unlicensed vehicles are being
parked off-road. When enforcement teams spot unlicensed vehicles in
public places they are currently unable to take action and the number
of vehicles is not recorded.</div>
<a name="0806136000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Member for Putney will realise that this is something worth
considering.</div>
<a name="0806136000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000632"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point about
public car parks. Can she clarify what she means by public areas? We
all understand the point about going into a shopping centre car park to
have a wander round and check car tax discs. That certainly happens in
my part of London as part of a public duty to ensure that untaxed
vehicles are removed and do not take up parking spaces. Is that what
she has in mind? Or does she have in mind that these powers should also
extend, for example, to officers going on to private land, perhaps farm
land, fields and all sorts of land that does not have public access per
se, in order to detect road tax evasion? Is the concept of it being
publicly accessible the key part of the schedule that gives protection
to those who have private land and might not think that it is
acceptable for other people simply to come on to their land without
permission?</div><a name="0806136000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000633"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We have got to the nub of the issue now. The
amendment suggests the inclusion of land that is &#147;privately
owned&#148;. I am simply pointing out that I do not think that that
would be workable because it would include private land that happens to
be owned by a private entity or company&#151;car parks are a good
example, and there are others. It does not follow from my rejection of
the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment that I think that law enforcement
officers should be able to trespass on private land. I hope that that
offers clarification. We feel that we can deal with evasion on large
rural estates, for example, in other ways, and there are also
exemptions for agricultural vehicles, which I will address
later.</div><a name="0806136000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked what is meant by curtilage? The definition of curtilage
is quite narrow, so I want to make a number of points about large
private estates, which I hope will clarify our intention. Some of this
might also end up being tested through case law, but our intention is
to try to make it as clear as possible. The intention is that curtilage
should apply to places that are intrinsically part of a private
dwelling, and operational guidance for enforcement personnel will
reflect that. The places should be intrinsically part of a private
dwelling, which I think answers her point. Obviously, a garage or
parking bay might be considered part of a dwelling if it is near it and
was bought and sold with the dwelling. That partially answers the point
about a garage that is owned and is part of the estate of a property
but is not completely next door to it, even if they are separated by
land or buildings not owned by the householder. I hope that that will
provide some clarity for city and town dwellers. As I said, it would
ultimately be for the courts.</div>
<a name="0806136000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Curtilage
around flats that lie beyond the public road would be treated as
follows: the approach roads will be subject to enforcement as they
would if they were part of the public road network, but parking areas
and spaces around a block of flats, for example, will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 706</div>treated as being within curtilage and therefore beyond enforcement
reach. I will be happy to consider any other specific
examples.</div>
<a name="0806136000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
the effect on the agricultural community and the question of whether it
would be possible to wheel clamp a vehicle on farm land without
permission, the measure will affect unlicensed vehicles that are parked
on agricultural land. The exception to that would be the land lying
within the cartilage or vicinity of a private dwelling that is not
normally used within that dwelling. Of course, there is already a 1.5
km distance-based nil rate for vehicles used on the land, and that
applies to any vehicle used in that way. That can include a Land Rover,
a quad bike and a four-wheel drive, light utility truck, such as a
Unimog&#151;I am learning all sorts of new things, although I do not
have one myself.</div>
<a name="0806136000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000634"></a>Justine

with only one leg, but I am assured otherwise by that
clarification.</div><a name="0806136000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000635"></a>Kitty

for
itself.</div><a name="0806136000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
agricultural and horticultural vehicles that have specific nil-rate
eligibility in existing legislation include all tractors and other
motorised agricultural implements such as mobile crop sprayers&#151;I
am going into detail to show that we are trying to draw this clearly.
Of course, vehicle keepers in the agricultural community who use their
vehicles on the land and only traverse a public road for a short
distance, as is the case when their fields are on both sides of a road,
are eligible to license their vehicles at a nil rate. I have probably
addressed the main points, so unless the hon. Lady feels that I have
missed something, perhaps I have reassured her on the points she
raised.</div><a name="0806136000453"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000638"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Clause 140 relates to rates for new
lower-emission vans. It essentially accommodates the fact that it is
now mandatory for lower-emission vans to be in the Euro 4 class and,
therefore, will no longer get a lower VED rate. However, my
understanding is that if they were registered between 1 March 2003 and
31 December 2006 and are Euro 4-compliant, they will continue to get
the reduced rate of vehicle excise duty. Vans purchased after 2009 will
not, hence my question. From the start of 2009, Euro 5 and Euro
6-compliant vehicles will get the reduced vehicle excise duty rate
until the start of 2010. Then, Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards, like Euro
4, will themselves become mandatory.</div>
<a name="0806136000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is
about vans that have been bought since 2007 and in 2008. Euro 4 vans
bought after 13 December 2006 will not, apparently, get the reduced
rate of &#163;120. It is not clear to me why the Government have
taken that approach. I understand the policy on vans bought after 2009
and onwards and the policy on low-emission vans bought before 2007, but
can the Minister clarify the rate for people who bought Euro
4-compliant vans that were or will be registered between 1 January 2007
and 31 December 2008. Will they be paying the full rate of vehicle
excise duty for light goods vehicles or will they be getting the
reduced
rate?</div><a name="0806136000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000639"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> That might have seemed mysterious to members of
the Committee who did not understand the context. For their benefit I
will explain briefly, and then come to the hon. Lady&#146;s
question.</div><a name="0806136000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause concerns rates for new low-emission vans. It provides for the
introduction of a reduced rate of VED from 1 January 2009 for diesel
vans that comply with the Euro 5 emissions standard. Although that
standard is in force, it is not yet mandatory. Consumers therefore have
a choice when selecting a new van, between models that have been built
in conformity with the current mandatory standard Euro 4 and those
built to comply with the more stringent Euro 5 emissions standard,
which had been established through an EU regulation. That regulation
gives member states the scope to use incentives to encourage early
take-up, ahead of the standard&#146;s mandatory
introduction.</div><a name="0806136000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
meet the Euro 5 emissions standard, comparatively larger emission
reductions are demanded from diesel vans than from petrol vans. That
provides the Government with the grounds for an incentive to help
deliver air quality gains&#151;compared with earlier technology
diesel vans&#151;from reduced omissions of nitrous oxides and
particulate matter. The reduced rate of VED is therefore intended to
encourage early take-up of Euro 5 compliant diesel vans, ahead of Euro
5&#146;s mandatory introduction in 2011. The reduced rate will be
&#163;120 on introduction, and will remain for the lifetime of the
van.</div><a name="0806136000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">EU
law does not allow the Euro 4 incentive after 2007, and DVLA cannot
bring in an incentive for Euro 5 before 2011. The standard only came
into force in late 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>2007, so we could not give any incentive for Euro 5 before that. I hope
that that answers the hon. Lady&#146;s
question.</div><a name="0806136000358"></a>

Greening:</b> That gives me the details that I was interested
in. However, it seems unfair that people who have in the past two years
caught on to the need to take steps against climate change and have
bought a Euro 4 van, will have to pay the standard rate, whereas those
who had already done that will still be benefiting from their
behaviour, paying the reduced rate. I understand the limits on the
Government&#146;s ability to move in that area because of European
legislation, but there seems to be inequity in the treatment of people
who have tried to do the right thing and buy a low-emitting van, but
bought it too late to get the reduced
rate.</div><a name="0806136000359"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000641"></a>Justine

because some people now use the internet to renew their road tax. It
would be interesting to hear from the Economic Secretary how many
people use that channel. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> My hon.

some
take-up.</div><a name="0806136000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise though, that when people go down that route it takes some
time for their licences to arrive in the post, particularly perhaps in
rural settings where larger areas are covered by each postal service,
or in areas where the service is not as effective as in others. In my
part of London we have had some problems with post not arriving on
time, and we know that there are postal strikes. So I understand that
the grace period takes account of the fact that people will be waiting
for their licence to arrive when they have purchased it legitimately.
Will the grace period apply to everyone? It simply suggests that there
is a grace period, full stop. It would be helpful if the Economic
Secretary clarified
that.</div><a name="0806136000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another brief
point is on the enticing free prize draw that I noticed on the home
page for people who were renewing. That explains some statistics that I
received from the Government. According to Government figures, over the
next three years Ministers expect the number of band A cars to go up by
11, from 395 to 406. Three of them can be won in this competition
because the free prize draw is for one of three brand new Seat Ibiza
Ecomotive cars, which is one of the few models that is under 100g per
km in terms of emissions. We have found three of them and I will look
for the other eight. Perhaps it is just the Government who are
purchasing these cars and that is why the figures have gone
up.</div><a name="0806136000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful

Ussher:</b> This measure is uncontentious, as the hon. Lady
implied. At present the amount of people using the electronic service
declines at the end of the month as motorists must allow five working
days for their new tax disc to arrive in the post. The clause allows
customers an exemption from the offence of not displaying a tax disc
for five working days at the start of the month. The exemption will
apply only provided that an application for a new tax disc has been
made before the expiry of the previous one. It is not a general grace
period, but is simply intended to cover all situations in which people
do not physically go to the post office to obtain their tax

a clause that my hon. Friend the Member for Putney is leading on, but
as a user of this scheme, I should say that one of the reasons why it
is difficult to take it up is that one can apply for a tax disc only
after the 15th day of the month. That causes a problem if one is away
from home. My tax disc goes to my constituency home. That is an issue
about how easy the scheme is to use. I welcome the grace period, but
could the Government allow people to apply for a new tax disc before
the 15th day of the month to encourage take-up and avoid the need for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000649"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Again, I want to ask some brief questions of the
Minister regarding the fact that coal mine methane is no longer being
considered renewable under the climate change levy. I understand that
the Government are saying that that is because the EU state aid
exemption expires in October and the incentive has not had much effect.
I want to press the Minister on why the Government feel that that has
been ineffective.</div> <a name="0806136000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of the debate in this House and outside is around the effectiveness
of green fiscal measures. When we have measures that the Government say
have been ineffective it is useful, helpful and instructive to delve
into that ineffectiveness a little more to understand why that has
happened. It is important because the exemption was put in place to
give financial incentives and assistance to coal mines. Over the past
two years, partly owing to changes in energy prices, some old coal
mines have re-opened. A good example is Hatfield colliery in South
Yorkshire. It is ironic that as coal production and coal mines are
being brought back into use the incentive to ensure that the methane
created as part of the production process is used for energy generation
is being taken away. Can the Minister briefly outline why it was felt
that this fiscal measure did not work and whether the Government are
considering other ways to tackle the environmental issue of methane in
relation to coal
production?</div><a name="0806136000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000650"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s question gets to the point.
We have been slightly mystified ourselves.</div>
<a name="0806136000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I give a bit of context? In
2003, we applied to the European Commission for state aid approval for
an exemption from the climate change levy for electricity generated
from coal mine methane. The Commission ruled that the exemption
constituted state aid but was approvable for five years under the
Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column711" />Column number: 711</div>Coal mine methane is a fossil fuel but is regarded as a renewable source
for the purposes of exemption in UK legislation.</div>
<a name="0806136000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the exemption was
to improve the rate of return on marginal coal mine methane extraction
projects, thereby encouraging the capture and generation of electricity
from the gas, mitigating emissions of methane into the atmosphere and
preserving natural gas reserves.</div>
<a name="0806136000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">We continue to recognise that
using coal mine methane in electricity generation is beneficial to the
environment. However, we have not found any evidence that the existence
of the exemption has provided incentives to use the gas to produce
electricity above what would have occurred without the exemption. We
have worked closely with the industry to explore the case for extending
the exemption but the combination of a lack of robust evidence about
its need combined with changes to the European Community guidelines on
state aid for environmental protection, under which we would obviously
be required to apply to extend the exemption, led us to conclude that
the UK would not be able to submit an application that would have
persuaded the Commission to extend the relief. That is why we have
concluded that that no longer depends on the levy exemption for its
existence, and is rather a side point to our general efforts in this
area.</div>
<a name="0806136000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000651"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Does the Minister have any assessment of the
impact on climate change levy receipts as a result of ending the
exemption?</div>
<a name="0806136000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000652"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I do not have such figures to hand, but my
presumption is that since we could find no way in which the exemption
was having a real effect on the economy, there is no marginal effect on
tax receipts either.</div>
<a name="0806136000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000653"></a>Justine

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000654"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I beg to move amendment No.
353, in
clause 145, page 89, line 21, leave
out from &#145;substitute&#146; to end of line 23 and insert
&#145;&#147;the withdrawal of approval
of&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(i) an environmental body by
the regulatory body;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(ii) the
regulatory body by the Commissioners;
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(iii) an
environmental body by the Commissioners on an occasion when the
Commissioners have assessed that serious non-compliance has occurred on
the part of an environmental
body,&#148;&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column712" />Column number: 712</div><a name="0806136000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks to put some
clarification into the Bill that is in the explanatory notes but
probably ought to be reflected in the Bill itself. It relates to the
fresh HMRC commissioners powers that the clause creates. At the moment,
the landfill communities fund is administered by Entrust, which can
both give and remove approval for environmental bodies that are part of
that fund.</div>
<a name="0806136000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
353, which I have tabled, seeks to ensure that what the explanatory
notes set out&#151;that HMRC will remove approval of an environmental
body to participate in the landfill communities fund only when there is
serious non-compliance&#151;will, in reality, be the only time that
HMRC has the use of those powers. My concern is that, at the moment,
clause 145 gives HMRC commissioners and the regulatory body, Entrust,
the power to remove approval of an environmental body that received
contributions, whereas previously Entrust performed that function
itself.</div>
<a name="0806136000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
really know what non-compliance and serious non-compliance constitute
in relation to the landfill communities fund. Can the Minister set out
some examples of where serious non-compliance has already occurred, and
whether there is a serious issue about that which the Government are
seeking to address through involving the HMRC? Does the Treasury have
some concerns perhaps that Entrust is not in a position to handle cases
of serious non-compliance? Does the Treasury nevertheless still see the
process of dealing with that starting with Entrust, which would then
refer possible cases to the Treasury, particularly HMRC? Does it see
HMRC going through a parallel scrutiny process of those environmental
bodies, in order to identify serious non-compliance for its own sake?
That would seem to be an obvious duplication of
effort.</div><a name="0806136000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some extent,
this is a probing amendment, but through it I am seeking to understand
better why the Government think that this is an issue, and to make sure
that the HMRC powers are proportionate for the occasions on which they
will be used. As I alluded to earlier, it would be helpful to hear from
the Minister how many times Entrust itself has withdrawn approval from
environmental bodies, how many instances have been identified so far of
serious non-compliance and what proportion that is of the total number
of environmental bodies that are participating in the landfill
communities fund. It would be helpful to get an idea of the breadth of
the problem that the Treasury is seeking to address with the clause.
Can the Minister confirm that the proposals have been brought forward
with the consent of Entrust and that Entrust has been fully consulted
so that it has a good understanding of how the measure will work
practically on a day-to-day basis and how practically it will be in
communication with the HMRC as and when occasions of serious
non-compliance
arise?</div><a name="0806136000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000655"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Lady raised four points. She asked: what
constitutes serious non-compliance? I will explain that shortly. What
are the numbers? How many issues have there been in practice, and have
we worked with Entrust in understanding how to implement these
rules?</div>
<a name="0806136000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may take
those in turn, the obligations of an approved body are set out in the
landfill tax regulations. This change gives the commissioners for HM
Revenue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column713" />Column number: 713</div>and Customs the power to revoke an approval if the body fails to comply
with any of those obligations. In exercising that power, however, they
will revoke the approval only if there is evidence of serious
non-compliance. Entrust is responsible for identifying and
investigating breaches of the regulations so the process is as follows.
Where in Entrust&#146;s view the alleged breach is serious, it will
report the case to the commissioners for consideration under an agreed
process. Each case will be considered by the commissioners on its
merits so there are no duplicate processes in this regard. Factors that
may be taken into account include the financial sums involved, any
previous incidents of non-compliance, the circumstances under which the
breach occurred and the potential ramifications of the
breach.</div>
<a name="0806136000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior to the change before us,
the decision on whether to revoke an environmental body&#146;s
approval for non-compliance was made by the regulatory body. Entrust
used that power on only six occasions between 1996 and 2008. I hope
that that answers the hon. Lady&#146;s question about
numbers.</div>
<a name="0806136000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are we working
with Entrust? Yes, of course we are. On the specific amendment, it
restricts the commissioners&#146; power to withdraw approval of an
environmental body to cases where there is serious non-compliance on
the part of the environmental body concerned. It is likely in most
cases, as it has been to date, that commissioners will exercise the
power to withdraw the approval of an environmental body where they
assess that serious non-compliance has occurred. However&#151;this is
the crucial point that I need to explain to the hon. Lady&#151;there
may be cases that fall outside any interpretation of serious
non-compliance but where under the circumstances it will still be
reasonable to withdraw the approval of the environmental body
concerned, for example, where there is an accumulation of a number of
minor incidents of non-compliance. That is why we would urge the hon.
Lady to withdraw her amendment because in those cases the Opposition
amendment would mean that the commissioners could not withdraw the
approval of the environmental body even though there had been serial
minor incidents of non-compliance that, added together, were taken as
sufficiently serious to warrant
action.</div><a name="0806136000401"></a>

helpful to be aware of the latter point about there being that climate
of minor non-compliance, adding up over time to an unacceptably poor
level of performance. I am pretty sure, however, when I went through
the explanatory notes that that point was not included, which is why I
tabled my amendment. With that helpful clarification, however, I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000657"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> This clause provides powers
for the Government to spend money preparing for the new form of air
tax&#151;airline pollution duty. I want to press 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 714</div>the Government on this because it is of great importance to the airline
industry and to millions of people up and down the country who use air
travel to get around and to go on holiday. Will the Minister clarify
whether the Government will be going ahead with an assumption of tax
being based on the maximum take-off weight? May I flag up to her one of
the industry&#146;s concerns, which is that, although the Government
are seeking to use this is a proxy for CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions by
flight, there are factors other than maximum take-off weight that have
an impact on emissions? Emissions depend not just on take-off weight,
but also on the speed of flight and the design of the
plane.</div>
<a name="0806136000406"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806136000658"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): One of the most
material issues is that this brings the dedicated freight sector of
aviation into a fiscal framework. I hope that, as the Government
construct the details of this review, they give careful thought to the
imperative of modernising freight fleets so that they are as
energy-efficient and noise-efficient as possible, since many of my
constituents, as well as myself, live immediately under freight
paths.</div>
<a name="0806136000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000659"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> That is an important point and brings me to
another key issue, which is uncertainty and the need to have the more
detailed proposals that the Government were planning to introduce.
Talking to the industry is vital if we are to get a thoughtful but
effective new form of air-passenger duty&#151;airline pollution
duty&#151;that will work and see CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions reduced.
Perhaps the Minister can tell me whether the Treasury is continuing to
meet representatives of the industry because I have been told by some
industry participants that they are having difficulty getting access to
Ministers in order to outline their concerns, including the issue of
freight.</div><a name="0806136000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000660"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I refer to my declaration in the Register of
Members&#146; Interests. This is a very strange clause where we are
giving powers to spend money on a duty that we know nothing about. It
is a bizarre clause and I am really rather unhappy about supporting
it.</div><a name="0806136000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000661"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Perhaps I can provide some
reassurance. A consultation paper was outlined by the Treasury and,
following that, some initial proposals were made about a how a new form
of airline pollution duty might work. Therefore, I do not have a
problem with starting to provide resources so that the Government can
bring forward some proper, detailed proposals and the definitive
proposal. If it is going to be effective, the industry needs time to
prepare. This has not been proceeded with as fast as we would have
liked and we would be grateful if the Minister could provide the
Committee with the latest timetable for what is going to happen and
when.</div> <a name="0806136000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
is on the issue of legality that has been raised in the last couple of
weeks by the American embassy. Can the Minister tell the Committee
about the Treasury&#146;s feedback on that letter from the embassy,
which said that, as far as it was concerned, this was possibly an
illegal form of duty? I understand that it should be possible, if it is
done with some care, to have a per plane charge. I sense that there is
a possibility to get at these issues, but perhaps the Minister will set
out the Treasury&#146;s formal responses to concerns raised by the
American embassy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column715" />Column number: 715</div><a name="0806136000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice it to say that we floated
this policy in our own consultation paper early last year. Obviously,
we support this mutual per plane charge, because it is a much better
structure for the tax and will bear down on CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions
from
aviation.</div><a name="0806136000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000662"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We are in a rather odd situation, because we have
to introduce paving legislation to fulfil a policy commitment, the
announcement on which has not yet been fully made. However, I shall
attempt to enlighten the Committee as far as I
can.</div><a name="0806136000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">On maximum
take-off weight, the only thing that I can say is that it is our lead
option for the aircraft measure element of the duty. We have sought an
objective, uniform measure or combination of measures of an aircraft
and/or an aircraft&#146;s flight. Maximum take-off weight has been a
reasonable proxy for emissions en route, but we are still analysing the
consultation responses. The hon. Lady rightly said that we need to work
shoulder to shoulder with industry to get the measure right. We
received more than 160 consultation responses and are considering those
at the moment. No decisions have yet been made.</div>
<a name="0806136000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the timing of the eventual
decision, we have said autumn 2008. That is currently our intention. We
want to keep working closely with industry and have met
representatives, both formally and informally on a number of occasions.
We understand that it is important that there should be as much
certainty as possible about the structure and rates of tax. We will
endeavour to decide as soon as
possible.</div><a name="0806136000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that there may be a view out there that access to Ministers
is not as great as some people would like. I shall pass that concern to
the Exchequer
Secretary.</div><a name="0806136000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000663"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am surprised that autumn 2008 is the time given.
The package travel industry has a fixed price that it includes in its
brochures, which are already published and it is prepared for autumn
2008. Normally, there is a much greater lead time for the industry.
That seems to be a rather short lead
time.</div><a name="0806136000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000664"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> That is the policy announcement date that we have
set.</div> <a name="0806136000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back to my
general point, we want completely to understand the effects on industry
as much as possible, which is why we are considering the consultation
responses in detail and why we have held a number of different forums
and tried other ways of ensuring that we understand the effect on the
industry as much as possible. It is always tricky with tax rates, which
cannot be pre-announced informally because there would immediately be a
huge public relations effect. Within those constraints, Ministers are
engaging as much as possible. That is why we have not already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column716" />Column number: 716</div>set out the design and detail of the measure. We have been consulting as
much as possible.</div><a name="0806136000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire, with support on his
general point from the Opposition, asked specifically about the freight
industry. I sympathise with his personal circumstances. It is not the
Government&#146;s intention to exclude freight or transfer passengers
from the new duty, but we are taking into account the evidence
provided.</div><a name="0806136000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000665"></a>Justine

way?</div><a name="0806136000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000666"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will, as ever, give way to the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="0806136000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000667"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> That is very kind. I am conscious of the time.
Will the announcement that will be made in the autumn cover
eco-labelling, which some carriers like Flybe are already doing? I
understand that when the Transport Committee looked at eco-labelling
earlier in the year, it broadly welcomed it. Obviously, it will give
passengers better data on the impact of noise and carbon emissions.
Just like eco-labelling on fridges, it might help the public to play
their part by making an informed choice to spend their consumer pounds
with aircraft operators who are doing their best to bear down on the
emissions caused by their
operations.</div><a name="0806136000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806136000668"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady that eco-labelling
plays an important part. It has not yet been decided whether the
announcement in the autumn will address the specific question of
eco-labelling, so I cannot tell her right here, right now, but I do
agree with her general
point.</div><a name="0806136000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Lady mentioned the US Government&#146;s response to our
consultation. As I said, we are considering all the representations
that have been made to us, but we do not think that our proposals are
illegal in any way, and that is our response to the American
Government. We are committed to our international legal obligations and
we will not do anything that we think contravenes
them.</div><a name="0806136000425"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put
