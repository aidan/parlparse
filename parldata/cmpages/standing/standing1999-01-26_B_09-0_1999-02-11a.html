<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I was responding after a lengthy debate to amendment No. 180, which would remove parts of the clause. I was trying to explain why we wanted to retain them.
<P>
Clause 13 ensures that local inquiries that are conducted on the request of the Secretary of State are procedurally consistent. The removal of subsection (4) would mean that procedural consistency between different sorts of local inquiry could not be guaranteed. Providing for the inquiry process will promote public confidence in the transparency of decisions about best value failure. Provision to direct a local inquiry is important for local accountability, and to ensure that intervention is based on clear evidence of failure. Procedural inconsistency in inquiries would undermine their effectiveness.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would require the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to consult representatives of best value authorities on the action that was considered necessary or expedient to secure compliance with part I of the Bill before issuing a direction under clause 13(2)(d). I am well aware of the importance of working with authorities and their representatives when an auditor or inspector recommends intervention by the Secretary of State. Therefore, clause 13(6) gives best value authorities the opportunity to make representations about the report that proposes the direction, and about the direction itself, before the Secretary of State or the Assembly makes a direction under the clause.
<P>
Notifying local authorities of the basis and nature of any proposed intervention and allowing them to put their case is a fair and effective method of tackling failure. The Bill provides ample opportunity for authorities to make representations about any direction under subsection (6)(d). The protocol that we circulated to members of the Committee will explain authorities' involvement in any intervention process and how the LGA or the association of police authorities might assist. Amendment No. 36 is, therefore, unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 146 is superfluous. Any direction under clause 13 will be designed to tackle an authority that has failed to secure best value. The amendment would ensure that a direction under clause 13 was issued to promote continuous improvement in the manner that an authority exercised its functions, with regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The amendment would not make a practical difference to any activity for which the clause provides. Therefore, it is unnecessary.
<P>
My hon. Friends tabled amendment No. 198, and my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) spoke to it this morning. I thank him for his measured speech, and for reminding us that he has a reputation in academia for his knowledge and understanding of local government. That was very clear this morning.
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that the Secretary of State will act, under subsection (5), in a manner that promotes the achievement of best value, and that authorities will be obliged to offer assistance only so long as the function exercised by the Secretary of State is also subject to best value criteria. The Government recogonise that that is an important concern&#151;as did the hon. Member for North Essex, who jumped on the bandwagon. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test that the Bill already provides for what he wants.
<P>
When issuing a direction under subsection (5) that he or a nominated person should exercise a function on behalf of the authority, the Secretary of State is automatically required to make arrangement to secure best value, despite not being a best value authority himself. A Secretary of State or his nominees are, in exercising a function, by definition acting to ensure that best value be secured.
<P>
The amendment suggests that the authority's obligation to provide such assitance as is required for the exercise of the specified function would be conditional on the Secretary of State acting in a manner that ensured that best value was achieved. I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that, the Secretary of State should always act to promote the achievement of best value with respect to any function that he was carrying out on behalf of an authority, and that no prudent best value authority that wanted to recover responsibility for that function would fail to assist him. That is already implicit in the Bill and I hope that my hon. Friend will no press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex):</B> Can the Minister identify the provision that the Secretary of State would breach by exercising a power under subsection (5)(a) or (b) without regard to the duty of best value? What provision binds the actions of the Secretary of State when exercising those powers?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have already made it clear that the Bill simply assumes the requirement. When exercising a function under the relevant subsection the Secretary of State is, by definition, acting to ensure that best value be secured. That is the reason for the intervention. It is therefore unnecessary to specify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I am sorry. I have answered the hon. Gentleman and we have now spent two and a half hours on this group of amendments. I need to finish my remarks about them, after which I am sure hon. Members will want to contribute further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is there to be any scrutiny of an intervention ordered by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As we discussed this morning, at this stage, there is no provision for parliamentary scrutiny of such an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Currey:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for mentioning parliamentary scrutiny, but equally an audit would be scrutiny. After all, an intervention would have been prompted by the judgment of an auditor or scrutineer that a service was not being properly provided. If that service were to be replaced by another one, would the latter be subject to an equivalent scrutiny?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I had not considered that, but I see no reason why not. The intervention would become part of the process of achieving best value in that authority. Whatever was happening would be part of its regime.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): In that case, would the scrutiny be conducted by the local authority's auditor or by the body that would be sent in in the event of failure?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman on that point. I would be interested to know how auditors dealt with some of his interventions on CCT, and what happened subsequently. CCT entailed powers of intervention similar to those in the Bill, and Conservative Members, when in government, did not think of the matter when exercising powers under previous legislation.
<P>
Government amdment Nos. 59, 60 and 61 allow for intervention in urgent cases. Government amendment No. 59 will do so by making clause 13(6) subject to new subsection (7A). Government amendment No. 60 makes clause 13(7) subject to new subsection (7A), and Government amendment No. 61 inserts new subsections (7A) and (7B) into clause 13.
<P>
Government amendment No. 60 makes provision for the Secretary of State to intervene in urgent cases, without having regard to any statement of action produced under section 9(2) of the Local Government Act 1972. Government amendment No. 61 will allow the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to exercise intervention powers under clause 13 in urgent cases to address serious and persistent failure by an authority.
<P>
The White Paper, ``Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People'', made it clear that effective intervention will normally involve working with authorities and giving them the opportunity to make the improvements deemed necesary themselves. However, in some cases, failure may be so severe or persistent&#151;or the risks to local people so great&#151;that immediate action is justified. If there is evidence of serious harm to vulnerable groups, and the authority is unwilling or unable to act sufficiently quickly to protect them, the Secretary of State must retain the discretion to act quickly. Hon. Members will note that the draft protocol illustrates the type of circumstances which might justify urgent intervention.
<P>
New subsection (7A) allows the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to give a direction without complying with clause 13(6) or (7), if he considers such a direction to be sufficiently urgent. That means that the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly can issue a direction under clause 13 without giving the authority concerned the opportunity to make representations about the direction proposed or the report&#151;if one is produced&#151;as a result of which intervention is proposed. The Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly will also be able to issue a direction under clause 13 without having regard to any statement of action produced under section 9(2) of the Local Government Act 1972.
<P>
Under new subsection (7B), the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly will be required to tell the authority concerned and those representing best value authorities of any direction that does not comply with clause 13(6) or (7) and the reason why that direction was given without such compliance.
<P>
Some amendments in this group deal with inquiries, and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) raised that matter earlier. So it might be helpful if I said a little more about that. When the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) asked about democratic accountability, she seemed to imply that all intervention powers would automatically bypass local people. I assure the Committee that that is not necessarily so, although I accept that urgent intervention would do so. But section 250 of the Local Government Act 1972 gives the Secretary of State power to direct an inquiry. He has power to appoint someone to hold it and his appointee can then direct people to give evidence. Costs are met by either the authority or a third party, as the Secretary of State directs. In this context, inquiries will be used where it appears necessary to ascertain local people's views. It may be that consultations under the best value framework have already provided sufficient indication of local people's wishes and aspirations, but inquiries could be used to determine whether the clause 13(5) powers should be exercised. We are certainly not ruling out that possibility.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> What are the corresponding provisions for police authorities, given that the legislation does not apply to them? I am mindful of the Minister's earlier comment about police authorities and chief constables being different things, but, having said that, many best value queries, based on what she described as clear evidence, might well concern operational matters. I should be interested to hear about the corresponding provisions for police authorities.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman. I do not assume that I have understood totally the Home Secretary's powers in the matter so I shall make sure that I write to him.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex gave us an interesting lecture on mandamus. I thought that I would let the Committee know how it is used in legislation. Mandamus is a provision for recourse of the last resort if an authority fails to comply with a direction. This has always been so, irrespective of whether there is a specific provision in primary legislation. We have simply ensured that it is in primary legislation so that people such as the hon. Gentleman can make us aware of their knowledge and understanding of Latin.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked about Burnley. The direction against Burnley has been varied, not withdrawn, to allow six months longer for retendering. If he consults his right hon. and hon. Friends who were previously Ministers in the Department, they will tell him that that is not unusual, that Ministers have always exercised discretion where circumstances suggest that it is appropriate. They did so on several occasions. We shall use the powers with discretion, listening to and being aware of local circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Both my right hon. and Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I asked what was referred to as the Stalingrad, or Vietnam, question, and I may have missed the answer as I had to leave early to go to Prayers. How does the Secretary of State or the Assembly, having become embroiled in a difficult situation, extract himself, or itself, from it, and what will happen to agencies, and people who work for them, if they are made redundant by intervention?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I answered that question this morning. Exit strategies in all such circumstances have to be well planned and worked out. Part of the team's job in intervention&#151;which we agreed this morning would happen only in rare circumstances&#151;would be to ensure capacity building, so that the work force and the local management would be able to pick up the pieces again and work effectively once the period of intervention was over. The Secretary of State will have to state the period of intervention when intervention powers are exercised.
<P>
We have had a full debate on the clause. I should like to hear whether Opposition Members feel that, in all justification, they wish to vote against the Secretary of State being able to intervene. After we had gone round all the possibilities this morning, I felt that was a recognition that there may be some circumstances&#151;we all hope that they will never happen&#151;in which such powers of intervention may be necessary, and having a proper legal framework for intervention is important. It is also proper for the Committee thoroughly to examine what such intervention means. Our provision of the draft protocol demonstrates that, far from wanting to use the powers in either a Cromwellian or a Cavalier manner, we seek to use them fairly.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> There is a fair understanding of motive and thinking but some of us are worried about the length of time. Having experienced compulsory and voluntary competitive tendering in my previous life, I know that time can sometimes be of the essence. It is all very well talking about inquiries and interventions, but what would happen if, during an inquiry into a local authority, the work force went on strike? Would the public be left without services, or would the Secretary of State intervene promptly, disregard all public inquiries and other shenanigans, and perhaps allow the private sector to provide the service?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have already made it clear that any utilisation of powers of intervention will have to have regard to particular circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is asking such a hypothetical question that it is impossible to answer it. If a group of workers with no relationship to the direct delivery of the service took strike action, that would be different from the core group of workers responsible for that delivery taking such action. It would also depend on what service was involved.
<P>
I appreciate how hard the hon. Gentleman is striving to be helpful, but I have to say that he is not succeeding. We cannot determine in Committee precisely what would happen to every service in every circumstance, or exactly how long the time scale should be. We would have to judge the problem at the time it arose, take account of public consultation&#151;as expressed in the performance plan, for example&#151;and take appropriate action.
<P>
It would be irresponsible for me to specify that action should always be within three months, 12 months or whatever. Different services and different problems would, as I say, require a different response. The important point is that, in taking action, the Secretary of State is seen to be fair and to be operating within criteria that are clear to all, but especially clear to the particular authority.
<P>
I hope that, after some of the confusion expressed this morning, Opposition Members have had time to reflect and recognise that the clause is neither draconian nor a soft touch, as suggested by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford). The clause is measured and reasonable, and it will ensure that when matters go wrong and an authority has been unable or unwilling to put them right, the Secretary of State can intervene on behalf of local citizens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that I can briefly invite the Minister to address some points. She has striven&#151;I was going to say manfully, but had better say womanfully&#151;to give us a great deal of information, and the Committee is extremely appreciative.
<P>
I make no apology for our expressing anxiety about the powers that the Secretary of State will receive under the clause, even though we see the attraction in being able to clobber inefficient local authorities in a way that they have never been clobbered before. That is not the sort of language that we are meant to use about best value, but that implication is there. The Minister has assured us that she hopes that the clause will be a last-resort clause, to be used only in a handful of cases, and I find that comforting.
<P>
We have also learnt that the clause provides for compulsory competitive tendering to continue. By the Minister's own admission, there are parallels with CCT in subsection (2), but the compulsory competitive tendering powers were found wanting, to use her words. That confirms that these are wider and more extensive powers than CCT, but it is an attraction for us that, under the clause, CCT can continue.
<P>
I have received a fax from the Public Contractors Association, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The position of the PCA is that these clauses''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
referring to this one in particular&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``will act as the noose which focuses the mind of the handful of councils who flagrantly ignore competition in favour of self-interest.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an advertisement for the clause. However, we still have problems with it. The Minister failed to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test on amendment No. 198. When I asked her to point to the provision that binds the Secretary of State's use of the power into that particular&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If it is in the Bill, what is the chapter and verse? It is no good saying ``the Bible says,'' unless one can point to the chapter and verse. The Bill will be the Bible.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was never a fundamentalist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady makes a very ineresting submission: she was never a fundamentalist. That may be reflected in the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> My hon. Friend has made appropriate reference today to the 17th century. I hope that he will agree that the problem with the divine right of kings was that there was no chapter and verse in the Bible to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall not be drawn on that point. I think that the point makes itself.
<P>
	I do not think that the Minister has answered the hon. Member for Southampton, Test sufficiently. I place the Committee on notice that we would be inclined to support the hon. Gentleman's amendment, if he chose not to withdraw it. I hope that he will let us know whether he is happy to be brushed off, or whether he thinks that the Committee should have the opportunity to express a view on the amendment.
<P>
	Regarding the question of intervention, there was a great deal of discussion about how an alternative private contractor might be brought into the process. That raises the question of how the Secretary of State might choose a private company to take over a function. Would there be a competitive tendering process? What would happen if staff were sacked as a result of bringing in an outside contractor? Would the transfer of undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 apply? would the Secretary of State's preferred bidder have to take&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Armstong:</B> The TUPE provisions mean that people have to be transferred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not think that the Minister understands my point. She has said that if there is a failing service in a local authority, and the Secretary of State cannot persuade, by exhortation, that local authority to do something about that failing service, the Secretary of State may, under the clause, bring in an outside contractor. If that contractor comes in, what happens to the people working in the existing service? It is not all their fault. If they are to be sacked or made redundant, what would happen to their terms and conditions of employment? Would there be an obligation to the new contractor taking over the service to take them over? That is a legitimate concern.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I answered that this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, the Minister did not answer that this morning; we are still waiting for an answer as to whether the TUPE provisions will apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I promise not to mention the Bible or the 17th century.
<P>
I strongly support my hon. Friend's argument. The Minister made clear that following an authority's breach of best value there would be an investigation into who was worthy of employment and who was&#151;I use the term loosley&#151;found guilty during such an investigation. However, she did not make clear whether the existing authority staff would be kept in employment and paid accordingly&#151;which would effectively mean the authority paying double. Surely we need clarification on what would happen to those people, how they would be remunerated and the financial consequences for the authority concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am anxious to short-circuit the debate. Will the Minister just say yes or no to the question of whether, if a private contractor is manoevred into a local authority and takes over a particular function, the TUPE rules will apply?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I made it clear this morning, but the Opposition had enormous trouble in paying attention because they had such division in their ranks that they frequently broke off to have private conversations. The hon. Gentleman might well not have heard me talking about that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that the Minister has just been given the answer.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. What I said this morning and what I say again is that in most cases we would simply not expect the majority of the work force to lose their jobs or for any other eventuality to occur. We shall discuss the TUPE arrangements later in the Bill, but it is not for me to say when they would or would not apply. They will be revised to update the directive, which will shortly be published by the Department of Trade and Industry and which will deal with those issues.
<P>
It would of course be proper for the Secretary of State to seek tenders for any external contractor. The nature of what is understood as a transfer under TUPE depends on whether the jobs are transferred and on whether a contractor would be using the same skills, and so on. My feeling is, as I said this morning, that the majority of the work force would not be displaced by an intervention, while I can envisage circumstances in which most of them would and they would lose their jobs. In those circumstances, TUPE would of course not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was an extraordinary answer. The Minister played a blinder, as it is called&#151;but it failed to blind me. She was clutching a piece of paper given to her by civil servants and we still did not get a straight yes or no from her.
<P>
I remember the days when the party that is now in government used to lecture the then Government that TUPE should apply on every occasion. They used the argument about TUPE to try and wreck the whole process of competitive tendering. Now that they are in government, they have changed their tune. Their approach is surprising; one cannot get a straight answer out of the Minister as to whether she thinks that people working in a local authority service should have their terms and conditions of employment protected. However, the length of her intervention was generous and there is no point in pressing her further.
<P>
The real failure of the clause, which will lead us to vote against it, is the Minister's admission that, although the Audit Commission report might be the main source of evidence to provide a pretext for intervention, it could be other evidence. She said that evidence of failure may emerge from other sources. We might, therefore, be dealing with hearsay evidence, or, perhaps, public complaints that result in a public campaign for the Secretary of State to intervene. Where is the legal precision in such a case?
<P>
The Minister wants to add amendments to the clause, so that after a swift but effective public campaign, the Secretary of State could, in extremis, intervene without consultation, redress or argument on the part of the authority. She refers to the protocol negotiated with the LGA, which has no legal status and provides no protection but is purely a plea from local authorities that the powers be exercised in a certain way. However, in such circumstances, local authorities would be at the mercy of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that in circumstances such as I described this morning, the Secretary of State should not have the legal powers to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In many circumstances&#151;in certain extreme cases&#151;the Secretary of State has the power to intervene. The Minister says that the Secretary of State needs more powers, but we are complaining about the unspecificity of the provisions, not the particular circumstances in which the Secretary of State may intervene. We are complaining about the unrestrained nature of the powers, which could, perhaps, be exercised, in the Minister's view, capriciously, by a Conservative Secretary of State. I am sure that had a Conservative Secretary of State attempted to exercise the powers when we were in government, the Labour party would have been up in arms. The hon. Lady cannot get away from that.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is sometimes rather difficult to predict from where complaints about local authority performance will come? For example, a GP not far from here noticed an unusual number of houses being boarded up, and made considerable efforts to persuade the Conservative Government to intervene to ensure that the local council exercised its housing functions properly. I refer, of course, to Westminster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It was not difficult to guess, because only one Conservative-controlled authority has been involved in a serious financial scandal. We have a list of 114 local authorities, all Labour-controlled, that are subject to some kind of investigation for sleaze. When it comes to throwing muck, we have bucketfuls compared to the hon. Lady. What is more, the cases to which we can refer have all taken place since the general election, while the only case to which she can refer took place about 12 years ago. That is rather a sterile way to conduct the debate. We have done rather well at avoiding such slagging off, if that is not unparliamentary language. We would do better to stick to the substance of the Bill.
<P>
The breadth of the powers is ultimately reliant only on the assurances that this particular Minister can give to this particular Committee about a protocol that may change even before the ink is dry on the signatures. That is our fundamental problem with the clause. We would vote on amendment No. 179 if we had the opportunity, in order to make the point, and should like to vote on amendment No. 181, because that power should be subject to a direction from both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): I am glad to have the opportunity to state whether I should like to press amendment No. 198 to a vote.
<P>
An interesting philosophical problem has arisen about whether the Bible exists as an entity separate from its contents. My hon. Friend the Minister suggested an analogy with the Bill, whereby the Bill as a whole can be inferred to be the appropriate mechanism for ensuring best value. The Secretary of State could not therefore act contrary to its provisions were he to intervene. The answer to the philosophical conundrum is that the Bible does exist separately. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister has put it on record that it would be difficult to conceive of her acting outside the overall scope of the Bill were she to intervene. Under those circumstances, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I am so disappointed at the hon. Gentleman's remarks. If he had ever been on the Opposition Benches, he would not accept the Secretary of State's saying that the circumstances were inconceivable. If one were able to line up all the politicians who said that they could not ``conceive of any circumstance'', they would form a very long line.
<P>
Best value seems to be a series of sticks with which to clobber local government. As someone with a degree in psychology, I can tell the Committee that it is poor practice to use sticks but no carrots. I see no carrots in the Bill. Clause 13 is the biggest stick of all: it gives open-ended powers to the Secretary of State to make local authorities take any action that is deemed to be necessary.
<P>
It seems that the Secretary of State and the Welsh Assembly are to be imbued with the god-like power to make judgments on local services&#151;judgments that are miraculously better informed and more legitimate than the judgments of locally elected councillors or the local population. Those powers are designed so that a Labour Secretary of State can step in and take control over Labour councils. The Conservative party claims to have a list of 114 Labour-controlled councils that have been up to all sorts of terrible things, and the Government cite Westminster city council. I am glad to say that, so far, no one has used a Liberal Democrat council as an example.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Will the hon. Lady give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I say that to prove that we are not frightened that Liberal Democrat councils might be subject to those draconian powers.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I shall mention only one such council&#151;Barnet, which is a Lib-Lab council.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I suggested that no one would mention a Liberal Democrat council. I said nothing about a joint administration.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> What about Liverpool?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Liverpool has been controlled by the Liberal Democrats for only one year, and it has been doing the job very well. I am sure that Liberal Democrat control will be even stronger after May, because people like what they are getting. I can advise Labour Members that the best way to take over a Conservative council is not to send in a Labour Secretary of State but to beat the Conservatives at the ballot box. As my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) said, the way to ensure that there are no single-party councils is to have a proportional voting system for local government.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I may be jumping the gun, but innumerable directions on competitive tendering have been made against Liberal Democrat councils, not least in Colchester.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): And Harrogate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend suggests Harrogate. Is Cheltenham another? What about highways, sewers and buildings maintenance? The Liberal Democrats do not have an unblemished record. I hope that best value will also reach Liberal Democrat authorities. The previous Government thought that competitive tendering was necessary for the whole of local government&#151;not necessarily for partisan advantage.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The examples cited were not examples of a failure to comply with directions on CCT, but examples of corruption and sleaze.
<P>
We shall press amendments Nos. 96 and 97 to Divisions. Amendment No. 96 would remove the ``hit-squad'' subsection (5), which would enable the Secretary of State to take over a function or to nominate someone to take over a function. We have already had a long debate on that subject. I wonder what would happen if a Government Department was failing in exercising a function&#151;if, for instance, a computer system was failing to make pension payments. Who would take it over? Why should only local government be subject to someone taking over functions that are deemed to be failing? Why should no one take over the Government's functions? Perhaps we should look at Government practices before we start clobbering local government. I cannot believe that Labour Members, many of whom have years of experience in local government, genuinely want subsection (5). The amendment will give them the opportunity to vote against it.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that she envisaged these powers being used very rarely. If that is the case, the Government could come to Parliament for a specific authority. They do not need to have the order of mandamus; it could be replaced with a statutory instrument procedure. There would be parliamentary scrutiny on the few occasions&#151;we are told&#151;that the powers will be used, just as there is parliamentary scrutiny of reserve capping powers.
<P>
I know that there will be soul searching on the Labour Benches&#151;one hon. Member is going out already to search her soul over the clause. I am sure that the Whip will frown if Labour Members vote against the clause, although I know that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) is a reasonable Whip. It would not create an earthquake if Labour Members were to vote for amendments Nos. 96 and 97.
<P>
I had time in the recess to read an excellent book, which I recommend to every Labour Member if they have not done so already. I am referring, of course, to ``Reinventing Democracy'' by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North. I shall quote a couple of sentences from the book, the first of which is in page 55. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we should stake a claim for nothing less than constitutionally independent local government for the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thoroughly agree with that. The second quotation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We need to put local independence beyond the reach of central government and to admit that the `man in Whitehall' does not know best, even if he is a Labour man. Petty interference from centre must be denied any legal or financial basis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government Whip and his hon. Friends should take this opportunity to deny more interference by voting for amendments Nos. 96 and 97. Because I am an optimist, I am sure that they will rise to that challenge. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
We have had the roundheads, the puritans, the cavaliers and we have now reached the Henry VIII clause. Liberal Democrats are naturally sceptical about it. It grants the Secretary of State powers to alter primary legislation, subject to a vote in Parliament. However, its intentions are generally benevolent. We broadly accept the belief of the Local Government Association that the purpose behind clause 14 is to allow for innovative new partnership provisions in the manner stated in paragraph 7.28 of the White Paper.
<P>
New powers might include partnership vehicles and pooled budgets. We like pooled budgets; they are important for meeting community needs. As we are aware, a problem can arise when there is no money in the appropriate budget to meet it or there may be situations in which expenditure by one agency or department will save money for another. Therefore, there is no incentive for that expenditure to be made, so the pooling of resources is critical to addressing many problems that go well beyond those of local government. I think it is the first time that the idea of pooling resources has been in a Bill, and the Liberal Democrats genuinely welcome that.
<P>
New powers might include pooled budgets and, for example, the integration of health and social services. Pioneering work is already going on in local government, such as the mental health services in Liberal Democrat-controlled Somerset. We welcome the mechanisms that will make such work easier. However, we are unsure&#151;as are some local authorities&#151;about the extent of the power. For example, will it enable local authorities to become energy supplying companies? Some authorities are keen to explore that and have received assurances from the Government that they can, but legal advice suggests that that may not be the case. Others are worried that the Secretary of State may sit on his or her hands and fail to use the power.
<P>
As we have said, we would like to see a power of general competence for local authorities. However, for some reason, the Government have not seen fit to include that power or their duty to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of an area. The amendment seeks to turn the clause into an enabling clause that would give a best value authority the chance to take the initiative. If the authority found its path obstructed by legislation, it would be able to initiate the process of modifying it.
<P>
The Committee should note that the mechanism allows for proper scrutiny by the House, and could be combined with scrutiny by a Select Committee, which could form a proper view on how much legislation is obstructing the course of powerful local government. In the debate, we would therefore like to hear clarification from Ministers about how the legislation will work. Do they expect to see strong local government actively seeking new and innovative ways of working, or, as we suspect, is the legislation merely another mechanism for central control?

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Last night, I distributed a further explanation of clauses to expand on the previous information that members of the Committee have had. I did so because I accept that the clauses are unusual. They deal with areas that are vital to enable authorities to find innovative solutions and ways of working so that they can improve their service delivery. I hope that hon. Members have had a chance to look at the document that we circulated, because it clarifies what the Government are seeking to do.
<P>
As I have said, the introduction of best value is part of our commitment to achieving better and simpler government, and the right tools have to be in place to accomplish that. Best value is one such tool. We think that best value will be attained by authorities carrying out their functions in a variety of ways, either by themselves or by working in partnership with other agencies or the private and voluntary sectors, or by delegating functions to another agency where appropriate.
<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is not here. I was going to tell him how authorities working effectively together with the voluntary sector are able, for example, to deliver services for children and young people leaving care. Given that he is so frightened of anybody from outside delivering social work services, I thought that he might like to hear of some places where it is already working well.
<P>
Clause 14 will enable the Secretary of State to amend or exclude the application of existing legislation to best value authorities where it prevents them from achieving best value. The clause enacts new legislation where authorities need new powers to achieve best value. We do not think it right to state precisely what authorities should or should not do, or what they might be able to do, but which at the moment they simply do not have the powers to do. We think that that is the best way of ensuring that&#151;

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We think that this is the best way to ensure that a full range of options is available to local authorities when they assess the most appropriate way to deliver best value. We want to encourage innovation, a wider variety of service delivery vehicles and the development of more imaginative and intelligent procurement skills, so that authorities are not restricted unnecessarily as to how they procure best value. That will help to achieve joined-up service delivery by enabling easier working access across organisational boundaries.
<P>
We have identified four clear areas where the clause will help local authorities to achieve best value: the pooling of resources between best value authorities and other public agencies; the regularisation of powers in respect of partnership vehicles, especially local authority companies; the clarification of the circumstances in which local authorities can provide goods and services to others; and in making better use of local authority assets.
<P>
However, it is not appropriate to have a series of provisions that allows the Secretary of State to prescribe every detail of each partnership arrangement. It is better that the provisions are very broadly drawn. That will give wide scope either in the provision of additional powers to authorities or in the removal of statutory obstacles to closer partnerships so that local authorities can deliver best value more successfully. That flexibility will permit innovative and imaginative approaches and assist learning from experience as partnerships develop.
<P>
Earlier regimes sought too great a degree of prescription in the relationships between local authorities and others, with too much reliance on detailed procedures and contractual relationships. Experience has shown that such an approach can work against the effective and efficient delivery of services. Research has shown that excessive management of process is inflexible, inhibits joint working and slows the growth of integrated work.
<P>
Opposition Members might remember a practical example of the point that I am making. In their attempt to provide local authorities with guidance on the avoidance of anti-competitive behaviour, the previous Government sought to identify in detail every possible circumstance in which it might arise. That guidance was undermined as authorities identified new scenarios and problems that had not been anticipated or catered for.
<P>
We are determined not to create such a climate of uncertainty or a framework that cannot evolve to take account of change and innovation. It is clear that local authorities are frustrated by the way the law works; it often seems to prevent the most appropriate arrangements being set up with those in the public sector as well as the private and voluntary sectors.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I accept the thrust of what the Minister says&#151;in fact, it was reflected in the changes that the previous Government introduced. However, she might be concerned about other matters. She has mentioned local authority companies. One of the difficulties that the previous Government did not sort out&#151;she might like to express an opinion about that&#151;involves local authority guarantees to local authority companies.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am sorry to take so long before replying, Mr. O'Brien. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to go on.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I do not go on.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I accept that the position on companies is tricky and has to be handled with great care and consideration. We intend to consider possible changes which would clarify powers to form companies. That is also something that I intended to say in response to the hon. Member for Torbay. At this stage I cannot give any undertaking in respect of energy companies. We are considering the implications as well as how they would be regulated and the role of public money in all that. I hope that we can consider that and come back at a future date.
<P>
The clause is bound by a series of strict provisions in terms of parliamentary scrutiny in future clauses. However, authorities frequently feel frustrated by the operation of the law. The law does not seem to recognise that a partnership can take many forms, from contractual arrangements to joint working through specifically set up companies such as the hon. Member for Mole Valley implied.
<P>
The incomplete nature of the powers and the contentious legal issues about the circumstances in which local authorities can rely on them has created a climate of uncertainty. Conflicting legal opinion has caused many local authorities to adopt a conservative approach and shy away from partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors. Those who venture into innovative arrangements from the public or private sectors constantly run the risk of legal challenge. There is a need for flexibility and that underlines our approach to clause 14.
<P>
We all recognise that this clause would provide the Secretary of State with significant powers but this is not a new approach, as the principle of amending primary legislation through the use of secondary legislation was adopted in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. When that Act was going through Parliament various fears were expressed. There was concern about the ease with which Ministers would be able to set aside Acts of Parliament by statutory instrument and a fear that it would be left to judges to decide Parliament's intentions. There was also concern about who would be consulted and general apprehension that the normal procedures for introducing new or amending legislation were not being followed.
<P>
Those fears have not been borne out in practice. Over the past five years we have seen that the robust procedures for consultation, reporting on the results of consultation and full debate in both Houses, all act as strong controls over the way the Secretary of State handles legislative changes.
<P>
Consequently, we consider that the powers granted to the Secretary of State by clause 14 will be used to achieve the objectives of partnership working. The process by which the Secretary of State grants or changes local authorities' powers will be subject to the checks described in clause 15. The successful way secondary legislation has been enacted under the 1994 Act shows that these sorts of checks are indeed effective.
<P>
	The power to make orders which have an effect in relation to Wales will be exercised by the Secretary of State for Wales. That is because we do not think it appropriate to confer these powers on the National Assembly for Wales. Of course, where the Secretary of State for Wales exercises his powers under clause 14, there will be full consultation with the Assembly, as required in clause 22.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 would remove some of the flexibility of the Bill in terms of the Secretary of State's power to make orders under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. The Minister seems to have gone on to the next amendment, which has not been moved, although we understand why she may have made that mistake.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
Amendment No. 193 would remove the Secretary of State's discretion in exercising the power. Decisions about the use of legislative powers should be taken by, and at the discretion of, the Secretary of State rather than by best value authorities. In addition, the amendment could lead to ad hoc legislative proposals being introduced, with subsequent confusion and uncertainty about the precise state of the law. It also implies that authorities could act on an individual basis. However, the amendment is flawed because the legislative process should not change the law in respect of individual authorities. That is why subsection (3) is so drafted.
<P>
Subsection 14(3)(d) allows orders under this proposal to make different provisions for different cases. It allows the Secretary of State to vary the way in which the power would apply to a particular type or case of authority, which will permit a more efficient and effective use of that power in respect of those authorities. It needs to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis; for example, factors such as a particular organisational framework or the objectives, nature, size and location of an authority may require a particular power to be designed or modified to suit. For example, powers might need to be modified to take account of differences between inland and coastal local authorities.
<P>
The amendment does not seem to take into account the process of consultation which the Government will go through before proposals for orders amending or disapplying legislation are laid before Parliament. All interested parties, including local authorities and their representative organisations, will be consulted on proposals for amending legislation.
<P>
Local authorities that consider that they are hampered in achieving best value will be able to comment on the Secretary of State's proposals. They will also be able to make representations to Parliament about the effect of the proposals if they do not think that the Secretary of State has sufficiently addressed their concern. The Secretary of State will have to report to Parliament what account he has taken of those representations when framing the secondary legislation. We therefore consider the legislative process enables all concerned to participate fully and to consider the proposals in their full context. With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Torbay will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I thank the Minister for her lengthy response and for clarifying the proposal, which is what we sought.
<P>
It is bizarre that in order to free local government, power has to be centralised, which is the effect of this and other clauses. So much rests on the trust that we confer on the Secretary of State of the day. We have protested against this Henry VIII clause because we fear what could happen in different circumstances. We need to watch carefully how the Secretary of State interprets the Bill when it is enacted.
<P>
I want to thank the Minister for her comments on energy companies. No doubt we will return to the matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 11, leave out line 9.
<P>
This is a probing amendment designed to clarify the Government's intentions as to how clause 14 will be used. It touches on the issue of beacon councils and, in particular, the second phase of that scheme. It would seem that subsection (3)(d) is the paving legislation&#151;or similar&#151;in that respect.
<P>
We are generally keen on initiatives that extend greater powers to local government. However, we have several worries about the clause and the beacon council proposals. In both contexts it is essential that any discretion be used on a non-partisan basis. If that were not to happen, the scheme would be the worst type of cronyism and would deserve all the opposition that it would get. In any case, we should rather that the Government entrusted local government with the freedoms on a universal basis.
<P>
We recognise that for beacon councils, and in the context of the wider objective of giving councils greater freedom to do what they need to do, the provision will be more than welcome. However, it would not be right for the Committee to proceed with it without at least gaining some reassurance that the Government would use the powers in the interest of all the differing local authorities, with their varying political compositions.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the powers to which the amendment relates would&#151;as I explained earlier&#151;apply to types of authority. I remind him that no legislation yet exists for beacon authorities, and that the House has therefore not decided what powers should exist in relation to them.
<P>
Clause 14(3)(d) is intended to make it clear that the Secretary of State would have to take account of features of an authority, rather than his view of it. Some types of authority might have features in common, to which a particular sort of partnership, joint venture company or other vehicle that could be the subject of secondary legislation would be especially applicable. I assume the hon. Gentleman that the powers would have to be exercised very carefully in each case. The Bill allows account to be taken of authorities' possible need for the design or modification of a power to suit their organisational framework, objectives or circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> On the question of features, the papers that arrived last night were extremely useful in setting out some of the purposes and probable uses of clause 14. Will the Minister define more clearly what she means by features? Might they be demographic and geographical as well as functional features?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I gave an example earlier, but I shall give another. A feature specific to coastal towns might lead us to make an order pertaining to such towns. They might want to improve their sea defences, for example. It is as innocent as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I happily beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

While we discussed the provision, which is termed a Henry VIII clause, I thought of ship money, which was a prerogative power of a Government&#151;King Charles I devised the provision&#151;to tax people who lived in coastal towns in order to fund the Navy. I am sure that the Government do not propose to do that, and that the clause is incorporated with the best intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The point about ship money is that it was used by an arbitrary central Government to levy a tax on inland towns, which had no interest in ships or the Navy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I stand corrected. [Interruption.] Government Members are easily amused. I am delighted to provide them with a little light relief.
<P>
The House of Lords Select Committee on the Scrutiny of Delegated Powers define a Henry VIII clause as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a provision which enables primary legislation to be amended or repealed by subordinate legislation with or without further Parliamentary scrutiny.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is an exceptional legislative device. The 1932 Donoughmore Committee studied the phenomenon. Henry VIII clauses have existed for far longer than I imagined&#151;[Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) will listen, I can inform her that section 80 of the Local Government Act 1894 is the first instance of a Henry VIII clause in a parliamentary statute. That provision gave county councils the power to amend primary statute. Therefore, the Minister was wrong to object to amendment No. 193 on the grounds that the power had to reside with the Secretary of State because of precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> That is in stark contrast to the Conservative Administration of 1888, which gave county councils the democratic legitimacy that we discussed earlier. The legislation that my hon. Friend mentioned was introduced by a Liberal Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is not that ironic? How times change!
<P>
I recommend to the Committee the Library brief of 28 January 1994 on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, on which the clause is based. It quotes the Donoughmore Committee, which concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The `Henry VIII clause' should
<P>
(a) never be used except for the sole purpose of bringing an Act into operation;
<P>
(b) be subject to a time limit of one year from the passing of the Act.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The opening sections of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, which we introduced were controversial because they went beyond that purpose. Their purpose is not to bring the Act into operation; they are about the primary aim of the Act. There is no time limit on them. Is clause 14 parallel to those opening provisions of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994? The Library brief and the explanatory notes state that the clause is inspired by that legislation.
<P>
I wish to draw the Committee's attention to differences between two sections in the 1994 Act and two clauses in the Bill. First, section 1(1) of the Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If, with respect to any provision made by an enactment, a Minister of the Crown is of the opinion&#151;
<P>
(a) that the effect of the provision is to impose, or authorise or require the imposition of, a burden affecting any person in the carrying on of a trade, business or profession or otherwise, and''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>it continues. It specifies the fundamental qualification for using the Henry VIII power in the Act. It is about removing obstacles on businesses and increasing the liberty of the citizen on the principle that the more statute, the more inhibition of liberty&#151;and it is the job of Parliament to protect liberty. That Henry VIII section can, albeit uncomfortably, be justified.
<P>
However, clause 14(1) of the Bill starts:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the Secretary of State thinks that an enactment prevents or obstructs compliance by best value authorities with the requirements of this Part''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, as we debated earlier, the requirements of this part&#151;particularly the duties under clause 3(1)&#151;are vague and subjective. Whereas the provision in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 is clearly a one-way street, it is more subjective in the Bill.
<P>
Furthermore, where the 1994 Act is about removing inhibitions on people, businesses and organisations outside the ambit of the state, the Bill is about enabling the Secretary of State or local authorities to do something&#151;thus conferring power on the state in order for authorities to expand their powers, which is very different.
<P>
The 1994 Act, under section 1(1)(b), makes it clear:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by amending or repealing the enactment concerned and, where appropriate, by making such other provision as is referred to in subsection (4)(a) below, it would be possible, without removing any necessary protection, to remove or reduce the burden or, as the case may be, the authorisation or requirement by virtue of which the burden may be imposed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But there is no such qualification in the exercise of the powers in the Bill. If, by exercising the power in the clause, a protection to an individual is removed, there is no constraint on the Secretary of State.
<P>
We could argue at length about the parallels, but the real entertainment from this clause derives from what the official Opposition of 1994 said about our Henry VIII clause which, as I told the Committee, was of a gentler variety than the clause in this Bill. I quote the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill 1994:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Opposition are worried that what makes the Bill notable is not the extent to which it cuts through red tape but the extent to which it cuts through the procedures of Parliament.''&#151;[Official Report, 8 February 1994; Vol. 237, c. 156-7.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see the Minister nodding in assent: perhaps she will nod consent in connection with her own Bill. The right hon. Member for Livingston continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Let us be clear what those four clauses propose. They propose that Ministers may be able to set aside Acts of Parliament by statutory instruments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those clauses, according to the right hon. Gentleman, are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``termed Henry VIII clauses in disrespectful commemoration of that monarch's tendency to absolutism. They have, of course, become increasingly common under this Government, as we would expect, given their tendency to absolutism.''&#151;[Official Report, 8 February 1994; Vol. 237, c. 157.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government Benches must recognise that in their short period of office they have been attracted to what the current Foreign Secretary calls a tendency to absolutism.
<P>
There are certainly rich pickings in the right hon. Member for Livingston's speech of 1994. He complained that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be possible for any Minister to come to the House and by order suspend an Act passed by it only three years ago with all-party support.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That applies to the clause. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The very fact that Ministers probably have never thought about it points up the problem we have with the Government. They have been in power so long that they cannot envisage anyone else but themselves in power.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I submit that, after only a little under two years, that already applies to the Government. They have forgotten what it feels like to be in opposition, as they accuse us of having forgotten, and are now prepared to take such powers upon themselves.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I remind the Committee that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Livingston said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are asked to trust that Minister with powers to extinguish Acts of Parliament by statutory instrument. . . . The House will be wilfully negligent&#151;so negligent that it could be sued by its constituents&#151;were it to hand over those powers.''&#151;[Official Report, 8 February 1994; Vol. 237 c. 157-160.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what the now Foreign Secretary said about the rather milder Henry VIII clause in our Act, yet the Government are now imposing such a clause on us.
<P>
More than one Minister attacked our Henry VIII clause. There must be something about the Foreign Office. The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) concluded the debate by urging his colleagues to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``stop this centralising measure and creeping undermining of the power of the House and join us in trying to protect our democracy.''&#151;[Official Report, 8 February 1994; Vol. 237, c. 231-2.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a serious point in what I am saying. We in our party were part of a process of centralisation of power on the Executive away from local authorities and the House of Commons. Now that we are in opposition, we are not afraid to reassess that record in good faith. But what is supremely ironic&#151;the Government Whip is clucking away on his Front Bench in approval of what I have said&#151;is that now the Labour party is continuing the very same trend. His mock surprise at the charge underlines the truth of that assertion. We are left with a Government who are more determined to centralise power on the Executive away from Parliament and local authorities than even the previous Administration.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> That is saying something.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Well, in all honesty, we are looking at a problem trend that affects a great many developed democracies in the western world: the tendency to accrue power to the centre. We suffer that problem in Europe generally as well. We would be making a grave mistake if we allowed the clause to pass into the Bill unremarked and unopposed. I seriously invite Labour Members, if they do not vote with us on the clause, to make known their feeling, even if in private, that this trend in legislation should not be allowed to continue indefinitely.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I am genuinely puzzled. After reading clause 14 carefully and setting it against the generality of Henry VIII clauses, I find that what the hon. Gentleman appears to have done is create a category of such clauses, put everything within it, and assumed that they are all the same. The clause appears in many respects to be an encouraging and enabling clause which cannot be set in the same category as the others that the hon. Gentleman talked about. Will he elaborate on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As I said, earlier Henry VIII clauses were primarily concerned with statutes coming into force and were time limited. The Henry VIII clause in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 was concerned with reducing legislation. The Henry VIII clause in the Bill may possibly expand its scope and confer new powers and capabilities on organs of the state, namely local authorities.
<P>
I do not want to split hairs over Henry VIII clauses. In a democracy, is it acceptable to legislate in such a manner at all? We are opposing the Henry VIII clause because we have grave anxieties about legislation being conducted on such a basis. [Interruption.] The Whip is muttering again. However, when the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs was in opposition, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Let us be clear what would happen and what we would lose if clause 1 to 4 were passed unamended . . . There would be no Committee stage in which the measure was considered line by line. Statutory instruments cannot be amended; they have to be accepted or rejected as they stand. There would be no Report stage in which new clauses could be considered. The House would have to accept the priorities of the Minister who presented the order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There would be no Lords amendments in which the second Chamber gave us a chance to have second thoughts.''&#151;[Official Report, 8 February 1994; Vol. 237, c. 158.]
<P>
Clause 14 will establish the process of legislation so roundly condemned by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the last time that the Henry VIII clause was considered in Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It is a pity that those quotes did not come from the Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), whose resemblance to Henry VIII is rather greater than that of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
<P>
My hon. Friend addressed the constitutional principle of the matter, but I want to talk about how it will work in practice. The Minister has put out a document explaining clauses 14, 15 and 16. I should like to refer him to a section entitled ``Partnership Service Delivery Vehicles''&#151;I assume that that is not a reference to joint refuse collection services. Such marvellous phrases commit violence on the English language. One gobbet or blob of text states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The options include: powers to establish and participate in companies; joint committees and boards and not-for-profit organisations such as companies limited by guarantee''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Am I right to assume that the power to establish and participate does not embrace the acquisition of a shareholding in a public company? I am anxious to winkle out the meaning of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``power to establish and participate in''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that participation is a consequence of establishment: one participates in the company that one has established. What is the status of organisations such as a Lancashire development company or a north-east development company? What is the status of a local authority shareholding? I should like clarification on that point.
<P>
Page seven of the document contains a section on enhancing the utilisation of local authority assets. However, no illustration is given of what those assets might be, so the explanation is rather opaque. Which local authority assets will be enhanced by the measures that the Minister has discussed?
<P>
The Minister has talked about a general power: she does not want it to be too specific. However, if the power is not to be specific, much will depend on the machinery used by the Secretary of State to determine the authorisation that he will give. A body of case law may build up. On what basis will the Secretary of State take his decisions? What sort of advice will he receive? Will matters go beyond the Secretary of State? Is a Cabinet committee envisaged? Should the Secretary of State establish a corpus of practice with a statutory basis, he may find himself reviewed by people whom he does not believe should have certain powers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay mentioned the different permissions for different authorities. I think that that is sensible. He referred to beacon authorities. All Governments struggle to define how good councils can be rewarded.
<P>
When financial and expenditure constraints are imposed, as they were under the previous Government, and as the present Government are making provision to do under the Bill&#151;the Minister's remarks in rate support grant debates show that the Government must take a view on volume of expenditure&#151;the most obvious power is to let local authorities raise more money and spend more money. However, the best local authorities do not need to do that, because they are spending their money efficiently in the first place.
<P>
The search is on for the means by which good authorities can receive more competence. The clause could be a vehicle for beacon councils to gain greater freedoms to use the responsibility that they have earned. Does the Minister think that differentiating between authorities and giving particular powers to particular authorities might eventually be a way to advance the concept of beacon councils?
<P>
Our concern is that local authorities do not set themselves in a commercial framework, in direct competition with the private sector. We agree on the enabling concept of local government, and that local government should commission services more. We agree that scrutiny must be applied to the services that are commissioned, and to those that it delivers. The Minister knows that the inspectorates often comment on the failure of local authorities to externalise their services sufficiently, for example in the case of old people's homes. I suspect that relatively few councils have not received a social services inspectorate report asking whether there is further scope to externalise some of those services. If so, we do not want a contradictory process whereby local authorities are given a green light to move back into the world of delivering their own services.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us where she sees a balance, and give us an illustration of how she sees the power being used in practice? My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex described it as a draconian power. I suspect that Draco may have been an underestimated figure, just as I believe that Henry VIII was a greatly underestimated monarch. None the less, the provision exists and will be passed. What matters is what will happen to it. Legislation cannot explain intentions. One cannot incorporate an intention. One cannot have a Henry VIII power for a good purpose or for a bad purpose; one can simply have a Henry VIII power. What matters is how it is then used in practice, and I should be grateful if the Minister would say more about that.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I shall not repeat the points made by my right hon. and hon. Friends, which I support, but I shall expand a little on the matters that my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has mentioned.
<P>
I am deeply concerned about the potential for unnecessary risks being taken with taxpayers' money. The Minister will be aware that a number of ambitious local authorities would like to move into the field of municipal trading that I mentioned on Second Reading. She mentioned joint ventures and partnerships. I shall move on to discuss open-book operations with contractors, which always bring difficulties because there is a built-in conflict of interest. The contractor seeks to maximise profit and minimise operating costs, while the local authority seeks to maximise on-contract expenditure and achievement of standards.
<P>
There is a conflict in that mismatch, and it would be helpful if the Minister would tell us more about that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has requested, with particular reference to looking after taxpayers' money and to making sure that the local authority is not directly or indirectly supporting one company, or itself, against private ventures in its own area or elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I appreciate the manner in which hon. Members have expressed their concerns. It is important for the Committee to consider the reason why the Government think it necessary to take such powers. I explained that earlier in a fair amount of detail, but I want to respond to the invitations from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Mole Valley and explain to the Committee some of the circumstances in which we envisage some of the powers being used. As the hon. Member for Mole Valley said, there must be safeguards. Indeed, the document that I circulated yesterday makes it clear there will have to be safeguards, because public money is involved. It is important that it is protected and that there is a proper audit trail. All such activities need to be circumscribed by appropriate safeguards.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall cite a few examples of some of the problems facing authorities with which the clause could deal. The Committee may be aware of the Brighton consortium best value pilot, some of whose activities are set out in the earlier reports. It is based on joint delivery of revenue services, such as council tax, national or domestic rates and benefits. It is a consortium of authorities working together to achieve ecomonies of scale. It wanted to choose a partnership vehicle that retained the consortium within the public sector; it did not want simply to create a company or externalise the activities&#151;even that would have been difficult.
<P>
The authority wanted to retain the consortium within the public sector, thereby avoiding issues relating to the transfer of staff, which the hon. Member for North Essex was so interested in, and then contract with the private sector for IT services. It wanted to do that through a statutory board, which can employ its own staff and have its own assets.
<P>
At present, primary legislation is required for councils to take that approach as the current legal framework does not provide for joint boards to be established for the vast majority of council functions. The authority is looking for an alternative approach, because we have had to say that its preferred vehicle is not available to it, but its sensible suggestion is one that we should be able to facilitate.
<P>
I shall cite another example of the problems involved in setting up a local authority company. One local authority said that it wished to establish a joint venture company with the private sector to provide support services to schools. The difficulty concerned the authority's powers to participate in such a company. Contrary legal views have been put to the local authority and its prospective partner, which are causing a lack of confidence in the authority's potential partners which could result in the collapse of, or delay in, the project. That would mean that either the services are not provided to the school, or they would be delivered be it at a higher cost to the local taxpayer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am genuinely interested in the matter. I am at a loss to understand why there needs to be a joint venture company in such circumstances. Why does not the authority just make a contract with the private sector? Why does it need to have a shareholding in the company? Why does it need to be involved in the financing of the company? Why does not it just set up a proper public-private partnership and get a private sector company to finance and operate the whole requirement?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants both public-private partnership and externalisation. He actually described externalisation rather than a partnership. The particular authority to which I referred considers that the specific relationship with schools and its responsibilities would best be delivered through a joint venture partnership. It has worked out what would be the most effective means to achieve that, and that is its conclusion. The private sector company is also looking for that and, presumably, it will feel that its legitimacy would be greater if it were linked with, say, a joint venture company. We should not be dogmatic and say from Parliament what is the best form of procurement, or the best way of delivering it. Perfectly legitimate ways forward are simply not available to local government at present, and the clause is a means of allowing that to happen.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon mentioned assets. Again, I can give a direct example. A local authority has told us that it wishes to sublease to a private company the spare capacity at one of its direct service organisation depots. That will provide valuable benefits both in terms of economies of scale for support facilities and a welcome income stream to the authority. The council's legal advisers are unclear about whether the council has the legal vires to do that, as it might be construed as trading. Councils currently have limited powers in relation to the private sector. The local authority is faced with two choices&#151;to spend a lot of money on legal bills to try to get round the problem, or simply not to proceed with the proposal. It is precisely that sort of example that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
I understand why hon. Members are concerned about clause 15 and whether it offers the right mixture of parliamentary scrutiny to meet their concerns. It is true that, at present, the scrutiny powers referred to in subsequent clauses are not the same as those in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994.
<P>
	The Bill, as currently drafted, requires the Secretary of State to consult on proposals for draft orders. Such proposals would have to be laid before Parliament, together with the consultation results and a full explanation of the proposed orders. Parliament will then have 60 days to consider them. That period will not include times when Parliament is dissolved, prorogued or adjourned for more than four days. When the 60 days have elapsed, the Secretary of State can lay draft orders before Parliament, together with details of representations made during the 60 days that the proposals are before Parliament. A report will be published on the changes made as a result of such representations.
<P>
	The Secretary of State can make and effect the order only when both Houses of Parliament have considered and approved it. It is true that, under the 1994 Act, there is more detailed parliamentary scrutiny, through Committee procedure, because under that Act, the Secretary of State must report back to Parliament on the extent to which he has taken into account the Committee's report when framing the draft orders. I am prepared to consider adding that provision to this Bill. We shall take account of today's debate and other comments that are made.
<P>
The Government are anxious to ensure that local government has the flexibility to develop the vehicles that it needs in order to deliver best value to its citizens. But we also want to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity properly to scrutinise. We must ensure that there are safeguards, to which the hon. Member for Mole Valley referred. I cannot say that we shall always agree on the safeguards that the hon. Gentleman may want, but Parliament should have the opportunity to consider the mattter.
<P>
We have had a useful debate. I hope that hon. Members recognise that we are trying to achieve the necessary flexibility and to ensure that Parliament has sufficient powers of scrutiny of whatever steps are taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I am intrigued by her comments about amendments that might be brought forward to clause 15. As we are not due to discuss that clause today, is that something we should know about? Will the Minister table such amendments before next Tuesday? Such prior knowledge would greatly facilitate the work of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I cannot give that commitment. It was important that we hear the debate; the Bill has a long way to go through both Houses and, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, we have to ensure that any amendment that we table has the blessing of parliamentary counsel. I therefore cannot promise to table such amendments, but I have said that I will consider the need for them in the light of the Bill's progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We shall continue to oppose the clause, which we regard as unnecessary, but do so in anticipation of what may happen during the later stages of the Bill. It is important that we place on record our concern about the legislation in principle. We look forward to what the hon. Lady might add to our proceedings later.
