<H4><center>Clause 89</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the committee that with this we are considering the following: clause 90 stand part to clause 103 stand part, clause 126 stand part, Government amendment No. 409, Government amendments Nos. 410 and 411 and Government amendments Nos. 413 to 421.
<P>
Hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): When we broke for lunch, we were discussing clause 89 and why, during the consultation process—the Government boasted that it was extensive in the run-up to publication of the Bill—there was no mention between the Government and the consultees of the forthcoming White Paper on communications, especially as that White Paper had been heralded in the document, ``Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead'', which was published in June 1999. Second Reading on 31 January 2000 was just three days prior to publication of the Department of Trade and Industry press release on 3 February, which announced that the White Paper would be published in the autumn. It is the practice for such press releases to be in draft for several days prior to publication. Ministers will have been aware of the press release, which stated that the Government would make proposals for reforming telecommunications and broadcasting regulations. The words ``telecommunications'' and ``regulations'' were included in the draft press release that was circulated round the Department of Trade and Industry at the time of Second Reading.
<P>
It must have been in Ministers' minds that the White Paper was forthcoming, so it should have formed part of the dialogue between Ministers and civil servants and the consultees—the telecommunications companies. If Ministers did not raise the matter or if they did not know that the White Paper was forthcoming, they were negligent in that, but I find it difficult to believe that they were not aware of it. If they were aware of it and decided that the industry would just have to go through the process twice, they are guilty of gross maladministration. They cannot have it both ways; either they knew about the forthcoming White Paper and decided that it did not matter that utility companies would be involved in a huge amount of effort and cost, or they did not know, in which case, what on earth was going on in the Department of Trade and Industry? It would be helpful to know which of those two options applies.
<P>
The Government are trying to get out of a highly embarrassing situation and explicit exposure of their lethargic approach to the details of government and administration by seeking to mislead. The letters from the operators group and BT are hostile to the bid. The main letter, which was sent to all members of the Committee and to Ministers, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we feel that the current Bill is inappropriate and that its underlying approach is flawed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a hard-hitting statement. The letter goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the reality is that the Government, through the Utilities Bill, is stepping sharply backward, rather than advancing the regulatory model to take into account market developments such as convergence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The third major point in that open letter is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The prospect of unlimited fines, with no full appeal mechanism, and communications companies being agents of social and environmental policy through vague or even undefined measures will severely lessen the UK's attractiveness for investment in communications.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a severe criticism of the framework of the Bill and it is not enough to say that a White Paper will be published in due course. The Minister said earlier that the framework of the Bill was unsuitable for the telecommunications industry.
<P>
The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Utilities Bill will create a barrier to the launch of new services rather than stimulate further innovation. It will throw our industry into regulatory uncertainty with the guarantee of repeated further upheaval to come.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those matters are too fundamental to the Bill for them to have arisen after it had seen the Department of Trade and Industry's press release on 3 February. Such opinions must have been voiced during the consultation process and after publication of the White Paper, the Green Paper and the associated consultation documents.
<P>
Vodafone also criticised the Bill. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Vodafone AirTouch's opinion, the direction of the regulatory reform for the telecommunications sector as outlined in the Utilities Bill is too backwards looking for this industry and as a result likely to damage the development of this already highly competitive and innovative industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the detailed briefing that it sent to Committee members, it stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The splitting of Oftel's functions between two entities seems likely to give rise to increased costs and Vodafone would urge that there should be no overall increase in the financial burden of regulation on operators and consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are severe criticisms of the Bill's fundamental principles and framework. The Secretary of State was wrong to say on Thursday that the only reason for removing the telecommunications provisions from the Bill was the fact that the telecoms companies were not aware that a White Paper would appear in the autumn. That happened because the press release was published three days after the Bill's Second Reading. When those companies saw the press release, they made representations, although they wanted regulations to be introduced not in two stages but in one. It is appalling that the Government continue to assert that that is their reason.
<P>
In a press release, the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the telecommunications measures currently in the Utilities Bill will now fall within the scope of the White Paper . . . But our principles for telecommunications reform remain the same . . . The industry has assured us that they remain firmly behind these aims.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not the case. I quoted at length the operators group newsletter and a letter from Vodaphone, which make it clear that the industry is not firmly behind those aims. Those bodies have opposed the Bill's fundamental principles. Despite everything, the Government are, I am afraid, still misleading the public—there is no other way to put it. Their press releases contain complete rubbish. What will happen to the industries? How will they be regulated after the White Paper's publication in November?
<P>
The Government do not appear to have taken on board the fact that the telecommunications industry is still concerned about a host of the Bill's proposals. For example, they are concerned about over-regulation, regulatory risks, fines, social duties, the failure to roll back regulatory burdens, possible inconsistency with the Freedom of Information Bill and downgrading of the duty to promote competition The Government's statement implied that the industry was happy with the Bill's principles, but it is not.
<P>
What consultation process will be involved before the White Paper's publication in the autumn? Notwithstanding the report that was published in June last year, the Government's approach appears to involve going directly to a White Paper without going via a Green Paper. The industry is concerned that there will not be much consultation before the White Paper's publication. Will the Minister give an assurance that there will be adequate consultation? We should avoid the situation that was alluded to earlier, which involved the Government hearing but not listening during the consultation process.
<P>
Do the Government accept that regulation is not necessary when a sector is fully competitive? When that occurs—it may take one, two, three, four or five years—do they accept that the regulator should be rolled back and that competition should be used to force prices down?
<P>
When can we expect the introduction of a Bill? Will it be in this Parliament or subsequently, assuming that the Government win the next general election, which is an increasingly dim prospect? Will the Minister explain why his amendment has not included the deletion of paragraph 3 of schedule 5, which refers specifically to the Telecommunications Authority and the Telecommunications Consumer Council? Is there a reason for that, or is it yet another error or omission in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): This is an opportunity to obtain from the Government, before they expunge any further reference to telecommunications, an indication of what they intend for the future. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) read out extracts from the Vodafone AirTouch letter. Clearly, Vodafone has always believed that it is ridiculous for it to be covered by regulation that did not affect it previously. None of the telecommunications companies accepts that it is a utility in the sense intended by the Government. Before the withdrawal of clauses, the Government should accept that such companies are not utilities. The White Paper should recognise that in such a multiple industry, which uses different technologies and approaches, the Government should not rush in and decide everything from the salary paid to the chief executive to who gets what from whom. We want to know the Government's intention for the White Paper. Such issues require a long time to plan and resolve.
<P>
We heard a number of comments about the fact that internet providers are bringing down their prices. Among other Committees, Pitcom—the Information Committee—of which I am vice-chairman, has been told for a considerable period the different plans of different companies, which are often given in confidential briefings because of commercial confidence. Those plans relate to the companies' intentions with regard to providing inexpensive internet connection. Opposition Members were always confident that such inexpensive connections would be forthcoming, but we understood that all the companies could not simply announce and go. They had to do a great deal of planning to realise how they would achieve what they wanted to achieve. They also had to hold discussions with Oftel to make sure that no competition or monopoly issues were at stake. No doubt they would also have had discussions with the DTI. Alta Vista's announcement of bargain basement prices was immediately followed by NTL's trumping of those prices. All the companies—especially NTL—have been planning for almost a year to introduce those offers. In my discussions with BT in the Information Committee, I have pressed the company to get well ahead of the game and reduce prices. That would ensure that the amount of money that it earned would continue to increase. It is foolish to think that all telecoms companies, in reducing the price per minute, would necessarily end up earning less money. The intention, in terms of good marketing, is to earn even more money.
<P>
In relation to the withdrawal of clauses, all those plans depend on knowledge of what the regulatory environment will be, not just tomorrow but in one, two or three years' time. However heavy handed the Government were in keeping the telecoms industry in the regulations, they were at least saying what they intended for it. It is not good enough simply to withdraw it and say that there will be a White Paper in the autumn. Governments of all colours say that there will be a White Paper in the autumn, but the autumn can stretch for a long time and we can end up with spring. They may then say: ``Did we really mean the autumn of 2000? Maybe it was the autumn of 2001.''
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Elections will get in the way of putting any part of the Bill into being. We know that any changes in the regulator will not occur until after the next general election. I think that all sides would accept that it would be virtually impossible to introduce them sooner, when the White Paper involves more than one Department. Unless the Government can give us chapter and verse on when they intend the regulation to come into effect, the telecoms industry is left in the lurch. The Government must tell us what the timetable is for the White Paper and the legislation that comes after it and what the White Paper will cover and make a statement about where we are going with the industry.
<P>
As I was about to leave my office I quickly opened the file marked ``Labour party manifestos'' and thought that I had picked up the 1997 manifesto. That manifesto has probably been stolen and destroyed, as I have ended up with the 1992 manifesto. The Government are trying to tell us that they had no inkling about what they would be doing on these issues until their last set of consultations a few days ago, so it is interesting to note that in 1992, under the heading ``We will protect consumers'', the Labour party manifesto said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our consumers' charter will cover all goods and services. It will include: tougher health and safety standards;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>compensation for injury from dangerous products;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>comprehensive guarantees;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a fast, simple remedy if things go wrong.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will press for similar standards throughout the European Community and strengthen the work of consumer groups and advice centres so that aspirations and standards are met.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Very inspiring, I am sure. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Every utility will be required to provide a customer contract, with compensation if standards are not met. Gas and electricity disconnections will be banned completely where young children or elderly people are concerned. We will regulate telephone services which demean women and corrupt children.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is content regulation.
<P>
The 1992 manifesto, referring to the White Paper that is to be published, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will strengthen the regulation of the utilities, enforce standards through our consumer protection commission, and ensure prices are cut or other action taken where profits are excessive so that the customer gets a fair deal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The manifesto goes on to talk about petroleum products regulation which, incidentally, when I raised it in Committee, was rejected by Ministers. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government and parliament will have a stronger role to work on the consumer's behalf. we will help consumers have a voice locally and nationally.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings me rather neatly to the National Consumer Council. I was told off for not fully representing its views the other day, when I disagreed with some of its comments about this regulation. We now have briefing note 2, rather than briefing note 1, and we should put on the record what it says about the Government's withdrawal. The note is headed: ``Withdrawal of telecommunications and water from the Bill: NCC urges retention of telecommunications and water consumer councils.'' It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Consumer Council is extremely disappointed about the Government's intention to remove the telecoms and water provisions from the Bill. We believe this action undermines the Government's efforts to raise the profile of consumers in its policies across the board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>NCC has supported the Government's intentions to reform utility regulation from the initial review, In particular we supported the establishment of the independent consumer councils which will be now be removed for telecoms and water,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then says in heavy type:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We call for the retention of the provisions for the Water and Telecoms Consumer Councils in the Bill. Having new independent-consumer councils is not necessarily dependent on the overhaul of the regulatory framework. Also, this would help salvage this extremely disappointing situation for consumers.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Then, under the heading ``Telecommunications Consumer Council'', the NCC continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We understand that any legislation to change regulation on communications is unlikely to take effect for at least two years as the White Paper is not due until this autumn Consumers need a strong advocate for their interests given the very fast changing nature of this sector, including the issue of the access to the local loop and the European Commission's review of communications. These and other important developments would be taking place without a strong sectoral consumer body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our ideal model would be a communications regulatory authority and an independent communications consumer council. Setting up a telecommunications consumer council now would not preclude the broadening of its remit to cover communications more widely later and would provide the basis for its establishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In respect of the Consumer Council for Water, the National Consumer Council states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whilst we understand that there will be legislation on water later this year—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is somewhat over-optimistic—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which is likely to include provision for an independent consumer cancel, consumers have to wait at least another year for a strong advocate. It is vital that consumers would have an independent and effective body to represent their interests in this essential service, particularly in debates over emerging issues such as the development of competition. The economic and social complexity of promoting competition has been demonstrated by the experiences in the telecoms and energy sectors. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read that in full because some Committee members have partially quoted electricity companies to suggest that all are pleased with the direction that the Government are taking. Clearly, the National Consumer Council is not really, really pleased but really, really cross, and the Government should be concerned about that.
<P>
A few days ago, some of my colleagues were invited to meet representatives of the Independent Television Commission, and my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) met them today. I was surprised to discover that the ITC, which is a content regulator, discussed with television companies the regulation of the internet and internet services. Problems will arise precisely as a result of such arrangements. Many inexpensive domestic internet services will be delivered through television, and many are beamed down by satellite as a block of information. If those services are broadcast, and particularly if they are broadcast digitally, the ITC, which is empowered to control and comment on programme content, will be empowered to control and comment on the internet. However, the Government said that they are not trying to regulate internet content because it is impossible to do so. The ITC was keen to point out that it wants the lightest possible regulation, but it is interesting to note that it is thinking about regulation at all.
<P>
The production of a White Paper three and a half years after the Government came to power on a manifesto requiring that such issues be dealt with—a direction in which the previous Government were moving—is a cop-out. They will take no action for the next two years, and it will fall to the next Government to decide what will happen. The Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport may consult and produce a good deal of work, only to discover after the next general election that the country is being run by a coalition between the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) and the Liberals, by some other party, or, more positively, by the Conservative party. Certainly, the Labour party will not retain its present form—its members are doing other things.
<P>
Whatever happens after the next election, I suspect that the industries will again have to enter a period of uncertainty, lasting perhaps years, while they wait to find out what the Government plan to do. Ministers must tell the industries what will be in the White Paper pertaining to the clauses that have been removed from the Bill. That is the least that they can do to apologise for marching them up to the top of the hill, only to throw them over the precipice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): During this morning's debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) made many of the points that I should like to have made. I shall emphasise and reinforce a couple of those.
<P>
On the withdrawal of the telecommunications provisions, no Minister has yet been able to produce substantial evidence that any new matters have come to light that were available for examination at the time of the Bill's initial publication. It is extraordinary that the telecoms industry has been removed in such a way, and at this stage of the Bill's passage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton quoted extensively from a letter from Vodafone. That is not the most recent letter from the company—I received one this morning that commends my intelligence in withdrawing the telecoms provisions in response to its representations. I do not wish to take credit unworthily. I am happy to claim the intelligence, but not the power or intention to remove the provisions.
<P>
This morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes repeatedly asked the Minister to state exactly where the consultations that resulted in the withdrawal of the measures took place. Vodafone's letter suggests that it is delighted, so perhaps the representations that it made, or the consultation undertaken with it by the Government, were instrumental in the withdrawal. When my hon. Friend asked the Minister about consultation with consumers, as opposed to providers, of services, I understand that the Minister was either unable or unwilling to give a straight, face-to-camera answer.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) has quoted extensively from the National Consumer Council's briefing note 2. I merely refer the Committee to the following passage:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Consumer Council is extremely disappointed about the Government's intention to remove the telecoms and water provisions from the Bill. We believe this action undermines the Government's efforts to raise the profile of consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides a contrast with Vodafone's letter, which praises me, the Committee, the Government, and everyone involved in the proceedings for their intelligence in taking this course of action. The National Consumer Council is far from doing that. Will the Minister admit that the Government listened to producers and suppliers, but did not consult or take representations from consumers?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> Had the hon. Gentleman been present during this morning's debate, he would have heard me read out two letters from consumer groups that relate directly to the clauses that have been removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for that comment. However, the representations that we are now receiving from the National Consumer Council suggest that, whatever discussions took place, the Government chose not to take any advice that was proffered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sure that the Minister will jump to her feet to tell me if I am wrong, but my recollection is that those were consumer bodies dealing with electricity and gas, not telecommunications and water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I apologise to the Committee for not having been present this morning, but the report from my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes was very much along those lines. If the Minister wants to correct that impression, she is free to do so.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We recognise that there may be valid arguments for dealing with telecommunications provisions separately, but whether the lock, stock and barrel removal of every one—at least except paragraph 3 of schedule 4 to do with water—is the right way to go about it is another matter. It seems that the purpose of withdrawing the water regulation from the Bill is even—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Water provisions are to be discussed under the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank you, Mr. Hood, for keeping me in order. I shall reserve my remarks about water for an appropriate occasion.
<P>
We believe that the Government listened to special pleading on telecommunications by those whom the regulator will regulate. There is no surprise that such representations were made, but some disappointment that they were listened to, particularly when it is so clear that serious problems lie ahead for consumers.
<P>
From the start, the Bill was ambitious, complex and highly technical—but the Government knew that when they began the process. There can have been no surprises for the Government when the Bill was published. It may have been a surprise to those in the industry who were to be regulated, and it may have been a surprise to some of us in Parliament to find such an ambitious Bill before us, but the Bill could not possibly have been a surprise to the Government.
<P>
In its original form, the Bill introduced clear benefits. It brought together consumer interests; it made a coherent consumer response to regulated utilities a possibility for the first time ever; it brought together four different regulatory regimes with different criteria and cultures, which is a good thing. We started with four regulatory bodies and the intention to create one regulatory body. As a result of the changes, we shall have three regulatory bodies. The reform is not sweeping, and it disappoints those of us who looked to such a coherent model.
<P>
There are similar worries about the consumer regimes. The National Consumer Council's views have been extensively quoted. The powers of consumers and consumer organisations of the two industries—I shall concentrate on telecommunications to stay in order—will be weakened, and there will be significant delay and great uncertainty for a long period ahead.
<P>
An ambitious and complex Bill has been chopped up. There may be good reasons for doing so, but however good they are, they existed before the original Bill was published. The changes have left a legacy of confusion, disappointment and inevitable delay, which is not to the ultimate benefit of those industries, consumers or the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): The Minister was remarkably brief in explaining the full implications not only of the deletion but of the amendments. I shall address my remarks to some of the Government amendments, especially those to part IV, which provides for the establishment of the Competition Commission's role.
<P>
Last week, when we responded to the Government's announcement that they were dropping references to water and telecoms from the Bill, I asked the Minister about the implications of that for the Competition Commission proposals in part IV. Those proposals emphasised that the four utilities shared similar interests, and that all of the functions should be carried out collectively within the Competition Commission, on behalf of the utilities, but with specialist panel members. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the current proposal is that the Secretary of State will retain the power to appoint not fewer than eight members of the Competition Commission. However, the effect of the amendments, and that of the next group, is to remove telecoms and water from their remit, and to restrict their role to gas and electricity matters.
<P>
On the commission's functions in relation to reference and the power to designate people to participate in particular specialist activities, amendments Nos. 410 and 446 remove any dealings with telecoms and water. If we accept at face value the Minister's statement that similar proposals will be introduced in a consolidated Bill dealing with the widest range of telecommunications, including broadcasting, and, in due course, in one dealing with water, why is it necessary for the Government to abandon the theme set out in part IV, whereby all utilities are subject to similar, coherent legislation, and accordingly alter the roles and functions of the Competition Commission?
<P>
In deleting references to telecoms from part IV—we will discuss water under the next group of amendments—the Minister cannot claim that the matter is the subject of detailed discussion in a White Paper. Surely the Minister recognises that it is a sham for the Government to continue to stick to the previously announced policy of treating all utilities on a common footing. If that were not so, the amendments would not be necessary. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government are fiddling around with the rules relating to the Competition Commission. The Minister refused to address that issue in the Committee's sitting on Thursday, as did the Secretary of State when challenged by my hon. Friend Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) on the Floor of the House, also on Thursday. I hope that that can be put right this afternoon.
<P>
I would also be grateful if the Minister explained a little more about the amendments proposed to schedule 7. Schedule 7 sets out some consequential repeals, of which I have made a superficial analysis. Amendment No. 420 will delete lines 26 to 31 from column 3 on page 167, which relate to the Telecommunications Act 1984. Significantly, however, it fails to delete lines 32 to 44, which means that schedule 7 will repeal only parts of the 1984 Act. The Government said that they want to drop all references to telecommunications from the Bill, so why do they want to repeal only parts of the 1984 Act?
<P>
I have read those parts of the 1984 Act that will be repealed. Notwithstanding the Government's decision to change their approach to, for example, sections 1 and 2 of the 1984 Act, they intend to repeal parts of it. Section 54, which will be repealed, refers to the Secretary of State's power to ``establish advisory bodies'' and, when doing so, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the desirability of having members who are familiar with the special requirements and circumstances of the part of the United Kingdom concerned (including, in particular, the special requirements and circumstances of consumers, purchasers and other users in that part of telecommunication services and telecommunication apparatus).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why will not the amendments alter the situation? Perhaps because we have already considered those parts of the Bill, and the Government may plan to introduce the relevant changes on Report. I hope that the Minister will clarify the situation.
<P>
Opposition Members are extremely suspicious about the Government's approach. They have not said whether they adhere to the Bill's original intention of treating all—the utilities on a level playing field, or whether they want to bow to the pressure that has been generated in relation to telecommunications and water and to introduce their original intentions in legislation on a subsequent occasion. That would not be an unusual way for the Government to carry on, although it would show that they are not as open as we would want them to be with the people who will be adversely affected.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset asked about the time scale for the legislation that results from the White Paper on communications, which is due to be published in the second part of this year. It would be impossible for such a White Paper to be the subject of primary legislation during the remainder of this Parliament. It will be three or four years before such legislation can realistically be introduced. We need and deserve a fuller explanation. Why does the Minister want to delete references to the Competition Commission, which is already up and running, and to telecommunications from part IV? The Government might think that the Competition Commission's performance might be improved by the relatively modest provisions in clause 124. Why have they abandoned that approach?

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton argued this morning that the Bill and the forthcoming White Paper on communications regulation adopt different approaches, and that the legislative framework for gas and electricity should allow for a stepping back from sector-specific regulation. As I said, I have no difficulty with that concept, and I should remind him that, during our sixth sitting, I tabled amendments that clarified the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority's obligation to include in its annual report an assessment of developing competition in relevant markets. I would expect that assessment to describe areas in which regulatory controls have been relaxed, and why; and other areas in which representations have been made for reduction of regulatory controls and their on-going consideration, and reasons why such controls should not be relaxed.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those measures will help to reduce regulatory controls as competition develops. Such an approach is not inconsistent with that adopted in the communications White Paper. In the particular circumstances of the converging industries, the White Paper must address how best to achieve more flexible regulation. That will be a particularly important issue, given wide differences in competition in the telecoms sector markets alone. In the converging industries as a whole, the picture is even more complex.
<P>
As with gas and electricity, the regulatory regime for those industries should employ a light touch, but the detailed measures may not be exactly the same. In particular, and as I have said, it may be necessary to adjust the telecoms provisions in the Bill to suit the new and broader regulatory framework that may emerge from the White Paper.
<P>
It may be argued that full competition will arrive sooner in the telecoms sector than in the energy sector. Indeed, in the energy sector, distribution infrastructure businesses are likely to be effective monopolies for the foreseeable future. Even when supply is fully competitive, infrastructure businesses will need regulation; we cannot tell at this stage whether the same may be true of telecoms. Our basic approach is that regulation in each sector should roll back at a rate consistent with the development of competition. That applies as much to telecoms as to energy. I should make it clear that the difference in approach that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton claimed to discern simply does not exist.
<P>
The Government remain committed to these proposals and the principles that underpin the Bill. We want to secure for all utilities sectors a more transparent regulatory framework, an independent voice for consumers and a stronger focus on protecting their interests. Those principles will remain part of separate communications legislation as it develops. Of course, it is possible that propositions will be modified to suit the new context, so that the passage of time and further market developments are reflected.
<P>
Since its introduction in January, we have discussed the Bill with interested parties, including the industries. Last month, the Government announced a comprehensive review of communications regulation—a point on which the hon. Member for South Dorset picked up at the time—and a White Paper will be published later this year. In the light of concerns expressed by the industry, we believe that there are compelling reasons for tackling the necessary reforms in a single legislative vehicle, rather than two. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who quoted the initial letter from Vodafone AirTouch in an interesting way, has a copy of its latest missive. In case he does not, I shall quote from it. Stewart White, the public policy director, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would like to reassure you that Vodafone AirTouch will continue to support the Government's principles for telecommunications reform as outlined again in the DTI's announcement on 2 March. Looking ahead to the White Paper, we have noted from the standing committee debates on the Utilities Bill that whilst industry's comments have been welcomed and considered helpful, it would have been useful to have received them earlier in the process.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fair enough. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is clearly vitally important that industry and Government do therefore work closer together on the White Paper.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, I believe it is a credit to members of the Utilities Bill Standing Committee and the Government that you have been prepared to listen to industry at this late stage in the Bill's progress and remove telecommunications.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a useful letter, which puts a different spin on what the Opposition have quoted. However, I do not aim to place the weight of the Government's case on those few sentences, welcome though they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> When was the last time that Vodafone AirTouch was in the Department of Trade and Industry's building discussing these matters with Ministers?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have no idea. I am but a humble Under-Secretary of State. I have no doubt that these companies of great repute have many conversations with the powers that be. I have no doubt that it will be listed somewhere and I shall try to get the hon. Gentleman a date. I have no doubt that it will be interesting to him because of his commercial interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was intrigued by that response to my hon. Friend's question. I thought that the Minister was the powers that be in relation to the Bill and to consultation. Are we being told that civil servants and not elected Ministers, accountable to Parliament, are the driving force behind the Bill?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not saying that. I am merely saying that I have not met Vodafone AirTouch and I understand that there has been no meeting with the company recently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, I want to make a little progress. I know it is jolly fun to do this, but I want to move on a bit.
<P>
We intend to publish a communications White Paper later this year. It is too early to say when legislation might follow. The timetable will have to take account of the progress of the European Commission's proposals for reforming the regulatory framework at European level. The prize, however, is that the industry will be subject to only one set of United Kingdom legislative changes, and telecoms reform can be considered in the wider context of convergence in the communications industry.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) asked whether the Government were still committed to a statutory consumer council in telecommunications. Our present view is that a statutory consumer council would be the most appropriate mechanism to meet the central aim of giving consumers an effective voice in the telecommunications sector. The White Paper to be published later this year has a wider ambit, including broadcasting, and introduces different issues, such as the interface with content regulation. The central aim remains the same, but it is too early to say exactly how it will be implemented in the broader context.
<P>
That point is worth repeating, because I was surprised when I heard the hon. Member for Hazel Grove say—not as surprised as when I hear Conservative Members say it—that the National Consumer Council and others are upset about that. The consumer council component of each sector is at the heart of the Bill. I was not aware that anybody inside Government had said anything about abolishing the consumer councils or not going ahead with them in other legislation that will arise as a result of removing clauses from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I have understood from what the Minister said that he was not aware of the National Consumer Council's briefing note 2 before the start of business, which is a rare case of the Opposition being better informed on consultation than the Government. Is that the case?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, it is the case. I am sorry that I cannot read everything. The hon. Gentleman received a most informative communication and I am sure that he represented it clearly and honestly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Christchurch raised an important point. We said when moving the original order of consideration on 10 February that the Bill was set out utility sector by utility sector. Hence, the clauses covering gas and electricity are, in most cases, self-standing. It is reasonably straightforward to remove the provisions covering telecoms and water. It is common sense to reduce the scope of the specialist cross-utility panel on the Competition Commission in line with the reduction in the coverage of the Bill. The panel will now be a specialist panel only for gas and electricity. There is currently a specialist electricity panel, but no gas panel. Creating a single energy panel will respond to the convergence of the two market sectors and represent a further alignment of the regulatory regimes for gas and electricity. As hon. Gentlemen know, there will continue to be specialist telecoms and water panels to deal with references under telecoms and water legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Is the Minister saying that it is no longer the Government's intention to establish a single cross-utility group in the Competition Commission? If so, it is a major change. Perhaps the Minister would also explain why it is necessary to defer implementation to subsequent legislation and how he will implement the proposal for a single cross-utility group. Surely it would be more sensible to introduce that in a Bill covering utilities.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. For now, at least, there will be a single energy panel on the Competition Commission. That may have to be modified when the White Paper and communications legislation is published, but for the time being there will be an energy panel.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about schedule 7, which, like schedule 3, is consequential on clauses that already stand part. I assure him that he will be able to voice his concerns on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Committee is always grateful to the Minister for his frankness; we have heard that the Government have decided to withdraw the telecommunications and water provisions without discussing that with the companies. Consumers are at the heart of the Bill, so will he tell us what discussions he has had with consumer bodies between the time when the consumer was king and when the Government decided not to have consumer bodies?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As far as I am concerned, the consumer is still king. If we scratched the surface of the hon. Gentleman's arguments, he would agree that what is required is for the consumer to be king. He may not like that, because he represents certain commercial interests I have always valued his opinion on these issues, but if we are to have the best companies in the world in an increasingly global trading environment, the consumer must be king. The efforts of those companies must be directed to the needs and demands of consumers, and companies must be innovative in order to widen customer bases and hang on to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I would not want the Minister to mislead the Committee on my interest, which I declared earlier. I am a paid adviser to the Telecommunication Managers Association. One has to be a user to be in that association; producers are not members. The hon. Gentleman and hon. Members on both sides of the House have been talking about consulting consumers before taking action. However, the Minister, by his own admission, says that no consumer organisations were consulted before the Government decided to change the Bill. That seems extraordinary.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I think that I have already made it clear that there were no direct talks with consumer associations before the decision was made to change the Bill. There were no direct talks with Vodafone Airtouch either. We read the information that was given to us, arrived at our conclusions and made our decisions on the basis of it, and decided to withdraw the clauses.
<P>
I therefore seek the agreement of the Committee to our proposals to remove the telecommunications provisions from the scope of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister misunderstood my point regarding clause 124. Sector-specific utility panels already exist as part of the Competition Commission. Clause 124 proposed that they should be abolished and replaced with a single cross-utility group. The Minister has just said that he is in favour of sector-specific utility panels for electricity and gas. That would be no different from the present arrangements.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It will be different. At present, there is an electricity panel but no gas panel. We want to create a single energy panel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> There will be a single energy panel, but the intention to have a single cross-utility group has been abandoned. That leads me to ask why there is no corresponding amendment relating to the minimum of eight specialist members of the Competition Commission who will have to be appointed. Will the Government table an amendment to that effect when we reach clause 124?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We will table an amendment to ensure that the Bill is tidied up in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I think that the industry will be alarmed by the Minister's response to the debate. He is saying that there will be no change in the approach to telecommunications in the White Paper; the same fundamental principles will apply to telecommunications as now apply to gas and electricity. The fact that he has not discussed that with Vodafone Airtouch or with the consumer groups illustrates his lack of understanding of their genuine concerns not only about the timing of the White Paper and two layers of regulatory change, but about the principles and proposals in the Bill.
<P>
The recent letter from Vodafone Airtouch might have been written in a state of euphoria, after it had succeeded in getting all these measures extracted from the Bill. All that it is doing is agreeing general broad principles, and if such principles are merely apple pie and motherhood statements about transparency, fairness and certainty, we can all sign up to them. However, if the Minister interprets ``principles'' to mean the principles in the Bill as it is currently drafted, and proposes to transfer the type of approach used for telecoms in the Bill to the proposals that will emanate from the White Paper, there will be genuine alarm. It is not only the timing and the procedural issues that are of concern to the telecommunications industry, it is also the fundamental, detailed proposals in the Bill. Those will add to regulatory costs and stifle an innovative, dynamic and internationally competitive business.
<P>
I have heard nothing from the Minister to convince me that the Government have learned from these events. He is continuing to talk about the same approach to telecoms as to gas and electricity. He justifies that by saying that his approach to the gas and electricity markets, especially his amazing amendment about assessing the development of competition, creates the kind of light-touch, deregulatory regime that the telecoms industry is demanding for itself. He claims that there is no need for the telecoms industry to worry, because nothing will change, and no need for the gas and electricity industries to worry, because they will have the regime that the telecoms industry is demanding.
<P>
Frankly, the Committee has not been well informed about where the Government have gone wrong in drafting the Bill, how they intend to remedy that in the White Paper, or what new philosophical approach they propose to take on the telecoms industry. All that we have been told today is that it is business as usual; if there are no problems with the Bill's provisions for the gas and electricity industries, there will be no problems for the telecoms industry. To that extent, the debate has been inadequate.
<P>
I hope that before the White Paper is published, Ministers will take the trouble to have direct talks with Vodafone Airtouch, the operators group and BT, as well as consumers groups. I and other members of the Committee have spent many hours discussing the issues with outside bodies, and it is beholden on the Minister and his team to do the same. If they do so, next time around, whenever that may be—we have been given no details of the timing of a Bill—the Government might not make such a mess of delivering a new regulatory regime for these industries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has not advised the Committee on the timetable envisaged by the Government for the introduction of a Bill. Although we know that a White Paper is to be published in the autumn—we take that as read, and will hold the Government to it—we have been given no further legislative timetable. We should be told about that before the provisions are deleted from the Bill.
<P>
Another issue, which I admit that I did not raise earlier, concerns staff and premises. I am sure that people have been taken on for different consultation bodies. The Minister is shaking his head—does that mean that that is not the case?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman is having a bit of fun at our expense. He knows that the only person who has been taken on is Ann Robinson, who will run the consumer council for the energy sector. There is nobody else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. However, I was under the impression that several people have been taken on for Ofgem. I hope that our postbags tomorrow will not contain pleas from people who are about to be made redundant and want to know what the Government are up to. 
<P>
It is most upsetting that this morning Ministers constantly repeated that they had listened to industry and come to the conclusion that they were wrong and should withdraw the provisions, yet this afternoon the Minister has told us frankly that they did not listen to industry at all. They did not even talk to the consumer bodies, which are the very kinds of organisations that are supposedly being set up to consult on other issues in the Bill.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Committee, the industry and consumers are being so treated. I hope that in future Ministers will consider carefully their assurances about the way in which the Government have been operating. This afternoon, they have not kept to what they told us only this morning.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 89 disagreed to.
<P>
Clauses 90 to 103 disagreed to.
<P>
Clause 126 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 104</center></H4>
<H4><center>Water Advisory Panel</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take clause 105 to clause 123 stand part, schedule 4 stand part, clause 125 stand part, clause 129 stand part and Government amendments Nos. 450 to 453, Government amendments Nos. 442 to 447 and Government amendments Nos. 455 to 465.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I propose to invite the Committee to disagree to clause 104 and clauses 105 to 123, clause 125, clause 129 and schedule 4. I shall also speak to amendments Nos. 442 to 447, Nos. 450 to 453 and Nos. 455 to 465, which will remove references to water from clauses 124 and 130, schedules 3, 5, 6 and 7 and the Bill's title.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs told the Committee last Thursday, and as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State told the House later that day, we no longer intend the provisions relating to the water sector to remain in the Bill. Instead, we intend to include the provisions in a new water Bill, which will be published in draft later this year. We aim to introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time permits. The water provisions were originally included in the Bill to follow up the commitment given in the White Paper, ``A Fair Deal for Consumers'', which was published in July 1998, and subsequent ministerial statements. We shall still honour those commitments.
<P>
Our proposals for the forthcoming water Bill were developed in parallel with work on this Bill—[Interruption.] I suddenly feel rather lonely on these Benches.—That led us to consider carefully which legislative vehicle would be the most appropriate for the water provisions that are currently in the Bill. We listened to the regulator, consumer representatives and companies that had made constructive suggestions about how to improve the Bill. We now propose that all the changes that we want to make to the regulatory framework for water during this Parliament should be done in one piece of new legislation. That will provide greater clarity and accessibility to the public, who will ultimately be the major beneficiaries of the legislation. It will also assist consumer groups, by helping them to understand the legislation, and the water and sewerage companies, because we shall make one change rather than two.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Under-Secretary said that a single Bill would be introduced this Session, although he also said that he had not yet arranged parliamentary time for that Bill. If he is not going to introduce that Bill during the next Session, will he guarantee that both of his statements are correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that no Government can give absolute guarantees. I can tell him only what the Government's intentions are—we want to introduce a new Bill during this Parliament and to publish a draft in the near future.
<P>
The decision is particularly relevant because of the Government's review of competition in the water industry. We shall publish a consultation paper during the next few weeks. Concern was expressed by consumer interest groups that we should not give the regulator new objectives or duties until we have taken into account the proposals that come from the consultation process. The result will be a more coherent regulatory regime for water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> A more coherent regulatory regime than what? More coherent than the regime that currently exists or than that which is proposed by the Bill?
<P>
It was interesting to watch the changeover of civil servants when we moved on to clause 104. There are no familiar faces—no civil servants who were with us during our earlier debates. It appears that few civil servants are responsible for ensuring the consistency of this clause with earlier clauses. We also saw Ministers disappear when the Under-Secretary began his opening remarks.
<P>
Those are trivial points, but that theatrical changeover demonstrates the deeper truth that there is fierce in-fighting between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry. I have documentary evidence in this regard—Dan Corry has said that there have been clashes between the two Departments. On which issues do those clashes hinge? That goes to the root of the matter. What sort of regulations will be produced when the consultation process has been completed? What is the Government's thinking in this context? What will the consultation document that is about to be drafted contain? I appreciate that the constraints of parliamentary time mean that the Under-Secretary cannot say when the final form of the Bill will be available, but when will the draft Bill be available? He has already confirmed—if I am wrong, I hope that he will correct me—that a draft Bill will be available. That is an improvement on the approach that was adopted with this Bill. We shall at least see some of the drafting errors, if there are any, in the Government's second attempt in relation to water.
<P>
In response to an intervention on Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he regretted the opposition of Ian Byatt, the water regulator, to the Bill. I remind Committee members of Mr. Byatt's comments. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Regulator will be festooned with detailed requirements . . . All laudable, all already being carried out, all, however, because of detailed over-prescription, likely to raise the costs but not the effectiveness of regulations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Byatt was very critical of the Bill. I was interested to hear what the Secretary of State said about how he intends to listen. He has listened to the industry and to consumer groups about how the Bill could be improved, but Mr. Byatt was clearly of the view that the Bill is over-regulatory, over-interventionist and over-prescriptive. That is also the industry's view.
<P>
This is an important point for the Committee to understand, because it will have an impact on what is left in the Bill. Does the Secretary of State intend to reduce the present regulatory interventionist approach to water in the Bill and make it a light-touch approach that encourages competition into the industry and backs off from regulation as the industry becomes more competitive? If he does, and he believes that the Utilities Bill approach to the water industry is over-regulatory and interventionist, as the regulator and the industry do, and he then proposes a similar form of regulation for telecommunications, that is extremely interesting.
<P>
There is a case to be made for the regulatory regime for telecommunications to be slightly more relaxed than that for electricity and gas, because at present there is more competition in telecommunications, although all the regimes should be fairly light-touch in order to anticipate future changes in the marketplace. However, given the current situation, telecommunications is probably the most imperative of the four utilities, followed by gas and electricity and, bringing up the rear, the water industry.
<P>
If, having taken these measures out of the Bill, the Government intend to introduce a much lighter regulatory touch, it seems odd that that should apply to water when it is less competitive than the utilities that remain in the bill—gas and electricity. Will the Minister propose a lighter regulatory touch for the water industry than exists in the Bill? On the other hand, he may say that the Government are applying a heavier regulatory touch to that sector because water is not very competitive, a natural monopoly exists and we need an interventionist regulatory approach to protect the consumer. If that is his view, how does he square it with the views of the regulator and the industry, which he claims to have consulted and listened to? Perhaps it is another case of having heard but not listened.
<P>
There is enormous criticism of what the Government have been doing to the water industry. The Times says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One would not start from here. Having been bogged down in trying to protect themselves from the worst that the Government and its draftsman had been at risk of inflicting, the water companies now look destined to spend more years in limbo, left to guess at the regulatory regime that they will face in the future.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if we could have a little more detail about when the Minister thinks he may be able to secure parliamentary time for the water Bill.
<P>
The Times goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They are paying the price, it seems, for the turf wars between Stephen Byers at the Department of Trade and Industry and John Prescott's sprawling Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. In the absence of agreement between the two over how the water industry should be regulated, it is back to the drawing board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is also the view of the industrial correspondent of The Times, who says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The removal of water from the Bill has alarmed some water industry chiefs who fear their companies will be left exposed to new, unknown provisions that will be drafted by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. They fear this will unnerve investors who are already cooling on the utilities in favour of Internet companies.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a good point. All this uncertainty and the incompetent way in which water has been handled in the bill add to uncertainties in the capital markets.
<P>
However much disdain old Labour Members, and indeed many new Labour members, have for the capital markets, they have an impact on the consumer. The more uncertainty and risk there is, the higher the premium the capital markets require to invest in those industries, and that in turn translates into the cost of capital. A capital-intensive industry such as water, which spends billions of pounds on rebuilding the ancient Victorian infrastructure, which was left to decline while the industry was in the state sector, will incur huge additional interest charges, which will be passed on to the consumer as sure as day follows night.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister would explain the broad thrust of the Government's approach to water regulation. Will it echo the Bill, or reflect the industry's worries about the Bill's contents, rather than mere procedural matters? Will he also give a little more detail on the consultation procedure and the timing of the draft Bill's publication?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> As I listened to the Under-Secretary, I waited in vain to hear why the water industry had been excluded from the Bill. Perhaps he will deploy those arguments more fully later. He explained what the Government decided to do but not why, and I hope that he will be more forthcoming in due course. We discussed the telecoms sector, and the water sector's withdrawal from the Bill seems to have been prompted by nothing new. Indeed, there is not even the excuse of stroppy letters from Vodafone or equivalent suppliers. The decision seems to have been plucked from the air.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was dismissive of any suggestion that interdepartmental conflict led to this change of mind, but even I am aware that the question of the level of environmental regulation and market regulation appropriate to water and other utilities has caused conflict.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was concentrating as hard as I was on the body language of Department of Trade and Industry officials, who ran from the Room—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should know better than to refer to officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> It would perhaps be out of order to comment on that, so I shall simply say that it may behove Ministers and their supporters to strive to counteract any impression of interdepartmental conflict, and I did not see the incident that the hon. Gentleman described.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats regret the withdrawal of the Bill's provisions on water for reasons relating to the likely impact on the regulatory regimes proposed for gas and electricity, as well as for water. There must be a suspicion that water industry regulation will be less market oriented than it would otherwise have been, and that regulation in the gas and electricity industries will be less environmentally oriented. Indeed, that may be the underlying intention behind, rather than a likely consequence of, removing the water industry from the Bill. Certainly, if there is any truth whatever in rumours of interdepartmental conflict, those would appear to be the points at stake.
<P>
After the announcement of the projected withdrawal from the Bill of water and telecoms provisions, the vultures are circling around the remaining parts. An Electricity Association press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What is needed is a much simpler Energy Utilities Bill concentrating on those provisions necessary to implement the New Electricity Trading Arrangements . . . business separation and key reforms of regulatory structure.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The scaled-down Bill that the Electricity Association would like contains nothing on consumers, social inclusion, the environment or the efficient use of energy. That is not a surprise or a criticism—the Electricity Association is, after all, a producer-driven trade association. It is now saying to the Government: ``You've taken water and telecoms out, let's have a Bill relating to the energy industries that is entirely market focused.'' That reinforces my point that by removing water provisions from the Bill there is a risk that the intention to tackle environmental and social inclusion rigorously will be diluted.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Allowing the dismemberment of the Bill to go ahead will have two consequences, neither of which is good. One is that market considerations will apply less to water services, and the other is that environmental considerations will apply less to gas and electricity services. I am still waiting for the reasons for that. There do not appear to be any reasons; there do not even appear to be any excuses. There are certainly no clear benefits. The dismemberment of the Bill leaves open deep risks of delay and uncertainty.
<P>
Will Ministers provide the Committee with assurances that cover the points that I have raised? It is not good enough for only one Minister from one Department to respond to the debate. These are cross-departmental issues, and we need to know all the answers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not merely prurience that makes us want an explanation? We do not merely want the gory details of the disputes between the two Departments. We want an explanation because it will show the issues at stake in the regulation of the sector. It will also show us the broad thrust of the approach of the Bill when it returns for consideration later in the Session.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I want to ask specific questions, to which I hope specific answers will be given. In some cases, those answers cannot come solely from one Department. I am not attempting to lend any credence to the idea of a departmental conflict. I am simply saying that, at the moment, it is the only explanation or supposition that is available. Will an assurance be given that, in deleting clauses 104 to 129, we will not weaken the already limited environmental regulatory powers in the remaining parts of the Bill? The gas and electricity industries should not be able to duck out of those regulator aims simply because water provisions have been excluded from the Bill and environment has a lower profile.
<P>
I want to press the Minister on the timing of the water Bill and of the process that it will go through. He referred to the draft water Bill being published shortly. ``Shortly'' is a flexible term, and it would be helpful if the Committee could hear whether that means before the summer recess, at the start of the next Session—
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman was not listening, was he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I would be happy to hear the Minister reply now or later on precisely what he means.
<P>
I want to refer the Minister to the question that I put to the Leader of the House and to the answer that she gave me on 2 March on the way in which the Utilities Bill has been dealt with up to now, and, by extension, what might be appropriate treatment for the draft Bill. I asked her whether it might not have been better if the Utilities Bill had been a draft Bill and had gone through the formal procedures set up by the House to consider such Bills, to produce improvements in a comparatively non-confrontational environment. Her answer would bear some examination by Ministers, because she suggested quite strongly that she thought that learned, there were lessons to learned, that perhaps that was one of them.
<P>
Will the Minister provide a timetable for the publication of the draft water Bill? Will he give us some assurance that it will go through the formal process of consideration as a draft Bill? Will he also reassure us that the subsequent Bill, which we hope will be announced in the Queen's Speech, will have passed through all its stages in the House and the other place by the end of April 2001? That may seem an arbitrary date, but it may not be unconnected with a likely date for a general election. I want to stress that these events will cause delay and uncertainty for the industry, and for others who will be affected by that Bill.
<P>
The representations made by the Electricity Association may not be typical. People might feel that they have been taken out of context, and I should be happy to debate that point. However, the Liberal Democrats require assurances that the removal of water provisions from the Bill will not lead to a weakening of the regulator regime that will protect consumers and the environment and ensure that market forces are regulated appropriately while being allowed to thrive.
<P>
I hope that we shall hear from both the Department of Trade and Industry and the DETR that they are fully alerted to these issues, and that, whatever the appearance of confusion and second thinking given by the progress of the Bill so far, they are on top of the subject. That might require some effort on their part, because what has happened so far has hardly been reassuring. However, we shall listen carefully and it will be interesting to see how the rest of the debate unfolds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It is puzzling to hear that Government have executed a U-turn almost on their own, while they try to suggest that some other influence has been brought to bear on them, either from the industry, consumers or elsewhere. There is no evidence of such influence.
<P>
We were told something that we already knew, as far as telecoms were concerned. That is, that telecoms will eventually be combined with communications and that the logic is that they should be regulated. The fact that we already knew that formed part of our earlier debate. Are we expecting the water industry to merge with something or to be changed fundamentally? I wonder, fancifully, whether there are plans to merge the water industry with the brewing industry . Such a plan could come only from a Labour Government. The Government are bound to end up watering down the workers' beer, and I suspect that such a proposal might be introduced.
<P>
One of the issues that could be affected by these measures is that many of the British water-producing industries and sewerage companies are now owned by overseas companies. I believe that Wessex Water Services Ltd. is now owned by Texas Utilities, although I am not certain. I declare an interest, in that there are still a few Texas Utilities shares in our household. However, many of our water companies are owned by French water companies or by other multiple utilities. Does that present any problems for the Government? Foreign-owned companies might be less happy for their shareholdings and their chairman's salary to be controlled by a British Act of Parliament. I hope that some light can be thrown on that.
<P>
I shall explain the basis of the situation. The Labour Opposition—and the Liberal Democrats, when they were in bed with Labour in opposition— constantly went on about the Conservatives not giving a damn about the consumer and allowing shareholders to make too much money. Having made such a fuss about it in opposition, Labour Members felt that when they got into government they were duty bound to legislate. The Government's problem has been that whenever they consider such matters, however much they may talk about social and environmental issues, their officials rightly tell them that they are going down an unsustainable path.
<P>
It is clear from the Committee's proceedings that the Government have seen the light and are finding every possible excuse to back down on the deal. When the Liberal Democrats sat on some Cabinet Committees, right at the beginning of the Government's period in office, one of the issues that interested them was environmental audit. Perhaps deals were done with the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) about what should be legislated on—although I do not suppose that the Liberal Democrats sitting here would have been consulted about any such deals. Now that he has moved on from the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, the Government may feel that they can throw such concerns away, because in reality they do not care about them. Having had to tell its older, supposedly more left-wing, members that it would legislate to deal with these issues, new Labour now finds itself in the embarrassing position that there is no need for legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I might be deeply out of order, Mr. Hood, if I were to engage in the discussion that the hon. Gentleman has instigated. As I am sure that he is aware, the co-operation between the two parties was based on a specific agenda of constitutional change, which is a long way from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises constitutional change. Scotland's water industry is not regulated in the way that the Bill stipulates. By negativing the clauses, the Government may be attempting to reunify water policy across the entire United Kingdom. They may feel that they have particular difficulties in that respect in Scotland, where the Labour party forms a minority Administration in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. I do not expect Ministers to admit that to the Committee, because that would let the out of the bag, but they have not yet explained why the Government are withdrawing the water provisions from the Bill.
<P>
If the Government feel that changing the regulation of the water industry can be left to another Parliament, why is it necessary for the electricity and gas industries to have such regulation? When one considers the reality of what is intended in respect of the electricity and gas industries, and what would have been the reality in the water industry, little change is apparent. In effect, the Government have said: ``Sorry, we spent 18 years criticising the Conservatives for privatising the water, gas, electricity and telecoms industries, but we now have to admit that they were absolutely right. Those industries are now in such a position that they do not need additional change or additional regulators.'' They are now desperately trying to get out of that situation.
<P>
I am disappointed that I have not had the opportunity to discuss some important issues relating to the water industry. Recently in my constituency, and I suspect in many others, enormous additional investment in the water industry has meant that many water projects, especially sewerage projects, have affected constituents.
<P>
Water quality immediately comes to mind when talking about the water industry, but in many ways its most important task is what it does with what comes out at the other end—sewage. My constituents in Swanage were promised a wonderful new flood relief and sewerage scheme, which would be provided by tunnelling underneath the town without any problem whatever. Unfortunately, all sorts of buildings were damaged. I was looking forward to our debates to find out whether the consumer bodies would be able to help my constituents or the authority would be able to deal with it.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
 The sewerage works in Weymouth has been subject to massive excavations, to provide the quality required of companies disposing of waste. That, again, has given rise to enormous problems for those living next to the facilities. We shall not have an opportunity to discuss those issues in Committee. Having given assurances to consumers that those matters would be discussed, the Government no longer intend to do so.
<P>
We all know that the word ``new'' is the one that the Labour party likes best. Another word is ``modernise'': that is a great word. ``Modernise'' means nothing; anything that one does tomorrow is more modern than it was yesterday. It does not matter how bad it is: it is modern. ``New'' has a similar connotation. It does not have to be better to be new it simply has to be different.
<P>
The Government have spent a great deal of taxpayers' money making things new and modern, but they have failed to make things better. Having withdrawn the clauses and said that there is no need to modify the regulations surrounding the water industry, the Government should consider carefully whether they can save themselves a great deal of time and trouble by letting the other two thirds of the Titanic sink to the bottom. When you are reading out the list of clauses, Mr. Hood, you might mistakenly go through the whole list, omitting them all. Then, by 7 o'clock, we shall have put the Bill where it deserves to be—at the bottom of the Atlantic.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I want to speak briefly on clause 120 in particular. The Government made much of what they felt was a system that enabled directors of water companies and other utilities to receive, at the expense of consumers, unconscionable remuneration packages that needed to be the subject of regulation. That is why four similar clauses dealt with that subject. The clause dealing with it in relation to water was clause 120.
<P>
If that was such an important subject on which to legislate, why is it now necessary to withdraw that proposal and perhaps reintroduce it in a year or two, or later? Does that not show that the Government do not really have a cast-iron commitment to legislating for the utilities? They simply wanted to create the impression of activity, but, at the first possible excuse, they have chosen to abandon the proposal for the time being—
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> To cut and run.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> As my hon. Friend says, to cut and run, and to return to it on another occasion.
<P>
If there is a case for introducing a link between remuneration and service standards for the directors of utilities, that case must surely apply to all utilities rather than just to gas and electricity. Indeed, arguably, because the water industry is subject to less competition than the other three utilities, the case for dealing with regulation of its directors' remuneration and service standards is strongest. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would explain why the provision will not be proceeded with. It would not be difficult to do so and it does not need to differ from the same proposal relating to electricity and gas. Is he saying that if the provision is included in a draft Bill for discussion, the Government would agree to that Bill having different phraseology, standards and regulation relating to the link between directors' remuneration and service standards compared with those applying to electricity and gas? If not, what is the purpose of delaying the legislation?
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the creation of a more coherent regulatory regime would be facilitated. I do not understand how removing clause 120 will assist with that objective, which he said is at the forefront of the Government's mind.
<P>
Will the new legislation on water cover water in Scotland, where residents may face a 50 per cent. rise in water bills over the next two or three years, when water bills for consumers in England are likely to fall in real terms? If regulation is necessary to protect water consumers, surely that regulatory control should be implemented more urgently in Scotland than in England.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the draft legislation will be introduced later this year, but did not say whether that would be before or after the end of this Session. It seems unlikely that it will be possible to introduce primary legislation in the next Session and, in view of the chaos that has arisen from the Government's changes to the Bill, surely he owes it to the industry to clarify his proposed timetable for the legislation. There is a precedent for that. During the previous Session, it was proposed that a Bill covering electronic commerce would be announced in the Queen's Speech, but when it became clear that the Government would not be able to achieve their legislative objective, they made a declaration before the Queen's Speech so that the industry would know where it stood. They overrode the convention that the Queen's Speech could not be anticipated, because they realised that because of the way in which the industry had been messed around on the e-commerce Bill, the least they could do was to spell out their exact legislative intentions. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would spell out, in words of one syllable, whether the Government intend to introduce primary legislation covering the water industry in the next Session.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall deal first with the matter of when the draft Bill will be available and our intentions for the future. Despite the invitation of the hon. Member for Christchurch, I cannot override the Queen's Speech. He will not be surprised to hear that I lack the authority to do so.
<P>
The draft Bill will be published later this Session. I hope that that will be done before the summer, although I cannot guarantee that. The hon. Gentleman, who has been in government, will know that offering such categorical assurances makes one a hostage to fortune.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Under-Secretary said that the draft Bill would be published before the summer. Did he mean before the summer recess?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes. I hope that it will be published before the summer recess. The consultation paper on the review of competition will be available, I hope, very soon.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked about pre-legislative scrutiny. I can offer him no assurances. I agree that legislation is often improved by such scrutiny. We may have a candidate in this context; I do not know. However, I lack the authority to give the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he seeks.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked whether we intended to lighten the touch. I cannot rule out minor changes, technical or otherwise—we intend to listen to further representations from interested parties, Mr. Byatt included—but the principles will remain the same. I hope that that rules out some of the uncertainty that the hon. Gentleman had foreseen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): My hon. Friend will be aware that I was concerned about the Water Industry Act 1991, in particular about the use of meters in my constituency. I was mollified at the time by the assurance that consumers would be crucial in the process. Will my hon. Friend give an assurance that the draft Bill will give the consumer council a crucial role?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I certainly give my hon. Friend an assurance that the consumer interest will be fundamental to the draft Bill. He may want to make representations when the draft Bill appears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Under-Secretary has just said that he cannot rule out minor changes, technical or otherwise, but that the principles will remain the same. Will he confirm that there have been no disputes of principle between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry regarding the regulation of water?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, I can confirm that. I am not aware of any disputes of principle. The hon. Member for South Dorset gave a fanciful account of alleged divisions, and Opposition Members have come up with several conspiratorial reasons for our proposed changes. Personally, I like a good conspiracy, but I have learnt over the years that the facts do not always support one's prejudices.
<P>
We have a simple reason for introducing changes in relation to water, and there is no need to look for a complicated explanation when a simple one is available, Our proposal is to make one major change rather than two changes to the way in which the industry is regulated. One of the representations that we have received from consumer groups and from others expressed the view that it would not be wise to introduce a major change to the regulatory system by passing the Bill and to introduce another Bill a little further down the line. On reflection, we decided to adopt that advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I certainly defer to the Under-Secretary in his experience of exploring conspiracies. He has a strong track record on that. When it is not conspiracy it is sometimes cock-up. Would he not accept that the factors that he has described were all present and well known to the Government before they published the first Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am reluctant to use the term ``cock-up'', but Governments sometimes have second thoughts. We are proceeding accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Opposition believe that the Government are quite clever. We find it difficult to understand how a clever Government, who have such control over everything that is going on, can suggest that these are the real reasons. The Minister is well known as an expert in freedom of information and matters such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. He is doing the water Bill because he cannot talk on any of those issues. Why are the provisions on water being removed from this Bill?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not know whether the Government are clever. Some of my right hon. and hon. Friends are much cleverer than I am. I am just a simple country boy myself. The answer is simple. This is a purely practical matter. We have, on reflection, and taking into account the many representations made to us, decided that this could all be better done in one Bill, rather than two. That is why we are proceeding as we are.
<P>
Some mention has been made of the consumer interest. A press release a few days ago from the Ofwat national customer council stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it sees new opportunities to ensure customers get an even fairer deal after the government postponed plans to change the regulatory framework of the water industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have been concerned that the powers proposed by Government for the Consumer Council for Water would not be strong enough It was becoming clear, because of the size and complexity of the Utilities Bill and its tight timetable, that these concerns would not receive proper attention. There will now be time to get the proposals right before they are introduced in the Water Bill. We are not entirely without support from the consumer side of the business.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked whether we intended to weaken the remaining gas and electricity clauses. No, we do not. The hon. Member for Christchurch asked whether the new Bill would deal with Scotland. It will not. He also asked about directors' salaries and why we were not leaving in clause 120. There is no point in leaving in little bits relating to water in the Bill. It would be cleaner and wiser to do the whole thing in one go.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Is the Minister assuring the Committee that the legislation on water will contain identical clauses relating to remuneration, service and standards of practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No. They will not be identical but the principles will be the same. There will be either technical or other changes in the Bill as the result of representations that we shall no doubt receive between now and the finalisation of our plan.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset indulged in a fair amount of ill-informed speculation, the most far out of which was whether foreign ownership was a factor in our consideration. No, it was not.
<P>
I conclude by saying what we have done for the consumer with regard to water. We have quite a good tale to tell. No hon. Member can say that we have not taken the interests of the consumer seriously. This year there will be a large decrease in prices and the beginnings of a huge investment in environmental improvement. We have ended the practice that was permitted under the previous Government of dumping sewage into the sea and then getting around the European directive by saying that the North sea is an area of high natural dispersion—an entirely bogus scientific concept dreamed up solely for that purpose.
<P>
Leakages are down by a fifth. More of our beaches are passing the test set by the EC directive and drinking water quality has improved. As far as the consumer is concerned, we have a pretty good tale to tell and we need apologise to no one. I repeat, however, that we intend to bring together all our proposed measures in one Bill as soon as possible. We remain committed to making the same changes as before. There may be some minor improvements, but that is all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed by that response, as industry—and, ultimately, the consumer—will be too. Consumers will be saddled with the costs that the Bill's principles will inflict on them as a result of higher regulatory risks, higher capital costs and other burdens. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be serious about his commitment to listen to representations from all parties interested in the regulation of the water industry. If he listens, rather than just hears, he will probably not proceed with a Bill based on these principles.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was categorical that the new Water Bill will adopt the principles set out in the Utilities Bill with no more than technical or minor changes. That shows that he has not thought through his approach and it might lead some people to believe that there is no point in making representations because the Government have already made up their minds that only minor changes will be allowed. I hope that that will not be the Minister's approach and that he will genuinely listen to the many concerns of industry and the regulator.
<P>
The Under-Secretary nods, but there is an important conflict here. He cannot say that he will pursue the principles of the Bill with only minor and technical changes and say at the same time that he will listen seriously to the views of the regulator and of industry. Those two views are diametrically opposed. There are huge concerns about the fundamental principles of the Bill, as they affect the water sector and, indeed, the other three sectors. I am disappointed by what the Under-Secretary said and I urge him to rethink.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on the Under-Secretary's assertion that the prices of water for consumers have fallen, especially in Scotland? Is his statement accurate about Scotland, or should further legislation be passed for the benefit of the Scottish consumer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Huge increases will be inflicted on the Scottish consumer of water, which is staggering. That demonstrates how successful privatisation has been in keeping prices under control. An enormous amount was invested in the water industry following privatisation in England and Wales. Although prices increased in England and Wales to reflect that investment, they will be as nothing in comparison to the price rises that will be seen in Scotland while water remains in the state sector. It is easy to see the efficiencies that arise once industries are removed into the private sector. All the extra costs go into new investment; none is wasted on unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and waste.
<P>
In conclusion, industry will be disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response and I hope that he will not stick to the principles that he outlined to the Committee today. I hope that he will genuinely listen to the real concerns of industry, the regulator and others about the principles in the new Bill, particularly regarding the water sector. If he does so, it should have a smooth passage when it is drafted. If he does not and he persists in the same dog's breakfast, albeit with minor and technical changes, he will face the same level of opposition that the DTI faced with the current Utilities Bill.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at least every five years and on a long term basis'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendment relates to the period for which the Secretary of State shall issue guidance. It aims to ensure that no Secretary of State—or no future Secretary of State, to be generous and fair to the current incumbent goes to sleep on the job of dealing with such important issues.
<P>
The amendment states that a review should take place on a set time scale; it should not simply be left to the Secretary of State to decide on the time that elapses between reviews, which are clearly needed. If one considers the issues at stake—the social and environmental matters relating to the gas industry the Secretary of State's guidance will clearly be significant. Furthermore, the environment in which that guidance must be made may change rapidly in the future. Changes are already occurring rapidly in the market structure, and there might be changes in social and economic conditions. Hon. Members of all parties are discussing how to make progress on social inclusion, which is of great concern to the Government, and certainly to Liberal Democrat Members. On Friday, in private Members' business, the House will debate the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The Government are being subjected, at various levels, to pressure and lobbying to respond and introduce relevant policies.
<P>
In an undoubtedly rapidly changing energy market, and a rapidly changing social and cultural environment, it is proper for the Secretary of State's guidance to be kept up to date, and to be provided in a timely and appropriate way. The essence of the amendment is that, whatever else happens, the guidance will be reviewed and refreshed every five years. That five-year term is broadly consistent with the lifetime of a Parliament and ensures that every Government will have not simply the opportunity but the obligation to bring before the regulatory authorities and into the light of day their views about these vital matters of social and environmental concern. One way in which the inertia of Government functions is that it is possible, simply by inaction, for a Government to inherit their predecessor's policies. By failing to make statements or to comment proactively on a topic, they can allow matters to continue along a course that they had sternly criticised in the past.
<P>
The amendment is would make the process of government more transparent and place on a Secretary of State an obligation to come to the House and set out clearly to the regulatory authorities the guidance that he or she thought appropriate. Hon. Members would then have an opportunity to bring their views to bear, and a public debate could take place.
<P>
This is not a complex amendment with subtle, hidden side-effects. It is a straightforward amendment to ensure that no Secretary of State can hide behind his predecessor's actions or inactions, but must confront the issues and provide an opportunity and a forum for debate. I hope that it will find favour with the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> The amendments have two purposes. First, they define the time frame in which the Secretary of State should issue guidance, ensuring that new statutory guidance to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is issued every five years as a minimum. They also state that the guidance should be based on long-term policies and objectives.
<P>
The Government believe that regulatory stability must be maximised by avoiding the issuing and reissuing of guidance. Constant changes to the guidance would contribute to regulatory instability and cause the cost of capital to rise, to the ultimate detriment of consumers. It is not appropriate to impose an arbitrary frequency on the issuing of guidance, irrespective of whether new developments or policy changes require it to be reissued. Indeed, if the guidance is focused on the Government's long-term policies and objectives—amendments Nos. 227 and 243 seem to suggest that the hon. Member for Lewes would support that—it might not be necessary for the Secretary of State to issue guidance every five years.
<P>
The point common to both amendments is that guidance should be issued on a long-term basis. The Government set the social and environmental policy objectives that will be contained in the guidance, so the content of the guidance will depend on what those policies and objectives are. It would be madness if the Government issued guidance that was intended to last several years which did not include long-term policies and objectives.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Lewes examines the draft statutory guidance to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, he will see that it focuses almost entirely on long-term policies and goals. Therefore, we must ensure that guidance is a flexible tool that the Government can use in a variety of circumstances. Circumstances may dictate, for instance, that medium or even shorter-term goals are included in the guidance. The hon. Gentleman's amendments would prevent that. I therefore resist them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am sorry to hear the Minister's approach. He says that he does not want to see advice chopping and changing. We understand that: a regulatory system must contain stability. The introduction of a review period does not require the advice to be changed: it simply requires it to be considered again and, where fitting, changes made. If one looks at the history of regulation in the industry, a five-year time frame for ensuring some overhaul seems not reasonable. From that point of view, I do not find the resistance that the Minister offered to my amendments convincing.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 243, the Minister thinks that long-term requirements are already built in, and that it is unlikely that, in considering future changes, a Secretary of State would fail to take long-term policy into account. That is reassuring if true, but the amendment would seem a wise safeguard. It would ensure that some short-term tactical changes to regulatory systems—which may benefit consumers in, say, the run-up to an election—do not take precedence over the long-term regulatory structure. For instance, consumers would be protected in the long term by the introduction of fuel efficiency and other measures, which ought to be in place.
<P>
I am disappointed by the Government's response to the amendments, and I hope that these are matters to which we can return, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
