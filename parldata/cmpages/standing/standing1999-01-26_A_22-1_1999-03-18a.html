<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In case there is any confusion among Committee members--I understand that there may well have been some in an earlier sitting--a revised selection list has been produced. I hope that all those who intend to speak or to follow our debates this afternoon have that revised list of the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments. 
<H4><center>Clause 226 </center></H4>
<H4><center>The spatial development strategy </center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 221, in page 114, line 22, leave out from "shall" to "prepare" in line 23.--[Mr. Raynsford.] 
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point of order Mr. Winterton. Do you mean clause 226? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 221 to clause 226 was debated when we discussed clause 33. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1084, in page 114, line 23, after "document", insert-- 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be based on the boroughs' views and".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 1095, in clause 235, page 119, line 10, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(ba) the unitary development plans of the London boroughs and any published proposals for the alteration or replacement of such unitary development plans".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that the hon. Gentleman is now clear about exactly what we are discussing. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister kindly reminded me that we debated amendment No. 221 some two months ago, so I hope that my temporary lapse of memory in respect of that amendment--whatever its implications may have been--is understandable. 
<P>
We have come to another very serious group of clauses. What we are trying to cover today is almost a Bill in itself. We will do our best to cover it at a decent pace. Perhaps I can start by noting that we shall be taking almost a Second Reading approach in our amendments to this part of the Bill. 
<P>
While there is a role for strategic planning on a Londonwide basis, there is concern that the planning provisions will add an unnecessary extra tier to the current planning system, which could increase delays and costs and harm London's economic development without necessarily improving the decision-making process. 
<P>
London's current planning structure is well known. There is a national policy under the Secretary of State; there is a regional policy, which is more commonly known to everyone as SERPLAN, or the south-east regional planning conference, and which works under regional planning guidance 9; and there is a strategic policy, which works under RPG3 and is operated by the Secretary of State proposals from the London boroughs and the common council, more commonly known as the London Planning Advisory Committee, or LPAC. Then, of course, there will be unitary development plans, which are prepared by the London boroughs. 
<P>
It would be helpful if we switched quickly to acronyms rather than talking in lengthy phrases. I shall hereafter refer to unitary development plans as UDPs and to the spatial development strategy as SDS. I hope that that will be of assistance to Hansard staff. 
<P>
Planning control under the tiers that I mentioned is two-tiered--planning applications are determined by the London boroughs unless an application is called in by the Secretary of State to decide for himself. The Bill proposes a third tier. Strategic policy is to be set by the mayor with the London boroughs, but the boroughs will have no greater role in policy making than members of the public. That is one of our first concerns. The boroughs' UDPs will be in general conformity with the mayor's strategic policy. Three tiers will therefore be in place. Planning applications are to be determined by the boroughs, but the mayor will be able to direct refusal of specific applications, which will usually be major. The Minister set that out in answer to a parliamentary question a couple of days ago. The Secretary of State still has a power to call in applications. 
<P>
The Opposition have a different approach. We agree that the mayor should take over strategic policy, but there should be formal borough involvement. That strategic policy should be given the same status as RGP3, which is what LPAC has at the moment. We also want to leave out of the Bill or to limit severely the mayor's power to direct refusal. If the mayor is concerned about an application, he should be able to ask the Secretary of State to call it in. That is the approach proposed by the amendments. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1084 would make subsection (1) state: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor shall ... prepare and publish a document to be based on the boroughs' views and to be known as the 'spatial development strategy'."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would therefore require the mayor to base the strategy on the boroughs' views. 
<P>
I am optimistic that I may be able to persuade the Minister to accept the amendment. He will be aware that the Deputy Prime Minister pledged on Second Reading that the strategic plan would be based on boroughs' views. The Opposition have not sought to exaggerate that pledge, and the amendment is based exactly on the Deputy Prime Minister's words on Second Reading. 
<P>
The Bill stipulates that the boroughs will be first able to express an opinion on the SDS when it is published in draft for public consultation. It involves them in the process to some extent, but does not require the mayor to follow their views or to pay special attention to them. The amendment would strengthen the role of the boroughs, which know what is going on in their areas. The boroughs will carry out the vast majority of planning, so we hope and expect that the Government will fulfil the Deputy Prime Minister's pledge. Amendment No. 1095 follows through that theme. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Like the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) I should like to make one or two general comments about this part of the Bill. I shall try to keep those comments brief and then move on to the detail of the amendments. 
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the record of our current discussions should contain a list of abbreviations at the beginning so that we can all speak in the shorthand relevant to this part of the Bill. The spatial development strategy--or SDS, as it should perhaps now be referred to--provides to London and to the mayor a useful tool in integrating the various policies and strategies that the mayor is responsible for putting together. It is where different strategies come together and where issues of conflict should be resolved. It should harmonise the strategies and ensure that they fit together. 
<P>
The clauses give us hope that that is the Government intention, and are reassuring to that extent. The provisions allow the London boroughs to have reasonable involvement. Perhaps more importantly, they allow to the public and to other interested communities in Greater London involvement in developing strategy. 
<P>
The issue that concerns us most relates to a point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. How will the boroughs relate to the SDSs, and how will UDPs be informed by them? The SDS is a new creature in the planning world. It will not have the same standing as the structure plan; it will have a slightly different standing. However, as I understand it, it will form a material consideration in planning applications. All those matters mean that we need to be clear exactly how those things will relate to each other--I shall return to a number of questions as we proceed through the clauses. 
<P>
The amendments raise an important question about the need to build the boroughs much more closely into the process of drawing up the SDS. I entirely agree with the sentiment behind the points made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, but I am not sure that the amendment will have the effect that he intends. The amendment states that the SDS shall be based on the views of the London boroughs. That can only mean that it must draw on the UDPS. 
<P>
The problem with that is the UDPs are running at different rates and are at different stages in their development. Some are old and are now under review; some are just about to be adopted; some are undergoing public inquiry. To try to pull together a single spatial development strategy for London based on those plans would result in a patchwork quilt, rather than something that would enable the mayor to take a view of the current situation and how we should move in future. 
<P>
As the UDPs are on statutory timetables, it is not easy to knit them all together. However, the hon. Gentleman may have something else in mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Unless the amendment is passed, the SDS will not be based on the boroughs' views. Somehow, the boroughs must have an input before the mayor's first draft is published. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is entirely right. As I read the Bill, the boroughs will be involved at the second stage; by then much work will already have been done to formulate the plan. There is a doubt about whether even the functioning bodies are directly involved in the first stage of drawing up the plan. London First has some interesting analysis. It has identified a seven-stage process that the Bill will put in place, which does not involve the boroughs until about stages five or six. They will not have a chance to have their say until a long way through the process. 
<P>
As I understand it, the first stage will be that the mayor will prepare a draft SDS. At the second stage, there will be consultation with the assembly and functioning bodies. At the third stage, there will be redrafting to take account of views put to the mayor. At the fourth stage, the London boroughs will be consulted, along with all other organisations that the mayor deems to be appropriate. The mayor will then publish the SDS--presumably, taking into account the views of the boroughs and others. Then there will be stage six, which will be public examination of the SDS. Finally, although it is not explicit in the Bill, the definitive SDS will be published. 
<P>
That is a lengthy process, and it will be interesting to hear how long Ministers envisage it taking especially in the first instance. Producing the first SDS, with the need to involve the boroughs and draw in other parties to ensure that everyone feels that the strategy meets the needs of London, is bound to be a lengthy, time-consuming process. We have only to consider how long it takes a London borough to produce a unitary development plan to realise that it takes an awful long time to move from early draft to final adoption. We will be interested to return to that later. 
<P>
We agree with the sentiments of the amendments, but other later amendments deal with the question of involvement of the boroughs. The boroughs need to be involved earlier in the process than is currently provided for in the Bill. Our view is that they should be involved at the first stage, alongside the assembly and the functional bodies. It would be better to amend a later clause to achieve that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be aware that amendment No. 1095 adds the same provision to clause 235, which may be what he has in mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As I understand the procedure, the only amendment on which we can vote is amendment No. 1084. If amendment No.1095 had been moved first, that might have gone some way towards addressing my general concerns. Liberal Democrat Members will not support amendment No. 1084 for the reasons that I have outlined. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I oppose the amendment because, apart from anything else, the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"based on the boroughs' views"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is poorly defined and would create significant difficulties. Clause 227, which deals with public participation, clearly sets out how the mayor will prepare the spatial development strategy in consultation with the London boroughs as well as with other bodies. 
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The wording is based entirely on the words of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is he who said that the strategic plan will be based on the boroughs' views. We have simply taken those words from the mouth of the great skin-diver himself and brought them to the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Right hon. and hon. Members make all sorts of statements in the House, but their statements do not necessarily enter legislation as legal definitions. When the mayor is devising the strategy he or she will need to take into account the views of the London boroughs. However, it would be impossible to base the strategy on all the boroughs, because they may be in conflict through their UDPs. On which of the London boroughs would the strategy be based? The various UDPs and views of the boroughs must be taken into account in devising the strategy, which would require the amendment to be worded differently. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the hon. Gentleman finds his own leader's words unacceptable, he may like to look at the wording of amendment No. 1095, which would require that the mayor shall have regard to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the unitary development plans of the London boroughs".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It cannot be put more clearly than that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The Bill is clear on this point. The public participation process has to take into account the views of the various boroughs and involve them through the preparation of their UDPS. There is nothing inconsistent in what I have said. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has in mind the words of President Nixon's press Secretary, Ron Ziegler, who announced, "Yesterday's statement is inoperative." 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I return to the point that I made a few moments ago. If legislation were to incorporate every word that was uttered at the Dispatch Box to make points in debates, it would make our laws even more difficult to understand than they are now. When legislation is drafted there must be a clear understanding of definitions, and they must take into account existing planning law. For the Bill to include the words that the Opposition suggest, although they were uttered supportively on Second Reading-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> He is rubbishing the leader! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I am not rubbishing the leader. The Opposition's amendment would require the mayor to base his strategy on the views of the London boroughs, which would make his task almost impossible. The views of the London boroughs must be taken into account, and those views will be expressed in various ways, notably through the UDPs. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> At what stage does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the mayor takes into account the London boroughs' proposals? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) set out the timetable in that respect, in accordance with the briefing received from London First, which has six or seven stages. However, it will be imperative for the mayor to act quickly. The development and preparation of the spatial development plan should be as speedy as possible to give London the maximum advantage. It follows that the mayor should be developing the spatial development strategy at the beginning, and will at that stage need to take into account the views of the boroughs. That may be done through a UDP or other forms of consultation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but that is not what the Bill says. That is the point of the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Clause 227 clearly provides what I have said. We shall come to it later. It deals with participation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): It is good to see you back again, Mr. Winterton. I was much impressed with the preamble of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, which put this pair of amendments most effectively in context, namely that this party seeks to ensure that the spatial development strategy reflects the wishes of the people on the ground. It should not he imposed on them by the mayor. That is the risk, as the Bill stands. 
<P>
I am always happy when my hon. Friends seek to encodify statements made on the Floor of the House by Her Majesty's Ministers if they can thereby ensure that the appropriate amendment is accepted by Her Majesty's Government. If the Government negate amendment No. 1084, it will mean that what the Deputy Prime Minister declared on the Floor of the House is null and void. Or, if it is not null and void, perhaps his language was more of the nautical than the legalistic draftsman's variety. 
<P>
Her Majesty's Government really should consider this long and hard, because there is a real risk of conflict. Local people will resent the fact that their local authority's plans--their UDPs, their ideas of how the environment should be protected and what areas of their borough development should be permitted, and their own particular worries and concerns--will be overriden by a strategic development imposed from on high by the mayoralty. 
<P>
The pair of amendments, although seemingly minor and a detail, reveal a fundamental difference in philosophical approach between our party and the Government, and perhaps even their paid-up subsidiary, the Liberal Democrats. We shall see. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1095 to clause 235 received a modicum of support from the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. We shall see whether that support is translated into actual commitment, either by dividing on the amendment or by pressing to have amendments introduced on Report. We believe that the planning process should be driven from the bottom up to reflect the wishes of local communities, especially at borough level. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This is a revelation--a completely new Conservative policy and approach to planning. Could the hon. Gentleman tell us when that policy was announced and in which document it is set out? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the hon. Gentleman please address the Chair? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Winterton--I got carried away. I would be very interested if the hon. Gentleman could indicate in which policy papers the policy has been announced, and where we might find them. They will make the most interesting reading, as they bear no relation to the policy and practice of the previous Conservative Government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Obviously, the hon. Gentleman has not studied RPG3 as carefully as he should have. [Laughter.] If he found the planning guidance long-winded, the much pithier phraseology of the Deputy Prime Minister says it all, and I hope that it convinces the Committee. 
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> This has been a useful introductory debate to this part of the Bill which introduces the planning powers for the mayor and the role of the spatial development strategy. 
<P>
We have heard some interesting propositions from the Front and Back Benches of the official Opposition. Let me summarise the critique of our position given by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. First, we are creating an unnecessary extra tier in the planning process and secondly, the boroughs should have a stronger, formal role in the process. That view was enunciated, perhaps rather more graphically, by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), who has clearly taken to heart his leader's suggestion that the entire history of Conservatism prior to 1997 should be junked. I will not comment on that, but I notice the fervour with which he wishes to rewrite the Conservative philosophy on planning. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said yesterday, the opening passage of the replacement of clause IV says that the Labour party is a democratic socialist party. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth Bromley and Chislehurst): The Minister mentioned the Prime Minister just now and, in the previous sentence, the junking of previous views. Does he recall the Prime Minister's election address in 1983 and his views about, among other things, the European Union and nuclear disarmament? Would the hon. Gentleman like to draw any conclusions from that? </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is most interesting, and I would be most interested in the answer, but not in this Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I bow to your guidance, Mr. Winterton. I was looking forward to a most interesting debate with the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) on the then Prime Minister's views in her election manifesto in 1983 about Europe, leading to the signing of the Single European Act, which she signed. However, that would be taking us far beyond the subject before us, and I shall come back very rapidly to the spatial development strategy. 
<P>
In answer to the two critiques of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, we are not introducing an unnecessary extra tier; we are creating a very streamlined procedure to give a strategic dimension which is there already and is necessary in the planning process in London. The hon. Gentleman referred to the south-east regional planning conference. Serplan is not integral to the London planning process. Its role is to co-ordinate between London and the south-east, for quite obvious reasons, and that co-ordination will continue to be necessary, but that is not material to the London structures. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the London Planning Advisory Committee. Quite rightly, that is a current structure, but he will know that under the Bill's provisions, LPAC is being subsumed into the new Greater London authority, so no additional tier is being created. He also referred to RPG3, the strategic guidance issued by the Secretary of State. It has had to be issued by the Secretary of State, on receipt of advice from LPAC, because there is no strategic body and there has not been one since the abolition of the GLC. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should ponder on this, because with the restoration of a strategic authority in London and with the framework of the SDS that we are putting in place, there will no longer be a need for the Secretary of State to issue regional guidance in the form of RPG3 or any successor. So we are not creating a new tier of planning.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I do not disagree with that. However, LPAC is not being incorporated on the same terms under which it currently operates, and as defined in RPG3. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Of course not, because LPAC currently gives advice to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State has to act in the absence of a strategic authority. Under the new arrangements, the strategic authority will itself, through the SDS, be enunciating the strategic approach that is vital to the planning process. 
<P>
I should have thought that that was pretty clear from the procedures set out in the Bill. 
<P>
To answer the second point made by the hon. Gentleman in his critique--that the boroughs should have a stronger, formal role--the boroughs already have an important formal role in the process. They will be properly consulted on the formulation of the SDS and their views will certainly be fully taken into account. That is the point that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister rightly made on Second Reading. However, it is wrong to suggest that the boroughs should determine the SDS, for the good reason that my hon. 1329 1330 Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) stressed in his useful contribution to the debate: the boroughs may well disagree. Different boroughs may well have different views. To say that the mayor is bound to base the SDS solely on what the boroughs say could create a difficult, if not impossible, position if the boroughs disagreed. 
<P>
<H5>3 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why did the Deputy Prime Minister say it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My right hon. Friend was focusing on the importance of the mayor consulting the boroughs, listening to their views and taking them into account when formulating the spatial development strategy. The boroughs themselves recognise that that is the appropriate way forward. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Rubbish. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman says rubbish. I remind him what the Association of London Government says in its response to the provisions. In its briefing note, it writes: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"this clause will deliver the new type of pan-London development strategy that the boroughs have sought."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman does not speak for the bodies whose interests he claims to represent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Would the Minister care to explain the consultation process that the ALG conducted before writing that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will be only too well aware, I do not speak for the ALG, and it is not for me to comment on its consultation process. It is pretty rich of the hon. Gentleman to claim to speak for the boroughs and then, when reminded that the official body that speaks for the boroughs--the ALG--takes a different view, to try to rubbish it. That is entirely typical of an approach that is not in tune with the view of the London boroughs. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): The Minister has just proposed the possibility of a conflict between strategies and plans. In our debate on the London development agency, the Minister for Transport in London, in response to my question about how a compromise would be achieved between objectives of competitiveness and social exclusion, told me firmly that that problem had been totally solved, because a series of strategies that we had discussed earlier would always be made to cohere. What is sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the gander. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is not demonstrating his usual sharpness in those comments. The arrangements for ensuring consistency between the GLA's strategies, for which precise arrangements are made in the Bill, are a very different matter from consistency between the GLA's views and those of the London boroughs. I readily accept that the London boroughs will not always agree; there is no reason why they should always be in uniformity. Westminster will not always agree with the City, both of which are represented by the right hon. Gentleman. That would create real problems if the mayor were required to formulate the spatial development strategy exclusively on the views of the boroughs. Those views may differ. 
<P>
I return to the question of how the spatial development strategy will be drawn up. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was concerned about the length of time that the process might take. He quoted London First, but incorrectly, I think. It describes the seven-stage process, but consultation with the borough takes place at the fourth stage, not the sixth.  The first two stages are designed to ensure consistency between the spatial development strategy and the other GLA strategies--a point that I was making in response to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister is correct, although I corrected myself as I set out the seven stages.  However, the fact that the boroughs are brought in at the fourth stage rather than earlier is still a matter of concern, although I acknowledge the need ensure that all the strategies are brought together within the SDS.  Will the Minister undertake to see whether anything can be done further to streamline the process and bring the boroughs in at an earlier stage, so that the UDPs can be taken into account earlier? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's wish to streamline the process as much as possible, but I hope that once I have explained the system he will accept that it is not possible to bring the boroughs in at an earlier stage. The first two stages are designed to ensure that the SDS is compatible and consistent with the other GLA strategies. That is an internal process. The third stage simply requires publication for consultation and the fourth stage is consultation with the boroughs--I do not see how one can consult without publishing. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will accept that the procedure is as compressed as possible. He made a good point, however, to which I shall return when I have answered the hon.  Member for Croydon, South. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> At present an RPG3 is drawn up on advice from LPAC, which, as the Minister knows consists of representatives from the London boroughs and the City.  Thus, LPAC has a formal say in drawing up the RPG3. But the provisions water down the only input that the boroughs have.  As the Minister well knows and as the hon.  Member for Sutton and Cheam pointed out, the boroughs will be consulted at the same time as--not before--the general public. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman must know that LPAC came into existence because of the abolition of the GLC.  It was a necessary creation in order to fill the gap that was left by the abolition of London's strategic planning authority.  We are restoring a strategic planning function, but in a very different way, as the hon.  Member for Croydon, South is only too well aware.  We are taking a different, streamlined approach, but it will be a strategic body. The draft SDS will be devised to ensure consistency with the other strategies, which is in line with the Bill. That draft SDS will then be published for consultation and the boroughs will be consulted, along with other bodies. It is right and proper that there should be consultation with a wider group of people than just the boroughs.  We are talking about planning for the whole of London, so it is right that the business community, local communities and other interest groups all have their say. The boroughs have an important role to play, but they do not have an exclusive right to determine the SDS. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The boroughs do indeed have an important role to play. The Bill makes it clear that they continue to exercise a role as development control agencies and that they will, through their UDPs, provide the bulk of the planning framework in which decisions will be taken in London. In that context, London is set apart from elsewhere.  The boroughs are therefore required to be more closely involved than perhaps they would be anywhere else, where the framework is different and a structure plan is produced.  This is not going to be a structure plan. For that reason, we need to find ways of involving the boroughs early on, even if it means only--perhaps the Minister will consider this further--that regard is had to UDPs in the first stage, when the spatial development plan is being drawn up. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made several perfectly sound points in the course of his speeches, but he is wrong to seek to change the sequence of development of the SDS. The sequence is logical and will ensure consistency with the other strategies, which must be right; it could not conceivably be correct for the GLA to consult on something that it then had to amend because it was inconsistent. Consistency must be ensured first. The next stage is consultation with the boroughs, so they are brought in at the earliest feasible stage.  They will have an important role. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), asked how long the process would take. Clearly, there are several stages to go through, not least because of the requirements of consultation, openness and an examination in public, which we believe is proper and appropriate.  We hope that the process will take between one and two years, but we cannot determine that; it will be a matter for the mayor.  As someone who has fairly lengthy memories of planning in London and who is old enough to remember the creation of the Greater London development plan, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have no wish to return to the lengthy processes involved in planning at that time. We are devising a modern, streamlined procedure that should allow implementation within that period, providing that all parties wish to proceed expeditiously, as I hope they will. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Clause 226(1) states that the spatial development strategy shall be prepared and published 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within such period (if any) as the Secretary of State may direct".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Bill therefore implies that publication is a matter not for the ultimate jurisdiction of the mayor, but for the diktat of the Secretary of State.  The Minister may suggest that publication of the strategy will take two or three years, but the Bill provides that the Secretary of State may properly say otherwise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is eagle eyed, and has spotted the reserve power for the Secretary of State.  I said that I hoped that the processes will be achieved within one to two years.  If an undue delay occurs, the Secretary of State will have the power to direct the mayor to produce the SDS sooner.  That will ensure that the planning system does not grind into a hopeless position in which no action can be taken because of the absence of an SDS. The clause has to contain such a reserve power, and other clauses contain such powers for the Secretary of State for similar reasons.  They have not always found favour among Opposition Members, but I hope that the hon.  Gentleman will recognise the appropriateness of the power in the clause. 
<P>
We have covered all the issues raised by hon. Members. The spatial development strategy is a new and exciting tool for the forward development of planning in London. It will seek to achieve an appropriate strategic approach to planning while avoiding some of the cumbersome and time-consuming processes associated with past systems of strategic planning. I believe that that is an exciting step forward, and I hope that the Committee will welcome it and that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister said that the Committee was discussing a modern, streamlined change to the planning. At other times he said that it was different and streamlined. It is certainly modern, because it is happening now, and it is certainly different, because the London boroughs are being undermined. 
<P>
The London boroughs are fully involved in drawing up planning guidance for London, but they will not be in future. The Opposition are prepared to support the Deputy Prime Minister against his own party. Labour Members may laugh, but they will soon be voting against the very words of their own Deputy Prime Minister. They shake their heads, but it is here in Hansard for all of them to see. The Deputy Prime Minister was asked about the matter by a Conservative Member. Labour Members are all weasel-minded--it took a Conservative to get this response. The intervention said that the Opposition wanted a bottom-up planning policy. The Deputy Prime Minister agreed. He said:

<P>
No. 1080, in page 114, line 26, leave out "spatial". 
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a probing amendment to try to find out exactly what the Government mean by the word spatial in the phrase "spatial development strategy." The amendment would delete "spatial" and refer instead to the London development strategy. That would keep the reference to a development strategy, which is a well-known planning phrase, without changing it to a spatial development strategy. Spatial development has wider implications than existing plans, and no one knows what it means. The Government ducked the issue when we debated clause 33, and I would be grateful if the Minister could now give us the ultimate definition of the word spatial. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak to amendments Nos. 1079 and 1080? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> They say the same thing, Mr. Winterton. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend, partly because of the manner in which the Minister dismissed the Single European Act in our earlier discussion of the spatial development strategy. The logic of the Single European Act was entirely clear--it was intended to produce a level playing field across Europe. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not in the least bit interested in the Single European Act at this stage. Will the hon. Gentleman direct his remarks to the amendment? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is very rare, Mr. Winterton, for you to cut me off literally as I come to the nub of my argument. Your intervention has deprived me of the chance to provide an illustration of what I was saying, but I am sure that the Committee can manage without it. 
<P>
Our unease is based on the fact that "spatial development strategy" is an ambiguous phrase. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South indicated the probing nature of the amendment. The phrase "London development strategy" is totally clear. I repeat: the Single European Act could have been regarded as being devoted to a spatial development strategy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South is right to probe, and I hope that he continues to do so after the Minister's answer, which I suspect will be unsatisfactory. The electors of London need to know what they are getting. They have no more idea than we do what this vast, literally limitless, concept means. I am sure that it will be hard for the Minister to define it. 
<P>
I suspect that it is a cover for the reality of the situation--that is, back-seat driving in a big way by the Secretary of State. If one looks at the powers, it is the Secretary of State who in so many ways will define the timing and the criteria for the definition of what I would call the London development strategy. 
<P>
The decisions of the mayor of London will crucially affect the development of the London boroughs, about which Londoners care so much. They will instinctively be wary of grand strategies, because so often the most appalling monstrosities and horrors are perpetrated in the name of such strategies and imposed on local communities. They will wish to know that this grandiloquent title will not be a mask for the rape of the green belt or the putting up of great big developments in residential areas about which they care greatly. My hon. Friend is right to seek to pin the Minister down to using a definition that Londoners can comprehend and actually means what it says. There is certainly nothing spatial about putting houses on the ground. 
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): I declare a possible interest as a fellow of the Royal Town Planning Institute. I do not seek to speak for the institute, and I am sure that it would want the Committee to know that. 
<P>
On this occasion, I support my right hon. and hon. Friends. To introduce the phrase "spatial development" into town and country planning matters is to confuse the issue. The word "development" or the phrase "town and country planning development" would be appropriate. I emphasise the word "country" in relation to London, because a considerable part of London lies within the metropolitan green belt or metropolitan open space. Indeed, I calculate that nearly 40 per cent. of my constituency is defined as metropolitan green belt or open space. 
<P>
I cannot stop myself from making one further point. Whatever justification there is for using the phrase "spatial development", one of the categories of significant planning applications included in the term "strategic" is very large new buildings or structures. It is a pity that the limits of those are not expressed in three-dimensional cubic measurements instead of the two-dimensional linear measurements--that is, square metres--that are given. That is an important point, although it is detailed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) remembers when the Select Committee on the Environment, on which he and I served, considered the green belt. My hon. Friend's north London borough gave evidence. We were driven to the perhaps surprising conclusion that in the last analysis, the only way that a borough council could defend its green belt was by owning it. There was no other comprehensive defence. Will my hon. Friend comment on that and say what he thinks is meant by subsection (5), which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The spatial development strategy must deal only with matters which are of strategic importance to Greater London."?
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A more confusing piece of circumlocution it is difficult to imagine. 
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I well recall my hon. Friend and I serving on the Environment Select Committee and considering the metropolitan green belt. My view is that the best way to conserve that green belt is by an explicit statement of Government policy to the effect that no green belt land should be developed for urban purposes. That is a definition to which I have long held. Broadly speaking, it has been upheld under successive Governments, although I have my doubts about one or two recent decisions relating to the green belt. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I defer to my hon. Friend's immense expertise in this matter. I must also declare an unpaid interest in that I am a successor to my hon. Friend as president of the London Green Belt Council. Does he agree that as currently drafted, the phrase "spatial development strategy" will connote to Londoners a mechanism under which the few open spaces left, such as green belt and metropolitan open space, will be available for development such as the large structures to which my hon. Friend referred, or even launch pads and other grandiose and undesirable ventures?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I share the conclusion that I am sure my hon. Friend was driving at--any development or planning application relating to the development of the metropolitan green belt must of itself involve a strategic decision being taken. 
<P>
With your permission, Mr. Winterton, I should just like to comment on subsection (5), to which my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) referred. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The spatial development strategy must deal only with matters which are of strategic importance to Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously the Government will justify what they define to be of strategic importance to Greater London later on. It is not just a matter of the size of a proposed development. Considerable developments in a London borough may have no strategic importance to London; small developments may be crucial. An example of the former is a large housing development on land zoned for housing. That would not have strategic importance for London. 
<P>
However, those are matters for the future. I end where I began. Using the phrase spatial development will confuse matters in relation to town and country planning in the metropolis. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have again extended courtesy and discretion to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet by allowing him to speak at some length to subsection (5), which does not relate to the amendments that we are currently debating, although the word "spatial" appears. Perhaps he will not seek to catch my eye when we debate the relevant amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I, too, have some concern about the use of the word "spatial". I tried to find an accurate definition of it, and looked it up in an encyclopaedia of planning and law practice, but it is not defined there. However, there is an attempt at such a definition in the monthly bulletin of that journal. Other definitions that I have obtained are: having extension in space; occupying or taking up space; consisting of or characterised by space. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether he is spelling spatial with a "t" or a "c"? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> With a "t". 
<P>
Other definitions are: of, pertaining or relating to space; subject to or governed by conditions of space; happening or taking place in space; concerned or involved by space; of faculty or sense, appertaining or perceiving space or extension. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that none of those definitions is in any way in conflict with the Single European Act? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I just do not know the answer to that. The point that I am trying to make is that we need to be precise when drafting legislation. The monthly bulletin of the encyclopaedia is helpful. It says of the spatial development strategy for London 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This document is to have a role similar to that of a structure plan (or, indeed, the old Greater London Development Plan) in the sense that it will contain a statement of the mayor's strategy for spatial development in London, including his general policies in respect of the development and use of land in Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not yet debating later subsections but, taken together, subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) are helpful. However, in my view, it would be better if there were a tighter definition either in the clause or elsewhere. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that we might receive any assistance in arriving at a definition from the European Space Agency? 
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reply that he does not know. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> My point is that there should be interpretation either in the Bill or elsewhere to make this more precise. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This short debate has revealed the desperate need for a clear definition, and I look forward to the Minister giving it to us soon. I suspect that the helpful intervention of the hon. Member for Upminster, who referred to the monthly update of the planning encyclopaedia, is not terribly helpful to the Minister in the context of his remarks in the debate on the previous group of amendments. He rightly said that we do not wish to see a return to--and these are my words--the monolithic structure planning system of the Greater London council. Given that SDSs mean, if the Government are to be believed, a more streamlined, 1337 1338 simplified system, that definition must be incorrect. Therefore it is essential that we establish today, for the benefit of those outside this place who want to understand, what "SDS" and "spatial" actually mean in this context. 
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
It is also incumbent on us to try and ensure that in drafting our legislation, we make it accessible to the public. I do not think that the terms "spatial" and "spatial development plan" will be readily understood and appreciated by the public. In that sense, we should be looking to put things into plainer English so that people can understand and engage in the process that the Government are putting in place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an interesting debate about the meaning of the term "spatial development strategy". 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is this a dubious intervention? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> This is possibly the most important intervention that I have made in Committee. The Minister should be aware of, and take into account, the relatively recent House of Lords decision in the case of Pepper v. Hart. It means that in the interpretation of these clauses in this Bill, when it becomes an Act of Parliament, account will be taken of the Minister's words, including what he says during the Committee stage. I am giving notice that the legal world awaits what you--I mean the Minister will say now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for emphasising the significance of the words that I am about to utter. I hope that they will be welcomed as clarifying the meaning of the phrase "spatial development strategy" and the purpose for which we are introducing this new concept. 
<P>
We have chosen the title "spatial development strategy" advisedly, and it is of some significance. It is not to be found in existing planning legislation. This will be its first appearance on the statute book, at least in English law. We are bringing into being a new type of planning instrument for a new type of authority. 
<P>
The term "spatial development" is not something that we have just made up. it will already he familiar to those who take an interest in planning at the European level. [Laughter.] 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I feel obliged to apologise to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for my earlier ruling. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am relieved that the hon. Member for Solihull corrected himself when he indicated that you might be giving the definition, Mr. Winterton, rather than me. 
<P>
European Union member states are in the process of agreeing the European spatial development perspective. The terminology will be well understood in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, where it signifies an integrated approach to planning, embracing all aspects of physical planning and infrastructure development. It is also reflected in the new draft guidance, which my Department has just issued, on the production of regional planning guidance--PPG 11--in which regional planning bodies are asked to develop a spatial strategy for their regions. 
<P>
What does spatial mean? We could, I suppose, go to the dictionary. my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster has done so. He did not go all the way through the definition, however, because if he had looked at the early uses of the term, he would have seen one attributed to Livingstone. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent East (Mr. Livingstone) is not present, however, so I cannot check. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): The hon. Member for Brent, East is in Barcelona this afternoon, exploring the concept of la planning spatiale. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Clerk tells me that he believes that we are getting a little excited. I am inclined to agree, so perhaps hon. Members could lower the temperature slightly and make a bit more progress. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am worried that my next point may not contribute to that progress, but I must say that I was somewhat taken aback to be told that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East was in Barcelona because I am due to fly to Barcelona tomorrow morning. I am not sure what construction will be put on that point. 
<P>
I shall move on from dictionary definitions, and try to set out what we are seeking to achieve by introducing the new concept under discussion into British planning. It is intended to embrace more than the conventional development and use of land, which is referred to in existing planning law. It should include the spatial--that is, geographical--elements of transport, economic development and other strategies for London and bring them together in a single comprehensive framework for London's future development. 
<P>
The main purposes of the SDS will be to provide necessary strategic guidance on the broad location of housing, industry, new transport provision and other infrastructure that will inform the preparation of UDPS. To that extent, it deals with issues similar to those covered by existing forms of land use policy guidance. However, it can also take into account issues not strictly related to the use and development of land, as well as matters that may be taken forward outside the statutory development and planning system. Such matters might include transport investment priorities, road user charging policies or economic regeneration priorities. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the Minister were mayor of London, would he introduce road user charges? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has tried to ask such questions at various stages in the Committee proceedings. The matter will be for the mayor to decide. The hon. Gentleman knows that we have already considered the permissiveness of the legislation, which allows the mayor to decide whether to introduce such a policy. The mayor will determine that and it would be inappropriate for me to express a view now.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I modestly and meekly inquire that if the hon. Gentleman were the mayor of London, would he introduce road user charging? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his persistence, but I have already said that it would be inappropriate for me as Minister for London and Construction to give any indication that might be seen as fettering the discretion of the future mayor of London. The matter will be for the mayor to determine. 
<P>
The spatial development strategy is about joined-up thinking and joined-up government. For too long, at all levels of government, planning strategies, regeneration strategies, transport investment plans and environmental plans have been produced independently and separately. Opposition Members should recognise that when they were in power, their Government made an important move by introducing the single regeneration budget to try to create a greater sense of coherence and integration in planning. Rather than rejecting that aspect of their past, Opposition Members could recognise that it was a step towards the sort of integration that most sensible people believe to be necessary and desirable in government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am now more than ever convinced that the Minister is a close friend of the man who mixed a metaphor and sprinkled it with cliches. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not mixing any metaphors, nor am I sprinkling cliches. I am describing a process of integrated Government thinking that anyone who believes that we should be improving the quality and standard of decision making would take seriously. it is extraordinary that Conservative Members cannot see that their Government also took some important steps in that direction. I recognise that they are trying to reject the past and dismiss everything that happened before 1997--their leader wishes to make a fresh start. Perhaps we will therefore continue to see these rather extraordinary demonstrations of their rejection of the performance of previous Conservative Governments. 
<P>
We are trying, at both national and regional levels, through our modernising planning agenda, the integrated transport White Paper, the creation of regional chambers, action on social exclusion and a whole range of other initiatives, to achieve better integration between different policies. In London, we now have the perfect opportunity to introduce and formalise a new joined-up, integrated approach. The spatial development strategy should include the spatial expression of all the mayor's policies, enabling better co-ordination of the future distribution of activities and investment and ensuring a consistent approach. 
<P>
Hon. Members have asked why we have not defined the term spatial more precisely in the Bill. Clause 226 defines, at some length, the scope and content of the spatial development strategy. Subsections (2) to (5)--if I may refer to them, Mr. Winterton, as I know that that goes beyond the scope of the amendments that we are considering--set out the contents of the strategy and what it is for. The only thing that is not defined is the word spatial. However, neither is the word planning defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Despite that, we have seen over the past 50 years that it has been possible for local authorities to implement planning policies, and I have no doubt that in the next 50 years it will be possible for the GLA and other bodies to implement spatial development strategies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Can the Minister tell the Committee whether the term is defined in any European Union document? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not know. However, in terms of English law it is only material whether there is a definition in our own law. As I have already indicated, there is no such existing definition. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> We have signed treaties going all the way back to the treaty of Rome. If there is a definition of a term of art in European legislation to which we are ourselves married by treaty, for good or ill, the Minister's last remark about resting purely on English jurisdiction or definitions must be mistaken. Will he reconsider it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, I will not reconsider it. I was referring to the fact that there is no definition in English statute of the term spatial in the context of a spatial development strategy and that, despite that, I see no problem in its proper and effective implementation because there was no reference to the definition of the term planning in the famous Town and Country Planning Act that laid the foundation for this country's planning system over the past 50 years or more. The hon. member for Chipping Barnet, who is a great expert in this area, will know that the planning system has worked very well despite the absence of that definition in that legislation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I say in fairness to the Minister that he handles our queries with his best endeavours and, if I may say so without presuming on your role, Mr. Winterton, in a rather agreeable way. However, this moment cannot pass without some insistence from Opposition Members that the Minister go a little further--maybe not now, but at a later stage--in the matter of his answer to the question by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) about whether this term of art might be defined in a European Community document. That was an extremely pertinent question. It is not impossible that our judicial authorities may look sideways to Europe. They are prepared to accept persuasive authority from other places; they do so regularly. Will the Minister return to that point? "I do not know" is not good enough--although it was certainly honest. 
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In the course of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, I have received more authoritative advice. My advice is that officials do not believe that there is any such definition in European Union legislation. However, in the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's question, I undertake further to consider the matter, and to write to all members of the Committee with a definitive answer. 
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw his amendment; if he does not, I invite my hon. Friends to vote against it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I should like to pick the Minister up on one point. He said that planning has not been defined under town and country planning legislation for the past 50 years. It has of course been clearly and concisely defined by the courts as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relating to the use and development of land".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister did not mean to mislead the Committee, but a clear definition is in use in planning circles. 
<P>
I thought that the Minister was going to say that "spatial" means what clause 226 says that it means. Interestingly enough, he did not say that. We have ended up with the Humpty Dumpty answer: it means whatever I say that it means. Nevertheless, the matter does not merit dividing the Committee, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 1089, in page 115, line 15, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) prepare an environmental assessment of the proposed spatial development strategy,".

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall speak initially to amendments Nos. 1085 and 1089. They would require the spatial development strategy to include policies on certain matters. They would set out a more positive framework for the SDS, requiring it to include policies on important matters of great concern to Londoners, such as conservation of the natural beauty and amenity of land, the environment, sustainable development, and the management of traffic, and requiring the mayor to prepare an environmental assessment of the SDS. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1081 is far more important. Subsection (3) states that the mayor's SDS "includes"--that is the operative and important word-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"his general policies in respect of the development and use of land in Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would remove the word "includes" and insert the word "comprises", which would confine the SDS to development and land use policies. That is important, because the word "includes" means that other unspecified matters can be included. The amendment would make the scope of the SDS the same as that of existing strategic planning guidance--RPG3--and in accordance with normal planning principles. It would also have the added advantage of preventing the mayor from including extraneous matters that might slow down the SDS and planning process and increase costs and delays to business. It is important that that lax drafting is tightened and better focused. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall speak primarily to amendment No. 1108, but will also address some questions raised by the other grouped amendments. Amendment No. 1108 is similar to amendment No. 1089, tabled by the Conservatives. It is intended as a probing amendment, designed to ascertain the Government's view on whether there will be a hierarchy of strategies in the operations of the mayor and the GLA. The spatial development strategy as defined for us by the Minister appears to be the place where harmony is reached by the various strategies. It is where integration takes place and where these issues have their effect in reality. 
<P>
I want to establish what will happen in terms of planning decisions by planning authorities that are exercising their responsibilities. They will have to have regard to the SDS; moreover, their unitary development plans will have to be in general conformity with the SDS. There is therefore a question about how significant a material consideration a noise reduction strategy, for example, or an air quality improvement strategy would be in making a planning decision. That is not entirely clear from the Bill. 
<P>
I hope that we can get some sense of the hierarchy that the Government foresee and how the SDS will fit into it. That is why we have tabled the amendment, which deals with the issue of appraisals. Conflicts could well arise between different policies. The Minister rightly said that the mayor would ensure that those conflicts did not persist, but it seems that they would be highlighted in the SDS, giving the mayor the opportunity to remove or minimise them. The amendment proposes an environmental appraisal of all the policies to be set out in the SDS. I hope that the Minister will accept it; if he cannot accept its precise wording, perhaps he will come back with a Government amendment to the same effect. 
<P>
I return to the issue of UDPs having to conform to the SDS. Can the Minister give us some sense of how the Government believe that that will work in practice? What will be a material consideration? As soon as the SDS is published, it is emerging policy and it becomes a consideration in planning decisions. Some aspects of the SDS which are not about land use beg questions. Will they be material considerations or not? We must be clear about that, just as we had to be clear about what "spatial" meant and what spatial development strategies were. It would be helpful for those who will have to revise their UDPs in the light of the provisions if the Minister put that information on the record.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I shall speak very briefly to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and that tabled by the Liberal Democrats. I am concerned that the spatial development strategy will not pay enough attention to environmental and particularly wildlife matters. 
<P>

<P>
I can think of two relevant cases, the first of which has been resolved. In my constituency, under my predecessor, Sir Michael Shersby, Warner Brothers proposed a plan for a theme park. Had that happened under the GLA, I think that the mayor and the spatial development strategy should have to take note of its environmental consequences. More importantly, on the east side of London there is an important issue concerning Rainham marshes. 
<P>
Will the spatial development strategy take into consideration the very important matter of the environment? The word covers such a wide area that I want to specify wildlife--the current buzzword is biodiversity, but I small stick to wildlife. I am worried that consideration of all the other aspects, important though they may be, may not in the long term be as important as preserving these open spaces. Such areas are an important part of London's environment. Once they are developed, they will be gone forever. That should be enshrined in what the Minister says, even if it is not enshrined in the Bill. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will he aware of the on-going problem with the borough of Havering and the marshes at Rainham, which I mentioned earlier. That is just one example of such problems. Unfortunately, there are not many areas in London where similar problems could arise because it has precious few areas of such wildlife importance. They are important for all Londoners, however, and not only those of us lucky enough to live in the suburbs and in green areas. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendments deal with a number of issues, some relating to the environment and some to the scope of the spatial development strategy. I shall try to deal with them in turn. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1189 and 1108 would require an environmental appraisal of the policies and proposals of the SDS during its preparation. We expect that the mayor will carry out a full appraisal of the environmental impacts of the emerging SDS, but it will form only one element of a wider sustainability appraisal that also considers the economic and social impacts of the policies and proposals of the SDS. 
<P>
It is not necessary to insert into the Bill a further general reference to the need to promote sustainable development in formulating the SDS. We cannot be specific about a sustainability appraisal at this stage, because as yet there is no national guidance on what such an appraisal might comprise or on how it should be conducted. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister has not been slow to break new ground. Spatial development strategy is a new expression, as he admitted. We all understand what sustainable development means. In respect of environmental protection, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) said, the term should not include building or development on sites of special scientific interest, green belts and other open spaces where wildlife will be lost to London as a result. Although it may not be possible to produce a legal definition now, the expression could be interpreted in the light of everybody's experience of its meaning. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman expresses concerns about wildlife, which the hon. Member for Uxbridge also rightly expressed. I shall come to their points in a moment. 
<P>
I was outlining the reasons why it would be inappropriate for the legislation to require a sustainability appraisal. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Earlier, the Minister spoke of a need to produce guidance about sustainability appraisals. We understand that he estimates that it will take about two years to produce an SDS, and we therefore expect it to be published in its final form by 2002. Will he give us some idea of when he anticipates the publication of the guidance to inform preparation of the SDS? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to be able to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that I think he is seeking. Consultants have recently submitted a report on the feasibility of carrying out a sustainability appraisal, which outlined how it might be undertaken. This will be followed up by a more detailed good practice guide on carrying out such an appraisal, which we hope to issue later this year. We will be able to embrace the findings from this emerging work in our guidance to the mayor on the formulation of the SDS. That approach is consistent with our proposed approach in draft PPG 11 for regional planning guidance. The issues will be taken on board through guidance, but not through a specific requirement such as that which the amendment seeks to introduce. 
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Uxbridge, I should stress that the SDS is one of a series of strategies -- We are keen that consistency should be achieved between all the mayor's strategies. I was asked whether there is a hierarchy. The answer is no, there is not a hierarchy, but there must be consistency. That is why, before the SDS is published for consultation with the wider world, the first stage involves internal consultation with all the bodies that report to the mayor. That will ensure that there is absolute consistency between the SDS and the other strategies. 
<P>
Among those other strategies, as the hon. Member for Uxbridge will recall, we have made provision for a London biodiversity action plan that will specifically address wildlife issues, as well as other environmental matters such as air quality and ambient noise. Environmental issues are covered well and comprehensively, and will be fully accounted for in the preparation of the SDS. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister may be about to come to this point, but it is one of the key areas that we need to be clear about. What will be the material considerations for planning authorities in discharging their responsibilities?
