</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<H4><center>Calculation of basic amount of tax</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 351, in page 39, leave out lines 28 to 30.
<P>
This is a highly technical matter. I shall therefore on this occasion stick to my script extremely closely--the Committee will realise why once I am about two sentences into it.
<P>
In certain circumstances, the clause would give rise to a negative amount as a result of the calculations. In this event, as the clause is currently worded, it would mean that the negative amount calculated would effectively be written off, as the only possible amount to be stated other than a positive one is "nil". Using the word "nil" does not allow for any negative requirement to be reported. The result of not reporting or writing off a negative requirement--here comes the point--is that if the funds to which that related were not available for use in any other manner, they would effectively be lost to the taxpayers of London. The amendment would allow for the reporting of a negative requirement, and the subsequent redistribution of such funds to the benefit of the taxpayers of London.
<P>
I hope that that is as clear to the Minister as it is to me. It raises an important point, which at the very least deserves clarification, if only to satisfy the Committee and those outside that in no sense in such, perhaps unusual, circumstances would the money be lost, but that it would be retained and available for the beneficial use of Londoners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am surprised that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst needed to refer to his notes--members of the Committee have become used to learning the skills of debate from him because he is normally so clear and precise without the assistance of notes. However, I shall try to put his words into plain English.
<P>
The amendment would give the authority power to notify the billing authorities that they should levy, on the GLA's behalf, a negative council tax precept--that is, reduce the tax burden on London's council taxpayers. The beneficial aspect of that process is that no extra billing would be required for the refunds. The negative council tax precept could appear on the council tax bills that are sent out to Londoners, and the council tax demand that they receive from their local authorities would he reduced by the negative amount of the precept. That would ensure that the GLA would become super popular and win the support of the people of London.
<P>
The Government have told us many times that they intend the authority to be efficient, lean and unbureaucratic. If that turns out to be the case, it is likely that it will make savings and will therefore be able to propose a negative council tax precept. I anticipate that the Minister will reply that a negative precept is unlikely to occur. That may be because Ministers intend to ensure, through the Bill's other provisions, that they control the GLA's finances in such a way that it is almost impossible to imagine a situation in which it would be possible to pay back a negative precept to London's council taxpayers. However, let us cast our minds ahead five or 10 years into the future. The House of Commons may by then have given the GLA different powers by which it is able to raise revenue of its own and may be in a position to pay back revenues if it has, through efficient management, generated a surplus. The Government should not, through clause 73, strike that power from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Yet again, an amendment seeks to change a key aspect of the local government finance regime of the GLA, which--in common with all local authorities--cannot set a negative amount of council tax. Despite the contributions of the right hon Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I cannot conceive of a case for treating the GLA differently from local authorities in general.
<P>
The amendment would allow for the GLA's basic amount of council tax for non-police services to be negative. However, it is surely right that local taxes should contribute towards the maintenance and upgrade of vital local services--services that are in dire need of improvement in London. I would find it perverse to agree to the amendment. The hon. Members who tabled it apparently intend that the GLA should slash much-needed services and give money away. Despite the interpretation that was given by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I do not think that that would make the GLA particularly popular with Londoners. The amendment is therefore unacceptable, and I urge the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful for what the Minister has said thus far, but I would like her to say one further thing to reassure us. Can she guarantee that there are no circumstances in which money that has been gathered from Londoners in the form of tax, or which has been earmarked through the normal procedures for expenditure by the London authority, could be lost through an accounting mechanism such as we have discussed? I would like an assurance from the Minister that in all circumstances the moneys that were intended to be spent by the authority on behalf of Londoners will be so spent. if she can give us that assurance, I will gladly seek to leave to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am delighted to give the right hon. Gentleman that assurance; the only guarantees that I can give him are death and taxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I shall take one half of that assurance as sufficient, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Winterton--[Interruption.] And thank you, Labour Members.
<P>
I shall speak briefly--if colleagues allow me to be brief. The purpose of the amendments is to introduce a new band I to the council tax. The intention is to make council tax in London a little fairer. The matter was debated some years ago when the council tax was first introduced and, although it did not carry favour with the then Government, many then felt that the tax was unfair, and that we needed to consider widening the bands to ensure a more equitable distribution of the tax burden on council taxpayers.
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure a more equitable distribution of the burden of council tax in Greater London. We believe that in Greater London, more than anywhere else, extremes of poverty and wealth are represented in terms of property, and the amendment is intended to write into the bill a slightly different formula for the collection of council tax in London for the new and--to use an overworn phrase--unique institution. I commend the amendment as a means of making the council tax fairer for Londoners.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Section 5 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 sets out the council tax bands and values for the whole of England. New clause 22, proposed by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, would amend that Act so that Greater London had its own separate council tax banding system with a different range of values and a new, higher band--band I. It is proposed that band I would include properties valued at more than £480,000, and that the council tax for such dwellings be almost double that for band H. Amendment No. 387 is consequential to new clause 22, building in a reference to proposed new section 5(1A), which would be introduced by the new clause.
<P>
That could be achieved only through revaluation, and there is no provision in the Bill that would allow for a revaluation of London properties. Revaluation is an expensive and potentially disruptive process, for which funds have not been allocated. Even if we were to introduce an amendment to enable a revaluation solely of London properties, I doubt that that could be completed and in place by April 2000. Even if the funds could be identified, such a radical change to the council tax banding system is likely to distort the current basis of council tax across the country, requiring a general revaluation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey rose--</B><P>
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, if Committee members want to hold conversations, I ask that they do so very quietly, not only so that I and other hon. Members who are interested can hear the debate, but so that those who are taking down what we are saying for posterity can do so accurately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Your reminder, Mr. Winterton, that our words are being taken down for posterity gives me pause. However, I shall make my intervention.
<P>
The Minister said that there would have to be a revaluation, for which there is no provision in the Bill. We understand that the valuation authorities still have data from the evaluation that took place prior to April 1991, for which they would be able to identify houses that would fall into the new band. Perhaps the Minister would like to come back on that.
<P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The point is not that the relevant information is not available, although the relevant information to which the hon. Gentleman referred would make no acknowledgement of any new properties. The point is that the Bill does not contain powers for such a revaluation.
<P>
As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will know, we reviewed local government finance last year and considered the need for a revaluation, including regional banding. However, our conclusion, as set out in the White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People", was that the current valuation base is still broadly acceptable and is likely to remain so for the next few years. In the circumstances, we do not consider there to be a need for a revaluation in the current Parliament. In time, of course, it will be necessary. Council tax banding for London can be considered then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am most interested in the Minister's arguments, which are important. Surely the Liberals have overlooked the effect that their proposals would have on certain communities. For example, Northwood is, as a parish, divided by the Greater London boundary. Under the Liberal proposal some people in Northwood Herts, who live in very high value properties, would be exempt from band I, while others who live in similar properties in Northwood Middlesex, in my constituency, would have to pay it. It is bad enough that those who live in Northwood Middlesex should have the precept of 3p, let alone this extra imposition.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a particularly pertinent point, which underlines the fact that the Liberal Democrats have yet again tabled an amendment without thinking through the logical consequences of their proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. John McDonnell </B>(Hayes and Harlington): As our proceedings are being recorded for posterity, it is important that we note that there is an outstanding issue about an additional council tax band for London. There has been cross-party lobbying for that on a London basis and although this is not the Bill in which to implement it, I want to put it on record that we will return to the issue.
<P>
Also for posterity, as I did not speak in the previous debate, I note that I was the last chair of the GLC finance committee and the only one to reduce the precept.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am sorry that I did not speak sufficiently clearly for my hon. Friend to understand. I said that a revaluation will in time be necessary and that council tax banding for London can be considered then. In the light of what we have heard, I trust that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheain will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened particularly closely to the comments of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) There will be an interesting debate in due course on the relevant comments that he made.
<P>
We want to make the point that although we thought that we shared our view on devolution with the Government, increasingly that seems not to be the case. The Government are clearly not minded seriously to devolve powers and to allow differences between different parts of the country. We therefore, regret that they are not prepared to accept the amendment, even in a different form. We listened to the Minister, and the points that she made about conducting a review of the system in general are welcome. It might be overly delayed given what the Minister said, but we will not press the amendment. Overall, however, we listened with some disappointment to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 42 line 16, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) Where the precepting authority is the Greater London Authority, within one week of the Greater London Authority having calculated the amount to be stated under section 40(2)(a) in respect of any billing authority in Greater London in relation to each category of dwellings in that billing authority's area, the Greater London Authority shall cause to be published such amount in relation to each category of dwellings in that billing authority's area, these amounts to be expressed both as annual and as weekly figures, publication to be by way of a prominent printed announcement in at least one local newspaper circulating in that billing authority's area and nominated by that billing authority.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The key words that relate to the amendment are transparency and accountability. I accept that the wording may not be the most felicitous that I have ever seen, but the Minister will understand in a few moments what we seek to do.
<P>
The point is to find a mechanism whereby we can ensure that council tax payers in London know exactly which element of their tax will pay for the authority. We do that in pursuit of accountability. We pick up our clue from what the White Paper said. Paragraph 1.21 stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Londoners will be able to choose the person in charge of their city and be sure that he or she is publicly accountable for their actions".
<P>
We are trying to pick up and develop the commitment that was made in the White Paper.
<P>
The White Paper went on to say that
<P>
"local people will ... better understand and have a greater say in expenditure and council tax decisions".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will be the case only if they have been given the necessary information on which to make their judgments. If people are to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"better understand and have a greater say in expenditure and council tax decisions",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we must find a way of ensuring beyond all doubt that a mechanism is in place that allows people to know what they are expected to pay towards the GLA through the precept. The aim of the amendment is to do just that.
<P>
As ever, it would be highly satisfactory if Ministers could satisfy me and the Committee that such a mechanism already existed beyond peradventure or that they were prepared to go further than the Bill appears to take us. We must have that assurance. If we do not, there is at least the danger that the authority's costs will be disguised, buried or subsumed in the council tax. Londoners will not then be able to make a proper judgment each time elections for the GLA come round 417 418 about what is being done on their behalf. They will, therefore, not be able to make proper political judgments about the candidates who are asking for the support of London voters.
<P>
The amendment raises a matter of enormous importance. It deals with a key element in the mechanisms that we have discussed from time to time for ensuring that the authority functions in the way that the Government intend, that it is accountable and that Londoners have proper and full information on which to make the judgments that will be expected of them in election after election.
<P>
Those are the aims behind the amendment and I hope that Ministers can assure us that they are already fulfilled or, if they cannot accept the wording of the amendment, that they will be prepared to suggest an alternative way of achieving the aims that we have set in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We support the amendment. The right hon. Gentleman has made some good points about the need to improve the transparency and accountability that the council tax bill can provide. We shall be supporting the amendments for that reason.
<P>
During our proceedings it has become increasingly clear that the mayor of London and the assembly are accountable to the electorate once every four years. Given that they will effectively be accountable to the Secretary of State every day of their four years in office, we should ensure that, at the very least, council tax bills are as clear and readily understandable as possible. For that reason, we hope that the Government will accept the amendment. If they do not accept this one, perhaps they will, as the right hon. Gentleman said, consider some form of wording that will meet the purpose.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Under existing legislation, all liable people are sent a demand notice, which is required to show details of the precept for their dwelling. As a major precepting authority, the GLA is required to provide details so that it can be included. Therefore, all liable people will know the full details of their bill and their billing authority.
<P>
The intention behind the amendment appears to be to require the publication in a local newspaper nominated by the billing authority of details of the GLA precept for each band of dwelling in each billing authority area to ensure that all liable persons are made aware of their liability. Publishing the information in local newspapers would involve local authorities in additional administration and costs, which would have to be found from their budget. Presumably, individually billing in individual local newspapers would be an additional cost that would also have to be shown on the bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
The amendment's intention is clear, but it fails to deliver the desired outcome because nothing in it requires anyone to read the relevant newspaper. No one on the Government Benches in Committee would like to see any such an amendment and nor, I trust, would the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst or the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Therefore, publishing these details in a newspaper--and one to selected by the billing authority which, I can well imagine, would not automatically accord with the journalistic requirements of individual householders--would be a pointless exercise. Not only would it fail to achieve its desired end but it would be a gross waste of public money, something to which I thought the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was utterly opposed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am conscious of the need to make progress, but I want to clarify this point. Is the Minister proposing that amendments will be brought forward on best-value criteria to repeal the requirement for authorities to publish their performance indicators which, given the Minister's arguments, would clearly be necessary?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I cannot make the connection between something that local authorities are required to ensure is delivered to individual households and this amendment, which has to do with people's choice whether to read a particular newspaper. There are many newspapers in all areas of London. Therefore, as the amendment could not conceivably deliver the desired outcome, I ask the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr.  Forth:</B>  I am grateful to the Minister, and I accept the points that she has made. She has skilfully touched a point of great sensitivity--my desire to avoid unnecessary public expenditure. I also accept her arguments that a requirement drafted in this rather cumbersome way to ensure publication would not necessarily provide the guarantees that we seek.
<P>
I am encouraged by the Minister's explanation that existing provisions cover the separate precepts shown on council tax bills. I want to consider the Minister's words to ensure that the assurance is definitely there, and then perhaps explore what lies behind it. For the moment, I am sufficiently encouraged by what the Minister has said, and have accepted her chastisement regarding the wording of my amendment. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Substitute calculations under section 49
of the 1992 Act
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 43, line 27, after "calculations" insert "(a)".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 303 and 304.
<P>
9 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clauses 79 and 80 include provisions setting out how the GLA should make substitute calculations of its budget requirement. Clause 79 simply 419 420 <P>
brings the GLA into line with other authorities. Under clause 80, such calculations would be made if the Secretary of State set a minimum budget requirement for the Metropolitan police authority.
<P>
The amendments make two main changes. Amendment No. 303 ensures that, when making such calculations, the GLA may take into account any new additional grant that may be payable to the Metropolitan police authority but which was not taken into account in earlier calculations of the budget requirement. Under the Bill as currently drafted, the GLA may take into account only any new additional grant to the remainder of the GLA grant. That was not intended to be the case.
<P>
Amendment No. 304 makes certain that the Secretary of State and not the GLA estimates how much new additional grant--grant not previously taken into account--will be payable to the GLA for the year, and how much is apportioned between the police and other services provided by the GLA. That will bring the clauses to which the amendments apply into line with clauses 73 and 74, under which the Secretary of State determines how the various grants should be apportioned. As a result of those corrections, a further minor drafting amendment is also required, which is amendment No. 302.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Authority; substitute calculations
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No.332, in page 44, line 10, leave out from "be" to the second "the".
<P>
This is a modest probing amendment. The Opposition are seeking to establish the relationship that will exist between the Metropolitan police authority on the one hand, the authority on the other and the Secretary of State on the third hand, if that is not too complicated. I have raised the issue in the form of the amendment because it would be helpful for the Minister briefly to clarify the process whereby the police authority budget was arrived at. Will he also clarify why the Secretary of State would want to intervene in the way set out in the Bill? What would happen if there were a difference of view about the minimum budget requirement between the police authority, the GLA and the Secretary of State? Is that a sequential series of events? When would each of those three important institutions come into play, and who, if I need ask, would have the final say? If the Secretary of State has the final say, how far would he or she have a key role in determining a large proportion of the authority's expenditure and therefore in setting the tax to be levied on Londoners?
<P>
This relatively innocent looking clause contains some important questions. The amendment is designed to elucidate further detailed information from the Minister about crucial relationships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to explore the important issues raised by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst about the budget of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
I shall speak to what appears to be the implication of the amendment, were it to be carried--I do not argue that it has a greater intent than that which the right hon. Gentleman stated. He argues that the powers of direction in clause 80(3) should be limited to imposing what is objectively decided as the minimum required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to restore or maintain an efficient and effective police force"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for London. The Bill as drafted allows the Secretary of State's discretion to enter that process.
<P>
I have a set of questions about the drafting, and a question that relates to common practice elsewhere in policing and police budgets. First, by the Secretary of State, is what is meant by the Home Secretary? My understanding from Committees considering Bills on which I have sat before is that "Secretary of State" normally means the appropriate Secretary of State. I assume that the Home Secretary is meant, and that it will be for the Home Secretary to form a view.
<P>
What is the difference in practice between the Bill as drafted and the Bill as it would read if the amendment were carried? It strikes me that the discretion available may not do anything other than confirm what is the minimum necessary for the Metropolitan police authority. To put the question the other way round, if we 421 422 did not include discretion for the Secretary of State, where would we find a definition of what is the minimum necessary in order to restore or maintain an efficient police force?
<P>
The second question concerns what is now common practice. I am trying with your supervision as always, Mr. Winterton--to limit my questions to the amendment, reserving the slightly wider issues for the clause stand part debate. Is the power in the Bill exactly the same power that exists at present for other police authorities--that which governs police budgets in county authorities and their relationship to their police authority? For example, to take the nearest authorities of Surrey or Kent, does the same power apply to them?
<P>
 London has been unique in not having a police authority in the same sense as the county authorities in England. The Home Secretary has in Mikado-type form been two people: the Home Secretary for England and the police authority. I assume that we are trying to give the GLA the same relative position toward the Metropolitan police as Surrey, Cheshire and Lancashire county councils and Greater Manchester council have with the police in their areas.
<P>
I ask another question, not knowing the answer but seeking to discover what the Government are planning. Given that last year there were debates on the budgets for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, does the same power reside in the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to intervene in the budgets for their police authorities? My hon. Friends and I want to ensure that the police authority in London does not have less freedom than the police authority in Warwickshire, Kent, Grampian or Powys. Where would the Bill put London in relation to other police authorities?
<P>
An interesting document that has probably landed on most hon. Members' desks in the past few weeks--it might be waiting for some of us when we leave the Committee Room--was the Audit Commission's report on police and fire authorities. It is a useful and important document, which establishes relative performances, value for money and other factors. The hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) took part in a debate on the fire service in London on the Floor of the House last week. It was initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable).
<P>
It is important to ensure that there is sufficient funding for an efficient and effective police force. I want to probe the issue using one example. One of the real concerns that is coming down the track for the police force is that it will have to find money for increasing pension contributions. That will do nothing directly to provide efficient and effective police forces. There could be 20 per cent. more in the budget, but if it all goes on pensions it will not deliver one more police officer on the beat or an increased response to crime.
<P>
There are two sets of issues; I hope that that is clear. We are keen to collaborate with the Minister to get the right formula and to ensure that London policing is not disadvantaged in its accountability compared with police forces elsewhere.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the member for Bromley and Chislehurst for moving this probing amendment in the way that he did. Many of us were anxious about the Bill in as much as it grants responsibility for policing to the GLA and to the police authority that will be set up under the Bill. Our constituents had very real fears that a highly politicised Greater London authority would overlook its national policing responsibilities.
<P>
The wording that the Government have chosen is appropriate in as much as we need an assurance that the Secretary of State will overtly, clearly and explicitly take responsibility in the Bill for ensuring that the minimum acceptable level of budget is set for the police authority for London so that it can provide an efficient and effective force. One must remember the range of activities that are particular to the Metropolitan police: diplomatic protection, public order, riot control, race relations work of great sensitivity, counter-terrorism, and work against the organisation of and incitement to terrorism overseas. Those functions might not have a high political profile for a London authority but they are crucial for the nation's interests and welfare. The Secretary of State must take ultimate responsibility for them and be prepared to provide the necessary funds. Thanks to my right hon. Friend's probing amendment, I am reassured by the wording as it stands, but perhaps I am a lone voice in that.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> It is interesting to have a short debate just on the police. We will soon move on to discuss matters that relate to setting up the Metropolitan police authority. First, however, I want to mention the amendment, which was moved by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.
<P>
The amendment amends subsection (3). At present, it provides that a direction should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that which the Secretary of State considers the minimum necessary"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the Metropolitan police authority to secure an efficient and effective police force. The amendment would change that so that the subsection read simply, "the minimum necessary".
<P>
It is not clear to me what material difference the amendment would make. It will still be the Secretary of State who has to decide the minimum budget necessary. I see no advantage in not spelling that out in the Bill. One possible effect of the amendment would be to make it easier to raise a legal challenge to the issuing of a direction, as the element of ministerial discretion has been deleted. I hope that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The questions that were asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey should be answered during the forthcoming debate on the police. However, it is important to point out some of the differences relating to the financing of the Metropolitan police, which are 423 424 covered by clause 80. One of the guiding principles of our approach is that London's new police authority should, as far as possible, reflect the structure and functions of police authorities elsewhere in England and Wales. Outside London, police authorities set their own budgets. However, we have decided that that principle cannot apply in the case of the new Metropolitan police authority. As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made clear, that is partly because of the importance that we attach to the maintenance of a single financial structure which spans the Greater London authority and its four functional bodies. more importantly, policing is a matter of great significance to the public, and the people of London have the right to expect that their police service will be properly funded.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Metropolitan police perform roles that extend beyond those that are provided by other police forces--for example, national security work, counter-terrorism and the protection of prominent persons. The Home Secretary will continue to have responsibility for those national and international functions following the establishment of the Metropolitan police authority. It is therefore important that the Bill contains the reserve power--I stress that it is a reserve power--by which the Home Secretary can ensure the adequate funding of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am listening very attentively to the Minister, as are the other members of the Committee. Can she tell us whether a reserve power also exists in the county authorities of England? I ask that question because, while I understand the argument that the public want the police to receive decent funding, it is not easy for the non-extra London services to justify a reserve power for London if the people of Hertfordshire, Essex or the Thames Valley are not given an equivalent reserve power for their protection.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The hon. Gentleman probably knows that the Police Act 1996 can be relied upon to ensure a minimum budget elsewhere. The power that is set out in section 41 of the Act applies only to police authorities outside London, but it cannot be exercised unless an adverse report has been made by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. The power cannot, therefore, be invoked to anticipate problems that appear only after the event. We are keen to ensure that the Home Secretary has the power to ensure that the people of London cannot, for whatever reason, be inadequately policed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> This is a very important matter. I did not sit on the Committee that considered the Police Bill in 1996, and I am therefore unfamiliar with the section to which the Minister referred. I understand the Minister's argument as it applies to London. However, I do not understand why the same argument does not apply to other police authorities: they should be covered by similar provisions. I cannot see why the Home Secretary must have an additional power in London that he does not have in relation to any other English police authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must tell the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that we are debating London and nowhere else. I am sure that if the Minister has the answer at her fingertips she will give it, but I hope that hon. Members will not labour--if I may say that--the point.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton. London is our capital city and its police have special national functions which differ from those that are found in the rest of the country. Within this new frame-work, which will for the first time give us accountable police in London, we are giving careful consideration to the issue so that we get the balance right as to who has the final power if we feel that the people of London are not being adequately protected for the amount of money that is going to the police. I hope such a situation will never arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Given the Bill's wording, given the fact that there could be disputes about the proper level of a minimum budget for an effective police force and given that the Secretary of State has the ultimate say, will the Minister confirm that if such a situation arose, the Secretary of State's decision would be subject to judicial review in the normal way? I just want confirmation because it seems that that is a likely corollary of Bill as it stands.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I have been nodded at, so I can assume that that is so. I personally do not know the answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I saw the nod.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> It confirms the right hon. Gentleman's assumption. That would be eminently reasonable.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment has helped to elicit an interesting debate, with which I am sure we shall continue when we reach part VI. For now, I would ask him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for taking us through the reasoning. We will almost certainly want to return to the matter at a later stage. For now, I heg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 304, in page 44, line 47, leave out from "the" to end of line 4 on page 45 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relevant portion of any new additional grant.
<P>
(8A) For the purposes of subsection (8) above, 'the relevant portion of any new additional grant' means the amount of any additional grant payable to the Authority for the year which was not taken into account by the Authority in making the previous calculations, but--
<P>
(a) in the case of item PI, reduced, as may be prescribed, by such sum as the Secretary of State considers represents the portion of the amount which relates to defraying the special item in whole or in part; and
<P>
(b) in the case of item P2, restricted, as may be prescribed, to such sum as the Secretary of State considers represents the portion of the amount which relates to defraying the special item in whole or in part,
<P>
and 'special item' has the same meaning in this subsection as in sections 73 and 74 above (see section 74(2)).
<P>
(8B) In subsection (8A) above, 'Prescribed' means specified in, or determined in accordance with, either--
<P>
(a) the report under section 85 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 relating to the amount of additional grant in question, or
<P>
(b) regulations made by the Secretary of State,
<P>
as the Secretary of State may determine for the purposes of paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection and any particular financial year or years.'.".--[Kate Hoey.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, start part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to raise three matters with the Minister that follow on from the previous debate. First, what is the genesis of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"restore or maintain an efficient and effective police force"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It appears to be entirely reasonable, but it must come from somewhere. I presume that it is a term of art that comes from other legislation, but if it has been invented specifically for the Bill, that is interesting. Is it reflected elsewhere?
<P>
I remember what you said in the previous debate, Mr. Winterton, but I cannot ask my question, which is entirely related to London, without making comparisons. Other than the examples that the Minister gave us of subsequent powers where there has been an inquiry, where else in what is by the Government's definition--although not by ours--local government legislation is there the power to set minimum and not maximum budgets? We discussed capping earlier, but this is the other end of it.
<P>
The Government will have the power to limit the top whack that the authority can raise as well as the bottom whack that it can spend. I stand to be corrected--indeed, I am happy to be corrected--but I do not remember in my 16 years in this place ever sitting through local government legislation in which the Government took power to limit both the maximums and the minimums at the same time. Does the measure have the support of the Local Government Association, Labour local councils around the country and local government leaders? I would be surprised if the principle of prescribing a bottom level of funding were established. Once it is introduced, the Government can argue that as it is in this Bill, so it can be in others.
<P>
My third question concerns the detail of the clause and the notes on clauses that were helpfully supplied. My understanding of how the process will work is that, as the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has the power to make the direction to which the Minister referred. If the Secretary of State makes that direction and the GLA has a different figure, the GLA must go around the circuit again and set a new figure. It is a bit like the 1980s, when councils had rate capping imposed on them by the then Government.
<P>
One of the options is, to use the words in the notes on clauses, to cut other component budgets. That alludes to an earlier debate and the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Can the Government guarantee that they will never intervene to prevent the Greater London authority from increasing its precept to increase the amount of money for the police, and that they will never tell the GLA that the result of the imposition of their decision is that the GLA will have to find the money elsewhere? Will the Government give the Committee a self-denying ordinance? This is important, because otherwise such action will impact on budgets such as the fire budget, and on other budgets and powers. We do not want other budgets to suffer if the Government decide to intervene in the police budget set by the GLA.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Surely there could be occasions when the people of London, in their strong desire for effective law and order in the capital, will want the budget for the police authority to have the priority and the resources that it requires. If it takes the Secretary of State to make that correct judgment, they will be very grateful to the Secretary of State, even if it means sacrifices elsewhere in the Greater London authority's plans and schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am second to none--I am certainly not second to the hon. Gentleman--in understanding the need for sufficient policing. That probably applies to my constituency even more than to the hon. Gentleman's. It certainly applies to the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department and the loads of us who live in the less well off parts of the capital. There is no doubt about that. London is suffering badly from a Government regime that has reduced policing significantly for the past two years and will reduce it next year.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> That is not true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is true. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis told me last week that it was true, and I am prepared to accept what he says. [Interruption.] If the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd), does not think it serious that his constituents are receiving a lower level of policing this year, I hope that they agree with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Canning Town) rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No, I will not give way. I think, and so do my constituents, that we should have the maximum amount of policing. There should be no cuts in the police budget, or caps on it. The Government should give the Committee an assurance that we will be able to have the budget we want. That is why we are probing: we want to make sure that we do not give the Government power suddenly to interfere in London's police budget and tell the GLA that it will have to pay for any cuts by taking money out of another service it has democratically agreed that it wants to spend money on.
<P>
I think that the question is clear. It is about having more resources for policing, not fewer. There are all too few at the moment.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The hon. Gentleman, on reflection--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is addressing the Committee. I do not want there to be arguments across the debate while she is speaking.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I was going to say that when the hon. Gentleman reads Hansard, he will, on reflection, recognise that his last remarks were slightly over the top. They did not do justice to the work of the police or, indeed, the sensible settlement that has just been announced for London.
<P>
I assume that the hon. Gentleman has not read the Police Act 1996, which deals with efficient and effective policing and clearly applies it to all police authorities. The policy is nothing new, and has not been plucked out of the air.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Police authorities can set a minimum budget requirement. In the fire service, the fire authority is duty bound to set a budget that will enable it to meet its statutory obligations under the Fire Services Act 1947. That is a ready precedent for the setting of a minimum budget in other police authorities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's last point again related to the minimum budget. If a direction were given that meant that the GLA would have to reconsider how it would find the extra money, it would have flexibility in how it would respond. It can increase the authority's consolidated budget requirement, and thus the precept, it can cut the budget requirement of one or more of the other functional bodies or it can opt for a combination of those approaches. It will be up to the authority to decide how to react. Such action will not be taken unless the Secretary of State, acting on behalf of the whole country, decides that it is necessary. The people of London would be very disturbed if they felt that the Liberal Democrats wanted a London authority to be able to put people's lives at risk and to have law and order subject to its whims.
<P>
The Secretary of State must have that final power. The Government feel strongly about that, as do the people of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am sure that the people of London feel strongly about that.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary guarantee that if the GLA wants to increase the precept, the amount that it can raise to enable it to make up for the money that it is required to put into the police will not be capped? I am just trying to make sure. If that is not the case, the authority will be directed from one end and capped from the other, and the only place to find the additional money will be from other budgets.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman feels that the matter is unclear. As I said, it will be up to the authority to decide. It may have to take money from elsewhere in the specific circumstances that he described. That will be up to the authority to decide. It would not be in anyone's interests to allow the authority to set a budget that would not be adequate to ensure that people are properly policed.
<P>
It is ridiculous that the hon. Gentleman continues to harp on about resources and police numbers. The increase for London was 1.7 per cent. There is clearly a need for police forces throughout the country to be more efficient and to examine how they are spending their money. We shall not repeat the debate about numbers and resources that was held in the House last week. We must get away from always viewing police numbers as being the measure of police effectiveness. We are expecting all police forces, including the Metropolitan police, to make efficiency savings of 2 per cent. That will realise substantial savings that will be allowed to go back into front-line policing.
<P>
I do not want to wear your patience, Mr. Winterton, because I am sure that the Committee will further debate the matter under part VI. The clause is crucial for ensuring the safety of people in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Liberal Democrats will not seek to vote against the clause, but we will return with relish to debates on the Metropolitan police authority and its resources. The clear evidence for problems is that the Met had the second worst settlement in the country this year, and is in great difficulty with its policing. There will be other opportunities to make changes on Report, when we may want to table amendments to protect budgets--not just that of the police authority--from being raided because of the Government's pincer movement.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 80, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 81</center></H4>
<H4><center>Minimum budget for Metropolitan Police Authority: supplemental provisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 333, in page 45, line 16, leave out "35" and insert "15".
<P>
I use the amendment to ask a simple, straightforward question. Anxiety has been expressed that the clause states that the authority must make substitute calculations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"before the end of the period of 35 days beginning with the day on which it receives the direction".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That could give rise to the risk of a hiatus or gap in police funding that could adversely affect policing. By means of the amendment, which would reduce the number of days in question, I seek an absolute assurance from the Minister that nothing in the Bill would put effective policing at risk. Is not the amendment simply a technical requirement?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I welcome the right hon. Gentleman's questions as they provide an opportunity for me to explain the proposal.
<P>
The amendment would require the GLA to make substitute calculations in 15 days rather than 35 days. That is too short. The GLA will have to follow the procedure set out in schedule 6, which involves the mayor and the assembly. It is essential that any changes to the budget are considered carefully, especially where cuts are being made, as might be the case in this respect.
<P>
In general, when a local authority is designated and has to set a new budget requirement, it is expected to do so in 21 days. To insist that the GLA, which has to involve the mayor and the assembly in the process, completes its substitute calculations in a shorter time is unrealistic. The GLA will, in any case, wish to complete these substitute calculations as quickly as possible--it is in its interests to do so--as it may need to adjust its spending plans or rebill the local taxpayers. Therefore, I ask the right hon. Gentleman, having heard that explanation to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I shall do so because I will take what the Minister said as an assurance that there can be no question of a shortfall in funding in an interim period. The Minister was referring to general and established practice elsewhere, but on that basis--
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Perhaps I should clear up any further concern by telling the right hon. Gentleman that the police would not be left without resources because they would have resources for the first budget, which the substitute calculations would replace. They would therefore have a substantial amount of money to be going on with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. On the basis of her assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 81 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 82 and 83 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Schedule 6</B><P>
<P>
Procedure for making of substitute
calculations by the Authority
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 156, line 37, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or section 52K or 52V of the Local Government Finance Act 1992".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 306.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford</B> The amendments tidy up the arrangements for making substitute calculations by the GLA. Amendment No. 305 covers the interaction between this Bill and the provisions in the local government finance legislation for limiting council tax and precepts. Amendment No. 306 turns the assembly's power to make substitute calculations when the mayor fails to present a first or final draft into a duty.<P>
<P>
Amendment No. 305 is important because schedule 6 sets out the roles of the mayor and assembly in the procedure for making substitute calculations. The Secretary of State will set a minimum budget for the Metropolitan police authority, but if the GLA does not make substitute calculations within the prescribed period, it will not receive precepts from the billing authorities until it has done so. Schedule 6 refers to the period of restriction defined in clause 81.
<P>
Similarly, if the GLA is designated under the new powers in the Local Government Bill, it will be subject to a period of restriction for which sections 52K and 52V of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 make provision. Government amendment No. 305 inserts reference to these sections in schedule 6.
<P>
Schedule 6, as drafted, gives the assembly power to make substitute calculations if the mayor fails in his or her duty to present a first or final draft to it in accordance with the authority's standing orders. Government amendment No. 306 is needed to convert that power into a duty.
<P>
The roles of the mayor and the assembly in making substitute calculations are set out in schedule 6. That procedure is designed to give the mayor and the assembly an appropriate role in these important processes and to prevent deadlock. Government amendment No. 306 ensures that circumstances do not arise in which there is no effective duty to make substitute calculations.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made:
<P>
No. 306, in page 156, line 38, leave out "may" and insert "shall".--[Mr. Raynsford.]

<B>Clause 85</B><P>
<P>
General GLA grant
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 352, in page 47, line 10, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) The Secretary of State shall publish the cost assumptions on which the amount of the grant has been determined.".<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) The Secretary of State shall publish the cost assumptions on which the amount of the grant, or any variation in the amount of the grant, has been determined.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We return to our old friend transparency. We wish to improve the Bill's provisions on the determination and payment of grants. To give that process a firm basis, the Secretary of State should be obliged to put into the public domain assumptions that he has made in establishing the amount of grant. That will enable people to see for themselves how that figure was arrived at and, more importantly, to make a judgment about the authority's use of the grant. The Secretary of State's explanation of the derivation of the grant, calculations and so on should be an important part of that judgment, and would be part of the continuum of judgment and accountability to be developed by the Bill. That is the basis of the amendment. I look forward to the Ministers' response, in which they might explain how they would provide an alternative basis for justifying the grant and its accountability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I support most warmly the amendment moved so succinctly by my right hon. Friend. It is crucial that the electorate of London know the basis on which the Secretary of State reaches what may appear to be an extremely arbitrary judgment and which, in all likelihood, will conflict with the plans and projects and, above all, the manifesto laid down by the mayor at his election and promulgated thereafter in his annual reports to the assembly and, thereby, to London as a whole.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The people of London will understand that they will be in for a roller-coaster ride in as much as the Treasury will take decisions for reasons of macro-economic policy that may have nothing to do with the priorities of Londoners 431 432 in their capital-wide context. From the outset, it is essential that the Secretary of State explain in full measure the exact basis on which the apparently arbitrary determination has been made. That is why I support my right hon. Friend, and it is quite essential that the Committee should, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We, too, support the amendment because it is important to place in the Bill as many measures as possible to ensure transparency and clarity when it comes to assessing the appropriate level of grant that is being paid to enable the GLA to undertake its functions. We therefore hope that the Minister can accept the amendment because clarity is needed for the procedures by which the grant will be paid.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The amendments would require the Secretary of State to publish the cost assumptions on which he determined the amounts of general GLA grant and GLA transport grant. The Secretary of State will be obliged to consult the mayor before determining the amounts of grant to pay to the GLA. I would expect the mayor's transport strategy for London to form the basis of the consultation on GLA transport grant. I would be very surprised if the mayor did not make public the content of the consultations. I would also be surprised if London Members of Parliament did not table parliamentary questions asking about the basis for the determinations.
<P>
Hon. Members cannot seriously expect me to agree that the Secretary of State should be under a duty to publish the cost assumptions on which the amounts of these grants have been determined. Are Opposition Members trying to demand that the Secretary of State should have to make public the advice that he or she has received in coming to decisions? As they very well know, it is a clear principle that policy advice to Ministers should not be published.
<P>
 
The amendments would not add anything to the information that will already be in the public domain. We already have a very long Bill, and we do not need to add to it unnecessarily. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B> Mr. Forth:</B> I am afraid that the Minister misses the point. I am asking the Secretary of State to publish not the advice but the conclusions which may well result from having received advice. That is a different thing altogether.
<P>
I am also rather disappointed that, in this era when much is said of open government, the Minister should so classically portray the secretive approach for which the previous Administration were from time to time criticised. In a peculiar sort of way, I am rather glad to see a continuum from what happened before to what happens now; but that is not quite the point of the exercise. I am disappointed. I do not on this occasion accept the rationale that the Minister has offered, and this is something to which we may wish to return in a different form. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We want to ask one or two questions about the way the clause will operate in practice. We would be particularly interested to know when the Government will be able to publish some indicative figures of the splits that they anticipate between what will be raised through self-finance mechanisms such as the council tax and what will be provided by Government grants. Clearly if the Government intend to publish and set out the authority's budget, it would be useful for the Committee to have some idea of the timetable on which they intend to operate, and to ascertain tonight whether we can anticipate more detailed figures, which will be indicative of the split between the moneys from central Government grants and those from council tax. That would allow us further to test the figure of 3p on band D, to which the Department's briefing material referred.
<P>
Once the GLA is established, when will the GLA grant be announced? Will it be part of the general local government settlement announcement, or will a separate announcement be made? Will the House have the opportunity to debate a motion on the GLA grant, or will it be rolled up in a motion that deals with local government funding in general?
<P>
We have made important points about mechanisms of accountability in Parliament, and about holding the Government to account by ascertaining how much they will pay the GLA. It is important to establish sooner rather than later to what extent the Government anticipate funding services through centrally provided grants, and how much will be raised through council tax.
<P>
<B> Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am somewhat surprised by the hon. Gentleman's contribution. Throughout our proceedings, he and his colleagues have argued for the need for consultation. Clearly, we are in no position to make a specific response to the bulk of his questions because discussions are on-going with, for example, the ALG. All the London boroughs need to be consulted, too.
<P>
Clauses 85 and 86 create two new government grants. Clause 85 provides for the Secretary of State to pay the authority a general purpose grant. It is envisaged that that grant will cover the majority of the costs of the mayor and assembly, and that council taxpayers will cover most of the remainder. The Secretary of State will consult the mayor before settling the amount. The grant will be paid annually, and it may be paid in instalments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked whether the announcement of the GLA grant would be made at the same time as that for other local authorities. We expect it to be made around the same time.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 389, in page 47, line 22, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"but the amount of the grant shall increase by at least the annual rate of the Retail Price Index in each year beginning from the Authority's second financial year.".
You were in the House, Mr. Winterton, when the Bill that set up the national lottery was passed. During that process, there was a debate about whether the funds that the national lottery raised for the arts and sport would be new money, additional to the money that the Government already contributed. A similar additionality argument has been applied to European Union regional funds--it is often asked whether they are additional to United Kingdom Government funds.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The concept of additionality lies behind the amendment. Later in our proceedings, we shall discuss the introduction of congestion charges and parking levies. It is important that the revenues from those new taxes are genuinely additional and new, over and above the revenues that London Transport currently receives from the Government.
<P>
The two new taxes are clearly controversial. Newspaper reports claim that the Government's famous focus groups already show some negative public reaction to the charges. We hope that the Government win the argument with the London public. If they are to do that, they will have to prove that the money constitutes new funds, and is not a substitute for central Government grants. That point is politically significant for the GLA. We all know the risks of introducing a new tax. The previous Government found that the poll tax very quickly became exceedingly unpopular. Those of us who believe that levying congestion charges is a way of tackling London's traffic problems are aware that introducing that levy will have the public's support.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Government were very nervous about the measure. In that debate, we referred several times to the wording of schedule 13, which suggests that the revenues raised from congestion charges could be paid into the consolidated fund. From the perspective of the ordinary Londoner who will pay those charges, they will be a national tax. The Government got very touchy about that on Second Reading; they said that the Deputy Prime Minister had given assurances that all the money raised from congestion charges over the next 10 years would be ploughed into London's public transport. During the recess, we heard from the press that the Government intended to change the wording; they did not say that on Second Reading--[Interruption].

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the Opposition Whip return to his place and not bounce between me and the hon. Member who is talking?
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I apologise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Accepted.
<P>
<B> Mr. Davey:</B> I hope that the Government will confirm those leaks and that they intend to amend the legislation  to ensure that the money will be hypothecated to public transport in London. It would therefore make sense for them to accept our amendment, which seeks to help them achieve that goal. If the Government are keen to win the argument with the people of London on congestion charges, they should accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman, who clearly has a selective memory and a short retention span, about the position on the use of road-user charging and work place parking levy revenues. The Government's ground-breaking arrangement will see pilot charging schemes retaining 100 per cent. of the net proceeds for at least 10 years from the implementation of a scheme. We have made it clear that the revenues from new charges will be additional revenue for transport spending in London. I shall repeat that for the hon. Gentleman, since he has grave difficulties in remembering anything. We have made it clear that the revenues from new charges will be additional revenue for transport spending in London. Schemes will require a separate income and expenditure account and accounts will be published annually, ensuring transparency. An extra £l.8 billion will be made available over the next three years to deliver the Government's integrated transport strategy. London will receive a fair share of that.
<P>
The amendment flies in the face of all consideration of best value and the effective use of resources. It would tie the Secretary of State to making an annual increase in the amount of GLA transport grant, regardless of whether such an increase were justified and even of whether the mayor had asked for more money. In the light of my comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister makes some reassuring remarks. It is clearly the Government's intention to assure Londoners that the money that is currently provided to London Transport will continue to be provided and that congestion charges will be additional. If that is the Government's intention, they should accept our amendment. If the Government's intention is to be achieved, we need to ensure that the GLA transport grant is maintained in real terms.
<P>
Given the hour, we shall not press the amendments to a Division. We want to give the Government time to reflect on the strength of our argument--they do not seem to have understood the force of the argument and we should like to return to the subject on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
