<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Requirement for private hire vehicle driver's licence</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> It is a privilege to work under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Earlier, I attempted to tackle some of the anxieties of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) about fees, their amount and the facilities to ensure that licensing would be entirely self-supporting. The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned consultation. It might be helpful if I gave the Committee the possible implementation timetable, and then dealt with fees.
<P>
If we assume that the Bill will receive Royal Assent in October 1999, the Secretary of State will formally agree the delegation of his day-to-day licensing powers to the Metropolitan police. The Public Carriage Office will have to form a project implementation team, begin recruiting and training staff, order the necessary computer hardware and software and start to plan and effect any accommodation changes.
<P>
Meanwhile Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions officials will have to get orders drafted, especially those that relate to transitional arrangements for existing operators, drivers and cars. The consultation period will then commence. That could take from December 1998 to February 1999.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young </B>(North-West Hampshire): When the Minister began her remarks, she said that the Bill would receive Royal Assent in 1999. Did she mean 1998?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I did. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for correcting my slip of the tongue so speedily.
<P>
When the consultation period has concluded, the results will be analysed, and orders will be made and laid before Parliament. That could take until the end of July 1999. Some regulations could be made later.
<P>
When the requirements for minicab testing have been agreed, the Public Carriage Office will put vehicle testing out to tender. As the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out, there are many minicabs. There are too many to be tested at Penton street. The Public Carriage Office will also have to put out to tender drivers' badges and minicab plates, once their design requirements have been determined.
<P>
There will have to be a phased introduction of licensing. We established that this morning. However, if all goes well, operator licensing could start as early as June 1999 and be completed with all existing operators' applications processed 12 months later.
<P>
Minicab licensing could start by January 2000 and be completed in 12 months. Driver licensing depends on transitional arrangements and the rate at which criminal record checks can be carried out. That process could start by January 2000 and may be completed by December 2000. On the issue of cost, which the right hon. Gentleman had some concern about, we have already established that minicab licensing must be self-financing, that licence fees will be set by the Secretary of State, who will wish to be satisfied that the system is being administered with due regard to efficiency, and that there will be no cross-subsidy from taxi licensing to private hire vehicle licensing or vice versa.
<P>
I asked for information on licence fees outside London and a survey carried out by the National Association of Taxi and Private Hire Enforcement Officers in 1996 gives an indication of average licence fees in England and Wales outside London. The cost of private hire licences is as follows: vehicle licences cost £119; driver licences cost £48; operator licences cost £105. A comparison between taxi licence fees and the provinces give us good reason to suppose that the fees for private hire licensing will not be out of line with the provinces.
<P>
The average cost of taxi licences in the provinces was £131 for vehicle licences and £45 for driver licences. The fees in London in 1996 were £78 for a vehicle licence and £87 for a driver licence. There is quite a variation in the fees charged for minicab vehicle driver and operator licences in the provinces, but the PCO is already aware of typical figures. It would certainly have them in mind in drawing up licence fees for London. As I have already said, such fees must be approved by the Secretary of State. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Certainly enforcement does not come free. The more pressure there is for greater enforcement, the higher the fees would have to be. I hope that that helps the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should have indicated for the convenience of the Committee before we started that I intend to suspend the Committee from 7 until 8.30 pm for dinner should the Committee sit until then.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>London PHV driver's licences</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Ms Perham:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, and welcome to the Chair. I am sure that you will conduct our business with the same briskness and efficiency as Mr. Winterton demonstrated this morning.
<P>
I should like to speak to the four amendments in my name. I tabled them with the aim of finding a way through a difficult issue in a Bill which ought to be uncontroversial. That issue apart, we should surely all agree that the proper regulation of the London minicab trade to bring it into line with the rest of the country is long overdue. The amendments will ensure that passengers using private hire cars are given the opportunity of reaching their destination by the most direct route in the shortest possible time.
<P>
I was enormously encouraged that on 5 May my hon. Friend the Minister, in reply to a question I asked in the House, agreed with me about the need for checks on a driver's criminal record, health and topographical knowledge. That was also supported by many Members on Second Reading and by the 111 Members who signed early-day motion 637. Indeed, in a debate in the other place on 13 May, Lord Brabazon of Tara stated his intention to move an amendment altering "may" to "shall" require.
<P>
The key element in the amendment is the substitution of the word "shall" for the word "may" in line 15 of the clause. The clause will therefore impose a clear duty on the Secretary of State to require applicants for a minicab driver's licence to satisfy him about their topographical knowledge. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister assured us on Second Reading that the clause would be implemented, but we all hope that the Bill will stay on the statute book for a long time; it therefore seems right to try to ensure that a future Secretary of State will have to deal with the issue of topographical knowledge for minicab drivers. That is an important issue for the taxi trade, many of whose members I have the honour to represent in my constituency. They want to ensure that competition from minicabs is fair.
<P>
Above all, the issue is important for the travelling public, the users of minicabs. They deserve to know that their driver has proper knowledge and the ability to use a map. Not only is it an irritation for passengers to have to attempt to direct a lost minicab driver, but it is dangerous if a driver is forced to consult an "A to Z" while driving.
<P>
Mandatory topographical testing is also supported by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the Consumers Association, the CBI and tourist organisations, as well as London's public. In a MORI poll commissioned by the London Taxi Board, 91 per cent. of Londoners agreed there was a need for drivers to have a knowledge of the area in which they operated.
<P>
While it is clear to me that the world "shall" should replace "mayin clause 13(3), I acknowledge the points made by my hon. Friend on Second Reading. We need to ensure that the Bill will function properly in 20 or 30 years' time, and we need flexibility to cope with changed circumstances, including, particularly, possible technological change on matters such as car navigation systems. Indeed, I recognise that there are different points of view on the issue outside the House, and that it is right to aim for a Bill that can gain general acceptance. Accordingly, the amendments include a measure of flexibility and amendment No. 3 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knowledge of London or parts of London".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That partly reflects the fact that the right to ply for hire across the whole of London will still be the exclusive preserve of taxi drivers. I want to assure my constituents that nothing in the amendments or the Bill alters that vital fact, and I hope that the Minister can confirm it.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 refers to the general topographical skills 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which appear to him" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the Secretary of State 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be appropriate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is to provide the flexibility that my hon. Friend said she wanted but within limits. The essential point is the replacement of the word "may" with "shall" and the consequent clear duty imposed on the Secretary of State something that many hon. Members who spoke on Second Reading wanted. A couple of technical consequential amendments are also necessary pursuant to the main amendments.
<P>
The amendments would improve the Bill. They would lead to private hire customers being offered a reliable, safe and time-efficient service, they would allay the fears of many in the tax industry; and they would respond to the Minister's wish to provide a firm and enduring framework of legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I join the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Ms Peckham) in welcoming you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair of the Committee, which you will, I think find to be conducting its business in a brisk and effective way.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 is intended to reflect an interesting point that was raised with me in my discussions with many of the interested parties. There is a worry, in some quarters, that a serving police officer who drove a minicab as a part-time job could be influenced in his principal duty as an officer, in enforcing laws and regulations covering the private hire trade. I am not in a position to judge how far that might be the case: it is at least a possibility. The amendment would put the matter beyond doubt by ensuring that serving police officers would be unable to obtain a licence as private hire vehicle drivers.
<P>
Arguing that police officers often work anti-social hours might allay some concerns. We may have doubts about people satisfactorily discharging their onerous responsibilities as police officers and then working safely as minicab drivers. The amendments are tabled in that spirit: hon. Members must make their own judgment about the desirability of people working in both jobs.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 81 touches on the fascinating subject of topographical knowledge. It would be respectable to argue that when one hires a minicab not a taxicab one is quoted the fare in advance, so it does not matter what route the driver takes. A driver may take a customer all around London, provided that the fare is agreed in advance.
<P>
That argument has considerable strength. The taxicab trade puts great emphasis in the fact as was mentioned this morning that when a meter is clocking up the fare it is of great interest to the customer that the driver has sufficient topographical knowledge to ensure that the taxicab travels from A to B as efficaciously as possible.
<P>
That does not apply to private hire vehicles. So it might be argued that a mandatory requirement for topographical knowledge is redundant for drivers of such vehicles. We must consider the extent to which we wish to continue differentiating in our minds, in statutes and in regulations the businesses of taxicabs and of private hire vehicles. It is not persuasive to argue that as taxicab drivers are proud of having the knowledge, it should be required of minicab drivers. We are discussing two different products, with differently structured fares, so that argument has no great strength.
<P>
In any case, my main contention is that it is not relevant to replicate the London knowledge of taxicabs so beloved by us all in the private hire vehicle trade. Mandatory topographical knowledge should not be replicated. That is why amendment No. 81 would seek to remove the reference to London, substituting a more restrictive requirement that would be based on the area on which minicab drivers propose to work.
<P>
I am trying to strike a balance that would reassure customers that drivers have reasonable knowledge of the principal area in which they operate. Of course, I accept that a lot of private hire vehicles' trade is out of that immediate area. One could take a more relaxed view of such trade, especially of the long haul trips to which knowledge of London as a whole might not be relevant.
<P>
The wording of amendment No. 81 provides a balanced judgment. Knowledge that private hire vehicles are required to have should relate only to the area in which they propose to work and should not replicate the London knowledge of taxicab drivers. The hon. Member for Ilford, North reinforced that point when she quoted from a survey that asked punters whether they wanted drivers to know a bit about the area they worked in. Everyone who responded to that question said surprise, surprise yes. I am sure that I heard her say that the key phrase was "local knowledge". So it seems as if that survey supports my point: customers, being ever sensible, recognise a difference between what they expect of private hire vehicle drivers and that they expect of taxicab drivers.
<P>
<B>Ms Perham:</B> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst refers to the knowledge of London. I think that he means "the Knowledge" with a capital K; my amendment relates to knowledge with a small k of London or parts of London. That covers the local areas to which I referred in my speech. I understand his anxieties and the reasons why he tabled the amendment. However, his amendment is slightly more vague than mine and my amendment covers parts of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I recognise what the hon. Lady says. We could have an intriguing debate about upper and lower case. Indeed, we all understand that knowledge with a capital K is the classic Knowledge.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I can see, Mr. Gale, that you do not approve of that so I will not pursue the matter unduly. However, it is relevant in the context described by the hon. Member for Ilford, North. What worries me about her amendment is that London is referred to. That opens the possibility that, after consultations and with regulations duly made, a future licensing arrangement might impose a requirement of knowledge of London, even though the amendment states "or parts of". The hon. Lady, somewhat uncharitably, described my amendment as vague. However, it deliberately leaves out a reference to London and seeks to remove it from the provision for exactly the reason that I have given. There should be no confusion on these matters.
<P>
Without imputing any motives to anyone, I know that there are those not unadjacent to the taxi-cab trade who would like to impose requirements about the knowledge of London on private hire vehicle drivers. However, I am not sure that that is the objective of the Bill, although my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire may correct me. Perhaps he had something of that sort in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Hill </B>(Streatham): Perhaps I can assist the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst by responding to his concerns about the reference to London, as a wider entity, and parts of London. Studies of the journeys taken by minicab operators show that they engage in two sorts of journey. For the most part, they operate within a radius of three miles from their operating base, which I take to be a reference to parts of London. That is exactly the locality with which he is concerned and which appears in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North.
<P>
The other sort of journey taken by minicabs is longitudinal journeys from the base, from the locality, to railway stations or to airports. In respect of the latter journeys, it makes sense for the drivers to be required to have a knowledge of London, but not the detailed street-[Mr. Keith Hill]
by-street knowledge that is expected of the black cab trade. We respect that knowledge in the black cab trade and it justifies the higher fares that are charged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for those helpful remarks. What he says may be true, but I am not sure, from my inexpert reading, that it is clear in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ilford, North. I am worried that if we accepted the amendment it would allow of the importation, at some stage, into the regulations, and therefore the requirements, of our good old friend knowledge with a capital K. It might be something in between if there were something between upper and lower case but it would be a move in the wrong direction altogether.
<P>
Perhaps I am over-suspicious; perhaps I have seen too much of this business from the other end of the telescope. However, I have set out the reasons for my anxiety and I prefer the more modest wording of my amendment.
<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 82, which is designed with the safety element of the Bill in mind. One can imagine many circumstances in which a driver is in a position of temporary responsibility for his customer or customers. If we are to take seriously worries about the lack of customer safety in private hire vehicles, and if we are bothered about the extent to which a driver understands instructions, or about his ability to respond to emergencies that may arise during the journey, it is blindingly obvious that if the driver does not have a working knowledge of the English language, he may put customers or even, in some circumstances, people outside the vehicle at risk. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is only a statement of what has been obvious hitherto.
<P>
If we license drivers who do not have a working knowledge of the English language, we may be putting passengers at risk, yet one of the main objectives of the Bill is to eliminate risks to the health and safety of passengers travelling in private hire vehicles. The amendment is straightforward and my intention is obvious. I hope that it will command the support of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Efford </B>(Eltham): I welcome you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair. I hope that we shall move through proceedings as quickly this afternoon as we did this morning.
<P>
The Government provided some assistance in drafting the amendments. An important alteration is being made to the wording by changing "may" to "shall" which would not leave the decision entirely to the Minister, with all due respect to the current incumbent. Previous Ministers stated their opposition to the requirement for knowledge in the private hire industry.
<P>
The public of London do not accept that the private hire industry should continue to employ drivers who do not have a working knowledge of the area in which they ply their trade. My hon. Friend referred earlier to a survey which stated that 91 per cent. of people asked felt that it should be a requirement on private hire vehicle drivers to have a working knowledge of the area in which they work.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 would clarify what was meant by knowledge as a working tool. My hon. Friend pointed out that the area in which a driver works may include places not in the immediate locality to and from which he may be required to make journeys such as a railway station or some other major venue in other parts of London. The definition of knowledge needs to be looser. The wording suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North is more workable and more in line with the reality of the private hire industry.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied that the wording makes sufficient distinction between the knowledge as we all understand it in relation to the taxi cab trade and a different sort of knowledge that may be applicable here? I am not sufficiently familiar with existing law and regulations to know whether the knowledge, if mentioned, has a capital K. Can we make a distinction in the wording that the hon. Gentleman considered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I believe that we can. I have tried to cross the "t's" and dot the "i's" to close loopholes and prevent loose interpretation of some clauses.
<P>
In the past, Ministers were reluctant to introduce effective regulation of the private hire industry. I have been involved in negotiations, and I believe that we should not leave it to future Ministers to interpret the clauses in a way that would allow the private hire industry to slip backwards into previous practices.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to define the knowledge, because it will be a different animal in different areas. It will be at the Minister's discretion to devise a workable framework, which will include a form of knowledge, and set a minimum requirement for anyone who wants to be a private hire vehicle driver in London.
<P>
Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions officials and the PCO opposed establishing such a framework in the past. The PCO recently claimed that the only knowledge requirement should be the ability to read an "A to Z". Will the Minister assure us that the final requirement will be a bit more onerous? I do not need an assurance from the Minister, because the wording of the clause already provides it.
<P>
The private hire industry has resisted the introduction of the knowledge, but if we want professional drivers who are committed to the industry and care about customers' opinions, because they want them to use the firm again, they should show some form of commitment. Giving up their time and making the effort to attain a level of knowledge before being allowed to ply a trade shows such commitment.
<P>
The licensed tax industry currently requires prospective drivers to spend a minimum of two and a half years on the knowledge at their own expense, in their own time, and with no financial support, before they can become London taxi drivers. That is a key element in the self-enforcement of the licensed taxi trade.
<P>
We can all relate horror stories about people's treatment by licensed taxi drivers. I hasten to add that none of those stories are about me! On the whole, however, licensed taxi drivers value their badge enormously because of the commitment that they had to show to the industry before they were allowed to earn a penny from it. Their desire to retain their badge and to be allowed to continue to ply their trade overcomes any temptation to break the rules.
<P>
We support a more professional approach from some parts of the minicab industry. Making a commitment to going through the knowledge contributes to that aim.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 deals with criminal record checks, and would replace "may" in subsection (4) with "shall", and require the Secretary of State to pass information to the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Unless the information is passed to the Metropolitan police, no record check can be made. If the information is not passed to the police in every case, I do not know whether criminal record checks will be carried out on every applicant. That is a minimum requirement of the people of London, and everyone who has been consulted on the matter, to ensure that only fit and proper people are given licences to ply their trade as private hire vehicle drivers.
<P>
My final amendment would introduce a one-year renewal of private hire driver licences. I tabled the amendment in response to some of the experiences of licensing authorities outside London. Drivers found guilty of road traffic offences pleaded in court that they would lose their livelihoods if their licences were taken away, yet they continually rack up the number of points on their licences way above the limit normally allowed to other drivers. When some drivers come to renew their licences at the end of a three-year period they can have as many as 26 points on them. I have been told of such instances in Birmingham.
<P>
I have never had any points on my licence and I spent 12 years plying my trade in London. It is legitimate to ask whether drivers with so many points on their licence have a sufficiently professional attitude to their work and whether they should be allowed to ply their trade in a minicab or a licensed taxi. I tabled the amendment to highlight that difficulty. Without an annual renewal it will be more difficult to highlight the abuses by such drivers and deal with them effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman considered it would be unfair at this stage to ask whether he has made an estimate the likely impact on the licensing body of changing the requirements from three to one year? We spoke this morning about the ability of the body to handle the bureaucracy in the Bill and I am grateful to the Minister for providing us with an estimate of how she envisages implementation, which will help to set matters in context. However, what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting would be a dramatic move. Is he satisfied that it would be reasonable for the PCO to implement an annual renewal system for what could be 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 drivers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's point. I pass his question on to the Minister and add my own question to it. Has she considered how more effective enforcement will be under annual renewal of licences and the subsequent savings that could be made on the cost of enforcement in this difficult industry? Annual renewal would bring to the attention of the public the people who are probably the source of most of the difficulties within the industry. As I say, there could be significant cost savings. Will the Minister tell us the likely annual cost of licence renewal and the potential savings if it is carried out?
<P>
I conclude by welcoming the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Minister for Ilford, North, which would bring a major improvement to the Bill. We should clarify the issue of criminal record checks and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on annual renewal.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> When I saw who were the joint Chairmen Mr. Winterton and Mr. Gale on the Standing Committee considering my Bill, I thought that it might have hostile atmospheric connotations. Happily, that has not so far proved to be the case and I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) about amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, which have helped to create a consensus on the right way forward. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Ilford, North on tabling those four amendments, which I hope the Committee will accept, thereby resolving one of the most contentious issues of the Bill.
<P>
My right hon. Friend has summarised the background. The taxi trade was anxious to make some sort of knowledge test mandatory, for reasons that the hon. Member for Eltham described very well on Second Reading. For my part, I was conscious that no other legislation on taxis or minicabs in London, the rest of England and Wales or Scotland, made any express reference to topographical knowledge or anything like it. Yet tests of such knowledge are widespread, most famously perhaps for London taxi drivers.
<P>
Provision in the Bill could hardly be said to be essential, against that background. However, my Bill broke new ground with an express reference to topographical knowledge. I was a little disappointed when that was represented to me as insufficient. I was above all concerned that any provision should be flexible. That point has already been mentioned.
<P>
We live in changing times, and that is certainly relevant to navigation technology. The amount of 19th century legislation on the statute book shows that opportunities for fresh legislation on taxis and minicabs are rare. It must therefore be right to try to legislate now in a way that will not be overtaken by events, leaving the law to look foolish. Too often, inflexible legislation is bad legislation.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ilford, North are carefully worded to provide sufficient flexibility. The nicely balanced draft would allow the Secretary of State proper discretion, while still imposing a requirement on him. The key word in that respect is "shall", which would replace "may" in subsection (3) if amendment No. 2 were passed, but the other amendments in the group are also necessary to the desired degree of flexibility. The reference to the Secretary of State requiring applicants to demonstrate 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a level . . . of . . . topographical skills . . . which appear to him to be appropriate"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is an example. Those are key words.
<P>
The Secretary of State would, under the amendments, have a clear duty, balanced by a measure of discretion. I suggest to the Committee that all the changes proposed by the hon. Member for Ilford, North are appropriate as a balanced package, bearing in mind the switch from "May" to "shall".
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made the point that if one pre-books and agrees the fare in advance, it does not matter quite so much if the route is not the most direct. I know that my right hon. Friend and I have slightly more time at our disposal than we did a year ago, but when one gets into a minicab time as well as money is a factor to be considered, and most of us would probably prefer a direct route to avoid a waste of time.
<P>
It has never been my intention that knowledge as provided for in the Bill should be interpreted as knowledge with a capital K, such as that currently applicable to the taxi trade. I do not want to fetter the discretion of the Secretary of State, to whom the provision gives powers to decide an appropriate test. The word "appropriate" recognises the fact that the people concerned would not be plying for hire; a lesser degree of knowledge might be appropriate.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept the four amendments. The issue has been a difficult one, because of the strong views on either side. It is in the nature of such cases that no one achieves everything that he wants. There are no perfect solutions, but the amendments steer a useful way through the complexities and sensitivities that have confronted us.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst wants to prevent a serving police officer from being a minicab driver. I should certainly be surprised if a serving police officer applied to become a minicab driver. I am not familiar with the rules that apply to policemen, but they may well set out requirements affecting whether a policeman can do a second job at all, let alone minicab driving. It is not clear to me that we should go quite as far as my right hon. Friend suggests, and make the practice illegal. For example, a police officer close to retirement might want to apply for a licence as a preparation for a new job on leaving. There might be other circumstances, such as a security operation or undercover operation, in which a serving police officer would need to become a licensed minicab operator, to complete a piece of detective work. I hope therefore that my right hon. Friend will agree not to press that amendment.
<P>
My right hon. Friend also proposes that the knowledge requirement should relate only to the area in which an applicant intends to work as a PHV driver. Amendment No. 3, tabled by the hon. Member for Ilford, North includes the phrase "or parts of London", which would, I think, provide the necessary flexibility. I hope that my right hon. Friend will judge his objective to be met in that way.
<P>
I think that we all have some sympathy with the purpose of amendment No. 82 that minicab drivers should have a working knowledge of English and not just minicab drivers, but taxi drivers and anyone else who comes into regular contact with the public. I am not persuaded that that requirement should be in the Bill. We could all think of lots of useful requirements for a minicab driver, but that may result in a Bill of twice the length, festooned with good intentions.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is right to leave some discretion to the regulatory authority for the years ahead. The Minister may want to give us some reassurance about what is intended in that respect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eltham tabled another amendment that would substitute the word "shall" for "may" this time with respect to a criminal record check on applicants for drivers' licences. As with the suggested requirement for a knowledge of English, I am sympathetic. I expect that the Minister may tell us that such checks are the intention. However, we must take care that the authorities will not be troubled with unnecessary checks. For example, the applicant might be a serving police officer, or already have evidence in the form of another, recent licence, from another licensing authority, making it unnecessary to go all the way round the course again. I hope that the hon. Member will not press that amendment, particularly in the light of what the Minister might say on the matter.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Eltham proposed that minicab driver licences should be granted for only one year, instead of three. A move to annual renewal would have implications for cost and bureaucracy. London taxi drivers have three-year licences, which seems a reasonable precedent.
<P>
I have spoken at some length on the amendments, because they are important ones that arouse strong feelings on both sides of the Committee. I believe that we have found an appropriate balance and that on reflection the Committee might agree to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4; perhaps the hon. members concerned will not press the other amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): I want to press the question of flexibility in relation to topographical knowledge. I seek reassurance that, with technology progressing so quickly, any demand for topographical knowledge would be flexible enough to allow for the possibility of, for instance, someone merely typing in departure and arrival addresses and following the route on a screen. That can be done with existing technology.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North on tabling the amendments, which strike a very fair and reasonable balance on an issue that we all acknowledge is somewhat difficult and controversial. I hope that they will receive approval from the Committee, because they would improve what is already a good Bill.
<P>
I said on Second Reading that the power under clause 13 would be exercised anyway, despite the use of the word "may" rather than "shall". I stand by that undertaking. I prefer "may" to "shall" in that context. The Secretary of State has the necessary powers to be flexible something that more than one hon. Member has advocated during the debate. We want the Bill to be effective in the medium and long term. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire mentioned the technological improvements that have already begun to come on stream. I have little doubt that that process will accelerate. The essential points to consider are the flexibility inherent in the measure and the Secretary of State's power to be flexible.
<P>
Hon. Members have raised specific points in the debate. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) asked about the requirement for an individual applicant for a licence to have topographical knowledge. I am extremely reluctant to introduce specific provisions on that matter at this stage. The matter warrants close, careful and detailed scrutiny by the Public Carriage Office, not least in relation to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) about the journeys that are currently undertaken by minicab drivers. A huge variety of topographical knowledge about London would be required to provide the type of service that is not only specific to a local area, but is also needed for the longer journeys to which my hon. Friend referred. They are to places that are easily recognised he mentioned airports and railway stations, and hospitals might also be included. I am, therefore, reluctant to define specifics; that is the proper responsibility of the Public Carriage Office, with the knowledge that the Secretary of State has powers to instruct and to be flexible in these matters.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire made some particular points about criminal record checks. I confirm that it is intended to make a criminal record check on applicants for minicab driver licences, including renewals, as is already done for the drivers of London taxis. The only exception would be if the applicant could demonstrate that such a check had recently been made, possibly by another licensing authority. There has been much debate in Committee about resources and efficiency, and it would not be right to waste resources on unnecessary checks.
<P>
I also noted the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham about annual licences. However, as the licence period for London taxi drivers is three years, by the same token, that would also be appropriate for minicab drivers. The Secretary of State has the power to fix a shorter period in particular cases, if he sees the need to do so. That shows the flexibility of the powers to which the Secretary of State has recourse.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made a point about the ability of applicants for minicab licences to speak English. Such a check will be made, even though not every passenger will necessarily have a knowledge of English. However, that is not a matter that I wish to pursue. At this stage, it is not sensible to include every conceivable requirement in the Bill. I repeat that the Bill has great flexibility; there are powers for the Secretary of State and duties for the Public Carriage Office. I therefore hope that the right hon. Member will feel sufficiently reassured to withdraw amendment No. 82.
<P>
Turning to the clause as a whole, there will be careful consultation about its implementation. I hope that all members of the Committee will be reassured by my remarks.
<P>
In conclusion, and in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North, I confirm, without any reservation whatever, that the right to ply for hire on the streets will be available exclusively to black cab drivers. Nothing in the Bill changes that and nor should it. The unique nature of the black taxicab in London has already been mentioned. Black cabs are an enormous attraction not only to people who live in London, but also to visitors. They are a major attraction to tourists in this great capital city.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured those hon. Members who had doubts. I commend the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I will not take up much of the Committee's time on the use of premises and checks on[Mr. Efford]
criminal records, as I raised those matters on Second Reading.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 would require an operator to seek appropriate planning permission before operating a business from any particular premises. I have been told of such problems in relation to other licensing authorities. Operators sometimes set up businesses in premises for which they have not obtained change of use or planning permission and begin to operate private hire industries. Those premises may be inappropriate and may cause local problems. The planning procedure is cumbersome and is slow to remove such operators and to deal with the problems that they cause.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 would require that appropriate planning processes be completed before a licence is granted to an operator. That would tighten up this area and would prevent the problems that occur when such premises are opened without consultation with the local community through the statutory planning procedure. Will the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire comment on that? I would be very pleased if he would accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 10 to 12 would make provision for the Secretary of State to require such information to be obtained. Clause 15 tightens up an area that has proved to be loose in other licensing authorities. The amendments would make enforcement of the clause much simpler.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for his attempt to improve my Bill. I listened with interest to his suggestion that we should delete "may" in a number of places in clause 15 and replace it with "shall". The advice that I have is that the first three amendments may not help to make the meaning of the clause more clear. I think that "may" is adequate. It expresses what the clause means and it avoids doubts about whether the Secretary of State has fulfilled the requirement of the Act when he grants a licence.
<P>
If "shall" is used instead of "may" it makes it easier for a mischief maker not an allegation I make of the hon. Gentleman to apply for judicial review over the granting of a licence if it is compulsory for the Secretary of State to do every single thing listed in the clause in every case. I am therefore anxious that we should adhere to the present drafting of "may" rather than "shall", to avoid unnecessary judicial review.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the planning permission for an operating centre, I have no strong views about the proposal, provided that the "may" applying to this paragraph is maintained as I have just requested. However, if the hon. Gentleman looks at subsection(2) he will find that the Secretary of State already has adequate powers to ask for the information. There is therefore no real need for it to be added to the list in subsection (3). Against that background perhaps the hon. Member for Eltham will not press his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> It may be appropriate for the Committee to pause for a moment on the clause as it is a key clause to the operation of the Bill. It allows me to raise again, but in a slightly different form, the question that is of enormous relevance to our consideration namely, the link that will inevitably exist between the need properly to enforce and to carry out the intentions of the Bill and the structure that will be necessary to deliver that.
<P>
The Minister and I may disagree on the emphasis that we want to place on what we may variously understand by enforcement but I think we agree that that will have to be a prime element. That will have a key relationship with the number of operators and drivers of vehicles that will eventually be licensed. All that in turn, given the Minister's helpful explanations today, will begin to indicate the sort of fees that are likely to be payable.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for being as helpful as she has been in giving us some idea of the average licence fees payable outside London. I wonder whether that will be of much help, however, because my right hon. Friend pointed out right at the beginning of our proceedings that London in his view was going to benefit not only from replicating what happened outside but from improving on it. Given that London differs enormously not just in size but in substance from other cities, I question whether the figures helpfully provided by the Minister give us any guidance as to the fees that may be payable in the context of the future licensing of London's private hire vehicles.
<P>
While we are on this subject, can either my right hon. Friend or the Minister say whether the fees are likely to be payable on application or on grant because, as they will both know, the final words in paragraph 20 are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"due in respect of the application or grant is paid"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will immediately see that that could be of some significance. One can imagine a regime either in which the fee is payable on application and perhaps not refundable if the application is not granted or one where the fee is payable only on the grant of the licence.
<P>
I would be interested to know whether any thought has been given to that matter and whether any guidance can be given to the Committee. It could have quite an important impact on the extent to which people were encouraged to apply for licences or discouraged from doing so. There might be a read-across into the number of, perhaps not operators, but drivers and perhaps even vehicles submitted to the licensing process. It might be helpful to have some idea of what my right hon. Friend and the Minister have in mind here.
<P>
I hope that they will see the importance of what I am trying to ask in the context of the clause. It is a source of some worry to me that a number of possibilities exist here which could be detrimental to the main thrust and purpose of the Bill. If the mechanisms required properly to give effect to the Bill ended up being extraordinarily large and unwieldy, that would drive up the support revenue required because as the Minister has told us yet again, the scheme has to be self-financing. That in turn would dictate a high level of fees for the different licensing areas, and that could have a number of effects.
<P>
First, a lot of people could be deterred from wishing to be licensed as private hire vehicle operators and drivers. That could deprive large areas of London of the service that they give and/or it could drive up their charges. That thought has been in my mind since the Bill's inception; it is one of the prices that may have to be paid to achieve the ends outlined in the Bill. The judgment that I suspect most of the Committee will make is that that is a price worth paying, but at least we should be open in acknowledging the possibility, if not the likelihood, of that happening.
<P>
The other effect the equal and opposite effect if the licensing fees were too high is that a lot of people could be driven in the other direction and would seek to operate illegally. That in turn would defeat the objects of the Bill. Linking those two is the effectiveness or otherwise of the mechanisms which we have to police the regime and to prevent people from operating illegally.
<P>
There is an intimate causal relationship between all those factors. The key is the possible or probable level of the fees that will be payable. My right hon. Friend and the Minister may want the opportunity to return to the theme. I hope that they think it will be worth while. The more we can understand how we envisage this working the Minister has already been helpful about times scales and so on the more everyone has an appreciation of what is my right hon. Friend and the Minister have in mind, the more likely it will be that matters work out successfully and effectively.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I begin with the right hon. Gentleman's idea that the level of licensing fees could act as a deterrent or discouragement to those applying for licences. He went on to argue that that could result in certain areas of London being deprived of services that they now enjoy.
<P>
I should like to return the right hon. Gentleman to the very reason that the Bill is being debated essentially an issue of public safety. The Bill seeks to address the anomaly whereby minicabs in London are the only ones with no form of licensing regulation whatever. It is not an attempt to reduce employment opportunities for many thousands of minicab drivers and operators who conduct their business in the best interests of their customers, who would not dream of behaving in the same way as certain minicab drivers and who have themselves advocated and argued in favour of the sort of licensing regime that the Bill will introduce.
<P>
Arguments relating to discouragement and deterrence are not valid. If people are discouraged by the need to obtain a licence it could be for reasons other than the one floated by the right hon. Gentleman that the fees are much too high. I can think of other reasons by which people could be discouraged and deterred. As I have made clear to the right hon. Gentleman, I cannot at this stage inform him as to the precise fee, but it is anticipated that licence fees should not and will not be out of line with similar fees in the rest of England and Wales.
<P>
With all due respect, we are engaged in establishing a licensing regime, not the reinvention of the wheel and certainly not rocket science. We are not being asked as legislators to dive blindfolded into a great black hole as if no such legislation has ever been considered, debated or passed in this place before. There are sufficient examples of the variables that the right hon. Gentleman perceives in the effectiveness of licensing regimes outside London, for taxis and minicab vehicles, from which it will be possible for us the Secretary of State and the Public Carriage Office to learn.
<P>
As to fees on application or on grant, I believe that it could be either. I can see the advantage of paying on application so that frivolous and inadequate applications, of which there will be some, are charged for. If the fee is paid on grant, successful applicants are effectively paying for the unsuccessful.
<P>
I repeat that we have a wide store of knowledge by virtue of previous and existing licensing regimes outside London. We can learn from them. The fees will not be excessive. As I said with respect to the timetable, there is a rolling programme. I did not touch on it in great detail but once the regime is in place and working effectively, an element of self-enforcement will apply by virtue of those who have met the requirements and been successful in obtaining a licence. They will be astute and assiduous in ensuring that competitors not providing the same legitimate service to the general public do not succeed, and it will be in their interests to inform the relevant authorities. I believe that we can introduce a regime in London that tackles a serious, genuine and justifiable public anxiety the lack of licensing for minicabs.
<P>
I hope that my comments have reassured the right hon. Gentleman.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I shall not delay our proceedings. I tabled the amendments to seek clarification about the ultimate sanction, and to ascertain whether the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to revoke the licence of persistent offenders under clauses 28 and 30. Will people continue to rack up fines for offences under the Bill and never confront the possibility of losing their licences? What instructions will the Secretary of State give to the licensing authority about applying the ultimate sanction?
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I have some sympathy for the amendments. It could be argued that someone who knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement to renew or vary a licence is not fit to hold a licence, and should be liable to lose the licence.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would make those who contravened regulations on prohibited signs or notices liable to lose their licence.
<P>
Clause 16 gives the Secretary of State adequate powers to revoke a licence in the circumstances that the amendments describe. Therefore, the amendments are not strictly necessary. Clause 16 states that a licence may be suspended or revoked if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Secretary of State is... no longer satisfied that the licence holder is fit to hold such a licence... or has failed to comply with any... obligation imposed on him by or under this Act."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's anxieties, but the remedy already lies in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I tried to relate revoking the licence to constant breaches of the regulations that the Bill establishes. Enforcement should be as simple as possible. The clauses and their requirements should make enforcement automatic. If it is spelt out that licence holders face the ultimate sanction for breaches of some of the Bill's provisions, they will be less likely to transgress. In the licensed taxi industry, drivers are acutely aware of the threat of being prevented from trading, and having their licence suspended for a short time or permanently. That makes them reluctant to breach any regulations.
<P>
It should be made clear that a breach of the Bill's requirements will lead to the loss of a licence. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire has not dealt with the issue that I raised. Perhaps the Secretary of State can assist.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Regrettably, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is not here, but I shall try to be as helpful as I can.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will find it reassuring that the Secretary of State or the Public Carriage Office, if the Secretary of State's powers are delegated to it would have to take seriously the grave offences that my hon. Friend described. The powers exist, and I hope that my hon. Friend accepts the futility of engaging with all aspects of enforcement in a Bill. That has been mentioned more than once. However, the Bill grants great powers to the Secretary of State and those to whom he may delegate powers. The seriousness of the offences that already occur outside a legislative regime that has yet to be agreed, emphasise the necessity for the Bill.
<P>
The Secretary of State appreciates the seriousness of the offences, it is in no Secretary of State's interest to introduce a Bill that could be eroded or weakened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. I apologise for calling her the Secretary of State.
<P>
I want the penalties to apply to breaches on signage. There is a constant battle in the industry. Some people will push back boundaries and try to breach regulations. My argument has an important public safety aspect. If private hire vehicles are clearly indentifiable on the road, people will hail them. That already happens. People take the large aerials on cars to mean that a vehicle might be available for hire on the street. Constant breaches should lead to revocation of a licence because they constitute a major pubic safety issue. If drivers of private hire vehicles accept fares on the street, there is no come-back for a woman travelling late at night who accepts a ride from a driver without going through a minicab booking office. That is where people are most vulnerable and in most danger. Breaching regulations regarding signage and seeking to push back the boundary are the main problems that I am trying to underline.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I well appreciate my hon. Friend's points and I shall not bore him or the rest of the Committee by repeating what I have already said. I hope that he will find it reassuring that the Public Carriage Office and other interested parties will read every word of our debate, and I have no doubt that his particular concerns will be taken into account.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I tabled the amendments in the hope of provoking a response. We have already touched on the issue of signage. We need to tighten up the provisions in this major area of concern. Vehicles displaying signs become clearly identifiable on the road, blurring the distinction between the licensed taxi and private hire industries and creating confusion in the minds of the general public who believe that the vehicles are available for hire from the street.
<P>
We want to prevent people from being exposed to dangers when they hire private hire vehicles in circumstances where they have no checks or come-backs in the event of attack, robbery or worse by the driver. The vast majority of violent attacks on customers start with an illegal hiring on the streets. That is why it is important to prevent the confusion that encourages the public to approach private hire vehicles on the street as if they were licensed taxis. It underlines the difference in standards between the licensed taxi industry had the private hire industry.
<P>
Having said that, I have taken note of the amendments in the name of the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and his wording is more in keeping with what I am attempting to achieve than my own amateurish attempt. I am thus minded to support the right hon. Gentleman's amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 84 and 85, which deal with the process of consultation. Under the clause, the Secretary of State should consult.

<P>
I have been told, as I suspect has anyone in the Committee who has made it his business to move[Mr. Forth]
among those who operate in this world, that there is a risk that any Secretary of State will always talk to the same people and that those people are not necessarily representative.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It does not take very long for anyone to realise that there are many voices, not only in the private hire vehicle business, but in the taxicab business. I am sure that the hon. Member for Eltham fully recognises that. He knows that world better than any of us ever will. I hope that he will corroborate what I am saying: there are many voices and they see things differently. I am trying to ensure with amendments nos. 84 and 85 that, as far as is possible in the Bill in circumstances such as this, all those voices are listened to before conclusions are reached by the Minister, the Secretary of State, the PCO or whoever it may be. It is as simple as that. I do not want to labour the point as it is perfectly self-explanatory.
<P>
I should like to spend a few minutes on new clause 2. The fascinating thing about this debate the hon. Member for Eltham ably described the background to it is that everyone can share the same purpose or objectives but will reach almost exactly the opposite conclusions in arguing towards them. My conclusion, which I regret is at odds with that of the hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend, is that having some sort of proper display on private hire vehicles would be an aid to safety, not a deterrent.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eltham rested his case, as always when the point is being argued, on the fact that if a vehicle is clearly identified as a private hire vehicle with the operator's telephone number clearly visible and a clear message saying that the vehicle can be hired only by telephone or whatever, it would encourage people illegally to hire that vehicle and thus break the law. I see the whole business from the other end. That may be a risk worth taking, although surely it would be more obvious to the public and to inspectors that the illegal hiring was taking place if the vehicle was lit up like a Christmas tree.
<P>
Much more importantly, by way of reassurance to vulnerable people who might be hiring private hire vehicles, it must be much better and safer to have a vehicle clearly identified as coming form the source from which it was hired. If a vehicle is completely unmarked and unidentified, it poses a risk for the vulnerable customer who sees any old vehicle drawing up and may get into it wrongly assuming it to be the one that he or she had quite legally booked.
<P>
The argument about clear identification of private hire vehicles should come down much more on the side of safety and transparency for the customer making the booking. That outweighs the worries that the hon. Gentleman so adequately described of encouraging illegal hire. I would turn even that argument on its head and say that if a vehicle lit up like a Christmas tree and clearly identified as a private hire vehicle were to undertake illegal fares and touting

<P>

<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. If I were drafting the Bill I would rip up all the existing legislation. We would have a one-tier system throughout the country. That would be my ultimate solution to these problems. We are trying here to maintain a distinction between the licensed taxi industry and the private hire industry. It has already been stated several times that only the licensed taxi industry will be able to ply for hire on the street and to stop when hailed. It is unfortunate that if we allow vehicles to be illuminated like Christmas trees, there is confusion in the minds of the public who are encouraged to approach such vehicles. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is shaking his head, but current custom and practice in south-east London an area that I know well is that minicab drivers encourage such confusion by putting large aerials in a conspicuous position on their vehicles. They park in places such as pubs and nightclubs and they are approached by people who are leaving those places late at night. That goes on all the time. There is a law against that, but there are breaches of the regulations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am all in favour of facilitating debate and of allowing reasonable intervention, but this is turning into a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I agre with much of what the hon. Member for Eltham says, but surely, in relation to his last point, the powerful and effective new enforcement procedures will stop the practices that he described. He and I would be outraged if they were to continue in our part of London. Surely, the PCO inspectorate will be hot on the trail of anyone in our part of London touting for business illegally in a brightly lit and marked vehicle. The hon. Member for Eltham can put that worry out of his mind because the Bill and all that goes with it will guarantee that those practices will not continue.
<P>
The point made by the hon. Member for Eltham involves a balance of judgment about whether it is more or less likely that the driver of a clearly marked vehicle will do something illegal and pose a threat to the innocent customer than will the driver of a vehicle that is almost unmarked. My judgment is that even if all the markings were removed, an unacceptable element of risk would remain.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eltham pointed out that the public might be confused. There is some substance in that point. In a moment, we shall discuss another amendment that would ensure that private hire vehicles cannot be described as taxis or cabs I assume that they can still be called minicabs. However, if they cannot be called taxis or cabs and are clearly described as minicabs, that would reduce the element of confusion and would go some way to meet the point made by the hon. Member.
<P>
There is only a certain degree to which we can assume that the public are incapable of making distinctions about cabs and private hire vehicles. However, the more clearly that we can mark a vehicle that is being offered as a private hire vehicle, the less likely the danger to the customer making a booking. Such a vehicle would be less likely to tout for business because it would be clearly marked. If such provisions were combined with the powerful new enforcement procedures, the balance would be tipped in their favour. For those reasons I recommend new clause 2.
<P>
The Committee should reject those amendments that seek to eliminate and prohibit the clear marking of private hire vehicles.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> Once again, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has outlined the arguments on both sides of the case. I, however, come down on the opposite side.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend recognised, there is a danger that if minicabs are too readily identifiable, people will mistake them for taxis and will try to flag them down. On the other hand, I agree with him that some form of identification for minicabs is desirable so that the public know that they are getting into the vehicle that they ordered. That is why the Bill provides for the driver to have a badge and for the minicab to carry plates.
<P>
However, I wonder whether my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was right about safety. By definition, a minicab would be pre-booked and the passenger would be expecting a vehicle. that person would not get into any vehicle. The vehicle would have been ordered and when it arrived the person could be satisfied that the driver was licensed with a badge and that the vehicle was licensed. Such provisions do not exist at present. That is an adequate safeguard for the public.
<P>
There is a risk to use the expression of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that vehicles that are illuminated like Christmas trees will be mistaken for taxis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. I understand that clause No. 15 requires licensed vehicles to carry licence plates, presumably at the front and at the rear. I do not wish to be unnecessarily pedantic. However, if such a vehicle were to draw up outside my house, I would be unlikely to walk around the vehicle and examine the front and rear plates. At that point, there will be no obvious marking to be seen on the car.
<P>
When I get into that car, it may be argued that I have made the commitment. More cautious citizens may choose to examine badges that will be a matter for them. However, some people, who may be intoxicated or in a state or euphoria, may not take that step. Therefore, I am not sure that I am reassured by my right hon. Friend's words.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> My right hon. Friend has omitted the context in which he would get into a vehicle. That context is that he has ordered that vehicle. A totally random vehicle has not presented itself and invited him to enter. He has requested a vehicle to pick him up at a specific time and at a specific place.
<P>
We will consult on where the plate is to be located. The provision that the driver will wear around his neck a badge that will probably bear his photograph, along with the fact that a vehicle has been ordered and is expected, avoids the risks that worry my right hon. Friend.
<P>
I turn to the amendments tabled by hon. Member for Eltham. Clauses 30 and 31 make provisions for signs and notices on vehicles and for advertisements about hiring. Both clauses address the question of misleading advertisement and the distinction between taxis and minicabs. As we have heard, in some ways those are contentious matters. Since Second Reading I have sought to listen and to respond to representations that have been made to me on those important matters.
<P>
Clause 30 concerns the prohibition of certain signs and notices on vehicles. Amendment No. 59, which relates to subsection (1), makes it clear that the clause applies only in London. Amendment No. 60 deletes the word "order" and substitutes "regulations". Amendment No. 61 removes subsection (3) I have been advised that that subsection is legally unnecessary.
<P>
I turn to matters raised by the hon. Member for Eltham. Amendment No. 16 seeks to alter "may" to "shall" not the first time has the hon. Gentleman tabled an amendment with such wording so that the Secretary of State will be positively required to make regulations. The Minister may try to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, so that she can speak about the Secretary of State's intentions. However, I personally hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment, as it seems desirable to have flexibility to make the Bill workable over a long period. The Secretary of State has significant powers to attach conditions to licences. "May" is the word that is usually used for regulation-making powers.
<P>
In amendment No. 20 the hon. Gentleman suggests adding the word "illumination" to subsection (1). I believe that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sign, notice or other feature"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the Bill are wide-ranging, and that "illumination" may not be entirely clear.
<P>
In amendment No. 21 the hon. Gentleman proposes to make quite a large alteration to subsection (1). He wishes to rule out certain words or suggestions that may lead to confusion with taxis. Again, I have no argument with the broad intent of that amendment and we value the Minister's comments on that matter. However, I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we must beware of including inflexible regulations in the Bill. It is better to leave the job to the regulations, on which, as other amendments suggest, there can be proper consultation. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
In amendment No. 17 the hon. Gentleman suggests adding a new subsection (3A) to clause 30. I understand his point about transition, but I feel that that is best left to whoever drafts the regulations. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has also proposed changes on the broad theme of notices in new clause 2 and in amendment No. 83. I understand his point and again the Minister may wish to comment. The Bill has wide powers and I believe that it is better to leave the Secretary of State to consult, so that all can have their say, than to pre-empt such consultations in the Bill.
<P>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who tabled amendments Nos. 84 and 85, I have discovered in the past few months that the London taxi trade is a diamond with several facets, and that not everyone agrees with one another. The same may be true of the minicab trade. Technically, the amendments pose difficulties for example in the phrase "all elements of". I hope that my right hon.[Sir George Young]
Friend will not press the amendments. Clause 30 states that the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall consult such bodies appearing to him to represent the London cab trade and the private hire vehicle trade in London as he considers appropriate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether the phrase "all elements of" would really add much to that.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My own amendments, Nos. 62 and 63, relate to clause 31, which is about advertisements not necessarily on vehicles. The taxi trade has expressed concerns about this matter. I have seen some of the reasons for that in strangely spelt billboards and other advertisements which could misleading suggest that taxis were being offered, when they were not. I do not believe that the vast majority of respectable minicab operators have any interest in misleading the public, so I have proposed a widening of the original provision, to rule out not only the use of the word "taxi" or "cab" but words that look like them and could thus mislead. I hope that the Committee will agree that that is an improvement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will my right hon. Friend clarify whether the word "minicab" will still be allowable under the terms that he has set out? If not, what words would be acceptable within the terms of the Bill, to enable private hire vehicle operators legitimately and properly to advertise their service?
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> If my right hon. Friend looks at clause 31(2) he will see that an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"advertisement which includes the words `minicab', `mini-cab' or `mini cab'."<P>
</UL></FONT>

I know they all sound the same, but he will see that they are spelt differently

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"does not by reason only of that fact contravene this section."<P>

<P>
So the answer is yes, those words could be used. The words that could not be used are those described in the amendment not just "taxi", but the word spelt wrongly, or "texi", which sometimes occurs. Those would be caught, and it would be wrong for them to be used.
<P>
I hope that my right hon. Friend is satisfied by that explanation and that the Committee will reject the amendments not in my name, and accept those that I have tabled.

None the less, we got there and I am grateful to them, too.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> May I add my thanks to you, Mr. Gale, and your officials for their help with the Committee this afternoon. It would be remiss if on behalf of the Committee I did not offer my thanks on their behalf and on behalf of everyone who lives in London to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire in selecting this Bill, for staying with it despite the many cul-de-sacs and total dead ends into which its passage has taken us.
