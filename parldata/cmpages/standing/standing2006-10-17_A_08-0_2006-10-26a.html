<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000309"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Welcome back, Mr. Amess. I am
delighted to see that you have returned after our break that seemed to
last twice as long as our sitting, which is an unusual way in which to
run things. Nevertheless, I am delighted to see you
here.</div><a name="06102671000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was in the
middle of what I hope will be a short contribution because, as I was
saying, many of the questions were about the details of the
regulations, but there will be opportunities to shape them when they
come out of draft and are taken through the formal process before being
agreed by Parliament. Where I can, I shall respond to specifics without
going into the detail of every draft
regulation.</div><a name="06102671000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
return to the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry
(Mr.
Boswell).</div><a name="06102671000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the debate on why a substantial number of people do not participate
in the first work-focused interview, I said that I could not imagine
him in a saloon bar. I think that that was the gist of the point that
he made before the break.</div>
<a name="06102671000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000310"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con):
Exactly.</div><a name="06102671000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000311"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have not sought to question or second-guess the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s statistic of 23 per cent. so the Committee will
of course take it at face value, and on the basis of that figure, I
accept his point
entirely.</div><a name="06102671000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000312"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, the piece of paper
from which I was reading has the imprimatur of Jobcentre Plus on it, so
I think that the Minister had better agree with
it.</div><a name="06102671000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): It must be true,
then.</div><a name="06102671000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000314"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> It must be true, but the fact that the hon. Member
for Daventry said it gives it additional credibility in
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 256</div><a name="06102671000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">A variety of scenarios&#151;we
cannot rehearse them all now&#151;could lead to the deferral of a
work-focused interview. For instance, someone might be close to the
labour market already, or be recovering from an ailment or injury, such
as a broken leg or an accident at work, or be taking up work. Those are
the types of circumstances that could reasonably lead to a deferral.
</div><a name="06102671000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Daventry asked reasonably about the timing of future work-focused
interviews. Our intention is that the first work-focused interview
should continue to take place in week eight of the 13-week assessment
phase and provide advice about the labour market and the gateway to any
benefits that an individual is entitled to, either out of work or as
they get close to and eventually into the labour market. That would be
an opportunity to offer wider benefit advice in a way that nearly
always happens really effectively in pathways at the
moment&#151;although, as is always the case, we can do more there as
well.</div><a name="06102671000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) asked
about sanctions&#151;I think that I responded to the question about
what taking part means.</div>
<a name="06102671000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the concern of the hon.
Member for BurySt. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) about not
complicating the system with too many intricacies and thus creating
what he noticed in other clauses&#151;complexity and
confusion&#151;and which we discussed how to avoid. We tested
analysis and thinking and concluded that the50 per cent.
reduction over that four-week period will be about the right level of
sanction necessary to encourage people to participate again in the
conditionality. If the conditionality is not adhered to there is of
course the second element of benefit reduction. As the hon. Gentleman
knows, the total reduction can be only for the total amount of
work-related activity. As the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs.
McGuire), said, we would never impose sanctions during the 13-week
assessment phase because that would take it below the current
jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;we would not seek sanctions beyond
that level.</div><a name="06102671000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
testing every scenario, which we will do in discussions on regulations,
reinstatement would take place if the person were to comply with the
conditionality&#151;in other words, attended work-focused
interviews&#151;or if on appeal they showed good cause and that the
sanction was inappropriate. Of course, we have set out what would be
interpreted as good
cause.</div><a name="06102671000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to lengthen the debate, but I remind the Committee of parts of the
draft regulations that have been provided on clause 11,
&#147;Work-focused interviews&#148;. Page 26 does not contain an
exhaustive list of examples of good cause, but the sanctions and
safeguards provided for are on page 6. Issues about deferrals are on
page 7.</div><a name="06102671000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am inclined
to wait for the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds to return to his
place, because I want him to know that I could not agree with him more.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Here he is.&#148;] As I
was saying, Mr. Amess, the hon. Gentleman made a proposal on
literature. I agree entirely, which is why we put in train some time
ago exactly what he has suggested. I will shortly receive a response
from officials in the Department for Work and Pensions on how the forms
can be simplified, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 257</div>the hon. Gentleman is right that we should share it
with lobby groups and organisations. The Under-Secretary has offered to
do likewise with carers&#146; organisations to find out whether they
believe it to be sensitive enough. As I said earlier in our
proceedings, we must also share it face to face with people with mental
health illnesses. That is why I have brought together a group of people
to do so. I reiterate that the intention is not to make that a matter
of media focus; it will be a private conversation with people whom we
have already met without any such focus. That is the way in which it
should continue. We will listen to their experiences and test the
redesigned forms with them. The lobbying and carers&#146;
organisations have a crucial part to play, but we also want to
road-test the forms with those who will fill them
in.</div><a name="06102671000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I offer the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds the caveat, which I know he will accept,
that of course the forms must contain a certain amount of legalese.
They will be stipulated by regulations and must thereforeset
out the legal rights and responsibilities. Notwithstanding that, there
is unanimity that we can find a better way to simplify communication.
There is a difficult balancing act to be performed, but it is important
that we convey as sensitively as possible the responsibilities and
sanctions that there will be if the activity requirement is not adhered
to. We therefore have absolute unanimity on the point made by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06102671000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
12</h4><a name="06102671000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Work-related
activity</div><a name="06102671000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000315"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I beg to move amendment No. 194, in
page 10, line 41, after
&#145;regulations&#146;,
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">&#145;(aa) prescribing
circumstances in which such a person is not subject to a requirement to
undertake work-related activity in accordance with
regulations;&#146;.</div><a name="06102671000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
this amendment I seek to probe the Government&#146;s intentions on
directions to carry out work-related activity. It would provide that
regulations could be made to prescribe circumstances in which such a
person as described in the clause is not subject to a requirement to
undertake such activity. The intention is to elicit more detail from
the Minister on the Government&#146;s thinking about the
circumstances in which members of the work-related activity group, if
one could call them that, rather than of the support group, might not
be required to undertake such activity. An individual could be affected
by a range of circumstances to do with their impairment, disability or
health condition. That concern might particularly apply to those with
fluctuating conditions. It might well be possible for such people to
engage in work-related activity when their condition is less severe,
but as it fluctuates there may be periods when that is not possible.
Unless exceptions are described so that the conditionality on
work-related activity would not apply, someone in such circumstances
could be caught out by the conditionality regime. I am keen to hear
more from the Minister about how those issues would apply to such
cases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 258</div><a name="06102671000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth saying that the
clause and the Bill seek to make obligatory taking part in work-related
activity, as well as attending a work-related interview or a
work-focused health-related assessment&#151;matters of responsibility
subject to reductions in benefit if not complied with. When we come to
later amendments, we will have a wider debate on what work-related
activity is and is not; that is not the subject of this amendment.
</div><a name="06102671000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Owing to their
disability, impairment or health condition, there may well be people
for whom support or adjustments may be needed, to enable them to
undertake the work-related activity required of them. If such support
or adjustments cannot be provided for whatever reason, it may be
inappropriate to require that person to carry out work-related
activity. I hope that the Minister will agree and that the Government
do not intend to sanction someone&#146;s benefit in such cases. I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06102671000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000316"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I shall speak briefly, Mr. Amess. If I
may say so, this probing amendment is well conceived. We need to know
something about this issue. The Government are undertaking a fairly
major step, although in pathways pilots they have done a little to
require work-related activity over and above the relatively easily
described and scoped work-related interview. A whole variety of
circumstances in which that might not be possible might
apply.</div> <a name="06102671000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that
unless we assume a grave deficiency in the local or national labour
market&#151;we shall not go into that wider issue this
afternoon&#151;it would normally be self-evident that somebody with
limited capacity for work who is not in work although there is work to
be had would need to move towards some work-related activity. That is
not objectionable in principle.</div>
<a name="06102671000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our debate on the last
clause, the Minister flagged up the fact that we are trying to
emphasise that there is an approach of mutuality and partnership so
that officialdom works with the claimant to try to get them through.
All the surveys of disabled people show that that is what many of them
would like to do if they had the support. We need to scope what they
can do and what will get them closer to working. At this stage, at any
rate, nobody wishes to prescribe that there should be a penalty for not
working. I certainly do not, but there is clearly a need to prepare for
work.</div><a name="06102671000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory
notes, which we sometimes criticise, are quite helpful on this issue.
They discuss work tasters, programmes to manage health and work, job
search assistance and programmes to assist in stabilising a
person&#146;s life. The latter programme may be a little less clear
than the others but it is fairly clear, even from those short words,
roughly what the Minister is driving at. No doubt he will wish to
respond to the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, all I need say in support of the amendment is that we
clearly need to know more about what is intended and to have in mind at
all times the possible constraints on the ability to carry that
out&#151;in particular when those constraints are not in the
claimant&#146;s control. Take work tasters, which are analogous to
people going on work experience from their school or college. There may
be health and safety
considerations.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 259</div><a name="06102671000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arguably, those considerations
could be more intense if a person has been out of the labour market
because of some illness or disability and then wishes to go and try
something out, rather than take part in a settled arrangement in which
they are in a contract of employment, having succeeded in getting work.
Clearly, it is important that the matter of constraints is addressed,
and that there is such a reasonable opportunity.</div>
<a name="06102671000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may wish to say
something about the fact that, theoretically, it may be necessary to
provide access to work arrangements in order for a work-related
activity to take place, let alone the work
itself.</div>
<a name="06102671000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06102671000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has reinforced my inquiry
on that matter. The whole import of the clause is that people will not
have an easy transition from being limited in capacity to work and out
of work to getting into work. We all want to bridge that gap, but we
must do so in a reasonable way. Above all, we do not have to attach
blame to the individual who, for reasons that may be beyond their
control, is unable to make the transition. If there is a constraint, it
needs to be met by a waiver or appropriate action. Therefore, we ask
the Minister to explain what he has in mind and urge him not to be too
literal-minded. We want some indication of how such a delicate gap is
to be bridged, particularly at the point where there is an implied
threat of sanctions, which is an
innovation.</div><a name="06102671000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000317"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall try to make my response relatively brief,
on the basis that, in spirit, this is a probing amendment.</div>
<a name="06102671000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">On numerous occasions we have
talked about the entitlement to a support group being on the basis of a
revised personal capability assessment of 15 points, matching one of 46
descriptors. I shall go on to some of the specifics.</div>
<a name="06102671000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is another example of a
speech excellently drafted by others, which my noble Friend Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath will have an opportunity to rehearse for the first time
when a Lords Committee considers the Bill. That may be the best thing
to do with some of our prepared speeches, to enable me to respond to
the specific points that have been raised.</div>
<a name="06102671000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">On sanctions and how we will
roll out work-focused interviews, I am trying to take some of the
lessons from work-focused interviews and the relationship between the
personal adviser and the customer, and the relationship between
personal adviser, customer and sanctions regime. Many hon. Members will
be aware that pilot schemes are under way in seven parts of the UK,
exploring the relationship between conditionality and the sanctions
regime among existing incapacity benefit customers. We will learn of
the best experiences from that process before bringing that knowledge
forward into the draft regulations and guidance on how we implement
work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06102671000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to stray on to
discussions that we have had on other amendments, so I shall try to
keep my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 260</div>comments narrow. The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the
explanatory notes. The draft regulations state, very
specifically:</div>
<a name="06102671000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Claimants cannot be
forced to undertake a particular
activity.&#148;</div><a name="06102671000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that we will not take the power to force a customer to undertake a
specific action. However, the customer should undertake activity that
takes them closer to the labour market over an agreed period, between
work-focused interviews. Without going back to the debate over clause
11(2) to (6), in normal circumstances interviews would be expected to
take place in a cycle of once in every four weeks. Inside that cycle, a
customer would be expected to undertake some work-related activity that
takes them closer to the labour market in that
period.</div>
<a name="06102671000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000318"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful that the Minister is helping to
advance our knowledge of this matter. Can he confirm that the
work-related activity to which he referred, even if it is not specified
that &#147;thou shalt do x or y&#148;, would nevertheless have to
be agreed as part of the action plan? There would have to be an
understanding by Jobcentre Plus or the contractor that an activity was
regarded as appropriate. We will come to that when we debate a later
clause. However, it is not an unconditional licence to do something
just because the claimant would like to do
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000319"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We will discuss action plans when we consider the
next clause, so I shall not go into great detail. I think that there is
some confusion about the nature of the plans, which is entirely
understandable. When we come to the next clause, some clarification can
be provided on the interaction between work-focused interviews,
sanctions, work-related activity, work-focused health-related
assessment and action plans. I can reassure Opposition Members, as well
as my hon. Friends, about the relationships between those
elements.</div> <a name="06102671000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members have said, the explanatory notes provide a list of activities
that would be considered work-related. It is not an exhaustive list.
The following broad headings are given in the paperwork: work tasters;
managing health and work; improving employability; job search
assistance&#151;not compelling a job search, but providing
assistance&#151;and, importantly, stabilising life. Under those
headings there are additional, specific examples of work-related
activity. As a general understanding, the tone of the draft regulations
is that a work-related activity would take the customer closer to the
labour market. That would be the saloon bar
description.</div><a name="06102671000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
reassure the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
about the specifics of protections. I accept that his is a probing
amendment. Perhaps, Mr. Amess, you will allow me to give a
general reassurance on this occasion, so that when we move to other
clauses, hon. Members will accept that it has been given.</div>
<a name="06102671000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to protecting customers,
clause 11 identifies sanctions or safeguards that also feature on page
6 of the draft regulations. Broadly speaking, such
safeguards would apply in relation to what we have
described as &#147;good cause&#148;, including work-focused 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 261</div>interviews and so on. Such matters are dealt with in the draft
regulations and clause 12. I hope that that reassures Opposition
Members. In addition, there will be a right of appeal, as with all
financial sanctions.</div>
<a name="06102671000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that broad reassurance on
a number of matters relating to a variety of amendments to the clause,
I hope that I have encouraged the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw his probing amendment. I also hope
that other Opposition Members who have tabled amendments will be
reassured by my comments as we discuss future
amendments.</div><a name="06102671000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000320"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am, broadly speaking, reassured, although I
reserve the right to raise similar issues in relation to future
clauses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000321"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 203, in
clause 12, page 11, line 18, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(j) for
notifying a person not subject to a requirement to undertake
work-related activity of opportunities to participate in work-related
activity on a voluntary
basis.&#146;.</div><a name="06102671000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to elicit a bit more information from the
Minister. I would like to probe the Government&#146;s thinking in
relation to the provision of information about work-related activity to
people who are not required under clause 12 to undertake such activity.
This is a similar point to that which was made during previous sittings
about the support group, although I suggest that this amendment is free
of some of the more contentious items that caused the debate in the
previous sitting.</div> <a name="06102671000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks merely to provide a power to make regulations to ensure
that people who are not required to undertake work-related activity,
which in this case means members of the support group, are none the
less provided with information about what is available. I should like
to hear a bit more in the Minister&#146;s response about what
proposals the Government have in mind to ensure that that happens. It
may apply not only to work-related activity but to work-focused
interviews and work-focused health-related assessments, and the
assistance that is generally available under the pathways to work
scheme, for example. How, if at all, do the Government intend to ensure
that people who are not required to take part in such activities are no
less informed about the opportunities that may be available to them? I
assume that there is an answer to that question. To take on board the
point that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) made in
our previous sitting, it should be done in a non-threatening way that
does not seek to create any feelings of obligation, but
that&#151;importantly&#151;provides information to people so that
they are aware of the opportunities and of the range of entitlements
available through pathways to work, which could help them get closer to
the labour market if they so wished.</div>
<a name="06102671000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not dwell on what is a
straightforward amendment. The point that I am making is clear. I hope
that the Minister can reassure me that the Government have clear plans
and proposals to ensure the undertaking of such a
function.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div><a name="06102671000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000322"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> It is proper that we raise these issues and that
the Minister should respond to them. I think that he will now be aware
of the interest&#151;on the Opposition Benches and all
Benches&#151;in the opportunities for members of the support group,
as much as for those who are on the employment and support allowance
and who are under obligations. I realise that, in a sense, anyone who
is involved in the support group in any work-related activity that they
do is ipso facto a member of the voluntary sector. That sector has not
so far featured as much as it might have done in our discussions. It
may well provide a useful route into work. Referring to our earlier
debate, what we discussed could be seen as an example of work-related
activity. That would apply equally to those who are subject to an
obligation and those who are not.</div>
<a name="06102671000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all understand that people
do not go automatically in one stage from a situation of restriction
and limited capacity all the way through to work, but the transition
should be made as easy as possible for everyone, and in particular for
the various classes available in the ESA. There is an interesting
logical point on which I shall briefly dwell. If people are subject to
a legal obligation to engage in activities, can they be said in that
sense to be in the voluntary sector at all, even if they are working in
the voluntary sector as part of the work taster? That is perhaps for
the philosophers and not for the Committee today,
however.</div><a name="06102671000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
things to be as inclusive and practical as possible. It would be unwise
for me to expand further on the necessary support, but above all we
want Ministers to remember the point and respond to
it.</div><a name="06102671000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000323"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I hope that I can reassure hon. Members about the
Government&#146;s intentions, and encourage the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw his amendment. I
shall start with an admission. I may inadvertently have misled the
Committee in relation to what would be work-related activity in draft
regulations. As you are aware, Mr. Amess, that was contained
in the Green Paper, and I was surprised that you did not invite me to
be called to order, as you have on at least one previous occasion. I am
surprised that others did not intervene, but I hope that I have
clarified the position.</div>
<a name="06102671000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that admission of error, I
shall try to proceed on steadier footing in relation to the amendment.
The hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue, which was amplified
by the comments and reflections of the hon. Member for Daventry. On a
voluntary basis, and where appropriate&#151;we have discussed
previously the appropriateness of the state allowing
matters&#151;someone in the support group should have access to
work-focused interviews and the support available to other customers.
That approach is exemplified by pathways, in which many in the exempt
category volunteer for the available support. That will therefore be
retained.</div><a name="06102671000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div> <a name="06102671000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Daventry is absolutely right about voluntary work being the
appropriate route for some or many ESA customers wanting to get closer
to the labour market, and therefore it will be deemed to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 263</div>work-related activity. I, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and many
others know from constituency experience that a great number of
voluntary organisations provide a fantastic level of support to people
coming off inactive benefits in order to get them closer to the labour
market. The experience in pathways in many cases has been that
voluntary organisations have taken inspirational steps to involve those
who have been out of the labour market for a very long time. We expect
that to continue and will discuss with voluntary sector organisations,
charities and many others details such as the capacity in the voluntary
sector to support a substantial number of new
volunteers.</div><a name="06102671000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific requirement to provide information, the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey will be relieved to have it
confirmed that the questionnaire accompanying invitations to tender for
provider-led pathways to work provision asked providers to detail how
they would ensure consistent delivery to mandatory and voluntary
customers. Their bids will be assessed on their replies to that and
other questions. I hope that that reassures him. It is a key part of
the invitation to tender and unless providers are able to provide that
analysis, they would not be able to offer the kind of contracts that we
are looking for.</div><a name="06102671000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not think that it would be appropriate to put information provision in
the
Bill.</div><a name="06102671000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000324"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do not know whether Minister intends to cover
this point, but he has provided some reassurance on the contracts in
the provider-led areas. However, my understanding is that they will
cover60 per cent. of the country only, so 40 per cent. will be
Jobcentre Plus-led pathways to work areas. How does he intend to ensure
that a requirement similar to that stipulated in the contract of
provider-led areas is carried out equally well in the Jobcentre
Plus-led
areas?</div><a name="06102671000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000325"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point. That
requirement operates already in the Jobcentre Plus-led pathways, which
cover 40 per cent. of the country. As I said earlier, many of those in
the exempt categories under the current and outdated personal
capability assessment process nevertheless say, &#147;I wish to
volunteer.&#148; I am sure that that can be improved further as part
of the continuing improvement in communication, which we talked about
earlier, but I am certain that that communication exists and, with the
existing pathways process, is one of the avenues by which current
exempt customers on IB can volunteer. I am not saying, on behalf of the
Government, that we cannot make further improvements and we shall
continue to seek ways in which to do so. With that, I encourage and
implore the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000326"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Duly implored, I add only, before responding to
the Minister&#146;s imploring, that he might find that Members of
Parliament, in dealing with constituents on such matters, are
interested in being engaged in the process of ensuring improved and
direct communication. With that comment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000328"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000329"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The amendments do not make the same point, but
complement each other and help to probe the Government&#146;s views
on the regulations that will enact these rather sensitive provisions.
AmendmentNo. 238 is perhaps the most straightforward because
it suggests simply that the regulations should
prescribe</div><a name="06102671000080"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the support
which is to be provided to a person in order to help him to undertake
work-related
activity&#148;.</div><a name="06102671000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious that this point might be turning into a King Charles&#146;s
head. Every time I get up to speak, I say that there will need to be
support. If I flag in my task, I suspect my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) or, indeed, the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey would get up to make my point
for me. We need to keep saying again and again: it is not reasonable
for people to go without support from one state to another. They need
the appropriate support to get there.</div>
<a name="06102671000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment says no more than
that, but perhaps the Minister could reflect on one or two things.
First, when I revisited the wording of the amendment, an analogy came
to my mind which has not been shared with the Committee before. This is
not dissimilar from what is required in an educational statement. A
statement of special educational needs does not simply diagnose a
child&#146;s condition; it lists the support that the public
authority will need to provide. I throw that in because it is the kind
of thing that is in our minds. If there has been a work-focused
interview, it might be sensible for such a provision to be embodied in
the minutes and an undertaking
given.</div><a name="06102671000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond that, I
have two points to put to the Minister. The first relates to education.
Many of the people who have problems returning to work may be either
educationally disadvantaged or educationally demoralised. They may
need, in parallel with the pathways programme, to have access to
educational programmes to support them and make them employable. I am
not clear whether that comes under this rubric and whether that would
be regarded as work-related activity. It is educational and the
Minister hardly needs me to remind him that there is an important
distinction running through a lot of social security law between
participating in educational activity and a benefit-qualifying
activity. We perhaps should be clearer what the relationship is and who
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div>&#147;prescribe&#148; the necessary education and/or see that is
carried out to an acceptable
level.</div><a name="06102671000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point
relates to health specification. Again, all members of the Committee
will know that many people within the allowance will have personal
health problems, including those of a less glamorous nature such as
addiction to drugs or alcohol. They will need to get themselves sorted
out before they can be easily and safely employable. While I am aware
from having seen the pathways project in Derbyshire that there is a
very constructive working relationship with the primary care trust
there, I am not certain exactly what the nature of the interface with
the customer is and whether health-related interventions would be on
the ticket or would be dealt with separately, bearing in mind that
there is an issue of propriety about this.</div>
<a name="06102671000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is one thing to say to an
individual, &#147;You have an alcoholism problem and in your own
interests it should be sorted out.&#148; It is another to say,
&#147;Your alcoholism problem is preventing you from being ready to
go to work and to come off benefit and we are going to remediate
that.&#148; I am rehearsing some potential ethical problems and the
different solutions that might be required. The person&#146;s GP may
be able to sort it out. Clearly it needs to be sorted out but we have
to be clear whether it is an intervention under the health service or
under the ESA and work-focused activity programme. There are delicacies
about this that could give rise to difficulties. I should like the
Minister to touch on those matters when he responds to amendment No.
238.</div><a name="06102671000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
239 to 241 are about the nature of the sanctions regime. Generally
speaking the Committee has not set up any Aunt Sallies, which sometimes
happens. We are too grown up and frankly the subject is too serious.
However, in my view, there is not a huge population of people desperate
to avoid work at any cost&#151;I notice that the hon. Member for
Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) is nodding with some enthusiasm. All the
evidence is that most people with a disability or other condition
limiting their ability to work would like to go back to work given the
opportunity and encouragement to do so. That is the Committee&#146;s
philosophy and is not in any way
contentious.</div><a name="06102671000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will remind us rightly, however, that we need an element of
sanction for the minority that will not play the game. Let us consider
the historical evidence from sanctions programmes. I have spoken at
little debates on sanctions and questioned, without wanting to sound
like a far-left caricature, whether they work or are necessary. In a
sense, it is rather like dealing with one&#146;s own children: if it
is necessary to take the sanctions, the sanctions have failed. It is
the threat of sanctions that underpins the process, not their
actuality.</div><a name="06102671000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments address the surprising fact that the Government might be
one-club golfers&#151;to borrow a phrase used to describe
somebody&#146;s economic policy, although we had best not go too far
down that road. They have only financial sanctions. They have the
ability to reduce benefits and it might be worth at least taking other
powers, although I am not saying that they should use those all the
time. We are offering Ministers a free gift here: they might consider a
wider range of sanctions&#151;more clubs in the golf bag.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div><a name="06102671000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might seek to
question me, but I do not have a ready-made list of sanctions.
Sometimes, Ministers come along with such lists: shall we take away
their driving licence, their passport or whatever? I am not canvassing
for that, but recording my surprise that he is going simply for the
financial sanction and is not at the moment prepared to look at a range
of potential ones that might be appropriate in particular cases, or
become appropriate at some
stage.</div><a name="06102671000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000330"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): Forgive me, I am slightly
confused. The hon. Gentleman seems to be making a case for other
sanctions, but he is very reluctant to give any examples of what they
might be.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000331"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman exposes the
dilemma to which I was trying to get the Minister to respond. All I am
saying is that if I were a Minister responsible for this
matter&#151;entering the realm of fantasy for a moment&#151;I would
prefer to have more than one possible recourse. I do not know what the
others might be, although as a matter of fact, I recorded a
couple&#151;withdrawal of driving licences or passports&#151;which
would be quite nasty for people, but I am by no means certain that they
would be the right ones to adopt. Certainly, I would not like the
Committee to think that I have advocated those. However, I find it
surprising that Ministers have apparently closed their minds to
alternative sanctions. It is one thing not to have them in a pilot
scheme, but another not to at least have the power to consider them if
something became possible or was worth trying out. Of course, they
would have to be proportionate and
reasonable.</div><a name="06102671000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000332"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for giving way because I think that he was about to expand
the point that I was going to put to him. For people with some
disabilities, the sense of isolation can be a very big problem. Would
it not be an extraordinary sanction to take away their driving licence
when that might be the very means by which they can have contact with
the outside world? Such a sanction might be disproportionately more
difficult for some than
others.</div><a name="06102671000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000333"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am bound to say that I agree with the hon.
Lady. In fact, I have not always been falling over myself to welcome
some of the more draconian measures that have been taken by, for
example, the Home Office in those regards. However, I find it
surprising that, at a time when some parts of the Government can be
quite authoritarian in imposing sanctions, they are not considering
them in this
case.</div><a name="06102671000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06102671000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a
factor to bear in mind, to which the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey referred this morning, which is that the use of
a financial sanction is not simply specific to the person, but affects
the family, because there may not be enough money to go round. I am
trying to be fair-minded, because I am genuinely rehearsing my own
doubts on the matter, but equally, the hon. Member for Colne Valley
says that even more malign consequences could arise from a particular
decision. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 267</div>Nobody is trying to suggest that the matter should be penal, but we are
trying at least to find the option available to a decision maker to
formulate a sanction that might be fit for purpose. One might be
compulsory attendance at something, specifically, after a failure. I do
not know. However, I would like the Minister to think about
that.</div><a name="06102671000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
there is the question of resources and amendment No. 241. That is back
to the world of access to work, if I can put it like that in shorthand.
It is about seeing what is required to encourage the claimant back into
work. That is there simply to hammer home the point that we have made
strongly, and will continue to make&#151;that the objective is to get
the claimant back into work. We shall not succeed unless sufficient
support is given appropriately, and that must be considered in the
regulations and any sanctions that are imposed as part of the regime.
Genuinely, I hope that I have not staked out a claim to take the hard
right on the matter by saying that we need more sanctions, or the far
left by saying that no sanctions are envisaged. I am not sure which
sanctions are best, but I do not think that Ministers should disable
themselves from a range of sanctions, so that they may be developed,
brought in and tailored to the individual&#146;s circumstances, in
the interests of encouraging that claimant back to work&#151;no more
and no less than
that.</div><a name="06102671000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000334"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman, in a thoughtful set of
remarks, has opened up a fruitful avenue for discussion. By probing the
question of sanctions a little further, not just the philosophy of them
but the research and the question of efficacy, he underpins the
sanctions-based approach. I shall be interested to hear more about that
from the Minister.</div> <a name="06102671000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a previous debate&#151;in this Committee Room, I think, in a
Statutory Instrument Committee&#151;I asked the Under-Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington
(Mr. Plaskitt), what evidence the Government have for the
idea that sanctions work, or that they fulfil the role that Ministers
believe that they fulfil. In that debate, he said that a substantial
body of research evidence showed that sanctions served the purpose that
Ministers believe that they serve: they encourage people to engage in
processes. In a subsequent exchange of correspondence with the
Minister, I asked him to list the library references of research papers
that the Department had commissioned, given that there is an
increasingly prevalent element of Government policy in the social
security field. I am afraid that not one academic reference came
back&#151;not one extensive piece of Department for Work and Pensions
research to back up that thinking. A couple of statistics were quoted,
but not much more than that. A fair response to the Minister would be
that the belief in the efficacy of sanctions is a matter of principle,
as opposed to a matter of evidence-based policy making, if I can use

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000335"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman will find that I am entirely
in sympathy with the argument that he is developing. I have found
Ministers, when I have asked parliamentary questions, for example,
extraordinarily coy on the matter of efficacy. At the moment, I cannot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>help feeling that the ministerial position may be more sensitive in the
event than in the statement. It could be summed up in the words of
Lear:</div> <a name="06102671000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I will

Alexander:</b> Who got into a frightful
mess.</div><a name="06102671000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the course
of the last 50 minutes we have roamed over philosophy and poetry. If I
may bring the conversation back down to earth, I understand the point
that the hon. Member for Daventry is making. There is a serious point
at the heart of that intervention. What body of evidence does the
Minister have for the idea that sanctions work? If there is no such
body of evidence, what is the underpinning principle of the policy that
is being developed in this Bill and others? I agree with the hon.
Member for Daventry that if sanctions have to be used in many cases it
means that the system has failed.</div>
<a name="06102671000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, will the
Minister answer a question that I posed in the earlier sitting? How
often does he think that the sanctioning power in this and other
clauses will be used? Another question, which echoes the point made by
the hon. Member for Daventry, is what research has he undertaken into
the impact of making use of these sanctioning powers, particularly on
child poverty which was of some interest to the Committee in earlier
discussions? What research has he undertaken into the use of sanctions
on
claimants?</div><a name="06102671000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000339"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would
also point out to the Minister that in the area of mental health,
sanctions or the threat of sanctions are incredibly important to the
outcome of that condition, even in the case of marginal
conditions.</div><a name="06102671000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000340"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am sure that the Minister will respond to
that.</div><a name="06102671000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
interested to hear the Minister develop his argument on the issue of
sanctions on the parents of dependent children. With those few remarks,
I echo and support what the hon. Member for Daventry said. I hope that
the Minister can continue to illuminate our discussion in the
philosophical and poetical manner in which it has been conducted thus
far.</div><a name="06102671000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000341"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): We have had a good
discussion on these amendments and I should like to speak briefly to
them. The first amendment concerns the support being offered. I should
like to go back to something that the Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling, said this morning. She made
an important point about the rights and responsibilities agenda and the
fact that the Bill talks about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>Government playing their part in helping people previously excluded from
the labour market to get closer to
it.</div><a name="06102671000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are nine
paragraphs in subsection (2), eight of which talk about requirements on
the claimant orthe customer. Only one is a requirement on the
Government and it is simply that the Government notify the claimant
what the requirements on himare. Nothing in the subsection
talks about the Government&#146;s responsibility to ensure that the
appropriate support is in place for the work-related activity to
happen.</div> <a name="06102671000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
stress, in the positive spirit of much of our discussions, that the
Government&#146;s intentions in this respect are wholly right. I have
no doubt that they intend to put in place the support for people, so it
seems curious that it is not written in the Bill that one of the
requirements of the work-related activity process should be that the
appropriate support is given. The Bill simply lists the requirements on
the claimants. We do not get that balance which the Under-Secretary
rightly pointed out is such an important philosophical underpinning of
the
Bill.</div><a name="06102671000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000342"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend also agree that there is
another party to this particular transaction of work-related activity,
namely the employers or the person who may be involved in delivering or
facilitating the activity? There is and must be consideration,
particularly where a sanctions regime is likely to be invoked, as to
whether any failure by the employer&#151;or third party, in
shorthand&#151;might itself have been the cause of the failure of the
claimant to meet the required standard or
expectation.</div><a name="06102671000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000343"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point
and in fact gives a flavour of some of the things that I was hoping to
say on the amendments under clause 13. He is absolutely right; the
employer&#146;s co-operation is essential. There is only person who
can ensure that that happens, and that is the personal adviser who is
supporting the claim of the customer in order to help them through the
process of work-related activity. It is extremely important, therefore,
that there is a responsibility for the Government to provide the
necessary support.</div>
<a name="06102671000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the organisations that I
have spoken to that place people in work&#151;such as Action for
Blind People and Remploy, both of which I visited recently&#151;talk
about the relationship between the personal adviser and the employer
being the critical factor in the success of the whole process. In
particular, the important element is the support that is given once the
person has been placed in employment. It is not something that stops as
soon as someone is given a job; it is an ongoing process.
</div><a name="06102671000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting this
amendment&#151;I note that so far the Government have not accepted a
single amendment we have proposed&#151;would be in tune with the
intentions that the Government
have&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div>
<a name="06102671000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000344"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> In the hon. Gentleman&#146;s examination of
how the relationship works, did he find any examples where the
relationship could be prescribed and did he find out whether that
prescription was actually helpful?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 270</div><a name="06102671000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000345"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am not sure what points the hon. Lady is trying to
make, but I am happy to give way if she wants to elaborate further.
This amendment is not saying that the actions should be prescribed; it
is saying that the support, which will be a vital part of the success
of this programme, should be agreed. The details of that support can
have tremendous
effects.</div><a name="06102671000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause 12
all the requirements on the claimant are written down clearly but,
apart from the responsibility to notify the claimant of their
obligations, there is no requirement on the Government. I do not
believe that this reflects the Government&#146;s intentions in the
Bill.</div> <a name="06102671000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not the
place for primary legislation to prescribe precisely what support is
given, but it can none the less prescribe that support should be given,
and that is the point that we are trying to make.</div>
<a name="06102671000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless the hon. Lady wishes to
intervene again, I shall move on to the question of sanctions. In my
short time as a Member of Parliament, listening to my hon. Friend the
Member for Daventry, this is the first time that I have heard a Member
of Parliament stand up and say that they do not know the answer to the
problem but that there is a problem. It is to his credit that he spoke
in the way that he did because he draws attention to one of the issues
surrounding the sanctioning regime. It is an issue that every member of
the Committee is aware of, because I imagine that we have spoken to
people involved in the pilots and have found that sanctions are very
rarely used because, in practice, what personal advisers find most
effective is carrots rather than sticks. Sticks are very much a last
resort. I respect the Government&#146;s view that they need to be
there as a last resort, but the concern that I have&#151;I share my
hon. Friend&#146;s concerns in this respect&#151;is that sometimes
some form of sanctioning might be appropriate when the claimant is not
co-operating to a reasonable degree with the work-related activity
process.</div> <a name="06102671000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes a
financial sanction might not be the right way of encouraging
participation. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey pointed out that child poverty is a key issue here. We know
that a third of working-age disabled people have children and we know
that one in four of people who are growing up in poverty have a
disabled parent. We know that there is a strong link between the two.
In that situation, it might not be appropriate to exercise a financial
sanction even if someone was being deliberately unco-operative, because
not only the claimant would lose out, but possibly their children as
well. No one in the Committee would support such an outcome. However,
in that situation other sanctions could or should be
exercised.</div> <a name="06102671000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are designed to give the Government flexibility so that in
regulations they could provide for alternatives, although the last
thing that we want to do is impose inappropriate alternatives. For
example, we have just discussed driving licences. I agree completely
that in a lot of situations the withdrawal of a licence would be
inappropriate, but there might be other situations in which the
withdrawal of benefits would not be appropriate but the driving licence
sanction would.</div> <a name="06102671000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I do not know the answer, but
it would be good if the Bill had the flexibility to allow the
Government to develop 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div>their thinking. Amendment No. 239 tries simply to exchange
&#147;is&#148; for &#147;may be&#148; so that the Government
are not obliged in such a situation to reduce benefit payments, but may
do so if they chose. It is not a particularly strong amendment; it is
designed to give the Government more flexibility to produce desirable
outcomes.</div><a name="06102671000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000346"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Characteristically, we have heard some thoughtful
contributions, and hopefully I can continue that in the tone and
content of my comments.</div>
<a name="06102671000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-West
Surrey mentioned in passing that the Government have not seen fit to
accept any of the amendments. Any fair adjudication of proceedings thus
far would find that in every instance bar two or three, I think, there
has been a meeting of minds over the purpose of the powers in the draft
regulations that the Government are introducing. I am sure that he
would not seek to caricature the Government as belligerent. In fact, I
think that we have heard a really thoughtful set of
contributions.</div> <a name="06102671000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government and outside organisations will reflect on those comments as
we move through later stages of the Bill. I think that that is the
spirit in which the hon. Gentleman meant his comment; I do not think
that he was suggesting that day in, day out we have thwarted reasonable
suggestions. The Oppositionhave probed us quite rightly, and
quite rightly we have provided reassurance. That is the spirit in which
we have conducted
proceedings.</div><a name="06102671000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific amendments, Opposition Members, in particular the hon. Members
for Daventry and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey,
mentioned child poverty and sanctions. They are correct in their
analysis. We have spoken before about child poverty, so perhaps it
would be inappropriate to dwell on it for too long now, but there are
common factors in the prevalence of child poverty in the UK: family
size, ethnicity, disability and generational aspiration within the
family structure. As we all know, one of the weaknesses of incapacity
benefit is the way in which it has become generational, not because of
an injury, ailment or illness, but because of aspirations within the
family.</div><a name="06102671000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say this
gently because we should not get into the cut and thrust of political
to-ing and fro-ing unless others feel that we should: it is a matter of
public record&#151;every commentator regardless of political
persuasion accepts this&#151;that until the mid-1990s, the UK had the
fastest-growing child poverty rate of any major industrialised nation.
That is a matter of public record. We do not need to ask
why&#151;</div><a name="06102671000127"></a>

we can have a conversation about why, if Mr. Amess allows
us. I am stating it as a matter of public record. The rates of child
poverty in the United Kingdom are now falling faster than those in any
major economy on the globe. We have not yet gone far 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 272</div>enough; we have a lot more work to do, but the fact is that we had the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000350"></a>Mr.

something. Mr. Amess, I know that you will not allow us to
go down this line of conversation for much longer, but many of us on
the Labour Benches feel this genetically&#151;we are entirely
committed, for all sorts of reasons, not just to a reduction, but to
the eradication of child poverty. I do not want to dwell on the party
political nature of the issue, but it is a matter of public record that
we inherited the highest, fastest growing levels of child poverty, when
one in three children grew up in poverty. One in five children were in
a workless household during that period. I do not want to apportion
blame, but that is a statement of where we are, of progress that has
been made, and an assessment of the contribution that the Bill can make
to the eradication of child poverty.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000355"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I am standing up to
ask the Minister, in the interests of making progress on the Bill, to
restrict his comments to the Bill. If he wants to discuss what happened
in the 1980s and 1990s, we have our version of what happened. There
were many problems, of which child poverty was one. That Government
tried to tackle other problems, including the economic crisis that we
inherited from his party in 1979. Before Mr. Amess brings me
to order, I simply say to the Minister that it does not help. All of us
on the Conservative Benches in this Committee have been talking about
child poverty in the context of the Bill, and our concern is that some
of the measures within it might not achieve the shared objective that
we all have, which is to eliminate child poverty. If the Minister
restricted his comments to that, we might have a more productive
discussion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000357"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000358"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000359"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I say to the Committee for the last time:
Minister, can we please return to the amendments&#151;not child
poverty, or any other party political
matters?</div><a name="06102671000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000360"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you, Mr Amess. Of course, I will obey your
strictures. I wonder, however, whether you would allow us some leeway
because a specific question has been asked about the sanctions power
that we are taking in the clause and the likely impact on child
poverty. It is entirely up to you to judge whether that would be an
appropriate topic of discussion. I did not seek to create party
political friction. I was trying to record an objective analysis of
what has happened in this country over the past two decades. One of the
issues concerning child poverty is that it is down to hon. Members to
assess what welfare reform is most likely to eradicate it.</div>
<a name="06102671000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the tone that we
had three or so minutes ago, I was analysing whether child poverty
could be eradicated if a parent with a dependent child spent prolonged
periods on benefit, even though there was an alternative available,
with appropriate support. Our sense&#151;there is a wealth of
evidence that this is indisputably the case&#151;is that the
opportunity to come off benefit and into work at the right level with
the right mix of skills and the chance to progress not just into a job
but into a career, is the most effective pathway out of poverty. It is
not appropriate for everyone because of different family circumstances,
but it is the most successful and effective pathway out of
poverty.</div> <a name="06102671000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
doubt the sincerity of the comments of the hon. Member for Daventry.
Having that sanction is the last option. With pathways it was used for
about 1 per cent. of customers and we would be delighted if it were
less than that as it is rolled out. However, it is used as a last
option and a further way of enforcing engagement with a process that is
aimed at getting people closer to and then involved in the labour
market, which is an effective way of reducing and eradicating child
poverty within that family unit. The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable
point about the impact on child poverty, but it is our assessment that
encouraging participation and engagement in work-focused interviews and
work-related activity has a much greater effect in terms of what we are
seeking to do than what may happen in a small number of cases, based on
the 1 per cent. of instances in pathways where sanctions have
unfortunately been necessary.</div>
<a name="06102671000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000361"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> What sanctions will the Minister be able to use
under the Bill for someone who is not co-operating in the process,
without good reason, but for whom a financial sanction would not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div>appropriate because it might affect children in the household who might
descend further into child
poverty?</div><a name="06102671000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000362"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will come to that later in my
comments.</div><a name="06102671000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Daventry and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
asked how we would progress on sanctions under clause 12. We are
currently considering the effectiveness and the operation of the
sanctions within the pathway pilots. Next summer we can come to some
conclusions about the operation of those sanctions. From that we will
draw our conclusions and form the specific sanctioning regime around
which work-related activity will be
focused.</div><a name="06102671000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000363"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Minister quoted the figure of 1 per cent. as
being those within the ambit of the sanctions regimes in pathways. I
would not like the Committee to go away with the idea that this not an
important issue once the pathways are rolled out. Look at the stock of
incapacity benefit claimants into which the Minister would eventually
like to make inroads: 1 per cent. of that is 27,000 people and their
families. There will be an awful lot of hard cases. That is an argument
not for taking away the sanctions regime, but for applying it very
sensitively and with the best possible range of options that decision
makers and personal advisers can use to encourage those people to
co-operate.</div><a name="06102671000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000364"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, based on those crude
statistics, but I am sure that he would accept the analysis, which is
that one in six of those currently on incapacity benefit have children.
Therefore, 1 per cent. of those one in six is an entirely different
figure.</div><a name="06102671000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000365"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I rise simply to correct the record. The
calculation that I did in my head to make the point that a significant
number of people were involved discounted the fact that, even if
eventually incapacity benefit claimants were migrated on to the ESA, a
significant number would be within the support allowance. I would not
like the Committee to get the impression that it would necessarily be
the whole lot. I am simply saying that quite a lot of people could be
affected and we need to be sensitive in their
interests.</div><a name="06102671000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06102671000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000366"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is a reasonable point and adds to the point
that I had already made: one in six of current customers have a
dependent child. Initially as we move into ESA, there is no reason to
think that that figure will change overnight. However, with the support
group alongside that, the proportion with dependent children who could
attract a sanction would be smaller still. We will seek to learn
lessons from the pathways sanctions and the pilots. We will publish the
evidence in the summer of next year and then construct the new system,
with consultation, to ensure that we strike the right
balance.</div> <a name="06102671000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn

in which the amount of the reduction is to be
nil.&#148;</div><a name="06102671000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We might learn that
lesson when taking forward sanctions and we have the power in the Bill
to prescribe circumstances under which a financial sanction might not
be appropriate. That route might be more fruitful than the one
suggested by the hon. Member for Daventry for alternative purposes and
sanctions.</div><a name="06102671000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
comment on some of the specific points made by the hon. Gentleman. I do
so entirely in the same tone in which he offered them because, like
others, he was frank enough in his analysis to say, &#147;Here are
some ideas&#148;. On driving licences&#151;others have commented on
this too&#151;it could be argued that getting a licence in the first
place is a work-related activity. Should we take away what could be
considered to be, in some circumstances, work-related activity?
However, I appreciate that he raised it as a point of debate, and we
will reflect on it.</div><a name="06102671000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
passports, the evidence is that folk on benefit and those from poorer
families, who have less access to reliable credit, credit cards, and
mortgages from established banks are asked for an authoritative form of
identification more often than the rest of the population. Analysis has
shown how often a middle class white man is asked for proof of
identification&#151;a disproportionate number of us here are middle
class white men, although not all of us. On average, I think that they
are asked for identity three times a
year.</div><a name="06102671000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000367"></a><b class="B">Natascha

Scottish.</div><a name="06102671000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000368"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) talks about the Scots. I think that Derby
played an important part in the history of Scotland&#151;it was
almost as far as we got. However, she would not wish to get involved in
that conversation. I do not know whether she advocates the permanent
occupation of Derby by the Scots, and I have no idea what that would
mean for accents. It seems to have worked okay in Corby and some other
places.</div><a name="06102671000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
passport sanction, the hon. Member for Daventry raises an interesting
idea. However, let us consider the profile of customers on IB and ESA.
In the absence of an identity card&#151;let us not have that
conversation today&#151;a passport is often the only accepted form of
identification for people from poorer families and households because
of their lack of a reliable credit record or mortgage. That is another
route we are not tempted to go down. The power in clause 12(4) is more
appropriate and the one on which the Government have settled&#151;the
power to prescribe &#147;nil&#148; as the applicable
amount.</div><a name="06102671000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000369"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Minister return to my earlier intervention?
Does the Bill give the Government any alternatives to the financial
sanction? I accept his helpful reassurance that the Government do not
have to apply the financial sanction, but will they have the power to
apply any other sanctions? There might be situations in which a
sanction should be applied, but a financial sanction would be the wrong
one.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div><a name="06102671000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000370"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I ask the hon. Gentleman to look at page 6 of the
draft regulations. We do not intend to take the power to apply
alternative sanctions for the reasons that I have stipulated already.
The draft regulations seek to ensure that, when possible, we avoid
having to use the sanctions. As I said earlier, we intend, after
consultation, to take the type of safeguards we are putting in place in
clause 11 across to clause 12. Hon. Members can see for themselves the
extent of safeguards that are put in place. They include advising
customers of appointments and making contact between each interview. I
will not read the full list of nine or 10 safeguards on page 6 of our
draft regulations. On top of that, and not listed, is the right of
appeal against any financial sanction. That is our approach. There are
very strong
safeguards.</div><a name="06102671000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000371"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I still do not think that the Minister has
answered the direct question from my colleague. What sanctions will
there be other than financial ones?
</div><a name="06102671000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000372"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> To be fair to the hon. Gentleman, he may have
missed my comment. I said that the Bill does not take the power for any
other sanction. We do not think it appropriate to have a wider or an
alternative power to the sanction of gradual reduction in two tranches
of the work-related activity component, until such time as
conditionality and the customer again participates in work-focused
interviews and, over time, work-related
activity.</div><a name="06102671000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000373"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> It was just the very short question: why does the
Secretary of State not seek to have the ability to impose other
non-financial sanctions that may be helpful for people returning to
work?</div><a name="06102671000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000374"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman willing to suggest any? I
accept the tone of the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry and the
difficulty that he identified, but the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam
Afriyie) strikes a different tone, so I invite him to identify an
alternative
sanction.</div><a name="06102671000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000375"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Let us say that for someone who has a mental
health challenge the sanction might be that they must attend certain
types of cognitive-based therapy. Perhaps that would be more
appropriate than threatening to withdraw
money.</div><a name="06102671000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000376"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman, for entirely good reasons,
such as other commitments in the House, may have been unable to be in
Committee when we had this debate on earlier clauses. If someone
participates in cognitive behaviour therapy and other types of support,
they would not attract a sanction in the first place because that would
be deemed to be work-related activity. Does he have a workable
alternative for a
sanction?</div><a name="06102671000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000377"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> We are scrutinising legislation here and I am
asking the Minister questions to examine why the Government have not
chosen to make allowance in the Bill or the regulations to use other
forms of sanctions that may be more
appropriate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000378"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I suspect the answer to my question is no. The
hon. Gentleman has therefore come to the same conclusion as the
Government, so I am glad that he apparently agrees with
us.</div><a name="06102671000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">These discussions
are about the formulation of the powers that we take. Two of the most
readily used alternative sanctions are the two that the hon. Member for
Daventry fairly identified. As I sought to explain to the Committee, we
do not think that those would be appropriate in the context. There is a
general acceptance that in almost all, if not all, circumstances
withdrawing a driving licence would not be appropriate. In terms of the
profile, withdrawal of passports from customers on ESA and IB would not
be appropriate either. At that point, we settle on a sanction as a last
resort on the basis that significant safeguards are outlined on page 6
of our draft
regulations.</div><a name="06102671000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000379"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
reassurance and I agree with the points that he has made about some of
those other sanctions. He may have been about to come to the point that
I raised earlier. It concerned the evidence base for suggesting that
the sort of sanctions that the Government are taking powers for in the
Bill are efficacious, or is it more a matter of
principle?</div><a name="06102671000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000380"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall shortly conclude my remarks on the
amendments, because I am now answering a question for a second time.
The response that I have already given is that we have pilot sanctions
in pathways, and we will analyse their effectiveness and publish our
conclusions. We will take the lessons of that into the draft
regulations on how sanctions will work in relation to work-related
activity. We will consult on that and, of course, Parliament will hold
the regulations to account through the appropriate channels and
mechanisms and consider whether they represent the right thing to
do.</div><a name="06102671000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000381"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am becoming quite frustrated by this debate.
Will my hon. Friend the Minister re-examine closely the safeguards
needed? Is it not a fact that the process is also important? A person
might be afraid of attending an interview or have had past experience
that makes them feel that something of which they are fearful might
happen. The visits and conversations that will take place before any
sanctions are imposed might enable someone to take an opportunity that
they would otherwise not avail themselves
of.</div><a name="06102671000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000382"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Again, my hon. Friend speaks from her experience
of dealing with her constituents. She continues to campaign and brings
that practical experience to the Committee&#146;s attention. Her
point is made clearly on page 6 of the draft regulations, through such
provisions as an offer
of</div><a name="06102671000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a more convenient
location or a home visit where appropriate...visiting those
customers with whom there has been no verbal contact&#148;</div>
<a name="06102671000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">before a work-focused interview and
encouraging an advocate to attend and support a customer at each
interaction. The tone and spirit of such protections 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 278</div>under clause 11 will be carried across and built on under clause 12 in
the regulations on which we will
consult.</div><a name="06102671000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sanctions
will be a last resort in a small number of cases in which a person does
not participate in work-related activity, which, as hon. Members know,
carries the broad definition contained in the Green Paper. It will
involve stabilising life and getting closer to the labour market.
Sanctions will apply if, without good cause&#151;that also has a wide
definition&#151;a person does not participate. They will have the
right of independent appeal against any sanction and, both in the
powers that we are taking in the Bill and in the tone of the draft
regulations, it is clear that sanctions are our last resort. The regime
will not be sanctions led; it will be about support. As a last resort,
the Government must have the opportunity to use sanctions as a way
finally to engage those who have not yet participated. From the
experience of pathways, we hope that 1 per cent will be the maximum
proportion of people involved as we roll out the sanctions. With that
reassurance, I encourage hon. Members not to press the
amendments.</div><a name="06102671000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000383"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. I
sense that you, Mr. Amess, and the rest of the Committee
would like to make progress, and I do not intend to speak at length.
The only self-indulgence that I will bring to the party is to say that
last year, in my capacity as an ambassador for the National Forest, I
had the privilege of planting a number of new oak trees within sight of
Stanton Bridge, the exact point outside Derby where the Jacobite army
turned around in 1745. I was on the right side of that particular
conflict. I know that that is as far as I should
go.</div><a name="06102671000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were in a
slightly unusual position with the amendments, because as I spoke to
them I was conscious that I was probing both the Minister and my own
mind. It is a difficult matter. The Minister has endeavoured to reply,
but I would have been happy for him to take powers to introduce
sanctions other than purely financial ones, albeit with the safeguards
that he has properly set out. The Government do not often get from the
Opposition free offers of greater powers, but in this case he could
have banked that. I am surprised that he has not availed himself of the
opportunity.</div><a name="06102671000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
whole I like to emphasis the positive in a Bill, but I might wish to
say a word on clause stand part. Given that we have rehearsed already
the lead amendment No. 238 and the need for adequate support for
claimants, I do not think that it is necessary to press it. The
Minister has declined the free offer and, in response, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06102671000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000384"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 242, in
clause 12, page 11, line 40, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(8) Regulations
under this section may make provision to ensure that the ability to
carry out &#147;work related activity&#148; is not automatically
treated as evidence that the claimant&#146;s capability to work has
improved.&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div><a name="06102671000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be brief because we have
discussed the essential point here before, but the Committee needs to
remind itself of its importance. There is an inherent equivocation in
the personal capability assessment. Is it a pass or failure if the
claimant shows that they are not capable of work? It follows that many
people are equivocal and probably even more are worried that if they do
succeed, which is the objective, they will find themselves
&#147;humbugged&#148;&#151;to use a Victorian phrase&#151;by
losing their benefits.</div>
<a name="06102671000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that that is
a separate process and would not be triggered by an ability to work.
Formally, that is the case. However, just because he has said it once
does not mean that it is not appropriate to ask him to say it again or
for us to remind him that it really matters to the claimants. The last
thing any of us want is for people to go bravely through a rather
difficult process and make progress, only to discover that they are
worse off than they intended or deserve. I hope that that does not
happen.</div> <a name="06102671000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise
not only the facts of the matter, but the word on the street and
people&#146;s concern that success in the assessment itself might
lead to sanctions, which might cause them not to do the sensible thing
and therefore lead them into a sanction regime&#151;returning to our
earlier discussion. They would have chosen the route of failure, which
would be in nobody&#146;s interest.</div>
<a name="06102671000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000385"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I shall briefly support my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments. There is widespread concern among a number of out-of-work
disabled people that any involvement in the world of work could trigger
a reassessment of their disability status&#151;if I can put it that
way. That could in turn threaten their benefits package, which is
incredibly important to their independence.</div>
<a name="06102671000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that that is not what
the Government intend, but mistakes happen. Citizens Advice reported an
occurrence in north Wales where a higher-rate disability living
allowance claimant lost his wife, after which he started to work for
seven and a half hours a week. He was incorrectly advised by his local
benefits office that he could not do that work and claim benefits at
the same time. Clearly, that was a mistake. Those things happen. One
purpose of the amendment is to provide reassurance to people that
involving themselves in work-related activity will not lead to a
reassessment of their limited capability to work.</div>
<a name="06102671000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I remind the
Minister of a recent Capability Scotland survey of unemployed disabled
people. It found that the reason half of them did not want to involve
themselves in the world of work was their fear of losing their benefits
package. The amendment might help to assuage those fears. I look
forward to any reassurance that the Minister might be able to
give.</div><a name="06102671000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000386"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall seek to respond quickly; I know that some
people, including my the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household,
my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr.
Heppell), are becoming impatient because we have not made as much
progress as was initially anticipated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div><a name="06102671000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point made by the hon.
Member for Daventry about the importance of language harks back to a
previous debate. The Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stirling, reminded me that previously, when someone
undertook a PCA in respect of an IB claim, the communication said,
&#147;Dear Mrs. Jones, this is to confirm that you passed
the PCA.&#148; What is passing or failing a PCA? If someone passed
the PCA, they were entitled to incapacity benefit. It is that sense of
language.</div><a name="06102671000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Gentleman that undertaking permitted work will not in itself
trigger a change in benefit entitlement. A change of condition will
lead to a change in consideration of someone&#146;s entitlement to
benefit. That change of condition would not be analysed on the basis of
what the person was now doing under permitted work rules but on a new
PCA, the process of which we discussed in our earlier clauses, based on
the 15 points and 46 descriptors. That will be the sole basis for the
judgment whether someone remains entitled to ESA, contrary to the quite
reasonable concerns that some people in this country beyond the
Committee might have. It is important to emphasise that, which is why I
am glad that the hon. Gentleman gave me the opportunity to confirm that
to the Committee and therefore
others.</div><a name="06102671000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000387"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that we are almost there. We needed that
reassurance. It is important, but I must hammer it home to the Minister
that language matters a lot. The more user-friendly and positive it can
be, the better. There will be plenty of people to rubbish it, but we
should start with the positive.</div>
<a name="06102671000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might be some
concerns&#151;I picked them up informally in discussion the other
day&#151;about whether people could lose out on existing benefits:
for example, in the linking rules where they undertake work. Perhaps at
the moment&#151;I am using oldspeak&#151;if they have higher rate
incapacity benefit, they might come back in at a lower rate. Beyond the
Minister&#146;s assurance, which of course I accept as he has given
it, is the need to check whether perverse incentives still buried in
some of the arrangements&#146; small print, like the one that I
mentioned, could mean that people undertaking work-related
activity&#151;although he referred to permitted work, which is not
quite the same thing&#151;might lose out in certain circumstances.
Nobody wants that. The more sensitive we are to it, the more likely we
are to avoid it. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06102671000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06102671000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The
Chairman:</b> Before we come to the expected debate on clause 12 stand
part, I remind the Committee that we have had a fairly wide debate
already. I am perfectly happy for Members to make their contributions
if they try to stick to matters that have not already been
discussed.</div><a name="06102671000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000388"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I wish to make a general point about clause 12,
which I think is the most important clause in the Bill. I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to the explanatory notes, which define
work-related activity as</div>
<a name="06102671000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undertaking activity that
increases the likelihood of getting a job. This may include activities
such as work trials or training&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 281</div><a name="06102671000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the training aspect of work-related
activity that I would like to talk about. The training and skills part
of the Bill is absolutely fundamental to its
success.</div><a name="06102671000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to note that we are discussing the Bill&#146;s detail at
the same time as Sandy Leitch is carrying out a general review of
skills, examining the matter with a cross-departmental approach. I do
not wantto pre-empt what he will say on skills, but I wish to
highlight the issue and to encourage the Minister to support a
cross-departmental effort involving the Department for Education and
Skills, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Treasury in order to ensure that the skills aspect
is never
forgotten.</div><a name="06102671000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Jobcentre Plus network was designed initially to be a one-stop shop for
everything related to being out of work. Jobcentre Plus would be the
first to admit that it does not really consider skills and skills
training to be its core function, yet basic skills&#151;I mean hard
skills such as literacy and numeracy&#151;are one of the serious
issues facing the group of people that we hope to help with the
Bill.</div><a name="06102671000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
introduce the Committee to Derbyshire Dave. Derbyshire Dave used to be
a miner in North-East Derbyshire. My constituency is actually not close
to Derby at all; it is much closer to Sheffield. We border South
Yorkshire. It is one of the coalfields constituencies, but it has a
large number of people who used to be steelworkers. Derbyshire Dave
could be an ex-miner or ex-steelworker who has lost his job and has
been on incapacity benefit for a while, but is keen to get involved in
pathways to work. Derbyshire Dave exists. He is so willing that he
walked into Jobcentre Plus to demand to be put on the scheme. That is
an important aspect in respect of our earlier debate; the people keen
to participate who come and ask to be put on pathways to work are the
issue, rather than the dragging of people into Jobcentre
Plus.</div> <a name="06102671000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Derbyshire
Dave, very keen to get a job, has taken part in all the condition
management programmes and retraining. The problem is that North-East
Derbyshire, like many other constituencies, is rural; Derbyshire Dave
is often not willing to do the kind of work available. In fact, he is
being offered work behind the checkout at Morrisons or Tesco; those are
the jobs we have in the constituency.</div>
<a name="06102671000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Derbyshire Dave is ready and
willing to work and keen to get involved in the labour market. However,
the jobs available are not suitable. What happens to him? He is in the
ESA group; he goes straight on to the jobseeker&#146;s allowance and
all the support available through the personal advisers in the system
is withdrawn because he is now a straightforward jobseeker. If he were
to find a job, he would still for up to a year have all the in-work
support that would be available to anybody who goes on from pathways
into work.</div><a name="06102671000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Derbyshire
Dave has serious issues and I am worried that in this legislation he
falls between two stools. This is a problem that affects rural areas.
The city strategy is fantastic and very important in bringing together
all the different agencies and employers and everybody else who is
willing to get people off incapacity benefit and into work. In rural
areas, however, we do not have the transport networks of cities, nor
their variety of jobs in geographical locations close by.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 282</div><a name="06102671000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">To address the issue, we have
launched a rural pilot similar to the city strategies. One of the ways
of doing that is to pull together all the different agencies to ensure
that we can identify the issues and overcome them locally ourselves.
Making sure that the local delivery is in place will be one of the most
important parts of the Bill and the clause; that is the only way in
which any of this can be
delivered.</div><a name="06102671000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues that we identified in our rural pilot was that nobody was
specifically responsible for mapping the local economy&#151;the local
labour market now and of the future. For any Committee member who
drives up the M1 to their constituency, I should say that we are
between junctions 29 and 30. Weare about to have a huge
employment zone. In theshort term, that means construction
jobs; in the medium term, it means more construction jobs;
inthe long term, it means lots of different kinds of
businesses. Nobody in my constituency or the surrounding constituencies
is identifying the skills needs now, in the medium term and in the
future to make sure that the people on incapacity benefit in my
constituency are able to have the benefit of the jobs once they come

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000389"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We are listening to the hon. Lady&#146;s
contribution with interest but also a bit of alarm. I am very surprised
to hear that there is not more strategic thinking to identify
conditions that might be prevalent in her area and to work out what
form of training package might fit the needs. I am staggered and
disappointed to hear about the various public bodies, whose job is to
think strategically and answer the hon. Lady&#146;s exact questions.
Will she say a bit more about the
issue?</div><a name="06102671000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000390"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention.
I deliberately painted a rather bleak picture to highlight the problem.
We can make national legislation and produce a good national
legislative framework for the system to exist in, but only local
delivery matters. Lots of different public, private and voluntary
organisations are doing some of that
work.</div><a name="06102671000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06102671000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The city
strategy brings all of that together in a coherent manner, which may
not be true in rural areas, and I am worried about the difference
between the rural and the more urban. We have organisations that do a
wonderful job in identifying skills needs, and we have a rather large
employment-creating project on our doorstep, which is fantastically
exciting, but even though we are thinking strategically and considering
future skills needs, that is not strategic enough. We are doing all
that against the backdrop of the accession eight countries, which
presents one of the biggest problems that we face in rural areas. I
would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on all of those
points.</div><a name="06102671000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000391"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am pleased to follow the hon. Lady, who made
some interesting and helpful contributions, the first of which was to
bring a degree of enthusiasm to a subject that deserves more than
cynicism. We need to realise that the Bill is about real people whom we
are trying to help. That is not an unworthy aim for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 283</div>politicians. It is sometimes unnecessary to claim that, but it is still
important to feel it.</div>
<a name="06102671000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady stood up for
rural areas. She will not be surprised if I respond to her on that. I
know something of the coalfield communities, and I think that she made
the point, by implication, that not all rural areas are affluent, and
that they have difficulties. I was recently reading the report of the
Government&#146;s new rural advocate, Dr. Stuart Burgess, which says
that there are problems with the ability to access a proper range of
services, with transport, and with other issues we have discussed. I
agree that, however well things are done at the centre, it sometimes
seems as though the rural areas are somewhat in default. Will the
Minister spend a moment of the Committee&#146;s time talking about
his approach to the projection of the system into rural
areas?</div><a name="06102671000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also talked about skills. I could join her in doing that and talk
enthusiastically for the rest of the day on that subject, which is
central to the debate. We have debated medical and quasi-medical
conditions, but the issue is wider than that. All the work that I have
seen, which includes the work of the National Institute of Adult
Continuing Education, shows that participation in education, in the
widest sense of the word&#151;not necessarily narrowly
vocational-specific activities, but activities from literacy to leisure
and pastimes&#151;is good in itself and good for people&#146;s
health. It involves interaction and affects confidence. The Minister
will appreciate this, but we need to keep saying it: it is important
that his Department and the Department for Education and Skills and
others work together on these matters.</div>
<a name="06102671000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bury St. Edmunds rightly asks, is not all that happening? In a sense,
formally it is, but the hon. Lady is right to put up her hand and say,
&#147;This really does matter in rural areas, and we have to be
involved in it,&#148; particularly where there are patterns of
morbidity, distance and exclusion from the labour market, which there
will be in some areas. I can find a few of my own that are not too
clever.</div> <a name="06102671000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s final point, about volunteering, is the one she made
best. That is because of the enthusiasm with which she expressed her
remarks. She talked about Derbyshire Dave, who wanted to get on with
things and was prepared to do everything, but somehow the services did
not come along. The important point is that he was fired up to do
something. It occurs to me that the whole clause is about the negative,
such as regulations and the conditions under which sanctions can be
applied. Most of the debate has been not about the negative, but about
helping people. I hope that it will stay that way.</div>
<a name="06102671000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to something that we
have debated before, and make the only other point that I want to make
on this clause. Many enthusiastic people who are already on incapacity
benefit would like to work if the opportunity arose. That is where we
start. Others&#151;we have discussed them at some length during our
debate on this clause&#151;might not want to join the party and might
ultimately come at least within the ambit of the idea of
sanctions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 284</div><a name="06102671000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems important that we
should emphasise the positive, not the negative, and one of the most
important things is the individual&#146;s motivation. Sadly, some
people within the support allowance category will find it difficult to
return to the labour market, and by definition no one in that category
will find it easy. On the other hand, if they are willing volunteers
they should be actively encouraged. Other people within the employment
allowance category will be less active and less keen, and if resources
are not unlimited&#151;we will not reopen that issue&#151;it may be
important for Jobcentre Plus or the private contractors to go out to
look for people who actively want to participate. A simple rubric that
I will leave with the Committee is that it might be better, rather than
having a conscript on the employment allowance, to have a willing
volunteer on the support allowance.</div>
<a name="06102671000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000392"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I want to follow the comments made by the hon.
Members for North-East Derbyshire and for Daventry, and to underscore
for the Minister the importance of delivering such services and
supporting people when they undertake work-related activity in rural
areas. I represent some 5,000 square miles of the highlands and isles
of Scotland, where the distances and&#151;less so, these
days&#151;weather conditions, such as severe cold weather, make the
strategic co-ordination of such activities incredibly difficult. I
understand the point that the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire
made. In some ways, it is even stronger if one is talking about a few
people up a mountain track up the Cairngorm mountains or Monadhliaths
who, in some circumstances and because of a range of disadvantages,
would be unable to take part in activities that are being promoted
through a city strategy or any other urban-centred strategy. It is
critical to reflect on the needs of people in sparsely populated rural
areas, as I am sure the Minister will agree.</div>
<a name="06102671000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am delighted that the
Minister has come to Inverness to visit the &#147;Unlock Your
Potential&#148; project, a joint effort between the SHIRLIE project,
which is an extremely well-respected and successful voluntary
organisation that promotes supported employment, and Jobcentre Plus in
the highlands. Jobcentre Plus has shown commendable innovation in
coming up with the ideas around the scheme. It is trying to deliver the
sort of joined-up thinking in sparsely populated rural areas that the
hon. Lady referred to. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that
is part of the Government&#146;s wider thinking for rural
areas.</div>
<a name="06102671000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000393"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will try to respond briefly to the reasonable
points about skills and the wider debate that we have not as yet
touched on. I will be quick.</div>
<a name="06102671000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Derbyshire mentioned the importance of training and skills.
To drive out poverty in a family, we need not only to get people into
work but to sustain them in work and to enhance their skills. There is
evidence that the most effective way to enhance skills is while someone
is in work rather while they are out of work. The hon. Member for
Daventry knows about these issues. I am not trying to belittle anyone
who is taking other routes and engaged in other activity, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 285</div>analytically work is the most effective place for a customer to be to
enhance their skills.</div>
<a name="06102671000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Derbyshire is right to say that Sandy Leitch is working on a
review at the Treasury&#146;s behest. I had the opportunity to meet
him along with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to discuss
his emerging thinking and to seek to influence some aspects of his
conclusions. I am happy to report that there is nothing that my hon.
Friend has said today that Sandy Leitch would not agree with&#151;I
base that on my conversations with him. It is important to mention his
work, and of course he will come to his own conclusions in his own
time.</div><a name="06102671000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may wish to
reflect at another time on the role of skills coaches as well as
personal advisers. On rural poverty, I would be happy to visit
Inverness the next time that my family and I go to the excellent Conon
Bridge hotel, which is in that part of the world. I do not know whether
it was appropriate to say that, or to talk about its cheap weekend
breaks. Anyway, the next time I am there with my family, I
will&#151;with my family&#146;s indulgence, of course&#151;take
the opportunity to visit the projects that the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
mentioned.</div><a name="06102671000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On rural
poverty and the rural dimension, there are all sorts of issues to do
with transport. People in rural areas, particularly young folk,
identify it as a key issue in respect of their connection to work and
the opportunity to get out of poverty or to advance their aspirations.
I was reminded of that again on a relatively recent visit to Jamie
Oliver&#146;s restaurant Fifteen in Newquay. The trainees there
identified the importance of transport in a rural environment. It
enables them to get to their workplace and to maintain themselves in
work.</div><a name="06102671000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cities
strategy is important. It is about a consortium of people who have
shared aspirations and a determination to work together. I have already
mentioned Wales, which, to its credit, has stolen a march on the rest
of the United Kingdom. In the rest of the UK, the strategy will be
rolled out in the cities, but in Wales, as I have said, it will be
rolled out in the heads of the valleys and in Rhyl. I do not know all
the topography and terrain of that part of the world, but I do know
that those places are not as yet major cities. We will have an
opportunity to learn from the experiences, co-operative working and
innovations of the consortiums, particularly in Wales, and use that
knowledge in a further roll-out of the cities strategy. With those
remarks, I invite the Committee to agree that clause 12 stand part of
the Bill.</div><a name="06102671000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000396"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I will try to be relatively brief. All three
amendments relate to the action plans and raise concerns which I hope
the Minister will address about how the action planning process will
operate.</div><a name="06102671000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
157 goes back to a debate that we had earlier, so I shall not dwell on
it too much. However, it is important to talk a bit more about the
requirements on employers. In a debate last week, the Minister said
that engagement with employers is essential because, in the main, the
Government do not create jobs. But he also implied that the Government
themselves should be doing more as an employer to engage with the sorts
of people we have been
discussing.</div><a name="06102671000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister expand a wee bit on what role he thinks the Department for
Work and Pensions and other central Government Departments could have
as employers, and whether they will have a role in recruiting people
from incapacity benefit, or from employment and support allowance, as
it will be?</div><a name="06102671000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
key question is how any employer engagement undertaken by the
Department or, indeed, by contractors on behalf of the
Department&#151;delivering pathways to work, for example&#151;will
relate to the action plans that will be drawn up for individuals. Is it
the Minister&#146;s thinking that within the action plans reference
could be made to the role that employers will play? That is the
substance of the first amendment. The burden of one of the other
amendments is that the action plan is not just about the individual. It
is about what the personal adviser can do to help an individual and
what potential employers might do in the context of the individual
action
plan.</div><a name="06102671000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06102671000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
38 is about safeguards in relation to the reconsideration of an action
plan. Subsection (4) provides that an action plan can be reconsidered
under certain circumstances to be specified in regulations. Will the
Minister assure us that an individual who is the subject of an action
plan will have the right to request a change to it, or to withdraw it
completely and to ask for a fresh one to be drawn up if circumstances
change?</div><a name="06102671000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
143 is intended to probe the Government&#146;s definition of the
&#147;prescribed circumstances&#148; in which a person will be
provided with an action plan document. With those brief words, I invite
the Minister to spell out his thinking.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 287</div><a name="06102671000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000397"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I wish to speak to Amendment No. 157, which is on
requirements on employers. A concern that many people have about the
Bill is that there is not enough in it about how we will improve
communications with employers, who are an important part of the
equation. Both Ministers will be aware of statistics that show that
there is still a huge amount of discrimination by employers. Some 38
per cent. are not prepared to take on anybody with any disability,
and63 per cent. are not prepared to take on someone with a
background of mental illness. It is important to involve employers in
the process, and the amendment suggests that requirements on employers
should be part of the action plan.</div>
<a name="06102671000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had Sheffield Dave and
Derbyshire Dave; may I mention Tunbridge Wells Tim? I have changed his
name, because I do not want to put his real name on the record. He
suffered an acquired brain injury when he was a teenager when he
stepped out of a bus and was mown down by a car that was moving very
fast alongside it. He was in a coma for many months. The result is that
he has a learning disability that will be with him for the rest of his
life. He was supported brilliantly by Kent Supported Employment, which
did a fantastic job of placing him in a job. He tried several times to
get a job, but he was open about his learning disability and was not
interviewed. Then he applied for a job at the Odeon cinema in Tunbridge
Wells andwas supported considerably by Kent Supported
Employment. He did not mention his learning disability, but as soon as
he was invited for an interview Kent Supported Employment contacted the
Odeon and explained the situation. The Odeon staff were very willing to
see him and he is now doing a brilliant job in that cinema.</div>
<a name="06102671000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I went to the cinema and
spoke to people about it, I asked the staff about the challenges
involved. They mentioned the role of the personal advisers who help
disabled people to get into employment. They said that it is crucial,
and they gave an example. Tim was serving ice cream and some of it
dropped on the counter. He started to eat the ice cream that had been
dropped. Had they not known about his disability, that would have been
a sackable offence. He would probably not still be working there. The
excellent relationship that the cinema had developed with the advisers
meant that they were able to deal with the situation. As a result, his
prospects there are going from strength to strength. That is a good
example of why involvement with employers, including, as the Minister
rightly said, the Government&#146;s involvement, is incredibly
important.</div><a name="06102671000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the comments made by the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire. There
are some brilliant employers&#151;parts of BT, Asda and Royal
Mail&#151;that do an excellent job. However, they say that they have
been driven to do so by labour market shortages. It made them consider
tapping into another labour market: people who have a limited
capability for work.
</div><a name="06102671000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">BT has found that
disabled employees save it a lot of money. It costs the company
&#163;3,000 to &#163;5,000 to employ someone, and if it keeps
someone for longer, it saves money. BT found that the retention rate
after one year for disabled employees was almost 10 per cent. higher
than for non-disabled employees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 288</div><a name="06102671000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are good stories, but the
unemployment trajectory is firmly upward. The hon. Lady also raised the
issue of accession states.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000398"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I pay tribute to the way in which my hon. Friend
has shared a heart-warming and positive story from Tunbridge Wells.
Does he recognise the statistic about tight labour markets? The Shaw
Trust, among others, has suggested to me that the employment rate of
disabled people in Berkshire could be eight or 10 times higher than the
employment rate of disabled people in Bridgend. We must understand that
and develop policies to deal with
it.</div><a name="06102671000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000399"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, and it
underlines my point. One of the most important outcomes of the Bill,
the general direction of which the whole Committee supports, must be
the stepping up of involvement with employers. With the pathways to
work pilots, we have the mechanism to make it happen. However, there
are practical requirements of employers, which is where the amendment
has some value. Employers are obliged to make reasonable adjustments
through the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, but a reasonable
adjustment will vary depending on the disability of the person seeking
employment. The personal adviser will be aware of the disability and
what the reasonable adjustment should be.</div>
<a name="06102671000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would clarify
what employers were expected to do, as they form part of the bargain.
Under the 2005 Act, the provision would become part of the action plan
and a helpful part of the process. On that basis, I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>
<a name="06102671000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000400"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am happy to respond to the points that the
amendment raises. Hon. Members are right to say that there are
inspirational examples throughout the country, and they have referred
to a couple of them. I, like many on the Committee, have had the
opportunity to listen to people in my constituency and elsewhere
describe how they have been helped by employers who have provided
leadership and inspiration.</div>
<a name="06102671000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102671000401"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I have listened to
the hon. Member for South-West Surrey, and he has taken some matters
out of context. I think I know a little bit about BT, seeing as I
worked for the company for 31
years.</div><a name="06102671000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000402"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> You were employed by
them.</div><a name="06102671000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000403"></a>John
Robertson:</b> That might be nearer the mark. BT has always
employed people with disabilities, and it has always sought to help
those people who become disabled during their employment.</div>
<a name="06102671000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will my hon. Friend the
Minister allay my fears about the figures we have discussed? Employment
is rising all the time, and that is one reason why we are considering
such people for employment. The issue has nothing to do with
unemployment, because more people are employed now than at any time in
the history of employment figures.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 289</div><a name="06102671000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000404"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is right to say that there are now
more people in work, and before the hon. Member for South-West Surrey
intervenes, I do not seek to make a wider point. For the first time in
our history, there are 29.02 million people in employment. For the
first time since records began, the UK has more than 29 million people
in work. Before the hon. Gentleman says that that is because of
migrants, I shall point out that migrants make up less than 1 per cent.
of our labour force. The big increase during the past year has been in
the employment of people over 50 years old. As my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary said, there are 200,000 more people over 50 in work
today than there were on this date one year ago. I believe that there
are about 609,000 current vacancies in the labour market, for jobs that
employers are trying to fill. In that context, we have the opportunity
to put in statute the kind of support that people who have been out of
the labour market for a considerable time are entitled to
expect.</div> <a name="06102671000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
the honour of representing the city of Glasgow&#151;the city of my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John
Robertson)&#151;because my constituency is just outside it. The
Silverburn centre is being built there&#151;my old school was
bulldozed as a result&#151;and the agreements that have been entered
into by employers are a model for what could happen in other parts of
the United Kingdom. A series of employers have entered into agreements
on the number of local people employed and on the number of people who
have a history of long-term unemployment coming off IB and other
benefits. If such agreements could be replicated throughout the
country, it would take us a long way towards what we are discussing
under the Bill.</div><a name="06102671000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
to the specific points that have been made. We have experience of
listening to IB customers who have been supported into and retained in
work because of the inspiration, far-sightedness and progressiveness of
employers. The hon. Member for South-West Surrey mentioned some, and my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West, who used to be a
manager at British Telecom for many years, cited his own company; I
know that he has declared an interest every time he has mentioned it
and its trade union.</div>
<a name="06102671000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can discuss the nature of
the agreements contained in the clause in terms of action plans,
because there is a degree of misunderstanding about what they would
contain. The action plan is not a legal document, and the customer will
not be asked to sign it. It is simply a record of the conversation
between the individual, the personal adviser and the customer, and of
what the customer has agreed to undertake. The customer is under no
obligation, and we are not taking the power in the Bill to oblige a
customer to adhere to the content of an action plan.</div>
<a name="06102671000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand some of the
concerns, and I hope to allay them by virtue of these comments. Perhaps
that might impact on hon. Members&#146; attitudes to some of the
other amendments that have been tabled. The action plan is intended as
a route map back to work. No one will have to fulfil a specific
commitment contained in it. In fact, when it comes to an appeals
process, if that was appropriate in terms of sanctioning at a later
date, the customer would have to show that they had undertaken
work-related activity in the widest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 290</div>sense, as outlined in the Green Paper, rather than that they had adhered
to the contents of the action plan. I hope that hon. Members have a
greater understanding and less confusion about the role of action plans
in the context of work-related activity, and that that impacts on their
attitudes to, and concerns about, an action
plan.</div><a name="06102671000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Daventry spoke about the close and important relationship between
the personal adviser and the customer. The action plan is intended to
be issued at the end of the first work-focused interview, after eight
weeks. It can, of course, continue to be updated but, for the avoidance
of any doubt, I repeat that its contents are a record of the
conversation. They do not compel the customer to undertake a specific
activity or fulfil the content of that action plan. The onus on the
customer is to undertake work-related activity, the nature of which was
outlined in the Green Paper, as that would take them closer to the
labour market in between work-focused interviews. I hope that that
reassures hon. Members about the nature of the action
plan.</div><a name="06102671000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context,
it would be inappropriate to try to place in an action plan a legal or
organisational responsibility on employers in a local environment with
which each customer would be expected to interact, because we are not
even putting into the action plan a specific responsibility with which
the customer has to interact. To put the type of responsibility on
employers that we are not even asking customers to undertake would be
wholly inappropriate in the context of these action
plans.</div>
<a name="06102671000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45 pm</div>
<a name="06102671000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employer engagement is
absolutely crucial, which is why we take the opportunity to meet and to
listen to some of our major national and local employers to see what
more we can do to support them to ease the transition into work of
people who have been out of work for a considerable period. As we roll
out ESA, the return to work credit of &#163;40 a week for 52 weeks
will ease the customer&#146;s pathway back to work. We can always
look for ways of improving that pathway and easing the transition.
Extension of the linking rules to two years is a new and important way
of doing that.</div><a name="06102671000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if
it were workable&#151;there is a legitimate argument on whether it
would be workable&#151;it is not necessary to designate in an action
plan, which is the note of a conversation between a customer and the
adviser about what could bring the customer closer to the labour
market. However, the customer has no legal responsibility to follow
that advice, so designation would probably be unworkable and is
certainly
unnecessary.</div><a name="06102671000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give
the Secretary of State the additional power to place requirements on
himself and external organisations that are carrying out his functions,
as the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is
seeking to do in amendments Nos. 38 and 141, could mean requiring a
pathways to work provider to make available a specific type of training
to customers. That can be better done through the contracting system
and that is how we intend to deal with the specific point raised by the
hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06102671000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
the draft regulations on work-focused interviews, which have been
provided to the Committee, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 291</div>set out the responsibilities of the customer during the interview and
they will be expected to participate fully. The Government already have
adequate powers in legislation to place requirements on employers. In
particular, the employment provisions in the Disability Discrimination
Act place duties on employers not to discriminate against disabled
people in recruitment and employment, and they must make reasonable
adjustments.</div><a name="06102671000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 38 would provide for regulations on the role of the customer in
determining the action plan and the right of appeal against it. The
action plan is best considered in the context of a route map. It is not
a legal agreement or a legal document in the sense that some hon.
Members have been concerned about and it is not appropriate to make it
subject to appeal for that reason. Instead, subsection (4) allows for
regulations to enable the customer to ask for the action plan to be
reconsidered. We intend to make regulations under that power when we
introduce the mandatory work-related activity to allow the customer to
request an alteration to the action plan if they feel that that is
appropriate. Not following the action plan is not a sanctionable
offence and the action plan cannot specify a course of activity in
relation to work-related activity. The amendments advocated by the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey are therefore
unnecessary. Equally, it would not be appropriate in a conversation
between two individuals to place a requirement on another external
organisation&#151;that is, an employer&#151;that we do not even
expect one of the parties to the conversation to fulfil as part of the
action plan.</div><a name="06102671000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
general reassurance about the nature of an action plan, I hope that
hon. Members will be encouraged to reflect, not to press the amendments
and to consider the importance of subsequent amendments on
conversations under clause
13.</div><a name="06102671000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000405"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> This short debate has been useful, not least
because of the opportunity to put on the record the importance that the
Government attach to working with employers. I think everyone in the
Committee attaches critical importance to that. There was almost
nothing in the Green Paper about that, so it is good that the
Minister&#146;s comments have provided more information on the record
than was in the Green Paper. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06102671000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000406"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in
clause 13, page 12, line 10, at
end insert</div> <a name="06102671000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including,
in particular, circumstances where work-related activity cannot be
accessed by him for a reason related to his physical or mental
condition and circumstances where work-related activity is judged by a
health care professional approved by the Secretary of State to be
having a detrimental effect upon his physical or mental
condition.&#146;.</div> <a name="06102671000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not need to detain the Committee for very long. Briefly, the purpose
of the amendment is to reassure a number of external disability
organisations that it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 292</div>be possible to review and change action plans in a couple of specific
situations, the first being when the provision that is laid out for a
disabled person in an action plan is not accessible. There are concerns
that blind and partially sighted people, in particular, do not receive
adequate support in a number of employment programmes. Because of the
benefits sanction that sits behind the action plan, it is important
that such people should not be penalised where the provision is not
accessible.</div> <a name="06102671000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are also concerns that it should be possible to change an action
plan if it is any way detrimental to the health, impairment or
disability of the person concerned. I am sure that it is possible to do
that, but the issue is a concern to a number of people. Part of those
concerns is legitimately created by the fact that some provision has
not always been adequate in some of the employment programmes that have
existed under the pilots. It would be most welcome if the Minister
could reassure the Committee on that
point.</div><a name="06102671000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000407"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> May I start by repeating what I said in my earlier
contribution? It is important to avoid confusion and others not
understanding the full implications of what we say in this Committee. I
confirmed earlier that the action plan will not attract a sanction, and
the hon. Gentleman repeated that that was a
concern.</div><a name="06102671000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000408"></a>Mr.
Hunt</b> <i class="I">indicated assent.</i></div>
<a name="06102671000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000409"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I see him nodding so he accepts what I say. On the
basis that action plans do not attract a sanction, I hope that the
concerns that outside organisations have expressed about the nature and
role of action plans, and about the relationship between action plans
and any sanction in an appeals regime is reduced. The action plan is a
route map. It sets out a type of activity that a customer could be
expected to undertake. It will not compel anyone to undertake any
specific activity, and as we roll out work-related activity, we will
take the power in subsection (4) to set out</div>
<a name="06102671000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the circumstances in which
reconsideration may be requested&#148;.</div>
<a name="06102671000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall, of course, consult on the
regulations before we bring them before the House. With those comments,
I encourage the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06102671000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102671000410"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassurance
on those points, particularly on where sanctions can and cannot be
applied. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
