<H4><center>Clause 93</center></H4>
<H4><center>Further provision about plans</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 487, in page 55, line 21, leave out `keep' and insert `review'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 488, in page 55, line 22, leave out `under review' and insert `each year'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We do not need to dwell on the amendment. In our previous sitting we discussed planning over five years and I raised the issue of cost. There is provision in the Bill for an annual review, and we tabled the amendment so that there is a debate about what changes occur annually and how that relates to overall planning over five years.
<P>
As Ministers know, authorities have elections. Some authorities are on the one-third system, others have annual elections. Let us say that a rigid five-year framework for a plan is set; an election then takes place in the second year of the plan and a party with a different agenda takes over the council. Is that party stuck with a local transport plan that it cannot change?
<P>
There is an issue of democratic accountability involved. How prescriptive are the plans? What latitude is there for change? If an authority that were anti-car—that is hard to believe, but let us suppose it—constructs a local transport plan on that basis and another authority of a different political complexion decides that it has different priorities, that are at variance with national priorities, what latitude would the democratic process have to amend or change plans in those circumstances? That is what we want to tease out in the debate.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I begin by extending, on behalf of Government Members, our heartiest congratulations to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) who, I am happy to report, was married yesterday. [Hon. Members: ``What is he doing here?''] That is a good question and one that crossed the mind of most of us. It is an outstanding tribute to the hon. Gentleman's commitment to the parliamentary process that he is here today. We are all delighted to see him, delighted for him and heartily wish him every happiness for the future.
<P>
On a more mundane note, I turn to the amendment. It provides that plans should be reviewed each year. Under subsection (1), plans need to be kept under review. In response to the important question asked by the hon. Member for Poole about democratic accountability, the Bill provides for that sort of reassessment to be carried out within the individual local transport plan. If there were a change of political direction at local level, requiring a radical reassessment of the plan, there is scope to allow that. Having said that, we place great emphasis in the legislation, and in the guidance that we have circulated on provisional plans and that we shall circulate on local transport plans, on consultation, participation and consensus. That is the spirit in which we hope the plans will be developed.
<P>
Our approach places much greater emphasis on authorities developing robust monitoring of performance indicators and setting appropriate targets, so that we can measure progress. We expect to see that in the annual progress reports produced by local authorities.
<P>
Local transport plans are five-year plans. In July, authorities will submit plans that cover the financial years from 2001–02 to 2005–06, and on that basis we will allocate resources for 2001–02 and give an idea of how much authorities can expect for the rest of the plan period. Greater certainty about future funding for local authorities and, in turn, for their local partners, is a key benefit of the new system.
<P>
Authorities will need to produce annual progress reports setting out how previous financial allocations have been spent and reporting on progress on performance indicators. That will allow authorities to consider the need for a more fundamental review of the plan and to instigate a review, if necessary, so our proposals provide some insurance. If a plan is delivering, it does not make sense for authorities to go through the motions of a formal review. Nevertheless, they should keep their plans under review. The amendment would place an unnecessary and unhelpful restriction on the review process, but I emphasise that the possibility of review and re-„assessment, if it is required locally, is implicit in our proposals. It is best to retain the general requirement for plans to be kept under review, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 417, in page 55. line 22, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and alter it if they consider it appropriate to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 418, 419 and 437.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> These are technical amendments to clarify the provisions relating to the alteration and replacement of local transport plans.
<P>
Amendment No. 417 requires that authorities must alter their plans if it is appropriate to do so, as well as keep them under review. Amendment No. 418 removes the restriction that plan alterations may take effect only on 1 April in any year. On reflection, we see no need for the restriction, which could create unhelpful delay in the implementation of new policies. Amendment No. 437 is a consequential change, removing the restriction that local transport plan provisions can come into force only on 1 April in any year. Amendment No. 419 reflects the fact that alteration of plans is likely to happen before their replacement.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 418, in page 55, line 23, leave out subsections (2) and (3) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) The authority must replace the plan not later than five years after the date on which it was made.'.—[Mr. Hill.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 382, in page 55, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The plan must demonstrate the steps a local transport authority will take, year by year during the five year duration of the plan, to achieve greater integration of the transport facilities and services to, from and within its area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have stressed how important it is that transport plans be integrated. The amendment would require local authorities to demonstrate the steps that they will take, year by year, during the five-year period that the plan covers,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to achieve greater integration of the transport facilities and services to, from and within'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
their regions. The wording and purpose of the amendment is so clear that I need say no more than those few words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The matter may seem clear to the hon. Gentleman. However, as Professor Joad might have said, everything depends on what is meant by steps.
<P>
Amendment No. 382 would require authorities to identify in their local transport plan the steps that they would take in each year of the five-year plan to achieve greater integration of transport facilities and services. In that context, what is a step? How broad or specific would each step be? If they are specific, the amendment is at odds with the general desire to avoid micro-management.
<P>
Some authorities may wish to establish milestones in their plan. However, there is a danger that requiring them to set out specific proposals to be implemented in each year of the plan will constrain the effective long-term implementation of their strategy.
<P>
I agree that the local transport plan should provide a clear indication of the broad strategy that an authority proposes to follow in any particular policy area. However, implementation must be flexible and authorities must be able to adjust the programme in the light of progress and in response to new opportunities. Indeed, the amendment appears to be at odds with subsection (1) which, as I said earlier, requires the plan to be kept under review.
<P>
Ultimately, what matters is not the measures being implemented, but an authority delivering its local transport plan objectives. Our approach to local transport plans places much greater emphasis on authorities developing robust monitoring performance indicators and setting appropriate targets so that we can measure progress on objectives. That is set out in existing guidance on local transport plans and would be covered in any future guidance issued under clause 93(6), as would the appropriate level of detail to be included. The amendment is therefore unnecessary and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary is usually more generous than he has been this morning. I should therefore like to comment on his response.
<P>
The Under-Secretary spoke about authorities wanting to have mileposts for their internal assessment procedures in order to monitor the impact and success of their plans. I very much hope that, within reason, local authorities will undertake such action. However, it is rather odd to hear that advocated by a Minister in a Government who have laid so much emphasis on targets. The Labour party gave everyone a pledge card with five targets at the election, and last year they produced an annual report with 600 targets.
<P>
My analysis shows that the Government currently have more than 6,000 targets, although they are not sure what many of those are. Indeed, one of the Under-Secretary's colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions recently announced that details of targets set between central and local government are not held centrally. The Government do not even keep copies of the targets that they require local government to establish, so they can hardly be monitoring them.
<P>
More importantly, I was disappointed that the Under-Secretary did not use the amendment as a peg on which to hang comments about integration. In our wide-ranging debate on clause 92, we discussed how local authority plans would be assessed. Reference was made to assessment of 28 different plans. If the plans are designed to ensure an integrated transport plan, it is not unreasonable to expect the assessment procedure to dwell on integration. Will the Under-Secretary explain how the Department will assess whether different modes of transport in local transport plans are integrated?
<P>
We have moved the amendment because of the absence of any clear reference to integration. We do not expect the Minister to accept it, but we are giving him an opportunity to say how important integration is to the Government, how it will be a central feature of local transport plans and how it will be assessed and monitored regularly, rather than once every five years. The Under-Secretary has not even tried to intervene and is now reading his notes. Fortunately, he has now caught my eye, so perhaps he will respond.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Even if I appear to be momentarily distracted while the hon. Gentleman is speaking, I can assure him that his discourse is so riveting that the major part of my attention is always directed towards him. The issue of integration is important, and I welcome the opportunity to say something about it.
<P>
Integration means much more than merely ensuring that bus and train services complement each other, although that is extremely important: it means integrating thinking and action across all policy areas and at all levels of decision making. It means making sure that transport policies are working with, not against, policies on health, education and economic growth. It means making sure that local and regional policies are in step with national policies and vice versa. It means making sure that the public and private sectors are working with, not against, each other. Integration is a philosophy that should inform every level of the development of local transport plans by local transport authorities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of mileposts. He is absolutely right to say that the Government are committed to the setting of targets, but we do not want to create a straitjacket for local authorities by laying down the way in which they monitor and report on the progress of their local transport plans. It is for the local authority to decide whether to establish annual milestones of the sort described by the hon. Gentleman. Local authorities will report to the Government on expenditure of resources each year, and we expect that robust performance indicators and appropriate local targets will be set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I sense that the hon. Gentleman is about to conclude. He is right to say that integration means much more than the integration of bus and rail, and I am sure that he would have added dial-a-ride and taxis to the list. He is also right to say that it is important to have integration in local plans. The Minister will acknowledge that that is covered by table 24 of the assessment procedure. He says, rightly, that there must be indicators—that is covered by table 4. Will the Minister tell me where integration between different modes of transport is covered in the assessment procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall be delighted to do so. The assessment of integration in the plans will be based primarily on the level of policy integration. We will leave the authorities to work out the details of how they deliver integration on the ground. Progress will be reported annually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister is still missing the point. I will not press too hard on that, as the Committee is anxious to make progress. The Minister has rightly acknowledged that the integration of different modes of transport is one element of the wider concept of integration. I may have got this wrong, in which case I am giving the Minister the opportunity to tell me so, but my analysis of the assessment procedure is that the issue of integration of different modes of transport is currently missing from the procedure. I find that hard to believe, and I suspect that I have got it wrong, but it would have been great if the Minister had told us that I had got it wrong and how I got it wrong. However, there will be an opportunity to discuss the issue in more detail.
<P>
The Minister said earlier that he might have been slightly distracted during my remarks. I am sure that that was partly because he was still having difficulty coming to terms with his earlier comments about the hon. Member for Poole. Liberal Democrat Members are delighted about the marriage yesterday and we are amazed that the hon. Gentleman is here today. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 490, in page 55, line 38, leave out from second `at' to end of line 39 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`public libraries within the area of the authority;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment is a little pedantic, in that it would insert ``public libraries'', but its real aim is to enable a little debate on public access to information. The Government's overall approach makes clear the importance that they attach to local transport plans and that the plans are a critical element in the planning of our national and local transport systems. Therefore, we must explore how local authorities will allow members of the public to have access, at reasonable cost, to the plans so that they can see what their local authorities and, indeed, the Government have in mind for local communities. The amendment is intended to secure an assurance that, through this part of the Bill, pressure will be put on local authorities to ensure that that is done properly.
<P>
Subsection (5) states that local transport authorities must ensure that plans are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``made available for inspection . . . at such places as they think fit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some authorities are very open, but others are less so. We want some reassurance from the Minister that such important documents will be available for the widest possible public scrutiny. As we all know, to many local authorities—particularly those that cover large geographical areas—the phrase ``as they think fit'' may mean having copies of the local transport plan in their headquarters, which may be 15, 20 or 25 miles away from some of the people who have a great interest in it. Therefore, our amendment says that plans should be available in public libraries, because most reasonably sized communities have one. Will the Minister reassure us that the documents will be available to the public?
<P>
The clause also says that local people can obtain a copy of the plan for the cost of providing it. I have seen some local transport plans and that cost is substantial. Some of the larger companies across the country might find it easy to comply, but for many parish councils and many other organisations, the cost could be substantial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I add my congratulations to your post-nuptial celebrations—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. After 21 years of marriage, mine are still continuing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I am most grateful for that correction. I am sure that every day is happy in the Gale household.
<P>
As regards public libraries, rural areas and vast geographical distances are a key point. In my area, the access point for a public library is often a mobile public library. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that facilities be available in mobile public libraries? With the development of IT, would the internet not be a more appropriate place for such information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. We can explore different ways of ensuring that people obtain the details of local transport plans. Putting plans on the internet would be one way of doing that. I know that many libraries see themselves as providers of not only books, but information. It would not be difficult for people to use computer terminals in libraries to find a section of the plan and print it. That might be a much better way of providing information than hard copy.
<P>
Having grown up in a rural area, I know that rural mobile library services are valuable. At the beginning of the five years, it might be appropriate for rural people to go and have a quick look at how the plan would affect their communities; it could be displayed in the vehicle. Not everybody has access to the internet.
<P>
The principal purpose of our amendment is to ensure that, given the importance of the plans and the priority that the Government give them, all the many organisations concerned, including all the local authorities down the tiers to parish councils, and people in general, have access to what goes on. It would also ensure that local authorities that sign up for their local transport plans, and the Government, actually stick to them. Some of the biggest criticisms that I hear at local level are about planning; people bring in the structure plan or local plan and say, ``This has been given permission even though it is totally against the policy agreed by the authority.'' We all know that planning applications are granted on their merits, but sometimes they cause as much frustration as anything else.
<P>
Wide publicity for the priorities of local authorities is important, but it is also important that local communities feel that they can have an input. Unless they know what the priorities in a particular area are, they cannot have a dialogue or debate about them. Sometimes those sitting in offices in local authorities are not in tune with every aspect and corner of their local authority area.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> May I add my congratulations to the hon. Gentleman, who has added a further dimension to his extraordinary dedication to service in the House. Not only is he here today, but he was on the Front Bench until almost one o'clock in the morning on the eve of his wedding, when many other people might have been indulging in the traditional stag night activities. That is extraordinary dedication to duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Has my hon. Friend any information about what Mrs. Syms thinks about those activities? Is she with her solicitor now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sure that she is not. I am sure—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am certain that the Minister's ingenuity will allow him to keep his remarks strictly in order in the context of the amendment that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I was about to say that I am sure that the wife of the hon. Member for Poole has shown nothing but admiration for his dedication to public service, as well as his performance as a husband.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman rightly raised the important issue of how local authorities should publicise and make available information about local transport plans. He has tabled an amendment with the obvious purpose of ensuring that local libraries are used as a source of communication. We have a great deal of sympathy with the purpose of his amendment, but I hope that he will accept that it is unnecessary. The problem of specifying in legislation a particular outlet for publicising new local transport plans is that the outlet might not be appropriate in every area. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) highlighted the problem of rural areas, where libraries may not be the most accessible place for information to be made available, even if there is a good mobile library service.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that many mobile libraries do not have an extensive reference section, and that the hon. Gentleman's proposal might cause a lot of additional expense to library services around the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is a valid point too. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the Government have already given thought to the matter and have covered it in the guidance. Paragraph 213 says clearly that local transport plans should be readily available
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at libraries and other locations which are open to the public outside of normal working hours. In choosing venues, local authorities should ensure, as far as possible, that they are accessible to disabled people. Authorities will need to consider how LTPs can be made available in rural areas where public institutions such as libraries are uncommon.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is well covered. I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will recognise that the matter is adequately provided for in guidance, and that his amendment, although entirely understandable, is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It has been a short but useful debate. I thank hon. Members for their congratulations. I took the precaution of marrying a House of Commons secretary who fully understands that we sometimes work slightly later than the average person and is therefore very understanding—I hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): I do not understand the use of the word ``slightly''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 56, line 1, leave out subsection(6).
<P>
Subsection (6) is important; amendment No. 17 would delete subsection (6), and has been tabled to allow discussion about it: One of the themes in our consideration of the clause has been the prescriptive nature of local transport plans. We believe that they should be less prescriptive. That is why we have tabled an amendment to delete subsection (6), which details how plans should be formulated.
<P>
I thank the Minister for Housing and Planning for the information that he supplied this morning. I am glad that, as we have progressed in our consideration of the Bill, the Government have seen fit to provide the Committee with background information, which is useful for the debate and helpful in considering Opposition amendments.
<P>
The guidance is substantial. To return to another theme that has run through our proceedings, we are worried that substantial guidance will result in large local plans that cover a vast area, and we wonder whether the plans need to be quite so all-encompassing. Sometimes, the thicker, bigger and glossier documents are, the less meaningful they become. In a former life I served on Wessex regional health authority, and I have never seen such large planning documents as the national health service produces. At that stage, I lived in Wiltshire. I had a letter box and a cat flap, and I always knew when I had received something from Wessex regional health authority, because it came through the cat flap. My cat has not been the same since.
<P>
We must be extremely careful not to produce plans that are too detailed and large, not only because they are difficult for the public to comprehend, but because achievements are difficult to measure, because so many flow charts and so on are involved. Short, simple, plain documents sometimes deliver a stronger message, and make it much easier to measure performance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): First, I offer my warmest congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Poole and point out his extraordinary dedication to his work. He was here last night and is here again this morning, working almost unaided, as two Back Benchers toiled away and he forged ahead.
<P>
I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 17, with reference to my own experience in helping my local council to formulate a local transport plan that was relevant to the area. Such was the impression that Government guidelines had made on the officials involved that the first draft was not relevant to the problems of a disparate rural area that includes 98 villages and in which two thirds of people drive to work. The officials tied themselves in knots trying to make their transport plans conform to the strict guidelines that they had received.
<P>
I have not had time to wade through the impressive photocopied document containing the guidelines, as I received it only 10 minutes ago. However, my fears are not assuaged by the fact that regional offices sited mainly in big conurbations will interpret a lot of the guidance. Shropshire is the country cousin of the west midlands, and those who come through the Birmingham civil service hierarchy make the big decisions. With the deepest respect to them, they do not really understand the problems of rural areas. My discussions with them about a bypass project highlighted the difficulties of trying to impose from the centre one criterion to fit all.
<P>
That goes the other way. The local press has announced that a Labour authority near my constituency will not impose workplace car park charging for seven years, as it does not think it appropriate to its town. That shows the sense of the amendment. If we must have transport plans, the local authorities should be left to tailor them to local needs. They should not be crafted and moulded to central diktats imposed by people who have the best intentions, but probably have a prejudice against the car and fixed ideas about reducing congestion that are born of experience of urban, rather than rural, areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> In the spirit of conviviality, I too would like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Poole. I had not realised that he had taken a short time off yesterday to undertake the necessary formalities to re-enter matrimony. As we know, marriage is an honourable estate.
<P>
Like my hon. Friends, I am concerned about the clause. I was going to ask the Minister to be more precise about the nature of the guidance, but that was before I opened the brown envelope. I was infinitely disappointed that it did not contain what brown envelopes are supposed to these days, and that it contained the guidance instead. I am sure that the Minister accepts that the length of the documentation is horrifying. Obviously, I have not had to time to read it. It is not only extensive, but highly prescriptive.
<P>
It will be a problem for local authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire said as we opened our envelopes, ``Who's going to read this?'' The local authorities will have to read and respond to it. I understand that Ministers want an integrated system and that, to have consistency in national policy, it is necessary to ensure that that is reflected at the county council or district council level of operation. Nevertheless, we are paying a big price for that policy in terms of the bureaucracy that it creates. I am not in a position today to discuss the concerns that I suspect that local authorities such as my county council in Hampshire will have about the documents, so I hope that we can return to them before Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The people who drew up the criteria will read the documents. If a rural area's transport plan does not conform to preconceived ideas of what such plans should look like, there is a danger that it will not qualify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Many people have clear ideas of what they want to happen in their localities, but strict directions from the centre will be imposed on them. That is a recipe for resentment and it makes a mockery of the idea that the Government want to devolve powers, especially as a prescriptive document will be landed on people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should turn to page 6 of the guidance on cycling and compare the amount of prescriptive detail with our extensive discussions during the previous sitting. Local transport is multi-faceted and the document provides a framework for local authorities. In my view as a former local authority leader, the document is not over-prescriptive and provides useful guidelines. The hon. Gentleman's points are poorly made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> During that intervention, I turned to page 6 and discovered that the paragraph 29 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Provision for cycling should be of good quality, to both attract and retain users.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is motherhood and apple pie—it is obvious.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am aware that that document has been delivered to Members this morning and, therefore, the great temptation is to debate it at length, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman that it has been provided for information and is not part of the Bill. We are debating amendment No. 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Indeed, Mr. Gale. I am grateful to you for your guidance, but subsection (6) would be deleted under the amendment, which would make the document redundant. As you have said, we have not had time to consider the document.
<P>
The document, which was issued by the then Minister of Transport, who is now the Secretary of State for Scotland, states that the guidance
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``means making sure that local and regional policies are in step with national policies and vice versa''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Government should explain how they expect the guidelines to filter down to local authorities and information to come back.
<P>
The document also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We shall no longer earmark money for specific projects, but give local authorities the freedom to decide how it would be most effectively spent to meet their objectives. We will allocate funding on the strength of the strategy. And we will judge success by performance against targets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all very laudable, given that it represents an attempt to devolve decision making to local authorities, but the public and councils need to have some idea about how they are likely to qualify. Under the current arrangements, if people want a bypass to be built in their area, the local transport authority puts the proposal to the Government and it competes against other clearly defined projects. However, we are talking about strategies and it is much more difficult to assess the value of strategies as opposed to evaluating and comparing specific projects.
<P>
The document is prescriptive. It will impose specific obligations on local authorities. It will mean more work and expense. It does allow consultation, which is, as we all know, a good thing. Nevertheless, as with so many transport planning issues, most notably terminal 5 at Heathrow, there comes a time when consultation has to end and decisions have to be taken. I do not believe that we improve the quality of decision making by dragging it out. In the planning system, proper discussion, consultation and a limited timetable are needed to assess the arguments and reach a decision.
<P>
For example, in 1985 we were promised that the Birmingham northern relief road would be delayed by only six months as a result of it becoming a private sector proposal. To this day, not a sod has been turned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I was told that 15 years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Minister says, ``We deliver.'' The Prime Minister was trying to say the same thing on the Floor of the House yesterday, but it was all cast in the future and not the present.
<P>
I fear that the document is not so much a blueprint for action as a recipe for paralysis. Will the Minister explain how the proposition set out in subsection (6) will work? Can he convince us that it will be a practical solution that will enable local authorities to deliver the integrated transport policy that the Government seek, without dragging out the process for months, if not for years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment would delete subsection (6), which requires local authorities when carrying out their function to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. In questioning the need for guidance, Opposition Members have highlighted the dilemma faced by any Government needing to ensure a comprehensive and consistent framework for decision-making without being unreasonably restrictive.
<P>
In the previous group of amendments that we discussed, the Opposition proposed to include in the Bill an obligation to consult via libraries. Opposition Members withdrew the amendment after the discussion, having accepted that that matter was probably better handled in guidance. The dilemma is that if we did not issue guidance, the Bill would have to include more measures to ensure a consistent framework for local decision making. Not many of us would consider it an improvement if the Bill were substantially enlarged to include items of that sort.
<P>
Guidance is the right way to go, but it is not intended to be unduly prescriptive about the policies that local authorities should put in place. It is there to guide them on the issues that they have to consider and to ensure that they go through the correct processes, including consultation. There is considerable latitude for authorities to develop policies. We shall discuss congestion and workplace charging—when those are raised by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)—on which authorities will have discretion. That is right. Some will choose to go one way and others another, but in doing so they should have regard to the general issues that are of concern in all areas. That is the purpose of guidance and it strikes the right balance between creating a framework that will enable sensible local decision-making and avoiding the problem that the hon. Member for Poole highlighted of some local decisions being not as consistent or well informed as they should be. He mentioned a planning case, but it can happen with other issues.
<P>
The guidance has not been sprung on local authorities. It was issued in April last year. I realise that it has only just been given to members of the Committee, for which I apologise. That was in response to a request at the last sitting and, as hon. Members will appreciate, it has involved a good deal of photocopying to circulate a document of this size. Local authorities have had the document for 10 months and have had plenty of opportunity to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for imparting that information to the Committee and I am sure that we are grateful to the people who have beavered away to produce the document. Given that local authorities have had it for some time, what sort of feedback has the Minister received to date?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The feedback has been very positive. Local authorities have generally warmly welcomed the guidance and they have been using it to prepare their transport bids for the current year. That is part of the ongoing process. The guidance will inform local authority policy-making, which will in turn help local authorities to frame bids for resource allocation, which we hope will in turn lead to satisfactory consequences on the ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I mentioned the shift away from funding being allocated on the basis of projects submitted by local authorities, and in favour of strategies. The Minister said that the local authorities had welcomed the proposals. Are they finding it relatively easy to work up their strategies? Have they made any representations to express concern that it might not be possible for them to have proper account taken of projects that they are anxious to have funded for the benefit of their local communities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I will take further advice on this matter because I am not fully conversant with it, but to the best of my knowledge the response has been generally very favourable. Local authorities have welcomed guidance on the criteria to be used in assessing applications. One of the purposes of guidance is simply to create a better climate of information about the way in which bids will be assessed—it is not intended to be unduly prescriptive or to insist that only certain bids will be considered favourably, but to give a clear indication of the issues that need to be taken on board and addressed and how local authorities should approach their responsibilities.
<P>
I will satisfy myself that there have been no particularly negative or hostile responses from local authorities and write to the hon. Gentleman if there have been any.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I wish simply to reinforce my hon. Friend's point. On page 3, in the table of contents, integrated transport, which the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) mentioned is extensively covered. The guidance enables us to have a shorter Transport Bill and proper guidance for local authorities—on such things as cycling, integrated transport and so on—and it would be outrageous to have it deleted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that further clarification of one of the merits of the system. In conclusion, the issuing of guidance is a pretty standard procedure as part of legislation. I shall not pray in aid the familiar Railways Act 1993, which has been discussed time and again in the Committee and in which there was, of course, a comparable provision. The clearest parallel is probably that of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which set in place the framework for all planning policy guidance. It provides an exactly analogous framework for the issues to which local authorities must have regard when framing planning policy. There are thus strong precedents, which means that it is the right way to go forward. We believe that the guidance will be helpful to local authorities and I hope that the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Again, this has been a useful debate. Our difficulty is that some authorities are good at producing plans but not necessarily at delivering decent transport. One does not necessarily follow from the other, which is why the guidance contains some means to measure performance. As we in politics all know, even when we start off with a guidance document this big—80 to 100 pages—the temptation is to add to it rather than subtract from it. There may be a new private Member's Bill, or something may become a hot political topic and the temptation is to put everything is in the guidance. Someone may then come along with, say, a strategy on hang gliders, and that goes into the document, too.
<P>
If we are not careful, matters will get worse rather than better. In future, guidance documents must be smaller and less prescriptive. Generally, local government officers love to be told what the Government expect of them. If a vacuum is left, however, that will cause difficulty and doubt, if anything, might lead to more nebulous plans being produced because local government officers would be trying to second-guess Ministers.
<P>
I accept the logic when setting up a new system of having a template along the lines of, ``This how we should like it to be done.'' However, when people start to produce the plans, certain information should be taken out of the guidance rather than added to it. I fear that, in five or 10 years, the size of guidance notes will be so large that they themselves will make a great deal of work for local authorities. The biggest cost involved in setting a strategy is the first plan, but once it is set up, it has only to be repeated. Amendments will be made to it, but every five years the basic structure will be repeated. Costs will be high to start off with, after which the process will become easier.
<P>
The document in front of us will require a lot of reading. I hope that the Government do not overdo it and issue too much guidance to local authorities in the future. I accept that there is a shortage of transport engineers to do useful tasks other than drawing up plans, but we must be careful not to construct a system whereby we have the most wonderful plans in Europe, but our buses do not run on time and people have difficulty accessing local transport services. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I can inform the Committee that I am not on performance-related pay in respect of the number of amendments tabled.
<P>
Clause 94 deals with bus strategies. I am sure that all members of the Committee want to improve the provision of bus services, which are so important to our communities. The Bill requires local transport authorities to develop, as part of their local transport plans and after consultation in accordance with clause 94, policies on how best to carry out their various functions to secure the provision of appropriate bus services in their areas. In formulating those policies, they must have particular regard to the needs of the elderly and people with mobility problems. Such functions are contained in the Transport Act 1968 and the Transport Act 1985, as amended by the Bill.
<P>
The amendments would change the wording of the Bill by adding ``local'' or ``local bus services''. ``Bus service'' and ``local service'' are defined under the 1985 Act. Clause 94 on page 56 of the Bill gives a different definition of a bus service without withdrawing the definition in the 1985 Act, we have tabled amendments to rectify that. Thus, we now have a third definition of a local bus service. However, all three definitions say essentially the same. The amendments are necessary to clarify the meaning of bus service, now redefined by them as local bus service.
<P>
We are trying to improve the Bill's drafting and I would be interested to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say about our carefully crafted amendments.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks and I congratulate him on his assiduousness in tabling these detailed amendments. Despite the length of this group, however, I need not detain the Committee long because, for the most part, they are entirely unnecessary.
<P>
Most of the provisions of part II of the Bill are already drafted so as to apply to local services. For example, clause 96(1)(a), which relates to quality partnership schemes, refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the quality of local services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, clause 104(3) on quality contracts schemes refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what local services should be provided''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and clause 115 on ticketing talks about a journey on ``particular local services''.
<P>
The Bill already defines local services in clause 138(3) by reference to the definition in the 1985 Act, which says that a local service is one that uses public service vehicles to carry passengers at separate fares and does not run for more than 15 miles without picking up or setting down passengers. That is the same definition as amendment No. 570 would add. Thus, the amendments are all unnecessary.
<P>
I beg to differ with the thrust of the amendments on one significant matter. The hon. Member for Poole would limit the application of clause 94—on bus strategies—to local services, but the Bill deliberately goes wider at that point. We can discuss the reasons for that more fully under subsequent amendments, but I can tell the Committee that we want the bus strategy to have a broader canvas and to encapsulate all services using public service vehicles, including for example long-distance coaches or excursions and tours. Such services may well impact on other bus services in the area—I am sure the hon. Member for Bath is girding his loins to tell us about that at some length. It seems reasonable, therefore, to expect a local authority to take that wider view when drawing up its broad strategy.
<P>
I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for Poole to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his response. As we all know, inter-urban transport is very important. Many buses and coaches run up and down motorways providing important services at good prices. In the light of the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 492, in page 56, line 16, after `persons', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who live, work or travel'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 493, in page 56, line 19, after `the', insert `quality'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The amendment would broaden the definition of the clause. It is important for local plans to take into account those who travel through a given area and those who work there, rather than just the people who reside there. As we heard, a passenger transport authority sometimes caters for many people who come into it from outside. If transport and bus strategies are to mean anything, they must take into account—because of the impact on the transport system—not just local opinion, but flows of traffic through particular areas. Bus strategies must represent quality and a decent level of service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend, who makes such an important point about amendment No. 492, although I am not so fussed about amendment No. 493. The clause should be more explicit. Having argued that the guidelines were too prescriptive, we must make it clear here that local authorities should be required to meet the needs of the wide range of people whom they serve—not just those on the voting register of a locality, but those who work there or travel through it. I therefore support my hon. Friend on amendment No. 492.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendment would make explicit the fact that bus services secured under the bus strategy should meet the needs of persons who ``live, work or travel'' within the authority's area. The amendment is unnecessary because bus strategies are an integral part of local transport plans, as dealt with under subsection (2). The inclusion of ``quality'', under amendment No. 493, to the provision on bus services is also unnecessary and confusing.
<P>
Clause 94 requires each local transport authority to prepare a bus strategy. That strategy—and I stress the point—is about how each authority should carry out its functions, which are the authority's powers and duties as set out in this Bill and other legislation. The clause requires the local authority to make a judgment about bus services meeting local transport requirements, about the standards of those services and about additional facilities and services.
<P>
Local authority functions cover a wide range: subsidies, quality partnerships, quality contracts, ticketing, information and concessionary fares. So there are many different powers and duties for the local transport authority to think about in preparing their strategy.
<P>
Clause 94(1) simply provides for the way in which the local authority should think about them. The three items (a), (b) and (c)—requirement, standards and additional facilities and services—are perfectly sensible and, for the legislation to work well, local authorities would not be helped by having to ask themselves not what is and what is not quality, but something else unspecified.
<P>
All will depend on the nature of each function. The Bill will not be improved by adding extra words to complicate the clause, leaving local authorities to puzzle over it. In the light of those remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. As we are the friend of local government and do not want to be too prescriptive, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Committee has by now accepted that a number of issues must be taken into account when drawing up local transport plans. Later on, we shall discuss quality partnerships, in which a number of different issues have to be taken into account, as the Government have accepted. Clause 122, for example, adds to section 7 of the Transport Act 1985 an extra reason that traffic commissioners may use to determine whether or not to accept a particular service. Quite rightly in my view, the Government propose to add a reference to the limitation of noise and air pollution. Part of the effect of the group of amendments, would be to ensure that reference is made to the limitation of noise pollution and air pollution in both the development of quality partnerships and a local authority's own transport plan.
<P>
In that regard, those two aims are consistent with the Government's own objectives. A third issue contained within the amendments is that of civic amenity. It is a reference to the damage that the various measures proposed in a transport plan or, later, in a quality partnership might cause to, for example, the fabric of an historic town or city. That is also entirely consistent with the principles that the Government have laid down within the Bill.
<P>
Another issue is raised that is also consistent with the Government's objectives. Nothing that is introduced through the transport plan or through a quality partnership should add to the problem of congestion. Indeed, that is already referred to specifically in the 1985 Act, which is referred to in clause 122 and is presumably accepted by the Government. Section 7(4) of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No traffic commissioner shall determine traffic regulation conditions unless he is satisfied . . . that such regulations are required . . . to reduce severe traffic congestion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All the issues that are referred to in the amendments are already touched on in existing legislation or in the Bill. My argument is that they need to be referred to specifically in local transport plans and in the development of quality partnerships. Therefore, knowing that I am working entirely with the grain of the Government on this matter, I raise two issues on which I should like to know the Minister's opinion.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The first is noise pollution, which existing legislation tackles. The Committee may not be aware, however, that that noise pollution relates only to static noise—noise emanating, for instance, from a loud party late at night, which is a problem we have all had to deal with. Existing legislation does not appear to apply to moving noise, of which I give two examples: one is the noise pollution that comes from a passing car with windows down and the CD player blaring out; the second example is tour buses, from which noise pollution is caused by loud commentaries. Will the Minister tell us what plans his Department has to address the issue of noise from vehicles—whether the ghetto blaster in a car or the loud commentary from an open-top bus?
<P>
The second issue on which I want the Minister to respond is that of pollution from vehicles. He will be aware of my concern about pollution from buses, particularly tour buses, but others as well. All of those vehicles are eligible for the fuel duty rebate. The Commission for Integrated Transport is conducting a review on the future of that rebate. Although we do not yet have its final report, will the Minister say whether the Department is minded to link fuel duty rebate—I accept that this is a complex issue—to the quality of emissions from the vehicles? The Commission for Integrated Transport is considering that.
<P>
The amendments are in the spirit of the Government's proposals, but they need to be accepted to tighten up aspects of the local transport plan and the quality partnership to ensure that specific reference is made to issues such as noise pollution, air pollution, congestion, potential damage to historic buildings and damage to civic amenity. They provide an opportunity for the Minister to inform the Committee of his thinking.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> It was only at the very last minute that the hon. Member for Bath made reference to the substance of amendment No. 461. I suspect that the lead amendment could be called the Bath Focus newsletter, edition No. 4,329(a) amendment. The hon. Member will no doubt be informing the genteel voters of Bath—whose support he will no doubt require next time around—that he vigorously fought the campaign in Committee to ensure that the ravages of bus pollution were not inflicted on the their wonderfully genteel and expensive houses in the lovely part of Bath that he has the honour to represent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for not giving way when he was discussing how many copies of the Bath Focus had gone out. The number that he gave is far too low and many more have been sent than he suggested. I welcome his comments about what is to be included in my newsletter. Indeed, I shall take them out of Hansard and use them verbatim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We are entirely accustomed to Liberal Democrats' plagiarism, so the hon. Gentleman's suggestion comes as no surprise. I am sure that the Bath electorate will note that my modest figure of 4,000-and-something was a huge understatement. The Liberal Democratic party will be held accountable for the destruction of many rainforests in the production of bumf that no one reads.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath should give a more explicit definition of historic areas. Would the definition be specific to Bath, or would it apply to other parts of the country?
<P>
Amendment No. 462 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the historic context of the authority's area''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and ``aesthetic amenity''. The hon. Gentleman gave clear examples of noise and air pollution, mentioning ghetto blasters and so on. However, ``aesthetic amenity'' needs to be defined more explicitly. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will say that the amendment is pretty vague. We must consider areas that are not as grand as Bath. We all have areas in our constituencies that are less grand than Bath, but where people are affected by pollution.
<P>
However, we all confront the problem of wanting to limit pollution and, at the same time, wanting to encourage people to use public transport. In the 1980s, public transport was in severe decline because people did not use it as services were too infrequent. If the local bus sector has enjoyed a resurgence, that is because there are smaller buses with a more frequent service, giving people the flexibility that they associate with the motor car. I do not see how that circle can be squared.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long. The amendment is interesting but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot made clear, problematic.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath made an interesting point about the fuel duty rebate, which is important to bus companies. Indeed, they always complain that buying a new bus may be good for environment but is bad in terms of miles per gallon and sometimes affects their profitability. It may be worth considering the hon. Gentleman's proposals on pollution and fuel debate rebate. However, sometimes the most profitable buses are the older ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall begin by acknowledging the excellent job that the hon. Member for Bath is doing for his constituents and for historic towns. He has certainly generated considerable publicity on the matter and Bath and similar cities have a powerful advocate in him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I hope that the Minister realises that he has just given powerful ammunition to the hon. Member for Bath for the latest Focus newsletter and that the Labour candidate in Bath may not be very pleased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me put it like this, I am conscious that it was not the Labour party that the hon. Member for Bath displaced in that historic result in 1992. To that extent, we know where the common enemy is to be discovered. Could this be a double whammy?
<P>
I have said all those nice things and there are more to come. I wish to resist the amendment, certainly not through lack of sympathy with the objective of conservation, but because the aims can be achieved by other, possibly more appropriate, means.
<P>
I will take the amendments in turn. Amendment No. 461 would require that local authorities should consider in drawing up their bus strategies additional bus-related facilities and should pay special attention to the protection of historic areas. Many authorities, Bath and North-East Somerset council doubtless prominent among them, may wish to do just that—though if I were to nit-pick I would wonder how directly that ties in with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``additional facilities connected with bus services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Drafting points apart, I stress to the hon. Gentleman that local authorities can already take account of special local circumstances in their local transport plans and bus strategies, and it is right that they should. It is not necessary to add all sorts of specifics, however worthy, to the deliberately general wording of the Bill. If we added every desirable objective to the Bill the list would be endless. There would then be doubts about whether other specific issues had been left out deliberately and were meant to be outside the provisions of the Bill when that was not the intention. I feel strongly that that uncertainty should be avoided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister understands that this is an important issue. May I put a hypothetical situation to him and ask him to tell me how, without reference to this in the legislation, a local authority could take action? Let us assume that four tour bus companies are operating in a historic city so many buses at an agreed frequency. A fifth bus company wishes to run an additional number of tours. The local authority has clear evidence that the additional traffic generated by those tours could damage, for example, historic vaults perhaps only a few feet under the road. Bearing in mind not least the Competition Act, which will come into force shortly, what action could the local authority take to prevent that additional company coming in?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I appreciate that this is a ``what if'' or hypothetical case. The answer is that there would be the right to revert to the traffic commissioners. It is an issue that I want to develop in my remarks and I know that the hon. Gentleman has a certain scepticism about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I am slightly confused. Surely other powers are available. Local authorities can apply weight restrictions or restrictions on the type of traffic that may travel along certain roads. Those are the powers that should be used, not powers to restrict competition between providers of public transport services. It would be a misuse of those powers if the aim is to protect the infrastructure or historic buildings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That must be the case. There are issues of public safety. If there is a danger of traffic plunging into the bowels of the earth as a result of such thin ceilings under roads giving way, wider public safety considerations could be invoked. I am assured that in circumstances such as those described by the hon. Gentleman, an appeal to the traffic commissioner is likely to deliver a faster result.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 462 would require local transport authorities to have regard when developing their bus strategy to the historic context of their area so as to limit environmental damage. Again, many authorities will be keen to do just that, but let us remember that the bus strategy itself forms part of the local transport plan and, in developing both plans and strategy, a local authority will of course want to have regard to the special needs of its area. There is nothing in the Bill to the contrary and again it is best to keep matters general, and thus flexible, for local responses to local circumstances.
<P>
On the two amendments that deal with quality partnerships, No. 462 adds reduction of rush hour congestion and protection of historic sites by vehicle weight limitation to the reasons for a quality partnership. However, the Bill already talks of benefits to bus users and pollution control, both of which would clearly cover easing of rush hour congestion. In addition, the guidance on local transport plans already has a section headed ``Action on air quality management'' at paragraphs 176 and 179, which mentions the Environment Act 1995 and the duty it places on local authorities to review and assess air quality. We have already talked about weight limitation and I suggest that a local authority can look to its existing general highways powers to protect historic buildings from vehicles of all sorts, including tour buses.
<P>
Amendment No. 468 perhaps does not readily tie in with the provision to which it relates. We are coming to an important debate on clause 96(5), but for now all I will say is that I do not see how a quality partnership could directly include requirements to preserve historic fabric. After all, the quality standards referred to are those of buses, rather than buildings.
<P>
I stress, more constructively, that bus policies can be about making buses more attractive to people who would otherwise use cars. Local authorities have traffic management powers to keep lorries or other sorts of traffic out of sensitive historic streets. If the hon. Member for Bath is worried about congestion or safety risks caused by buses, the traffic commissioner already has powers to impose traffic regulation conditions on bus operators if he is so required by the local authority. I was pleased to have the hon. Gentleman's welcome for the provisions in clause 122, which adds reduction or limitation of noise or air pollution to the reasons for invoking the powers of the traffic commissioner. Noise from loudspeaker systems in tour buses would certainly come under the definition of ``noise'' in this context. Noise is noise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am absolutely delighted by what has been said. That will bring great comfort to many people. He referred to clause 122 and the addition of noise and pollution. Will the traffic commissioners be able to use that new clause in relation to the number of vehicles? We could examine an individual vehicle and see that it gives out a certain amount of noise or air pollution—all vehicles do—but it is not always a question of the individual vehicle but of the number of vehicles passing a given point at a particular time. The issue is whether the traffic commissioners could limit the total number of buses, taxis or tour buses and so on. If they could, that would answer the point made by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin).

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about the cumulative effects of vehicles. My inclination is to say that the traffic commissioner would have the powers to deal with that.
<P>
Amendment No. 585 would further extend that power to cover protection of historic vaults and of historic sites, buildings or streets, but it would not be right to make those powers too extensive or too complicated. I know that the traffic commissioner whose area covers Bath would be ready to discuss these matters further with the hon. Member, so I extend that invitation again now. In the light of all the various options open to local authorities under the Bill and through other measures, I hope the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment. The hon. Gentleman also asked me to comment on two other items: the operation of tourist buses—which in historic cities such as Bath cause congestion and run empty—and fuel duty rebate. I recognise the hon. Gentleman's concern about tourist buses. I remind him of the powers that are already available. The local authority has powers to make traffic regulation orders to control vehicles of any class on local roads. It also has powers under the Bill to make bus quality partnerships, whereby pollution control standards, for example, can be imposed on bus operators in return for the use of facilities provided by the local authority. The traffic commissioner has powers to impose traffic regulation conditions, if asked to do so by a local authority, on grounds of danger or congestion. The traffic commissioners' powers will be enhanced under the Bill, so that traffic regulation orders can be made to reduce or limit noise or air pollution.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked if the Government were minded to link fuel duty rebate to the quality of emissions. We are awaiting the recommendations of the Commission for Integrated Transport. It may be possible to implement the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, but we cannot make a commitment on that at this stage. It may be a straw in the wind for me to remind the Committee that fuel duty rebate is already paid at a higher rate for gas fuel—100 per cent. on gas fuel and 70 per cent. on ordinary diesel.
<P>
Fuel duty rebate is paid only on certain conditions, to ensure that services are genuinely available for the general public. Those requirements include the following: at least half the seats must be available to the general public and the service must be regularly used by the general public; stops must be sited where they are likely to be used by the general public; fares must not be a deterrent; bus signs must not give the impression that the service is available only to particular categories of people; and information about the service must be available to the general public.
<P>
As I have told the hon. Gentleman, officials from my Department have responded—because we are a listening Government—to his concerns about the way in which tour buses operate in Bath. We carried out a check on them but discovered that, as far as our officials are concerned, those buses meet the conditions. That is a regrettable conclusion that I know the hon. Gentleman will resist, but it is simple fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful response. The hon. Member for Aldershot is right that the issue does not affect Bath alone: many towns and cities have civic amenities of which people are proud and which they are anxious to protect. I am delighted to hear about the possibility of changes to fuel duty rebate and that emissions might be taken into account. I re-emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Poole—modern buses with new equipment to minimise pollution are more expensive to run because they travel fewer miles per litre of fuel. Costs are higher and current returns—in terms of fuel duty rebate—are no different than from more polluting vehicles. It would be a useful measure to adopt.
<P>
The Minister touched on fuel duty rebate for tour buses. Would he be willing to visit my constituency and see for himself whether the conditions laid down for fuel duty rebate are being met? It is difficult to believe that conditions providing for no discrimination between different categories of user of vehicles are not being broken: in some cases, nothing on the vehicles shows that they can be used by members of the public going from one fare stage to another. If the Minister needs convincing, he could see that easily in Bath.
<P>
How can the Minister accept that information is being made available when, on a two-side glossy A3 leaflet detailing services provided, the only reference to show that ordinary fare-paying members of the public travelling from one stop to another can use a vehicle is two short lines occupying less than 0.5 per cent. of its surface area? That is not making information available and I am surprised that the Minister believes that it is. I know that he has seen it, because I gave him a copy.
<P>
Otherwise, I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful remarks. Many historic cities will also be grateful and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, the hon. Member for Bath invited the Minister to visit his constituency. It is not for the Chairman to determine whether a member of the Committee should ask Ministers—or, indeed, other hon. Members—to see something for themselves. However, a formal process exists whereby hon. Members can properly invite Ministers to their constituencies. If every member of the Committee were to abuse the opportunity that exists on the Floor of the House of Commons to offer invitations to Ministers, by the end of the sitting the Minister's diary would be full for the next nine months. I mention it because it is the second occasion in Committee on which an invitation has been made. We should not seek to extend that precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 420, in page 56, line 24, leave out `formulating' and insert `developing'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 421.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> These are technical amendments intended to achieve greater clarity and consistency in the wording. I hope that the Committee will accept them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 421, in page 56, line 28, leave out from `any' to end of line 31 and insert

<P>
Committee members will know from the useful biographies of the membership with which we were issued many hours ago that I am a chartered civil engineer. I should like to thank the hon. Member for Poole for recognising the skills of chartered engineers and the fact that there is a shortage of transport engineers in particular. I suppose that that is why my former employer, Railtrack, kindly asked me to give them the opportunity of first refusal if I ever cease to be a Member of Parliament. Therefore, I have stated that fact in the Register of Members' Interests.
<P>
My previous career as a railway engineer took me to many parts of the country. I have experience of working alongside many local authorities, especially in eastern England and East Anglia. I have worked with other traffic and civil engineers around the country. My experience tells me that there is a tendency for professionals to reinvent the wheel and to make guidance locally if they can do so. Therefore, I welcome the Minister's kind delivery of the draft guidance on provisional transport plans. I am sure that many of my fellow professionals in that important area of British life will welcome the fact that the guidance informs them that there is no need to reinvent the wheel when consulting on and designing those important local transport plans.
<P>
When I first studied the Bill, it was clear that the clause did not focus on one of the important factors in delivering effective bus services for people, communities and bus operators. Paragraph 7 of the draft guidance on provisional transport plans states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In many places, the role of local authority since bus deregulation has been limited to filling the gaps in the market through supported services, and operating concessionary fares schemes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In my experience as the Member for Scarborough and Whitby—a rural constituency, which includes significant urban areas—the local authority does not always choose to consult bus operators when planning street furniture and traffic management schemes to pull together important parts of the infrastructure and transport policy in my part of the world. For whatever reason, it forgets that bus operators have to go through its patch.
<P>
As someone who has worked with many local authorities, I have great sympathy for bus operators, because I was involved in trying to deliver a transport service, too. The tendency for local authorities to reinvent the wheel and perhaps have slightly different policies and design criteria from those of a neighbouring authority means that bus operators and transport operators in general have to adjust and make changes as a particular route or strategy goes from one local authority area to another. Obviously, that problem is compounded in the greater metropolitan areas, which is why I have always been a strong supporter of passenger transport authorities and passenger transport executives. There are many parts of the country in which slight changes in design strategy and approach mean that bus operators fail to convey to local authorities their important contribution to the debate about delivering an effective transport strategy for the community.
<P>
Many members of the Committee will be aware that my constituency is the home of Plaxton's, one of the country's major bus manufacturers. About 40 per cent. of the new-build buses that come on to Britain's roads come from that factory. Plaxton's were at the forefront of developments in low-floor technology and the design criteria that allow disabled people, young mums and other people with mobility difficulties to get on to buses. Obviously, the bus industry and operators are keen to buy into the new technology as they replenish their bus fleets. However, that great professional expertise offered by bus operators is often not utilised or absorbed when local plans are being developed.
<P>
Imagine that a bus manufacturer sells £40 million-worth of new-build buses—I hope that Plaxton's would be the company fulfilling such an order—which then come on to the streets. It would be nonsense if, as a result of the planning system, the street furniture and the routes from homes, work places or businesses to bus stops were incompatible with the needs of people with impaired mobility. However, I am afraid that that often happens in Scarborough and Whitby. We have the new buses with low-floor technology, but there are real impediments to passengers making their way to the bus stops. Local bus operators tell me that if they had had a formal opportunity to advise the local authority on infrastructure planning for the bus system, that fragmentation, and therefore those impediments, would have been avoided.
<P>
The local authorities are missing a tremendous opportunity, but I understand why. They have all sorts of other things on their minds as they try to pull local transport plans and transportation policy together. However, the amendment would ensure that local authorities had greater regard for bus operators and could use the in-house expertise of operators to plan a more effective transport system for the communities that will benefit from the important proposals for bus strategies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I support the amendment. The hon. Gentleman has made some valid points. I also pay tribute to the fact that he is proud to speak as a chartered engineer and I agree with him that not enough people are in that profession in this country and that it does not have the same cachet as would operating from the City of London. I salute him for that. The Committee will also be grateful for his tribute to Railtrack as a very responsible employer—
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Well-managed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> And well-managed, as my hon. Friend says. That is entirely consistent with its status as a privatised concern, as I am sure that he will also agree. The Committee was also interested in the reference to Plaxton. I shall view its products in a new light as I sit behind one in a traffic jam in Bath and associate its products with the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I would recommend that he sit on the bus and make a contribution to fulfilling the requirements of green transport strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is not unfair and I will take note and seek to make as much use of buses as possible—as we all do. We are not averse to the use of public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Not at the moment. We do not follow the lead of the Deputy Prime Minister who has available not one Jaguar but two. Perhaps the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby could take the Deputy Prime Minister to his constituency so that he could see what Plaxton has produced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned that we are all making an effort to encourage bus use. When was he last on a bus?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot remember. It was not long ago. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I regularly use the underground in London. Wherever it is possible to use it, I do so, in preference to using taxis. I do not have much cause to use buses, but I certainly use the London underground and, by and large, it is a good service.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby that in Aldershot we are assisting in promoting the interest of his constituency company, Plaxton's. We have put road humps in every conceivable place in the town centre and, with his new low-floor technology, I am quite sure that we are helping to ensure that the vehicles are worn out rather quicker than they might otherwise be. Perhaps that will lead to new orders for the company.
<P>
The hon. Member makes a very important point and the Minister owes the Committee an explanation as to why, under clause 94, entitled ``Bus strategies'', there is a specific requirement on a passenger transport authority to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and have regard to the advice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is more than consulting. It is to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have regard to the advice'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which means that the authority has to respond positively to the advice of the passenger transport executive for its area. Yet in clause 95, which deals with consultation on and publicity for bus strategies, a local authority is required to consult a number of organisations. I am sure that the Minister will point out that under clause 95(1)(c) ``operators of bus services'' are encompassed within that clause but not encompassed within clause 94. In the absence of an adequate explanation from the Minister as to why bus operators are not encompassed within clause 94, I shall feel bound to follow the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby if he presses the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby for moving this amendment and for the able way in which he did it. It is a lesson to us all in extolling the virtues of his constituency and of its major bus operator and yet remaining within the rules of order. It was excellently done and I congratulate him for it. Both he and the hon. Member for Aldershot raised valid points. Like the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), I find it strange that the clause is so specific about the relationship between the PTA and the PTE, and not about bus operators, which will be responsible for implementing the strategy—although I expect that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us in his lucid, able and witty way that such matters are covered later in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause specifies the relationship between PTAs and PTEs, even though that relationship has been statutory ever since the Transport Act, 1968, which created the two bodies. My hon. Friend the Minister should explain why, even though that statutory relationship has existed for 32 years, it is specified again in the Bill, while those responsible for implementing local authority strategies—bus operators—will not be entitled under the clause to have their views taken into consideration. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister can point to lots of other circumstances in which bus operators will be consulted. Most reasonable local authorities, having submitted a bus strategy and abided by the guidelines, will consult bus operators and, moreover, listen to their views. However, there is always a chance that during the five years of a local transport plan the reasonable people in the authority who initially devised the strategy will no longer be around. It is conceivable that a Labour-controlled authority might witness a diminution in its overall majority in a five-year period. The change would be unlikely to involve the Conservatives, because anyone who is interested in the matter and has listened to the contributions of the hon. Member for North Essex will probably, like me, feel that early on election night 2002, or whenever, that bit of Essex will change colour on the map and the magic words ``Labour gain'' will appear on our television screens. However, it is not inconceivable that the Liberal Democrat party might win a few seats in some areas, and might not want to implement the intentions originally specified when the local authority formulated its plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> My hon. Friend is pointing out how political change might manifest itself in the important technical aspects of a strategy. Will he develop my argument about routing through different local authorities? A lack of consistency of approach among local authorities will be a recipe for chaos and will make planning services virtually impossible for transport operators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My hon. Friend touches on an extremely relevant point. Not only might circumstances such as I described arise, but numerous local authorities are involved in a PTA area. Political control in one of those authorities may change, causing tensions in the authority itself and, possibly, difficulties in the implementation of the local transport plan as originally envisaged two, three, four or even five years previously. The amendment is extremely valid.
<P>
I dismissed as unlikely the possibility of a Conservative majority being formed in a PTA area, largely because the Conservative party has no real or relevant transport policies. However, it is not inconceivable, especially for anyone lulled by the honeyed words of the hon. Member for Bath, that the Liberal Democrat might have minor political success in various parts of the country during the period of a local transport plan. It is not impossible to envisage how that might happen. As usual, they would go down to what they regard as the Labour end of the constituency and tell people that if they vote Liberal Democrat at the next election all the housing repairs will be done, the sun will shine and England will win the world cup—everything that that party normally promises at election time. Then they might move down to what they regard as the Tory end of the constituency and say that not only will they do lots of those things but they will also reduce the rates.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying hard to relate this to bus transport but am having some difficulty in doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale. I am clearly not making the point that I am seeking to make as effectively as I should. I am trying to say that the blandishments of the Liberal Democrat party, as I have just outlined them, might cause a change of political control in one of the constituent authorities within the PTA or the Highways Agency itself, thereby rendering the original plans as drafted ineffective. Without that consultation for the local bus operator as envisaged by the amendment, chaos may ensue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I am afraid that my hon. Friend is over-politicising the thought process behind the amendment. It is principally a technical amendment to try to bring about consistency from my perspective as a professional transport engineer. If I may try to bring him back to the point that I believe he is trying to make, in my constituency we have a metropolitan area above a rural area. Higher standards apply in the metropolitan area for those bus services coming into the rural areas.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for assisting the Chair in trying to keep order, but he is now in danger of being out of order himself. That was an intervention, not a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am getting advice from so many different quarters that I am even more confused.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting advice from one quarter only and that is the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That is the only advice to which I am prepared to listen, Mr. Gale. I will ignore the diversions down which my hon. Friend wishes to take my group of buses and listen only to your wise words. The point that I am seeking to make— somewhat laboriously, I fear—[Hon. Members: ``No!''] It is early in the morning—certainly too early for most of the Conservative Members, given the time they arrived—and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I have taken longer to make my point than I first intended. It is a valid and serious point and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with it when he responds. Bus operators have a genuine and valid reason for requesting consultation. They are, after all, the people who will be responsible for implementing the strategy when it has been drawn up and approved. In responding to my hon. Friend, I hope that the Minister will not only congratulate him on the sound way he moved the amendment and the wise guidance that he has given those like myself who are occasionally tempted to transgress, but will also see the common sense in accepting it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I should like to move that the debate now be adjourned. Taking place in an adjacent Committee Room is a press conference for the publication of a Select Committee report on the proposed public-private partnership agreement on the National Air Traffic Services—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go further, it is in order for any hon. Member to move an adjournment. It is up to the Chair whether to take such a motion. There is a precedent for an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman to move an adjournment and any motion so moved is debatable. First, before the hon. Gentleman goes any further at all, the Chair has to accept the motion. I should like to hear a little more of what he has to say before I decide whether to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. We have spent a considerable time in Committee discussing the Government's proposals for the so-called public-private partnership for National Air Traffic Services. The Select Committee has just published a report on the subject. It concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government has failed, in its evidence to us, and more generally, to make a positive case for the public-private partnership for NATS''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have now heard enough to make a decision. From what the hon. Gentleman says, it sounds as though a document that is, at least in part, relevant to the matters under discussion, has been published, although I should point out that NATS has already been debated. If this document, which most members of the Committee have not had an opportunity to see, is relevant to the broad principles under discussion, and if the hon. Gentleman wishes to move a motion simply to allow hon. Members to examine it—despite their not having yet been able to discuss it—that motion may be put before the Committee, debated and, if necessary, voted on. I must make it plain that, in accepting a motion to adjourn, I am not accepting a wide open debate on a document that most members of the Committee—I believe that some members of the Select Committee who prepared the report are also Committee members—have not yet read. It would be improper to do that. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to move that debate be now adjourned, he may do so, but he must confine his remarks to his reason for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move, That the debate be now adjourned.
<P>
I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. Gale. Although we wish to press the matter to a vote, we need not detain the Committee at length. The report raises considerable doubts about what Ministers have told the Committee. It also raises questions about whether Ministers have understood the implications of their policy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in some difficulty. As I said, hon. Members have not yet been able to consider the report. It would be improper for the Committee to debate matters that are not yet in the general parliamentary domain. The hon. Gentleman has moved his motion that the Committee be adjourned and has indicated his reasons. If the Minister wishes to reply, I will allow him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. You said earlier that the motion was debatable. I hope that you will allow members of the Committee who are not members of the Select Committee—most of whom have been present all this morning—to debate it. We are debating a fairly important amendment, which my hon. Friend might wish to press, on a subject that is causing considerable concern to those who work in the bus industry as well as those who provide bus services. I for one would like you to know, Mr. Gale, that I hope to have the opportunity to denounce what I regard as a political stunt by the hon. Member for North Essex, who not only has proved during the debate that he is a political lightweight, but is now trying to—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have taken the hon. Gentleman's point of order. It is a matter for the Chair and the hon. Gentleman is right to raise it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me deal with the point of order. Whether there should be a debate is a point of order for the Chair. I have made it abundantly plain that a motion to adjourn further consideration is in itself debatable, but I have also stated clearly the very narrow confines under which I am prepared to allow that debate to take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I very much regret that the hon. Member for North Essex has chosen to introduce this subject in a highly partisan and inappropriate way. He has been able study the Select Committee's report, so he will know that it pays no attention whatever to the Standing Committee's proceedings—it was approved by the Select Committee before a large part of our proceedings were complete. Therefore, it would be entirely inappropriate for us to debate a report that has not been properly informed by the Committee's serious detailed discussions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his remarks.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to tell the Minister, as I told those on the Opposition Front Bench, that I made it abundantly plain that there is no question of the Committee debating a report that most Committee members have not seen and that is in any case not part of the discussion on the Bill. The motion under consideration is simply that debate be adjourned. The reason given by the hon. Gentleman who moved the motion is that this would allow hon. Members to study a report that has just been published. That is the sole subject under discussion.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I had not finished my remarks when I sat down. I was going to crave your indulgence, Mr. Gale, to draw Committee members' attention to one or two brief points in the report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already said that I am not prepared to allow a discussion of a report that Committee members have not had the opportunity to consider. I do not know what is in the report. It may contain matters that will lend themselves to debate as our discussion proceeds. However, now is not the moment for such a debate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman moved his motion and gave a reason for doing so. If hon. Members wish to contribute to the debate on whether the Committee should adjourn for the specific reason that was given, I am prepared to allow them to catch my eye. Those are the narrow confines of our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I support my hon. Friend's motion. I am sorry that the Minister for Housing and Planning reacted as he did, speaking as someone who was unable to participate in the NATS debate. However, I accept that he is not happy.
<P>
On the narrow question of whether the Committee should adjourn, we are not far from the time when we would adjourn in any case. It would be in everyone's interest briefly to leave our discussion of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East said that the amendment is extremely important. Indeed, I spoke in support of it. However, a matter has arisen relating to an important aspect of the Bill. It would be appropriate for the Committee to adjourn a few minutes early, so that hon. Members may see the report, which emanates from a Select Committee not dominated by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Adjourning now would allow Committee members to obtain a copy of the report. They would see that the PPP proposed by the Government has been condemned by the Transport Sub-Committee and that Ministers gave evidence to that Committee. For the Minister to claim that the Sub-Committee's proceedings have not been considered is another matter entirely.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a long intervention. The hon. Member for Aldershot has the Floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another reason for adjourning quickly is that the Sub-Committee press conference is taking place as we speak? Many Committee Members may wish to hear what the Sub-Committee has to say about the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point and, accordingly, I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Bath. News of the report has stung the Minister and the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. We should clearly be attending the press conference to learn what is in the report. I therefore endorse the motion.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now resume the debate on amendment No. 442.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby raised an important point, given the fact that many bus companies operate in several local authority areas. Local transport plans and bus structures may apply only to a particular area. Although the Bill allows neighbouring authorities and other authorities affected to be consulted, it seems a strange aberration that the people whose professional business it is to provide a service for passengers at a profit are not to be consulted on the overall bus strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I draw to your attention the fact that the Committee's deliberations have been held up for some time by the principal speaker for the Opposition, the hon. Member for North Essex. I appreciate that your hands are tied by the rules of this place, Mr. Gale, but the hon. Gentleman has taken no part in this morning's debate. He arranged that disgraceful stunt outside at 11 o'clock and he has been briefing the press instead of performing his duty in this Committee Room. Now, as the debate on this important matter resumes, he picks up his papers and sweeps out to talk to the newspapers. In 26 years in this place, I have never seen such disgraceful behaviour.

<B>The Chairman:</B> As he said, the hon. Gentleman has been a Member of Parliament for 26 years, so he is well aware that what he says, while it is a point for debate, is not a matter for the Chair. It is up to hon. Members on both sides of the House whether they attend the Committee and, if so, for how long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I seek your guidance on how the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East might be better informed. Clearly, he was not present in the 1987 to 1992 Parliament, when the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), now the Prime Minister, made such practices into the finest possible art form. He makes my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex look like a complete amateur—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Happily, the provision of information to individual Members is also not a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. It is clear that the activity in a local authority area could easily affect the overall strategy of a bus company—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There has been a certain amount of disruption, but we owe it to the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby, who moved the amendment, to give the debate a fair hearing. He has raised an important issue—all the issues that have been selected for debate are important. Will the Committee please settle down now and return to the matter under discussion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Direct representations and consultation with bus company engineers would be useful in formulating a strategy. After all, it is their business.
<P>
The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby has done the Committee a service by bringing this issue to our attention. He talked about long-term capital expenditure. Consultation on the bus strategy could well be material to commercial decisions being taken by bus companies and to their plans for the future. They spend a considerable sum ordering buses—even the type of bus could be material to the strategies pursued. We all know that some companies invest heavily in easy-access low floors, which are very important. If however, two or three local authorities on the route of that type of bus react by improving pavements or doing other associated works so that people can take full advantage of those easy-access low floors, but one authority in the middle does not, that may impact on the quality and success of that service.
<P>
This has been an interesting debate. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Poole for returning us to the serious and adult world of politics after the juvenile, time-wasting antics of his supposedly senior colleague on the Front Bench. It is important that we as heavyweight politicians, in marked contrast to the hon. Member for North Essex, should address the problems that our constituents experience in the real world.
<P>
This has been an interesting debate—

It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
