26, in clause 105, page 49, leave out lines
26 to 29.</div><a name="080129125000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome
back to the scintillating proceedings on the Planning Bill, Sir John.
We are starting with what appears to be an innocuous little amendment
to delete clause 105(4)(h), which would allow the development consent
orders to free land</div>
<a name="080129125000044"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from any restriction imposed on
it by or under the Green Belt (London and Home Counties) Act 1938 (c.
xciii), or by a covenant or other agreement entered
into&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080129125000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000447"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I know that the hon. Lady would not wish
to mislead the Committee, but the amendment would also delete clause
105(4)(g).</div><a name="080129125000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000448"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> Thank you, Sir John. I am grateful to you, because
that paragraph is even more sweeping. It is considerably less
innocuous, even if shorter. Unless I receive serious reassurance from
Ministers, I will invite my hon. Friends to vote on the
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">You, Sir
John, probably more than anyone, are aware of the pressure on the green
belt in and outside London. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst and I have long had to fight, on behalf of our constituents
in Bromley, attempts to infiltrate the green belt with development; 50
per cent. of our borough is green belt, which leads to a lot of
pressure on it. Anyone with an outer London constituency or one that
borders any large metropolitan area&#151;I do not use the term in the
local government sense&#151;will know that the pressure on the green
belt is huge. The pressure to ensure that that lung remains around the
big urban conurbations is equally
huge.</div><a name="080129125000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have for a long time been trying to use various methods and means to
resist or break down the resistance to development in the green belt.
They have been defeated so far on all occasions. It is, to
say  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>the least, sneaky to try to get it through in this Bill, in which no one
would believe that it should be
included.</div><a name="080129125000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that the pressure for homes is enormous. The purpose of one section of
the Bill, which we have still to come to, is to try to extract some
extra value from the capital gains on housing developments because of
demand in response to the market. However, the green belt is precious
and is perceived to be precious. Should the infrastructure planning
commission or any other body be able to override current legislation on
it, I would suggest that the Government would live to regret it. We
certainly think that that should be resisted wherever attempts arise to
make incursions on to green belt
land.</div><a name="080129125000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, as I
have said, unless the Minister can reassure me as to the point of
including paragraphs (g) and (h) in the Bill, I will invite my hon.
Friends to oppose their inclusion as strongly as we
can.</div><a name="080129125000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129125000449"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I fully support
the amendment. The power in the paragraphs concerned seems very
sweeping. Were the commission considering making such an order,
effectively freeing up green belt land, would there be a dialogue with
people in the surrounding area before such an order was granted, so
that at least the consultation would have been gone through?</div>
<a name="080129125000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision seems to be
extremely sweeping, and as the hon. Member for Beckenham has said,
green belt land is there for a purpose and is very much valued by those
who live in its vicinity. Although I generally understand why the
commission should have powers to vary existing legislation, which can
sometimes be arcane, I find this power a little disturbing. Will the
Minister give some assurances about the amount, form and timing of
consultation and how the commission would be
guided?</div><a name="080129125000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000450"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> Although I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman and
generally agree that there should be consultation, I am concerned that
we can consult until we are blue in the face. I rather suspect that the
consultation will be completely meaningless if the provision is passed,
and that our local communities will feel even more
cheated.</div><a name="080129125000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000451"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> The hon. Lady puts her case strongly and I hear
what she says. No doubt the Minister heard that and will respond in due
course.</div><a name="080129125000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129125000452"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): May I briefly
support the observations that have been made? The provision is a
concern, and I understand the point made by the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. There might be certain circumstances in which
it is necessary to lay a pipeline across green belt land, or to
undertake something similarly limited and modest that relates to
infrastructure and development. However, a proposal to build a major
infrastructure development within the green belt would raise great
concerns indeed.</div>
<a name="080129125000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I see the argument
for single consent, I cannot help but feel that however well it is
dressed up, there will be a diminution of the protection of the green
belt and of the rights of individuals to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>consulted and to make representations. We have addressed that point with
regard to London suburbs and suburban areas, and I make no apology for
that. In my constituency, the inspector has recently given permission
for some 700 houses to be built on green belt land, and that is a
troubling precedent.</div>
<a name="080129125000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue relates not only to
the suburbs, but to other areas of the country where we can envisage
some type of infrastructure project being placed on the green belt, and
the sweeping nature of the power seems to go well beyond what is set
out in the subsection&#146;s preceding paragraph, which sensibly
limits the power in relation to electricity lines going across the
land. What constraints and restrictions will there be on that power? Do
we run the risk that many acres could be taken out of green belt land
under the provision as it stands, with less protection and opportunity
for the public to have their say than exists at the
moment?</div><a name="080129125000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000453"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> On behalf of those of us on the Government
Benches, let me welcome you back to the Chair, Sir John.</div>
<a name="080129125000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government do not support
the amendment, but understand what the hon. Member for Beckenham is
trying to do. She would like to see green belt land keep all of the
protection that it currently enjoys against inappropriate development.
The Government share that desire to protect those areas from
inappropriate development, but the amendment would not achieve that
intended result and is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="080129125000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help the Committee if
I were to set out the main protections for green belt land, and to
clarify the differences relating to the amendment and the apparently
simple term &#147;green belt&#148;. The clause relates to land that
is designated as green belt land in accordance with the Green Belt
(London and Home Counties) Act 1938. Under the 1938 Act, local
authorities were given power to hold certain lands surrounding London
and other metropolitan areas on trust, and development of that land is
subject to restrictions over and above those imposed by the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990.</div>
<a name="080129125000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">When land is designated as
green belt land for the purposes of the 1938 Act, a separate consent is
required from the Secretary of State to enable the land to be
developed. I will refer to that type of green belt land as statutory
green belt land. It is not the same as land designated as green belt
land by a local authority in its local development plan. Such land is
currently protected from development by both local and national
planning policy, which prohibits inappropriate development in the green
belt, except in very special circumstances. This type of designated
green belt is not the same as statutory green belt land. Although the
development of this designated green belt land requires planning
permission in the usual way, it does not also require a separate
consent from the Secretary of State under the 1938 Act.</div>
<a name="080129125000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way the Bill works in
relation to green belt land is to combine the consent regimes arising
from the 1938 Act and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the
single consent regime and to give the commission, or the Secretary of
State when she is the decision maker, power to authorise the
development of both 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>statutory green belt land and land designated as green belt in a local
development plan. An order granting development consent in relation to
green belt land will therefore have a similar effect to both a planning
consent and a separate consent from the Secretary of State under the
1938 Act.</div><a name="080129125000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In deciding
whether to grant consent for a development in the green belt, the
decision maker will be required to adhere to the policies set out in
any relevant national policy statement and to take into account such
other factors as may be prescribed. It is intended that not only will
national policy statements reflect existing policy on green belt, as
set out in PPG2, but the Secretary of State will make regulations
requiring the decision to take into account the purpose for which green
belt land is held. In that way, the special status of green belt land
will be protected.</div>
<a name="080129125000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 26 would mean
that a development consent order could not include provisions on the
transfer of land protected by the 1938 Act or the freeing of such land
from restricted covenants under that Act. That would have no effect on
the ability of the IPC to make orders that contain provisions relating
to land designated as green belt by virtue of a local development plan.
The effect of the amendment would be detrimental to the concept of a
single consent regime as in certain circumstances it would be necessary
for a promoter to apply for a separate consent from the Secretary of
State in order to allow a proposed development to proceed.</div>
<a name="080129125000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Applicants could still obtain
authorisations for such sales or transfers, but only after a separate
application to the Secretary of State, who would be unsighted on those
issues as she would have no role in the granting of the other
permissions or consents in relation to the project. Furthermore, under
the amendment, in cases in which the Secretary of State was the
decision maker, the applicant would still need to make a separate
application to the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="080129125000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government believe that
the right way to address the issue is by ensuring that green belt
policy is properly set out in national policy statements. It is our
intention that when we introduce national policy statements they will
cover the special policy protection for green belt land, which
prohibits inappropriate development except in very special
circumstances. In turn, that will be reflected in the policies set out
in any local development plan. When Ministers prepare national policy
statements they will have regard to national planning policies,
including PPG2 on the green belt. Special protections for green belt
land will therefore continue to
apply.</div><a name="080129125000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, I
should like to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to clauses 94 and
95, which permit the Secretary of State to prescribe matters which the
decision maker must take into account before deciding to make an order
granting development consent. It is intended that those regulations
will set out that in a case involving proposed development on any green
belt land, the decision maker will be required to take into account the
special status of the land. The Secretary of State already takes that
into account currently when deciding whether to grant a green belt
consent under the 1938 Act. The single consents regime, as we have
discussed previously, is based on a clear separation between policy
making and decision making. As such, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>the final decision maker needs to have the power to grant all the
necessary consents for a particular project, which may include the
power to free the land in question from the restrictions imposed on the
green belt.</div> <a name="080129125000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the specific question raised by the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about dialogue with local communities, there
would be three chances for local consultation: first, when the national
policy statement is drafted; secondly, during the pre-application
consultation; and thirdly, when an application is made. Therefore,
there will be three opportunities to ensure that local issues are
raised appropriately. On that basis, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw
her amendment. Otherwise, I will have to ask my hon. Friends to vote
against
it.</div><a name="080129125000412"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000454"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> The Minister has set out a convincing argument, but
it still begs a number of questions. He refers to inappropriate
development in the green belt. I would suggest that that is the issue
about which local communities might get most exercised. They wish to
feel, as we have set out clearly, that there is recourse to a
democratically accountable person&#151;the Secretary of
State&#151;because green belts are regarded as being precious in
urban
communities.</div><a name="080129125000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other concern that I have, which applies to the green belt planning
permission that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
referred to, is that once there is any form of infrastructure
development such as a pipeline, pylons or an electricity sub-station,
the land around it tends to degrade. Over the last few years we have
heard the argument that the minute the green belt has degraded, it
becomes ripe for development. We are concerned that this planning
system should in no way lead to the degradation of the green belt.
Therefore, I will press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="080129125000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000474"></a>Mrs.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div><a name="080129125000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000475"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 430 to
432.</div><a name="080129125000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000476"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> We tabled the amendment to delete even more sweeping
powers than were set out in the green belt provisions in subsection
(4). Subsection (6)(a) and (b) will give the IPC the power to override
Government decisions. It will be able to amend or repeal any
legislation. If that reading is correct, a fundamental principle of
democracy is being swept aside in order to speed up the planning
system. Doubtless Ministers will have a very clear explanation for
giving the IPC this power. We all wish to see the process speeded up,
but under this proposal the IPC could ride roughshod over the
democratic rights of the British public and of Parliament. I find that
fundamentally difficult to contemplate, let alone
accept.</div><a name="080129125000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we
want to hear what the Government have to say on the matter. Unless
their rebuttal of the amendment is convincing, it seems that we are
moving back to a situation in which the Executive pay absolutely no
attention to the people who are democratically accountable. Without
going too deeply into one of our continual criticisms of the Government
over the past 10 years, that is all of a piece with their ignoring
Parliament and wishing that they could ride roughshod over us and that
we would all do exactly as they wished. On those powerful grounds, I
have tabled the amendment.</div>
<a name="080129125000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000477"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> We oppose the amendment. I will explain why I
hope that it will be withdrawn, subsequent to my explanation, or
resisted by my hon. Friends.</div>
<a name="080129125000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause sets out which
matters can be included in an order granting development consent for an
application. In particular, the clause allows an order granting
development consent to apply, modify, or exclude legislative provisions
relating to matters covered in the order, subject to certain
limitations. The ability to do that is modelled closely&#151;I got
into trouble last week for using the word &#147;modelled&#148;; I
have checked this time and I am using it in the right context&#151;on
the powers already available to the Secretary of State in making orders
under section 5 of the Transport and Works Act
1992.</div><a name="080129125000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns about the fact that the Bill would
allow legislation to be applied, modified or excluded by a body other
than Parliament. I hope to reassure colleagues about that and to
demonstrate that a deletion of the provisions in paragraphs (a) and
(b), as envisaged in the amendment, would be the wrong step to take.
Before the Committee considers the amendment, it might be worth while
to reflect on why the 1992 Act and the Harbours Act 1964 contained the
legislative provisions that we are now trying to incorporate into the
Bill.</div><a name="080129125000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past,
promoters of several types of nationally significant infrastructure
project have found that there are statutory provisions regulating
existing infrastructure that they propose to upgrade or improve. In
particular, railway infrastructure is frequently covered by one or more
private Acts of Parliament, which gave the original promoters of the
railway the ability to construct it in the first place. Often, the
provisions of the existing legislation are inconsistent with proposals
to upgrade or improve infrastructure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div><a name="080129125000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, Network Rail might
be under an obligation to provide or maintain a certain infrastructure,
perhaps a bridge or footway, that would be incompatible with the
provisions to upgrade a site. It was with that problem in mind that
Parliament previously granted the Secretary of State the extensive
powers in section 5 of the Transport and Works Act 1992, including the
ability to make an order that
can</div><a name="080129125000104"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;apply, modify or
exclude any statutory provision which relates to any matter as to which
an order could be
made&#148;</div><a name="080129125000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">under
that Act. The 1992 Act also permits the Secretary of State to make
amendments, repeals and revocations of statutory provisions of local
application as appear to her to be expedient in connection with an
order. The Harbours Act makes similar provision in respect of local
Acts in relation to harbour
developments.</div><a name="080129125000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
105(6) of the Bill is based on the wording in section 5 of the
Transport and Works Act 1992, and the similar provisions in the
Harbours Act. As we have seen in part 3, many of the types of projects
to which the 1992 Act applies will in future be classified as
nationally significant infrastructure projects, and, as such, will
require development consent under the Bill. Clause 29(2) has
specifically excluded the 1992 Act or 1964 Act orders from being made
in relation to those projects. That will prevent the use of orders
under those Acts to amend legislation in relation to such
projects.</div> <a name="080129125000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
reasons I have already given, many of such projects could be
incompatible with existing legislation. Unless that is dealt with, the
single consent regime will be unworkable. The options would be to
retain the provisions of the Transport and Works Act and the Harbours
Act in relation to relevant nationally significant infrastructure
projects, or for promoters to be required to promote private
legislation to enable schemes to proceed. We do not believe that either
of those options is
sensible.</div><a name="080129125000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
issue of private Bills, we should remember that the
huge amount of parliamentary time that was taken up debating private
Bills was one of the prime reasons why Parliament created the Transport
and Works Act regime in the first place. If we required a promoter to
obtain an order under the Transport and Works Act or Harbours Act, in
addition to consent under the new regime, it could result in exactly
the kind of duplication of effort that the new regime seeks to avoid.
It would mean that the decisions would continue to go to the Secretary
of State, which is the subject we debated previously. As has been
mentioned previously, that would add time to the process and reduce
predictability, because there would be multiple decision makers. In any
case, we do not believe that such a system would lead to better or
different orders because of the safeguards that we have already built
into our proposals.</div>
<a name="080129125000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, and
most basically, the only pieces of legislation that can be altered are
those that the promoter includes in the application. The IPC will not
be able to make orders on a subject other than for that which is
applied. Secondly, the form of the draft order is based on model
provisions that are set out for the Secretary of State by order, as we
discussed under clause 33. Those will be similar to the model
provisions currently set out in relation to Transport and Works Act
orders. Any Member will have the ability to scrutinise those model
provisions and force a parliamentary debate on them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div><a name="080129125000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the decision maker
will only be able to approve the application and make an order when
that is in accordance with the relevant national policy statement.
Again, that will have been set out by the Government and scrutinised in
Parliament. Fourthly, where the IPC intends to use the powers in clause
105(6), it will have to send a copy of the draft order to the Secretary
of State ahead of time. If the Secretary of State thinks that the terms
of the order would contravene Community law or any of the convention
rights, she has a power in clause 106 to direct or require the IPC to
change the terms of the
order.</div><a name="080129125000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should also
be remembered that powers set out in clause 105(6), under which
legislation may be amended, apply only in relation to the particular
development that is under consideration. Those powers do not permit the
commission or the Secretary of State to usurp the functions of the
legislature. They are powers of limited scope and application. I hope
that the explanation of the safeguards on the use by the IPC of
legislative powers gives comfort to the Committee and the hon. Member
for Beckenham. I therefore ask her to withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 430 to 432 are technical in nature. They are intended
to ensure that when the IPC needs to use its legislative powers under
clause 105(6), those allow amendments not only of legislation but of
statutory provisions. Without that provision, the IPC would not be able
to amend previous Transport and Works Act orders or Harbours Act
orders.</div><a name="080129125000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000478"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that comprehensive
explanation, which goes some way to reassure me. On the basis of that I
shall seek to withdraw the amendment, but I will probably have to do
some more research to see whether we need to return to the matter on
Report. I can understand the arguments about the Harbours Act and the
Transport and Works Act. I am concerned that the national policy
statement is a much wider system and that the conjunction of all those
provisions might enable the IPC to make rulings much more widely than
the Government envisage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

2006&#146;.</div><a name="080129125000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, welcome you back to the Chair, Sir John. Whether this will be one
of the sittings where we make speedy progress or whether we will slow
down again remains to be seen, but I am sure that you will enjoy
watching our deliberations and keeping us in
order.</div><a name="080129125000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is similar to that tabled by the hon. Member for Beckenham and is about
the power to disregard legislation. We are spending a great deal of
time in this Committee. We have 14 sittings in which to debate the Bill
and potentially to put it into law. We do that because we take
legislation very seriously and want to get it as right as is possible.
If we then set up bodies that can disregard legislation and make
decisions that will affect the lives of people in the areas concerned,
we are going down a very dangerous
road.</div><a name="080129125000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not speak
to the last amendment because many of the issues addressed by it are
addressed by this amendment. I hope that the Minister will forgive me
if I reflect on what he said when debating the previous group. He made
the case that the Secretary of State is already able to disregard
legislation in some circumstances under other Acts. However, there is a
fundamental difference between the Secretary of State and the IPC. We
have had that argument
before.</div><a name="080129125000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition parties
about whether the IPC is comparable to the Secretary of State. I do not
think that they are the same. People are willing to accept that the
Secretary of State may, for certain technical reasons&#151;as long as
it is in the spirit of the legislation&#151;exempt certain provisions
in certain cases. I think that people will find it much harder to
accept that an unelected, appointed body, at some distance from a
democratic mandate, will have those powers. There are real differences
between the two.</div><a name="080129125000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would use the super-affirmative resolution procedure, which
sounds very exciting and was set up under the Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Act 2006. It would still allow exemptions to be made
from legislation, but there would be a powerful means of parliamentary
scrutiny to ensure that such departures have been properly considered
and that elected Members have had the opportunity to examine them in
detail.</div><a name="080129125000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what
the Minister says about there having to be a facility to do such things
to avoid going back to using private Bills. The amendment would provide
for such a procedure, but it would be a little more onerous, it would
give hon. Members the opportunity to participate in the process and it
would take the power away from an unelected body&#151;that is the
fundamental point for
me.</div><a name="080129125000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister is prepared to consider my arguments. I hope he will see that
this is not a black and white issue between the very lengthy procedure
of using private Bills and the IPC having this power. There are other
possibilities and, as the hon. Lady said, I hope that he will reflect
on that and come back to us at a later stage. I am also interested to
hear what he has to say now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div><a name="080129125000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard, the Bill is aimed
at simplifying the planning procedure for major projects. It should
make the whole process more straightforward and transparent. It should
also cut out some of the repetition of areas of controversy and ensure
that they occur at an earlier stage in the process. However, I still do
not see that delaying something by a matter of a few weeks or months is
crucial. We have talked about schemes in the past that have been
delayed by five, 10 or 20 years while those processes have rumbled on.
The important thing is that we get the decisions right. Allowing
Parliament the opportunity to examine whether a case has been made for
legislation that it has made to be disregarded in that way is an
important part of the process, and I hope that the Minister will
consider whether there might be a middle way between private Bills and
the IPC having the power to throw out legislation whenever it
wants.</div><a name="080129125000129"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000480"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> When the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment,
I had hoped that he was taking the time to reflect on the earlier
debate and was considering offering to withdraw it, but clearly he
talked himself out of that while reminding himself of his speaking
notes and has decided to test it by having some discussion.</div>
<a name="080129125000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will try not to repeat what
I have said because we have discussed the safeguards
on the use of legislative powers by the IPC. However, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment tries to address that with a different
tactical approach to such safeguards, by providing that no order
granting development consent could apply, modify or exclude statutory
provision without being confirmed by a resolution of both Houses of
Parliament under the super-affirmative resolution
procedure.</div><a name="080129125000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know, the super-affirmative procedure is extremely
onerous, at least with regard to parliamentary time, and I say that
with respect. Under that process, Ministers would lay a draft order
before Parliament for 60 days, during which a Select Committee of
either House may recommend on specified criteria that no further
proceedings be taken, in which case the order falls. Designated Select
Committees in either House may make recommendations on the draft order,
to which Ministers must have regard. If the Minister decides to revise
a draft order, the Committee stage restarts. After 60 days, if the
Minister has decided not to revise the order, the draft order is laid
before Parliament and a motion to improve it is then moved in both
Houses. A Minister can only make the order if both Houses resolve to
affirm it. I hope that that description demonstrates the amount of
parliamentary time that would be taken up in that procedure, with which
the hon. Gentleman is obviously familiar.</div>
<a name="080129125000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are unconvinced, in any
case, that Parliament would welcome those time commitments back again.
It was because of the time spent on private Bills relating to
infrastructure development that Parliament created the Transport and
Works Act regime in the first place. I question whether any of the
parties at the examination stage will welcome an additional
parliamentary stage after the IPC&#146;s examination has already gone
over all the facts and reached a decision.</div>
<a name="080129125000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 398 would
certainly increase uncertainty for all parties. Therefore, I encourage
the hon. Gentleman to think again about the safeguards, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>four of which I listed in the discussion with the hon. Lady a moment
ago. I hope that that explanation and the discussion that has just
taken place with regard to amendment No. 418 on the safeguards on the
use of legislative powers by the IPC have given him the opportunity to
think again so that he will withdraw his amendment. If he does not, I
will ask my hon. Friends to oppose
it.</div><a name="080129125000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000481"></a>Dan

the amendment so that the Committee had a second chance to consider
what the Minister said in response to the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment,
and the safeguards do not reassure me a great deal. It is an onerous
procedure, although not a hugely lengthy one, as there are time limits
imposed on it. It ought to be fairly onerous for an unelected body to
disregard legislation passed by Parliament. Therefore, on this occasion
I would like test the Committee&#146;s opinion on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000484"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> We reach clause 106, which I suppose is a
resonant number in the planning terms that we all
quote backwards and forwards to each other in a different context. No
doubt we will do so again when we reach the section on the community
infrastructure
levy.</div><a name="080129125000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would widen the scope of powers available to the Secretary of State. It
may seem a little odd that I should be arguing for that, and that the
Secretary of State&#146;s representative among the Ministers might be
arguing against it, but it allows the Secretary of State a longer
period in which to act in considering whether he is happy with a draft
order. As drafted, the clause specifically limits those powers to
Community law or convention rights. My amendments would widen that
provision so that the Secretary of State can review the draft order and
make any changes that he or she sees fit to ensure that the draft order
is right, or as near to that as possible. The provision may well not be
exercised a great deal, and it would not necessarily delay the process
a huge amount. However, it would ensure that there is an extra
safeguard for the Secretary of State to consider the draft orders and
to change them if concerns arise not only from problems with Community
law or convention rights, as the clause currently states. I hope that
the Minister will discuss how the Secretary of State might be able to
address any problems that occur with a draft
order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div><a name="080129125000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000485"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
The clause sets out a limitation and safeguard on the IPC&#146;s
ability to exercise its powers under subsection (6) in relation to a
project. When the IPC proposes to make an order that will include such
matters, it will have to send a draft to the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State may step in if she believes that any provision the
IPC wishes to include in an order in exercise of its legislative powers
will contravene Community law or convention rights under the Human
Rights Act 1998. That reserve power takes the form of an ability to
direct the IPC to make modifications to its draft order so as to
prevent the contravention from
arising.</div><a name="080129125000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would remove the limitation on the Secretary of State to
make changes only when the order contravenes Community or human rights
law. Instead, the Secretary of State could direct changes for any
reason. It is not clear whether the Secretary of State&#146;s power
of direction would continue to be restricted to changes to the
provisions relating to the legislative powers, or whether changes could
be made to other provisions in the order granting developing consent.
Even if the courts were to favour the former interpretation, the
amendments have the potential to involve the Secretary of State
extensively in decisions for which the IPC wants to make use of its
legislative powers. Whether there is a restriction or not, it seems
clear that the intention behind the amendment is to involve the
Secretary of State more closely in making
decisions.</div><a name="080129125000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the topic at length, and the Government continue to believe
that there are great benefits and a clear separation between policy
making and decision making. That led us to suggest the IPC system in
the first place. It would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State
to direct changes to IPC decisions on any grounds other than those
mentioned in the
clause.</div><a name="080129125000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would jeopardise the benefits of the new system. The clause
currently states that if the Secretary of State wishes to direct the
IPC to make modifications to the draft order, she must do so within 28
days of receiving it. Amendment No. 401 would extend this deadline to
56 days, presumably because the hon. Gentleman is trying to expand the
scope of decision making and so allow more time.</div>
<a name="080129125000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, we believe that
28 days remains the appropriate time. The Secretary of State will not
need more than 28 days to determine whether a draft order contravenes
Community or human rights law and to direct changes to ensure that it
continues to conform. An extension of the deadline would simply slow
down the process more in its final stages and therefore increase the
level of cost to promoters who would be waiting for the development
consent order to be made formally.</div>
<a name="080129125000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, I hope that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000486"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister has clearly addressed the issues
that we have just discussed. Having heard that he was quite happy for
the IPC to have the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>provision to disregard the legislation, the amendments aimed to offer a
further safeguard to that process. He and his colleague have sought
throughout the debate to distinguish between policy and decision
making. I should have thought that there is certainly an element of
policy in deciding that legislation can be disregarded. It is a bit odd
to say that that is purely a matter of deciding on an application.
Surely the disregarding of legislation is in itself a policy-related
decision. I am not entirely convinced by the Minister&#146;s
argument. However, we have had the opportunity to debate the principle
and get it on the record that Opposition Members are unhappy about
this. As others have said, we can return to this at a later stage. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000489"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> We ask the Committee to accept the
amendments. Amendment No. 433 is largely technical. Instead of the
decision maker needing to be satisfied of compelling need in the public
interest for land acquisition, he needs to be satisfied of a compelling
case in the public interest. That wording better reflects the current
wording of the test set out in the Department for Communities and Local
Government&#146;s circular 06/2004 on compulsory purchases and the
Crichel Down rules and hence the established case law. We have been
asked by the Compulsory Purchase Association to make that
change.</div><a name="080129125000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 126
provides that time limits will apply to orders granting development
consent. It specifies that development that is consented under such an
order must have begun before the end of the prescribed period, although
the clause allows the decision maker to set a different time limit as
part of the order itself. Amendment No. 436 will allow us also to set
time limits on any compulsory purchase powers contained in an order
granting development consent. The time limits by which point compulsory
purchase powers must be used will also be prescribed, as we expect that
this prescribed period will in most cases be shorter than the time
limits for the development to
begin.</div><a name="080129125000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, this
clause will allow the decision maker to set a different time limit as
part of the order. We believe that it would be unfair and improper for
developers to have the right to buy people&#146;s land but then not
do so until a significant period of time later. The ensuing blight from
compulsory purchase powers that are not acted on could wreck
people&#146;s quality of life, let alone the value of their
property.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000490"></a>Robert

consideration that the Government have in this instance been prepared
to return from their original proposal to the existing case law. That
is sensible and makes for greater certainty. I hope that between now
and Report they might like to reflect on adopting the same approach to
the question of materiality that we discussed, because the same
considerations
apply.</div><a name="080129125000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000491"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> We will not vote against clause, but I ask the
Minister to reassure people who have told us that they are worried
about precisely what is meant in subsection (2)(b) by the circumstances
in which land is required that is &#147;incidental to that
development&#148;. Everyone understands the concept of land for
development, and to facilitate that development, but there is naturally
concern that the use of the powers in this regime should be limited to
that which is necessary for the development. What are the practical
implications of the phrase &#147;incidental to that
development&#148;?</div><a name="080129125000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000492"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> The Bill outlines different powers that the
IPC may have. An applicant may apply for the decision to authorise the
compulsory acquisition of land that is incidental development when the
land is required as part of a package of compensatory
measures&#151;for example, if the applicant has to acquire land that
is protected by the habitats directive. Where there is a clear
community, environmental or legislative need to make additional
incidental arrangements, they are covered by that
phrase.</div><a name="080129125000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000493"></a>Robert

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000496"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> I am curious about the magical figure of 209.03 sq
m in subsection (5); were it 209.04 sq m, I dare say that things would
not proceed. I presume that it is the standard width and accommodation
for the land on each side of a pipeline that is not normally developed
at any cost. There is a word for that which escapes me. I would be
interested to know precisely why it is 209.03 sq
m.</div><a name="080129125000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129125000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): I am equally
somewhat arithmetically baffled. It might be that the figure refers to
something defined in acreage or metres in a previous piece of
legislation.</div><a name="080129125000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like some clarification from the Minister on how this provision will
work for common land. There is a large amount of common land in my
constituency. A significant part of the Yorkshire dales is common land.
It is quite a complex business. The Bill says that if some land is
taken away, compensatory land will be given on which all the old rights
will apply, but it is not quite as easy as that. Rights on common land
are historical rights held by various people. Those are not necessarily
transferable to new pieces of land because they might not have the
historical quality of the old
land.</div><a name="080129125000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there is a complex issue regarding the Rural Payments Agency, an
organisation which the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am a
member, has had occasion to examine in some detail over far too long a
period because of its continuing inability to get its act together. The
way that the RPA recognises, or fails to recognise, the rights on
common land is important. For any land given in compensation, the RPA
should recognise the rights that are often endowed to grazers on common
land. That should be done in terms of entitlement under the single
payments system.</div><a name="080129125000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Minister is widely versed in all those matters, but I
would like some strong reassurances about matter and, out of sheer
curiosity, an answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about the magical
arithmetic.</div><a name="080129125000175"></a>

Fitzpatrick:</b> I shall ask the Committee to reject the
amendment. However, I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Cornwall
for tabling it. I will explain why it should be rejected and will try
to address the point raised by the right hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon.</div><a name="080129125000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will place restrictions on how far orders granting development consent
can go in authorising the compulsory purchase of common land, open
space and fuel or field garden allotments. The restrictions are drawn
from section 19 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. They provide that
any order granting development consent that would also authorise the
compulsory purchase of common land and other specified types of land
can be made only after being confirmed by means of a special
parliamentary procedure. There are two exceptions to that: first, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>where less than 200 sq m of common land will be acquired; secondly,
where the applicant offers replacement land. I draw the attention of
the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon to the explanatory notes
for the Planning Bill. On clause 114, they state clearly that</div>
<a name="080129125000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary of State is
satisfied either that:</div><a name="080129125000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">a)
replacement land has been or will be given in exchange and that it will
be subject to the same rights, trusts and
incidents;</div><a name="080129125000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">b) the land is being
acquired in order to secure its
preservation&#148;.</div><a name="080129125000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that addresses the point that he has
raised.</div><a name="080129125000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000499"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The fact of the matter is that with a road or a
pipeline, there is likely to be common land on both sides. Where will
we find the land that compensates for the land that has been taken,
other than outside the common? If it is outside the common, how can the
Secretary of State satisfy herself, in the terms of the Bill, that
those rights can be attached to the new piece of land? It will not have
those rights to start
with.</div><a name="080129125000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000500"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> Clearly, were the Secretary of State not
satisfied, and the parliamentary procedure used, any hon. Member could
object to the proposal. I understand the important issues that the
right hon. Gentleman raises on transferring rights and entitlements,
but the clause simply repeats provisions that are already extant in the
1981 Act. It will not introduce any new provisions or remove any
existing rights. In that sense, the clause is simply a
repetition.</div><a name="080129125000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about the
reason for the figure of 209.03 sq m, it is a straightforward
conversion from the imperial measurement in the 1981 Act. That is how
we end up with that rather obscure
figure.</div><a name="080129125000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="080129125000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third
exception exists. Special parliamentary procedure would not be required
in this regard if the compulsory acquisition of common land is being
carried out in order to secure its preservation or improve its
management. Amendment No. 403 would require the Secretary of State in
such cases to publish a statement explaining the means and extent of
any preservation or improvements. The effect of the amendment would be
problematic as it would require the Secretary of State to make a
statement whether or not she was the decision maker. Furthermore, this
statement would presumably be required before the decision was made,
which would pose difficulties as the Secretary of State would not have
been involved in the examination of the
application.</div><a name="080129125000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I understand the concerns of the hon. Member for North Cornwall that
the promoters of nationally significant infrastructure projects could
claim to be acquiring common land for its preservation or management as
a loophole to avoid needing to provide replacement land. I hope that I
can reassure him and the Committee that we share his concern and that
the Government are currently considering tabling an amendment that
would prevent such a situation arising. With that assurance and the
explanation of the other points, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
If the Government decide not to pursue the matter, he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>can return to it on Report. But as we intend to bring forward an
amendment that should meet his needs, he should let us do the
work.</div>
<a name="080129125000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000501"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Were I to table an amendment on Report to change
209.03 sq m to 210 sq m, on the grounds that a nice round figure makes
disputes less likely&#151;I would hate to fall out with somebody over
0.03 of a metre&#151;would it be regarded as a concession that went
beyond the Government&#146;s compass? As we have had no concessions
of any description up to now, would a piece of land of about that size
meet with the Government&#146;s approval? The suggestion is just in
order to have a nice, tidy metric system, which I am rather in favour
of.</div><a name="080129125000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000502"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I understand exactly where the right hon.
Gentleman is coming from. I am personally a big fan of imperial
measures. I would rather have seen the figure left as it was in the
Land Acquisition Act. However, we do have an amendment to go to 200 sq
m, if that would suit him. It is, however, a reduction in the amount
that is contained in the Bill at present. I have heard what he has
said. Obviously, we will reflect on his suggestion, and he will have
the opportunity to return to the matter.</div>
<a name="080129125000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, if there is no
equivalent land to replace it with, the expectation is that the
Secretary of State would simply not certify it and it would go to a
special parliamentary
procedure.</div><a name="080129125000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000503"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. There are perhaps
one or two problems with the clause in relation to that provision for
compulsory purchase if it takes place without adequate explanation. I
am grateful to the Minister for considering that. I am also grateful to
him for standing up for imperial measurements and getting involved in
that debate. As someone of a generation who was taught metric but was
surrounded by adults who quoted back in imperial, I use that as an
excuse for not being good at metalwork, woodwork or anything like
that.</div><a name="080129125000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad to

to extinguish a right of way may not have been a significant part of
the overall debate on the application or on site-specific national
policy statements. The previous consultation will have addressed the
bigger issues and people in the local community may not have noticed
what was happening to the rights of way. At the end of the process when
the development consent is granted it is important that the issue is
drawn to the attention of local people so that they have the chance to
comment on it. It may affect only one or two people but in a very
significant way, and they may not have been aware of it when they were

its construction, its size, transport issues and so on.</div>

opportunities in the Bill as a matter of principle. Rights of way
generate surprisingly strong feelings, as hon. Members know from our
constituency postbags. It is better to have a requirement to have
regard to consultation and to ensure that people feel that they have a
fair crack of the whip, rather than a group of dedicated ramblers, for
example, going for judicial review arguing that their concerns about a
right of way that is precious to them have not been properly taken on

the Government will be sympathetic to the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div><a name="080129125000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000508"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> As my hon. Friend said, this is a complex issue. On
one hand, I am very sympathetic to farmers who find that a right of way
goes straight across their working surfaces&#151;for example, through
the centre of a farmyard where animals are kept&#151;and any attempt
to divert it to a more sensible path usually meets with huge
resistance.</div><a name="080129125000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
other hand, many arable farmers display agriculture at its most
bloody-minded in their absolute refusal to obey the law, which is that
when land on which there is a public footpath is ploughed over, it
should be made good within a certain time. But that land is often
deliberately left so that to go across it is like engaging in an
endurance test because walkers end up with mud up to their knees. There
are important enforcement issues to be
considered.</div><a name="080129125000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of
common sense needs to be brought to the issue. People need to recognise
that there are genuine concerns about the management of livestock, and
rights of way need to have a sensible regard to them. Equally, those
historical rights of way have not been put there for the express
purpose of interfering with the work of the agricultural community and
irritating them, but it would be much better for all concerned if they
did the minimum required to ensure that they are observed effectively.
Those who do it rarely have cause for concern, but there are few issues
that get people more angry than the obvious disregard of something
through, as I have described it, sheer
bloody-mindedness.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000509"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> We all know, for example, that the procedure for
stopping a current right of way, a stop order, is time-honoured and
defined in law, and I am sure that many of us have had experience of
inquiries of that kind. I am concerned about the wording of paragraph
(b), which states
that</div><a name="080129125000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision of
an alternative right of way is not required.&#148;</div>
<a name="080129125000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who is to decide that?</div>
<a name="080129125000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us think about public
footpaths, which often join up with one other. If a public footpath
does not join up with another, is that a reason for saying that it is
not necessary? For example, if there were two footpaths in a locality
running roughly in the same direction, does that mean that one is not
necessary? I would be wary of ditching the current procedure whereby
age-old usage and local conditions are examined, along with whether
they link up with others and are in reasonable repair.</div>
<a name="080129125000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be the first to say
that there have been occasions when our friends in the Ramblers
Association have suddenly decided that they use a footpath that they
have not known for half a century previously, and spin out the costs in
time, money and sometimes a great deal of frustration. That said, there
are many public rights of way that people are reliant upon and that
have existed for good purpose over many generations, so I am wary of
the clause&#146;s working because I would not like someone totally
divorced from the locality to decide suddenly that a footpath is not
necessary, for whatever specious reason there might be. In his
response, perhaps the Minister could tell the Committee what kind of
reasons are likely to be adduced to support the contention that a right
of way is not necessary, as that would be quite useful for the
debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div><a name="080129125000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080129125000510"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I am
grateful for the opportunity to ask the Minister to clarify the wording
of the clause, because I am interested in the words &#147;is not
required.&#148; On a variety of occasions I have had to deal with the
protection of rights of way and have found myself at different times on
different sides of the argument. For instance, many people will recall
the van Hoogstraten case, concerning an outrageous obstruction of a
public footpath where maintenance of the right of way was absolutely
crucial. However, there has often been obstruction to the closure of
rights of way in circumstances where closure is necessary for the
reduction of crime and disorder, such as on council estates and in
inner-city locations.</div>
<a name="080129125000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few years ago, we clarified
some of that in legislation in order to make it possible for
appropriate closures to take place. The problem is that we all want
appropriate closure and protection, and the definition of which is
which, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, is not
always easy. Therefore, being absolutely clear about what is meant by
the words &#147;is not required&#148; is important, and it would be
helpful if the Minister could spell that out.</div>
<a name="080129125000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some concern that
public opinion could be the only arbiter of whether a particular
closure takes place. There are some places where all sorts of closures
would take place on the basis of instinctive public opinion, despite
their being necessary for people to get around. In other circumstances,
public opinion is absolutely the right criterion to use. Again, the
devil is in the detail, so my concern is to be absolutely clear what
the clause means and to ensure that there is no danger of unintended
consequences, where wording is intended to mean one thing but perhaps
at a later stage could be interpreted through case law to mean
something rather different. Therefore, the clearest possible
explanation from the Minister of the test for whether an alternative
right of way is required would be extremely
helpful.</div><a name="080129125000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000511"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> The Government do not support the amendment.
The clause specifies that an order granting development consent cannot
extinguish public rights of way over land, unless the authority making
it is satisfied that alternative rights of way have been provided or
that none are required. That point has been raised by my right hon.
Friend and other colleagues in the debate. The procedures are drawn
from section 32 of the Acquisition of Land Act
1981.</div><a name="080129125000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would compel the decision maker to have regard to public consultation
before deciding that an alternative right of way is not required. That
might prove difficult if the decision maker was required to hold their
own public consultation for the purposes of this section. Such an
additional consultation would be expensive and could delay unreasonably
the final determination of the
application.</div><a name="080129125000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any
case, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary. The application as
a whole would already have undergone extensive consultation, been
widely publicised and been examined in detail. It would have been open
about any rights of way to be extinguished, and any person concerned
about the proposal would have the opportunity to make representations
to the promoter, or subsequently to the IPC on that
matter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div><a name="080129125000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000512"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> That is the crux of the matter: &#147;has the
right to make representations&#148;. As the law stands, the person
would have an opportunity to address, effectively, a tribunal hearing,
or an inquiry. Therefore, the member of the public loses the right to
challenge that procedure at inquiry level that they would previously
have had. Now we are down solely to representations; that is a major
concern.</div><a name="080129125000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000513"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> As I said, the application would have to have
been open about any rights of way, and any person concerned could make
representations. Any representation would have to be taken into account
by the IPC if it was relevant, particularly in deciding whether a right
of way was needed. We understand the importance of the
issue.</div><a name="080129125000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have the
power to issue guidance on consultation in clause 37, which we have
previously discussed. We intend that it would include guidance on the
right of way. An example of a right of way that may no longer be
required, as asked for by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy,
would perhaps be a cliffside path that has been washed away by erosion
but would still exist in law, or a right of way that has fallen into
disuse. Apparently there is clear case law on those types of
definitions and it would apply in those
instances.</div><a name="080129125000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000514"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> It is not clear to me what my hon. Friend is
drawing from those two examples. For instance, a clifftop right of way,
which is an important aspect of access that Government policy supports
strongly, would surely still be required. Is that the interpretation he
is placing on that example? Also, he used the words
&#147;needed&#148; and &#147;required&#148;. The Bill contains
the word &#147;required&#148;, but it is not clear from what he has
said what is meant by
that.</div><a name="080129125000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000515"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I have been trying to reassure the Committee
that there is case law in respect of the matter, that there are
instances in which there will no longer be a requirement for a
particular right of way, that the representations that individuals can
make are already contained within the consultative procedures, and that
there would be no loss of rights, as there would be relevant
representation for the examination, including the open floor
stage.</div><a name="080129125000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000516"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> The Minister is obviously engaging fully with the
matter. All the case law is predicated on the fact that there is
currently a statutory right to a full inquiry. That is the crux of the
matter. I do not want to delay matters unnecessarily and perpetuate
quasi-tribunals that might not be of any use, but we are talking about
a time-honoured statutory procedure. People who feel aggrieved because
they think they will lose what they believe to be their age-old rights
of access will no longer have recourse to an inquiry. They will simply
be allowed to send in a submission within the ambit of the planning
procedure; in other words, they will be consulted in a way, but that is
all.</div> <a name="080129125000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, the case law on the issue is extensive, and often decisions are
made on the quality and quantity of use&#151;how many people use a
footpath, how long it has been used, whether there is evidence that the
local council have maintained it or it has fallen into disrepair and so
on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div><a name="080129125000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s examples
are obvious ones that would cause no problem to anyone, but many fall
into another category, which would create problems. For example, people
rely on footpaths for recreation and other purposes, and they might
find their representations on what might seem to be a trivial matter
have been brushed aside in the interests of a larger scheme. For a
local village or town the matter is not trivial but very important. The
Bill is in danger of trampling on people&#146;s ancient
rights.</div>
<a name="080129125000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000517"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I recognise the sensitivity and significance
of the issue. We have had many discussions about previous procedures
and ways of doing things, and this proposal changes things, but we want
to reassure everyone who is interested that we are trying to strengthen
the consultative arrangements by having a pre-application stage and a
hearing.</div> <a name="080129125000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tried to
explain to the hon. Gentleman that there will be no loss of the right
to complain to the inquiry. There will be relevant representations for
examination during the open floor stage of hearings. Individuals will
still have the right to make those
representations&#151;</div><a name="080129125000224"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000520"></a>Mr.

because the IPC could decide not to allow examination or
cross-examination at that stage. Therefore, any objector could be
muffled.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000522"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I want to underline what the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said. I have been involved in many inquiries
about public rights of way and I know the fundamental importance of
cross-examination. The veracity or otherwise of evidence of long use
can usually be tested only by assiduous cross-examination. If that is
to be abandoned as a result of the proposed procedure, people&#146;s
rights will be trampled on, as the hon. Gentleman
said.</div>
<a name="080129125000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000523"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> We are returning to previous discussions
about the adequacy of the consultative arrangements being put in place,
whether the IPC will be able to satisfy people that their concerns are
being listened to and whether they have an adequate opportunity to put
them before the appropriate authorities. We are confident that the
arrangements we propose are more than adequate, and we oppose the
amendment on that
basis.</div><a name="080129125000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000524"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister sets great store by the fact that
there will be an examination of the overall application. However,
subsidiary changes are proposed in this and other clauses to what will
happen in the local area based on the main applications. The wider
environmental impact will be considered primarily, and that will be
people&#146;s biggest concern. Consideration will also be given to
transport implications and all sorts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>of matters that were set out in the national policy statements and how
they should be applied locally once an application has been
submitted.</div> <a name="080129125000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rights of
way will not necessarily occur to people straight away. They might come
to the fore only later on, when it would be too late for them to be
considered in the open hearing. People will quite rightly have been
exercised by the bigger picture and the totality of the development.
There might be other provisions and unforeseen consequences. In the
application and consultation, the applicant may have put on page 753,
line 22: &#147;PS: We&#146;re going to take away your right of
access.&#148; That is not good enough. On matters as contentious as
rights of way, where there are established processes for addressing the
issues, I think that the Government have gone far enough. We have heard
from hon. Members how important such provisions are to
people.</div><a name="080129125000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very
generously, the Minister said that he will look again at the provisions
under clause 114. I think that it is unfortunate that he has decided
not to do so under this clause. Having heard about these concerns from
hon. Members of all parties, it is important that we test the

<a name="080129125000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000546"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this we may discuss clauses 128 and 129
stand
part.</div><a name="080129125000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000547"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I have only a brief question on clause 129. I note
that it refers to a building being erected, extended, altered or
re-erected. The building can only be used for</div>
<a name="080129125000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the purposes for which the
building is authorised to be
used.&#148;</div><a name="080129125000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">For how long does
that definition extend? Our country is covered with
buildings that started with one purpose and have been converted to
another. If an infrastructure development becomes redundant at some
point, the associated buildings become redundant&#151;the
infrastructure could remain, but, for all sorts of reasons, the
building could become redundant. Is there, in essence, a covenant on
that building, or can its use be authorised to be
changed?</div><a name="080129125000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000548"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I have a question about clause 129(2), which
states:</div><a name="080129125000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If no
purpose is so specified, the consent is taken to authorise the use of
the building for the purpose for which it is
designed.&#148;</div><a name="080129125000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if my hon. Friend can explain how the purpose is defined for
that subsection. I ask because of a recent planning application in my
area where there was a debate between members of the public and the
local authority, which had to reach a determination on the application,
about the purpose of a building that was being converted and the
intentions of the developers. Sometimes, the purposes are very
straightforward&#151;for instance, with residential or commercial
properties&#151;but sometimes they are considerably less clear, as
with this particular application. Will he explain what is meant
by</div><a name="080129125000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the purpose for
which it is
designed&#148;?</div><a name="080129125000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it a
question of what is set out in the application or is there some other
meaning?</div><a name="080129125000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000549"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> Clause 129 specifies that where a development
consent order is made that includes the erection or alteration of a
building, the order may specify the purposes for which the building can
be used. Where the development consent order is silent about this
matter, it is to be assumed that the building will be used for whatever
purpose it was designed. That provision ensures that the IPC can
specify, in the terms of a development consent, what a building will be
used for and thereby ensure that, subject to the applicant receiving
any necessary operational or safety consents from the appropriate
regulator, there will be no regulatory gap preventing him from using
the building for the purpose for which consent was
granted.</div><a name="080129125000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to my right hon. Friend, the nature or purpose of a building will be
determined and defined by the application. In response to the hon.
Lady, a building can be used for the purpose for which it was intended
or designed, but not only for that purpose.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div><a name="080129125000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must confess that on reading
clause 129, I consulted my officials because it is the last clause that
I am responsible for in this sitting. I sensed that this was the
elephant trap because it did not look very convincing to me. I am
assured very strongly that this provision is for legal clarity in
respect of an application that is submitted for consent. It will ensure
that there is no gap at the end of the application and that, as I have
explained, the building can be used for the purpose for which it was
designed or for that which is stated in the
application&#151;whichever is
appropriate.</div><a name="080129125000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000550"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I think that I understand what my hon. Friend is
saying, but I would like to be clear. The words in the clause mean that
it is not what a designer had in mind when they were drawing the plans,
but what is stated by the applicant in the application for permission
that determines the
purpose.</div><a name="080129125000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000551"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> My right hon. Friend is very experienced in
bringing legislation forward and in interpreting the words that are on
paper. Clause 129(2)
states:</div><a name="080129125000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If no
purpose is so specified, the consent is taken to authorise the use of
the building for the purpose for which it is
designed.&#148;</div><a name="080129125000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
application does not say that it will be an extraction room, but it is
clearly an extraction room because of the nature of the equipment that
is in it, the fact that the application is silent on that issue will
give some certainty to those who are watching the construction as to
the nature of the
building.</div><a name="080129125000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000552"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> So that I have got it on the record, if a building
subsequently becomes redundant, can somebody apply for it to be used
for another purpose? I would like just a quick yes or
no.</div><a name="080129125000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000553"></a>Jim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000554"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in
clause 130, page 60, line 39, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) The
measuring and marking out of land shall not constitute development for
the purposes of this
section.&#146;.</div><a name="080129125000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have another change of personnel and voice to keep everyone with us.
The amendment would ensure that there is an effective time limit for
the new criminal offence. After all, it involves a substantial
financial penalty: &#163;50,000 on summary conviction, which is well
above the normal rung for such matters, and an unlimited fine on
indictment. Therefore, it clearly envisages a harsh penalty.</div>
<a name="080129125000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that situation, it is
right and proper that there should be an effective time limit for the
bringing of proceedings, as with all criminal offences.
Clause 132, as it stands, provides for a four-year time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 507</div>limit for bringing charges for committing the new
offence&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I have read the
wrong sheet, and am grateful to hon. Members for correcting me. I have
my briefing notes here and have moved on to the wrong clause.</div>
<a name="080129125000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">When dealing with a
substantial financial penalty, it is important that it is proportionate
to the operation concerned, and amendment No. 27 would deal with some
case law, sometimes referred to as the Malvern hills case, about the
definition of what the commencement of development can be. In a
nutshell, the Malvern hills case indicates that setting out the pegs
for laying out a road constitutes the commencement of development.
Perhaps other members of the Committee have a more detailed awareness
of these issues than I do, but that case certainly seems to be well
settled and the lawyers, who naturally take an interest in those
matters, have advised us that that is the potential
situation.</div> <a name="080129125000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it
really proportionate, which is the issue that the amendment seeks to
raise with the Government, to put someone at risk of such a substantial
financial penalty when all that has happened is in itself a minor
operation? I can see that it has consequences and should be stopped if
unauthorised. We are not talking about anything to the contrary, but
there are other mechanisms to stop that development. It seems to us
that that does not come into the same category of someone who carries
out a significant piece of
development.</div><a name="080129125000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000555"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, because when one looks
at clause 127(2)(e), one sees that it states that &#147;Material
operation&#148; will include</div>
<a name="080129125000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an operation in the course of
laying out or constructing a
road&#148;.</div><a name="080129125000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">An anomaly will
be entrenched in the
Bill.</div><a name="080129125000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000556"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that. He
reinforces our point. Given that that could be rectified much more
readily through the other procedures available, it seems excessive that
someone who simply sets out the pegs potentially commits an offence
that brings down such a penalty.</div>
<a name="080129125000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of our concern throughout
has been that the Bill and the regime that it sets out command public
confidence. It seems to be excessively heavy handed and out of
proportion for someone who might act in good faith to be liable for
that criminal offence because of a misapprehension about the position,
despite having been put right. Indeed, a four-year time limit for the
bringing of proceedings seems to be simply too much, and that is why we
seek to place that modest, but important, limit in the interests of
fairness.</div><a name="080129125000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000557"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:</b> I support the amendment and will give an example
from the area in which I live. In Aberdovey, which is a small, charming
village on the Cardigan coast, about 200 planning permissions going
back to the 1960s are still viable because of a tiny amount of work on
laying out the roadway into the village. The consequence has been that
anyone along that coast seeking planning permission, even for one
house, is told, &#147;I am sorry. There are too many permissions
already.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div><a name="080129125000418"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="080129125000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that a
development should be far more substantial to qualify as material.
Otherwise, unfortunately, there will be land banks here, there and
everywhere. People will decide to invest their money in a piece of land
for development, put in a slight amount of infrastructure, leave it
there for 25 years, and, bingo, there is their pension policy. At the
same time, it will skew all planning policy and practicalities in the
local area, as I have seen, to the detriment of my constituents. I hope
that the Government will seriously consider the
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000558"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Parmjit Dhanda):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John, albeit in the
autumn days of this Committee
sitting.</div><a name="080129125000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
some reassurance to the hon. Members for Bromley and Chislehurst and
for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The amendment seeks to ensure that the
measuring and marking out of land does not count as development, for
which a person could be prosecuted if they did not have a consent
order. Marking out land is quite different from the definition of
laying out a road&#151;they are quite separate and different things.
I do not believe that the amendment is necessary. Under clause 127,
development will be taken to have begun when a</div>
<a name="080129125000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;material operation comprised in
the development begins to be carried
out.&#148;</div><a name="080129125000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000559"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Is the Minister saying that those who advise him
can reassure me that the laying out of pegs on the site, under
circumstances such as we and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
have been talking about, would not be caught by the definitions in the
Malvern hills
case?</div><a name="080129125000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000560"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I will make the situation clear by going through
the list of enforcement issues that are relevant and those that are
not, for the benefit of the
Committee.</div><a name="080129125000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">A material
operation is defined in clause 127(2)
as</div><a name="080129125000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) a work of

development.&#148;</div><a name="080129125000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measuring and marking out of land therefore does not count as
development under the legislation, with the sole exception of laying
out a road that is specifically catered for.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div><a name="080129125000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must re-emphasise to the
Committee that clause 130 is specifically about nationally significant
infrastructure projects that do not have consent. That is important.
Clause 131 is a slight variant on that, and deals with a situation
where a person has consent but is deviating from
it.</div><a name="080129125000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000561"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister is right to point out that some of
these matters might more properly have been discussed under other
clauses&#151;such as clauses 126 and 127, on when development
begins&#151;that we have skipped over as we have rapidly made
progress.</div><a name="080129125000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
know whether the Government have considered this question, and I hope
that it is not out of order, Sir John, but it concerns me whether, once
development has begun, there is a period within which it should be
completed. We have doubtless all seen examples in our constituencies of
a building being begun and then being left for a long time, but the
development consent standing because some work has been going on. Have
the Government looked at that issue, too? A major infrastructure
project could be begun and then halted, for whatever reason, for a
number of years, with environmental consequences for people in the
surrounding
area.</div><a name="080129125000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000562"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Yes, and the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst is coming to that issue with amendments to clauses in part
8. I hope that I have managed to give the assurances that the hon.
Gentleman sought. The amendment is consequently unnecessary and I urge
him to withdraw
it.</div><a name="080129125000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000563"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am only partly reassured. I understand the
Minister&#146;s intentions, but concern remains about how the
definitions that he read out from the Bill are likely to be construed
if it comes to litigation in court. We have imported &#147;material
development&#148; from the town and country planning legislation into
the second element of the test. The Malvern hills case was decided
under that legislation. I am not sure that we have yet got to a stage
where we have effectively excluded a result that we both seem to want
to achieve. Perhaps I can leave it this way: we will take further
advice. If I do not press the amendment now, perhaps there could be
some discussion to ensure clarity. If not, we might need to return to
this issue on Report. That said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080129125000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000564"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst is concerned that developers might get walloped unfairly
for what they do. My concern is that they do not get walloped enough
for the things they do unfairly. Some developers are given an inch and
they try to take a mile. They know that the local authority will be
very reluctant to take enforcement action because it costs an arm and a
leg. The entire budget of the smallest local authorities that are
planning authorities may be &#163;7 million or &#163;8 million.
Even a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>fairly significantly sized local authority would have a budget of less
than &#163;20 million. Planning officials are therefore extremely
reluctant to commit the local authority to embark upon a great case for
enforcement. Equally, they are often reluctant to refuse planning
permission because they do not then want to have to face the costs of
going to the inquiry and contesting that planning permission.</div>
<a name="080129125000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways the odds are
rather stacked against local authorities. We know that some companies
resent the whole business of planning permission in any case; they
regard it as unnecessary bureaucratic interference. They get permission
for X, and they do X plus, and there is a deliberate challenge to the
local authority to take enforcement action. The roof-lines might be
somewhat higher than agreed; the intensity of development might be
somewhat more than planned. Equally, we all know that in the corner of
a field there might be a shed, and five years later 5 acres of
landscaped gardens and goodness knows what else has been built there
without planning permission. A deliberate gamble is taken that the
local authority will eventually cave in.</div>
<a name="080129125000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I subscribe to the belief that
we should try to make planning more rapid, effective and transparent,
but the quid pro quo is that where people deliberately try it on, the
powers to prevent that from happening should also be reinforced. I
should be grateful if the Government considered looking at this issue
so that, perhaps during the Bill&#146;s later stages, we can get more
of a balance. We need to balance the acceleration that we all agree is
necessary with the reassurance that it will not mean that people who
are somewhat cavalier with the rules will get away with it, because of
local authority reluctance, for whatever reason, to get into the
significant legal tangle of taking enforcement measures that could even
result in the demolition of the development
itself.</div><a name="080129125000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000565"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> That is a very helpful contribution, and those are
the steps that part 8 tries to take. It is not just about the hefty
fine of up to &#163;50,000 for developments without consent, which
has already been mentioned. The later clauses in part 8 make it
incumbent on developers who do not have permission to take down the
development in question in some cases; indeed, under certain clauses
the local planning authority can enter the land, take the development
down and bill the developer for doing so. I hope that that reassures
the right hon. Gentleman that this clause and others in part 8 take
into account his understandable concerns.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000566"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 420, in
clause 132, page 61, line 28, leave
out paragraph (a).</div> <a name="080129125000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the matter that I inadvertently anticipated
earlier&#151;the time limits for bringing
prosecutions. The clause puts a four-year time limit on bringing
prosecutions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>for the new offence of carrying out development without consent or of
breaching the terms of an order granting consent. However, under the
clause, someone could be charged with one of the offences after the
expiry of the four-year time limit if the local authority had applied
for an injunction under clause 141 or if it had been served with an
information notice under clause 137. The injunction probably relates to
something that is fairly significant: a development that actually
happened and on which some restraint is required. There will be some
certainty in such a case because there will be a hearing on the
injunction and the court will make a definitive order.</div>
<a name="080129125000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am more concerned about the
use of the information notice under clause 137 because it would require
the person on whom it is served to provide information about any
operations they are undertaking to enable the authority to determine
whether one of the criminal offences has been committed. The notice
would then hang over that person, whether or not the information
process is proceeding. Once the notice is served, the time that it
takes for that notice to be complied with&#151;it will depend on the
complications and nature of the works that are going on&#151;will
extend the time available for bringing proceedings. If an authority
were strongly opposed to a developer, the time available could be
stretched considerably longer than the four-year period.</div>
<a name="080129125000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most people who have been
involved in these things know that quite often in development, there
may be a minor infringement of the conditions by, perhaps, a
subcontractor acting in good faith. If those infringements are dealt
with sensibly, the problem can be put right. In theory, however, the
authority would be able to serve an information notice and trigger the
provisions of the Act. Even if the information notice was served very
shortly before the expiry of the four years, until the whole rigmarole
was complied with, the risk of criminal prosecution would
arise.</div> <a name="080129125000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a lot of
notices were served, one after the other&#151;as far as we can see,
there is nothing to stop that if the local authority comes back with
another notice after the first one has been served&#151;the time in
which there is a threat of prosecution would continue well beyond the
four-year period. I suspect that that is an unintended consequence of
the proposal, and the amendment would remove it.</div>
<a name="080129125000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view, which is held by
many practitioners in this sector, is that although we do not have a
problem in principle with the enforcement provisions of development
consent orders, they might be better served if they followed the
existing enforcement regime under section 171B of the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990. That is why we tabled the amendment and it will be
interesting to hear what the Minister
says.</div><a name="080129125000419"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000567"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I listened closely to what the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst said in his case for the amendment. However, I
also have in the back of my mind the case put forward by the right hon.
Member for Skipton and Ripon about ensuring that enforcement is as
powerful as possible. There are many cases every week around the
country of smaller developments of the nature that he mentioned, such
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>where roof lines are built slightly too big. However, we are talking not
about that, but about very significant
projects.</div><a name="080129125000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is unlikely that the developers that we are talking about, having
invested so much time in this process, will step outside the law. I do
not think that there will be many cases of that. Having invested much
time and effort in getting a huge application such as this through the
process, it is unlikely that they will jump the gun. However, it is
important that there is a clear provision that is as flexible as
possible for enforcement to be carried out. On this occasion, I am not
sure that I agree with the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst.</div><a name="080129125000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000568"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> There is an interesting piece of triangulation on
the Committee because I am inclined to agree with the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst. In a peculiar way, that gives the right hon.
Member for Skipton and Ripon what he has been asking for all this time.
He was saying that we have not given in on
anything.</div><a name="080129125000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has been talking to
his old friends in the Law Society, and I confess that he is on to
something. He expressed concerns that the clause, which is about
invoking time limits for enforcement action, will mean that if an
information notice is served under clause 137 before the expiry of the
four-year time limit, a developer could find themselves faced with the
indefinite threat of legal proceedings, under one of the new criminal
proceedings. That may well happen because a local authority that is for
ever opposed to a nationally significant infrastructure project could
choose to use this process as a mechanism to keep the enforcement
going. I am sympathetic to that
point.</div><a name="080129125000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are considering the application of time limits to the enforcement
provisions. In doing so, we will be happy to take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns into account and will come back to him at a
later stage. Although I am not accepting his amendment as worded, due
to the potential consequences attached to it, I am happy to return to
the matter and take on board what he has said. He has a fair
point.</div><a name="080129125000334"></a>

amendment No. 29, in clause 133, page 61, leave out lines 38 to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000572"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> The amendments are about
proportionality in respect of rights of entry. Quite simply, they seek
to redress the balance. We understand that there will be circumstances
in which rights of entry are appropriate, but we are concerned that the
Government are going too far in giving draconian powers of entry to
people&#146;s property and, in some instances, to what may be their
home.</div><a name="080129125000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not agree
with the Government&#146;s contention that it could be appropriate
for somebody to enter a dwelling without notice, and so have tabled
amendment No. 29. The Government are proposing that someone can go in
with 24 hours&#146; notice being given to the occupier of a dwelling.
We think that that is very limited. If somebody is away, for example,
that does not give them very much time at all, yet it is a significant
intrusion into their home. That is why we are saying that if someone
wants to go into someone&#146;s home, they should get a warrant under
clause 134 rather than rely on the power to enter without one under
clause 133.</div><a name="080129125000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that there will be circumstances in which someone will wish
to enter other premises&#151;business premises and so on&#151;and,
because that involves less intrusion into people&#146;s private
lives, to which they have a right under domestic law and the European
convention on human rights, we do not have quite the same difficulty
with that. However, we think that there ought to be an attempt to give
notice first.</div><a name="080129125000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
trigger should be that if the premises is a business premises, someone
should seek to give notice and, if that is not possible, go in without
a warrant. If it is a dwelling house, or a family house, it is not that
onerous to get a warrant. It does not really take that long to get one.
Those of us who have had experience in criminal law will know that a
warrant can be applied for quickly if there is an emergency. I
appreciate that there will sometimes be such cases, but entry to a
dwelling should require the extra
safeguard.</div><a name="080129125000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000573"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am afraid that I am not about to give in again
to the hon. Gentleman. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The bubbles
are evaporating
indeed.</div><a name="080129125000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
about enforcement. The idea of a dwelling on the site of a nationally
significant infrastructure project is an interesting notion. It almost
goes back to the point made some days ago by the hon. Member for
Beckenham about nuclear fusion&#151;perhaps within a household, who
knows?</div><a name="080129125000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is quite fair for the clause to require 24
hours&#146; notice if we are talking about the remote possibility of
a house on a site where there is development taking place, or if there
is a nationally significant infrastructure project at the bottom of the
garden. The Bill is consistent with the Town and Country Planning Acts.
It gives the local planning authority the element of surprise in the
likely scenario that it is actually the developer on the site who is
perhaps doing something that he should not be doing. For those reasons,
enforcement is important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div><a name="080129125000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000574"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I shall return to the issue of what dwelling houses
might be on a site. Is the Minister&#146;s advice that the clause
would not permit entry into a dwelling that is not on the site of a
major infrastructure structure project&#151;it might be the home, let
us say, of the developer or the engineer&#151;to seize documents,
plans and other correspondence that might indicate whether instructions
had been given to carry out works on the site? It seems that if someone
were carrying out the investigation, one of the things that they might
seek to do is to go into the offices to get the drawings, for example.
That is the situation that I am particularly interested in. Is the
Minister saying that that would not be
covered?</div><a name="080129125000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000575"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am saying that the clause is specifically about
getting on to a site. We will be moving on to another clause, and
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, that deal with
a local planning authority not being able to access a site, the role of
the justice of the peace, and giving a period of forewarning prior to
accessing a site. Clause 133 gives an important power to local planning
authorities to get on to a site, and to do so with an element of
surprise.</div>
<a name="080129125000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000576"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I understand much of what the Minister says. I do
not want to sound ungrateful, but I have some residual concerns. It is
possible that they can be met, but first I should speak again to those
to whom I spoke about the previous clause. If concern remains, we can
return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

debate is related to that prompted by amendments Nos. 28 and 29. It is
to do with the phrase &#147;reasonable period&#148;. Hon. and

that I should not be alarmed about it. The amendment simply suggests a
period within which people should be notified that a warrant has been

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000579"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The clause is particularly relevant in the event
that entry has been refused to a development site. It provides that a
justice of the peace may issue a warrant authorising a person
authorised by the local planning authority to enter the land. The
conditions are</div> <a name="080129125000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence...is
being, or has been, committed&#148;</div>
<a name="080129125000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">under clauses 130 or 131; that entry to

case.</div> <a name="080129125000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 134(4)
provides that entry is to be regarded as having been refused if no
reply to request for admission has been received within a reasonable
period. The hon. Member for North Cornwall suggests 14 days&#151;a
popular time for him&#151;but the amendment is not necessary. I shall
explain why.</div><a name="080129125000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is based on similar provisions in the town and country
planning regime, which have historically worked very well. It allows
the JP, when considering an application for a warrant, to reach a view
on whether a reasonable period has been given for a response. The JP
may well decide that that period should be 14 days, or that it is more
urgent than that. I suggest to the Committee that the provision has
worked well in town and country planning, and that we should follow
that model in part 8 of the
Bill.</div><a name="080129125000420"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

of entry: the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000581"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The clause deals with an issue that has
concerned me throughout: Crown land being given an exemption that does
not apply to any other land. I can see that there are particular
facilities or areas to which one would not expect a right of entry.
There is a facility in my constituency operated by GCHQ that I would
not expect the local planning authority to be able to get access to
easily. However, Crown land is a wide definition, and an awful lot of
land could be covered. I am concerned that the Government could perhaps
have defined it a little more closely and that Crown land is too widely
defined.</div><a name="080129125000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000582"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I shall aim to provide clarity for the hon.
Gentleman. The clause specifies that the rights of entry that we have
just discussed under clauses 133 and 134 do not apply to Crown land.
Clause 175 states that offences under the Bill do not apply to the
Crown; hence, powers of entry are not required. That clause is
equivalent to section 296A of the Town and Country 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>Planning Act 1990. It is a standard provision that the Crown cannot
commit an offence under planning
legislation.</div>
<a name="080129125000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rights of entry to Crown land
are strictly controlled. Although we have disapplied them under part 8
of the Bill for the reasons that I have set out, other rights of entry
powers can be exercised if the appropriate Crown authority gives
consent, such as under clause 48. Examples of such an exemption include
Ministry of Defence land, in relation to which it is clearly right that
there should be additional safeguards. In short, the intention is to
make the Bill consistent with the 1990
Act.</div><a name="080129125000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000583"></a>Dan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000585"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I have one question on clause 138 and offences
relating to information notices, on which I am sure the Minister can
help me. Earlier in the Bill, in clause 130, we set up the offence of
development without development consent, which is punishable on summary
conviction and on indictment. Interestingly, in clause 138,
particularly subsection (4), we are considering&#151;it is a common
enough formulation&#151;an offence that, under certain circumstances,
such as making a statement that one knows to be false or misleading in
material respects, might be argued to import dishonesty, and probably
would, given the facts of certain cases.</div>
<a name="080129125000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagine that the reason for
the provision is that the Minister seeks to follow the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990 approach and other precedent. We have talked about
lower-level breaches, and I shall sound like my right hon. Friend the
Member for Skipton and Ripon now, but when there is dishonesty
involving a potentially important breach in relation to a substantial
project with significant sums at stake, would it be appropriate to make
that offence triable on indictment, too?</div>
<a name="080129125000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000586"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman makes a good point. If
he looks closely at clause 138(3), he will see that for failing to
respond to the information notice, one can incur a level 3 fine, which
is &#163;1,000. However, he makes a fair point that if one
deliberately misleads, there should be a bigger fine, and subsection
(5) states that if there is an offence under subsection (4), the fine
will not exceed level 5, which is &#163;5,000. So we have taken the
issue into consideration and I hope that he will be satisfied, because
we have done so for the reasons that he outlined. If someone
deliberately misleads, it is a bigger
offence.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div><a name="080129125000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000587"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I understand and am grateful to the Minister. In
certain circumstances, however, given the size of the project and what
is at stake, one might be tempted&#151;if one were being
cynical&#151;to say, &#147;Cheap at the price.&#148; I shall not
press the point, but perhaps the Minister will think about it again,
because I can envisage circumstances in which the misleading behaviour,
if it were shown to be seriously dishonest, could be as grave&#151;in
terms of public perception&#151;as the offence under clause
130.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000588"></a>Mr.

with offences relating to information notices, not specifically to the

that the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 regime
allows a person to enter into a planning obligation only if they hold
an interest in land that is subject to development. There are proposed
amendments to section 106 of the 1990 Act and we are not unsympathetic
to them, but the amendment before us suggests that to make the system
work better, it might be sensible to extend matters, because section
106 does not permit every promoter of an infrastructure project to
enter into a planning obligation.</div>
<a name="080129125000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help if I gave an
example. If an application for development consent includes power for
the promoter of the infrastructure project to acquire land by
compulsory purchase&#151;an example would be the site of a power
station&#151;the promoter would enter into the planning obligation
only after the compulsory purchase order process had been completed.
Only at that point will he hold an interest in land for the purposes of
the Act. If the promoter proposes to install overhead power cables or
underground pipelines, we are advised that the current wording would
mean that he would have no interest in the land at the time that the
application for development consent goes in. He will have interest in
the land only after the development 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>consent has been obtained and after the promoter has exercised the
compulsory acquisition powers that come with it. That means that he
cannot enter into a planning obligation at the time that the
development consent is granted. We should have thought that it was
probably desirable from the Government&#146;s point of view, as much
as anyone else, that he be able to do so.</div>
<a name="080129125000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is really what we are
looking to achieve here. This matter has been raised by a number of
practitioners in the field. We are sympathetic to the objectives, but
we wonder whether there is an opportunity to improve the Bill&#146;s
operation by enabling people to enter into a section 106 agreement at
the stage of consent. That would be consistent with the desire to have
as much pre-application discussion as possible. No doubt the terms of
that agreement would have been worked out and everything could be
wrapped up more efficiently if it were not caught on the legal hook of
whether, at the time when consent is granted, the promoter has an
interest in
land.</div><a name="080129125000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080129125000590"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b> This is an
important clause. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s explanation of
his amendment and I recognise that the matter has been raised by a
number of practitioners. I will try to deal with the clause as drafted
and explain the purpose behind it; I hope that that will help the
Committee. It allows the promoter of a nationally significant
infrastructure project to enter into agreements with local authorities.
Its purpose is to allow them to do so in the same way&#151;I think
the hon. Gentleman recognises this&#151;as a developer seeking
planning permission under the 1990 Act.</div>
<a name="080129125000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is needed to allow
full use of planning obligations to be made under the single consents
regime. By allowing planning obligations to be negotiated on a
bilateral basis between promoters and local planning authorities,
agreement can be reached on many important issues that might otherwise
have to be brought to the IPC&#146;s attention for examination.
Clearly, if they can be dealt with and agreed in advance, that saves
everybody time and hassle. Certainly, it helps to speed up the
IPC&#146;s examination process and allows it to concentrate on the
matters where agreement cannot otherwise be reached.</div>
<a name="080129125000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that the hon.
Gentleman raises a real concern with his amendment, but it is not
workable. In many ways it would wind the clock back a number of
decades. At present, under section 106 of the 1990 Act, any person
interested in land in the area of a local planning authority may, by
agreement or otherwise, enter into an obligation with the local
planning authority in question. The obligation is registered as a land
charge.</div> <a name="080129125000388"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
