Amendment moved, [this day]: No. 45, in page 24, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) This section shall not take effect until Her Majesty's Government has published a study of the implications of the section for self-assessment of tax liabilities'.'--[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again moved, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I was elaborating on the risks to the self-assessment system posed by the clause. The complexities signalled by the clause, which will come into effect in 1999, will impose higher costs on taxpayers by generating compliance cost increases. More taxpayers will have to consult professional advisers and that means more work for my profession so I suppose that I should not complain. From the point of view of responsible government, it is regrettable to increase the cost in that way because it is a cost that will be borne by the economy as a whole.
<P>
Government, of which the tax system is part, is the largest service industry in the world and often not an efficient service industry. I generally exempt our own institutions from that, but we should be wary of doing anything in legislation which increases costs on the economy as a whole. Increased complexity in the tax system does exactly that. With self-assessment, the chance of error is increased and if taxpayers make errors, they will face penalties.
<P>
For all those reasons, it is important to drive for more simplicity and transparency. The Red Book made great play of that and it is a desirable objective, but our charge is that the Government have not followed the objective through into deed. The abolition of ACT credit relief has brought in its train a series of additional complications which, under clause 31, will result in increased compliance costs.
<P>
The Economic Secretary may say that the problem is small and trivial and involves only a few extra computations, but I ask her to try to quantify the position. For example, will the computation worksheets prepared by the Inland Revenue have to be lengthened or added to to take account of the changes? That would be a fairly good objective guide as to whether there will be increased complexity for taxpayers.
<P>
The costs may be difficult to quantify but no less real because they are dispersed among the economy at large. That is why the amendment calls for a study to be made before the clause comes into operation. A study would take some time and cost something in the short term, but it would be well worth it if it could identify the real cost to the economy in the longer term. If the Government's response is that the costs are comparatively small and acceptable, a study would reveal that and then we would all be satisfied. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to accept amendment No. 45.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): It was George Bernard Shaw who said that genius was simplicity. I would add that any damn fool can make things complicated. The previous Government were absolutely right to introduce self-assessment. The problem is that ever since we initially consulted on the idea, it has grown more and more complicated. But it need not grow more and more complicated if one considers the systems in other countries, such as America and Australia.
<P>
It is a feature of our Finance Bills that they are unnecessarily complicated. Anyone can write a complicated piece of legislation; one studies the subject in great depth and drafts the legislation to cover every permutation and possibility. It is much more effective to write the legislation in a simpler way with more widely drafted anti-avoidance provisions so that the Government and Inland Revenue can challenge the individual taxpayer if some evasion takes place.
<P>
The test of whether self-assessment works will be what proportion of taxpayers are able to complete the self-assessment returns. If we find that a ridiculously high percentage of returns have to be completed by accountants, self-assessment will not have been a success. I urge the Economic Secretary--or the Financial Secretary, because I am unsure which of them will reply to the debate--carefully to consider the rewrite exercise and see whether we can simplify our finance legislation.
<P>
During the Committee stage of last year's Finance Bill, a comparatively short paragraph in the notes on clauses equated to a complicated two-page ramble in the Bill. When I asked the then Minister why the simple paragraph in the notes on clauses would not suffice, I did not receive a satisfactory answer. That proves that there is often a much simpler way of writing legislation, and I appeal to the Economic Secretary and to those involved in drafting financial legislation to make it simpler.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> That was an interesting point by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) about the complexity of Finance Bills. I wholeheartedly agree, as I have mentioned several times during the debate. However, the Conservative party was in government for 18 years, during which time it had the opportunity to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests. Hopefully, in time, we shall have the opportunity to do those things. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman spoke of self-assessment as if it were a visitation on the country without origin because the Conservative Government were responsible for the introduction of self-assessment.
<P>
I do not see that the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) serves any purpose. Perhaps, at the end of my remarks, the right hon. Gentleman will agree to accept clause 31 unamended. The amendment suggests that clause 31, which introduces lower rates for the taxation of dividends and other income from 6 April 1999, should not take effect until after a study has been conducted to consider the implications of the section on self-assessment. We have already considered that, and the changes will have no effect until the year of assessment, which is 1999-2000. I hope that is acceptable to the right hon. Member for Wells. The changes will ensure that taxpayers pay no more tax on their dividend income than they do now. There is, therefore, plenty of time for the changes to be taken into account, and consultation on drawing up the self-assessment return for 1999-2000 will be carried out in the normal way. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman made that point. For lower and basic-rate shareholders, we propose what the then Chancellor, Normal Lamont, did in 1993--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): If there will be full consultation, which we welcome, will the Economic Secretary explain why it is necessary to legislate in this form now, when the changes will not take effect for two years?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That is the whole point of the clause. We have taken on board the argument of the hon. Member for Cotswold--we have attempted to make legislation comprehensive and rational. I do not accept the comments of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell).
<P>
Our proposal is similar to Norman Lamont's reduction in the rate of tax credit in 1993. We are pulling the income tax rate down in line with the reduction in the rate of tax credit. We are being kinder to higher-rate taxpayers than were the Conservative Government--they increased higher-rate taxpayers' liabilities on dividends; we shall ensure that there will be no such increase.
<P>
I must confess--and I do not say this to be belligerent; as I said this morning, I am in a good mood--that I am at a loss to see what the Opposition will gain from the amendment. The proposal would require all taxpaying individuals to pay more tax on their dividend income than they do now. For example, at the present basic and lower rate, shareholders have all their tax liabilities satisfied by the tax credit. Clause 31 will ensure that that remains the position after the rate of tax credit is reduced in 1999. The reduction in the tax credit will be matched by the reduction in the tax rates on dividend income. If there are delays in the clause's introduction, the rate of tax credit will be reduced in 1999, although tax rates and dividends will stay at 20 per cent. for those who pay basic and lower rates. Every basic or lower rate shareholder would have to pay an extra &#163;10 in tax direct to the Revenue for every &#163;90 of dividend that he receives. Even when I am at my worst--in my most appalling mood--I could not believe that that is what the Opposition want. I therefore urge them to withdraw the amendment; if they do not, we shall oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is a wholly unsatisfactory reply. We all know that under the clause, the tax take will be the same. That, however, is not our complaint--we asked about the increased compliance cost which will arise as a result of the proposal. We also know that the clause will not take effect until 1999 and that people will not have to take the changes into account in their tax returns for some years. That is why there is enough time for study and consultation and for the production of a report.
<P>
The Budget is an extraordinary mixture. On the one hand it is the result of unseemly haste--the Government are seeking to legislate from Budget day without any consultation at all. Huge new taxes which were not mentioned in the Labour party's manifesto are bursting in on an unsuspecting public, and we are dealing with those taxes as best we can. On the other hand, the Government are legislating for two years hence quite unnecessarily. They should take their time and consult with those who will be affected.
<P>
The Red Book refers to the fact that in future, the Government will publish a Green Budget in advance of the main Budget to expose their ideas to the public. They should take a similar approach with the clause. They should modestly accept the amendment and adopt such an approach to self-assessment. The Economic Secretary did not refer to the amendment at all, and she was entirely dismissive of the fact that tens of millions of taxpayers will be expected to deal with an additional complexity which will make matters more difficult and contribute to the lack of understanding. Professional charges will go up; there will be an increased risk of errors and, therefore, greater penalties. Given that the proposal does not come into effect for two years, the Government could step back a little and study its specific effect on self-assessment, which the Government support.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was a member of previous Finance Bill Committees when the Labour Opposition clearly supported the concept of self-assessment. They said that there was a need for simplification. The Government should turn those words of support into action by accepting this modest amendment and completing a study before the unfortunate additional complexity proposed in the clause is introduced in two years' time.

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I must respond to the right hon. Gentleman's comments. The Opposition want to commission more and more studies at the taxpayers' expense. We want to introduce new rates to ensure that individuals do not pay more tax. If the amendment were accepted, individuals would have to pay more tax.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> This clause introduces an important part of the changes to the taxation of dividends in 1999. We have reduced the rate of income tax on dividend income from April 1999 so that there is no possibility of individual taxpayers having to pay more on their dividend income as a result of the changes.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>Trusts</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have been researching the reason for the Economic Secretary's good mood. I should like to extend the Opposition's best wishes on her silver wedding anniversary. Those of us who have been through that experience--in my case, almost exactly three years ago--would confirm that it is a very happy occasion. We wish her well and tell her that things can only get better and better. We are delighted that we have cracked that mystery--although we have not always managed to crack the mystery of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 32 to 34 are complex proposals, which introduce such delights to the tax system as the schedule F trust rate. We consider the legislation to be premature--the Government should have first tried to simplify the system. I accept, however, that the Economic Secretary's good intentions were not to impose further tax on those taxpayers, who would not expect to pay more. As clause 34 paves the way to schedule 4, which we shall discuss later, I confine my remarks to clauses 32 and 33, which deal respectively with trusts and estates in administration.
<P>
Will the hon. Lady confirm three points with regard to those clauses? First, will she confirm that no taxpayers in those categories will pay more than at present and that the measure is designed to achieve neutrality? Secondly, will she confirm that no difficulty will arise if incomes or other distributions are received from a period before the changes or, in relation to trustees and administrators of estates, if different streams of income are received before or after the operative date? Will that aspect flow through simply without complicated apportionment, analysis or preferential treatment of any income streams? Thirdly, in the dearth of representations from professional bodies on the mattter, I assume that silence broadly means consent to the clauses' intentions. If the hon. Lady confirms that she has not received adverse representations on the clauses, we will give them a quick and fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes. My secret to 25 years of married life is to have an occupation that means that I have probably only lived through 10 of them. That may be useful advice for new Members of Parliament. As Members of Parliament, we seldom see our spouses.
<P>
I am also grateful for the hon. Gentleman's supportive views on clauses 32 and 33, about which he asked three questions. First, he is right that they aim to introduce neutrality and represent an attempt to ensure tidying up of trusts and estates. Secondly, there would be no complicated apportionment arrangements. I forget his third question--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Whether there were any adverse reactions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As far as I am aware, we have received no adverse representations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I would like to ask the hon. Lady a question--she may not be able to answer me immediately. Will she confirm that the clause's thrust shows that the Government are intent on charging all types of trust to the same rate of income tax? That has not always been the case under previous Labour Administrations. In particular, will discretionary trusts and accumulation and maintenance trusts continue to be charged at the same rate as normal trusts?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That question goes beyond the range of the clauses that we are discussing. We are not in a position to enlarge on our policy on trusts in general. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 33 and 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tax credits, taxation of distributions etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 76, leave out lines 35 to 43 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ```(4A) The tax mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) above shall be calculated at a rate equal to nine-tenths of the rate of advance corporation tax in force for the financial year in which the return period ends--<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in a case falling within paragraph (b) of that sub-paragraph, on the amount shown under sub-paragraph (1)(a) above.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 46, in page 76, line 49, leave out `subsection (2)' and insert `sub-paragraph (2)'.
<P>
Government Amendment No. 38.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> In addition to the two Government amendments to schedule 4, we are prepared to accept the Opposition's amendment No. 46. Our two amendments correct a minor technical defect in the rules that will apply to the calculation of ACT after 6 April 1999. From then, the tax credit will be reduced to 10 per cent. but we intend that the same amount of ACT should be collected as is now. Adjustments must therefore be made to the rules under which companies account for ACT by changing the rate used in companies' calculations. Even with the new 10 per cent. tax credit rate, the amount of ACT paid on a given dividend will remain the same.
<P>
The new rules broadly achieve that aim, but there is a drafting error, which is obvious, in paragraph 23. In one of the circumstances dealt with, the adjusted rate is not correctly applied. The amendments ensure that the adjusted rate will apply in that case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that there might be occasions when an Opposition might use this event to crow over the Government, but I am in a good mood, though not for the same reason as the Economic Secretary. Part of the substance of our arguments over the past few days has been that complex legislation introduced to build new complexity into a complex system is likely to contain slips. It is no radical criticism of the Revenue or the drafters to say that a slip has clearly occurred in schedule 4, which has been picked up by the professional bodies.
<P>
I am pleased that that slip has been identified and rectified before the Bill's enactment, but it leads me to wonder whether greater minds than mine may have overlooked other slips. I hope not, but there is always such a risk when proposed legislation is produced in a rather opaque form. 
<P>
I am prepared to give the amendments a fair wind without further delay, partly because the hon. Lady has been gracious enough to accept an Opposition amendment. I do not want to make too much of that; I do not think that it suggests to the world that the Government are on the slide. It does, however, show that Oppositions, with the assistance of their professional advisers and representations made to them, occasionally spot matters that have been overlooked in the highest circles. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for welcoming our amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 46, in page 76, line 49, leave out `subsection (2)' and insert `sub-paragraph (2)'.--[Mr. Boswell.]

<P>
Schedule 4, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transitional relief for charities etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 28, line 2, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and before 6th April 2004'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 49, in page 28, line 15, leave out from `to' to end of line 26 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`25 per cent. of the amount of value of the distribution'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Clause 35 concerns the withdrawal of advance corporation tax relief for charities. That trend began under the previous government in 1993, when the tax relief for charities was reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. with accompanying transitional arrangements. There is now to be additional effect on charities in that the ACT relief is to be reduced still further from 1999 with a sliding rate of transitional relief available to the year 2004.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee appreciates that charities in all their forms do a huge amount of good for the community. They include religious bodies such as the Church of England. I hope that no member of the Committee would question the need for charities to be given every possible help and for every penny that is donated to charities to be utilised most tax efficiently.
<P>
Although charities are extremely grateful to the Government for the long transitional period, a big question mark hangs over what will happen at the end of that period. A trend that is increasing, certainly with the larger charities, is that they are learning the need to smooth their income path in relation to their charitable objectives by holding reserves, and holding them particularly in equities. Over the past few years, charities that have efficiently managed those reserves will have benefitted their charitable objectives considerably and it would be a great pity if the clause had the effect of driving charities into a narrow range of investments for their reserves.
<P>
I shall give the Committee an example of the sums that will be lost under the clause. It is likely that the Church Commissioners' income will fall by &#163;12 million a year, which is a significant drop in income. Furthermore, the income of other Church of England bodies will fall by about &#163;5 million. I should be grateful if the Government would consider carefully what will replace tax credits after the year 2004. How do they envisage charitable donations being utilised in the most tax-efficient way?
<P>
As the Economic Secretary will know, a wholesale review of charitable status is taking place, as a result of which there is some nervousness among some charities about whether they will be included in tax exemption at all. That uncertainty, as well as the uncertainty felt by all charities about losing the ACT tax credit status, is causing some ripples in the charitable movement. I should be grateful if the hon. Lady could let the Committee know her thoughts on the matter and say how charities can continue to meet their charitable objectives in the most efficient way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): I want to make a few important points. I did not really want to touch on my general theme and say that the Bill has not been well thought through, but the clause is yet another example of that. I genuinely ask the Government to respond in the spirit in which I am making my comments, but my real worry concerns the consequences of the clause. There is no doubt that the measure will hit grant-making trusts. I should declare an interest, because my wife and I have a rather substantial charitable trust, which includes in excess of &#163;10 million capital, and every year we give away a large amount of the money earned from that trust. The work that we have already done in assessing our family trust shows that we shall be substantially hit by the proposal. Nearly 90 per cent. of the shares in the trust are held in one particular family company and the obvious thing to say is that diversifying out of this company would send signals that go well beyond the charitable implications. When trustees have to consider diversification out of trusts in which equities are held, often in former family firms, it can have a serious impact--I do not mean on people like me because I am not a beneficiary of this trust; I mean that the provision will have an impact on other charities.
<P>
Our grant-making trust, like other family grant-making trusts, such as the Laing Family Trust, gives money to good causes. In 1993 the rates of advance corporation tax credits were changed from 25 to 20 per cent., whcih involved a 5 per cent. reduction for charities. Whether or not that was right--at the time I would have taken issue with the impact that that would have on charities--it was done over five years. That 5 per cent. was removed over five years, whereas this measure will remove 20 per cent. over five years.
<P>
The people to whom I have spoken so far regard it as genuinely extremely difficult to see how there is any prospect of diversifying so as to ensure that the same level of income can be brought into a charity to allow it to give away grants. The amount of money that our trust or any other similar grant-making trust can give away will be reduced by somewhere between 0 per cent. and 20 per cent.
<P>
The measure will have a particular impact which I wish to draw to the attention of the Committee. The national lottery has led to a vast number of schemes throughout the country in which grant-making trusts have pledged sizeable sums of money over a period of three to five years. Not only my trust but a number of charitable trusts have pledged money to charitable projects--including the arts, sports and straightforward charity-giving projects, such as hospitals and so on--on the basis of predictions made this year that in the next five years they would have that amount of income to give away. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be heard by the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I repeat my concern that the Government may not have thought the matter through properly. Grant-making trusts have made commitments for the next five years based on a flow of income and the measure will dramatically change the position. I grant that the change will be made over a period of five years with a two-year notice period, but it must be acknowledged that charities could find it difficult to think about other ways of making up the shortfall. It may not be possible for them to diversify. We must also think about what options for diversification are realistically open to grant-making trusts. Foreign equities clearly cannot produce the money necessary for that; we might well have to consider such measures as inviting some charities to take the risk of getting involved in property--and the property market could go down as well as up. I should hate to think that in the haste with which the clause was drafted, the Government--albeit with the good intention to remove distortions; I disagree with their intention, but they have their philosophy--may not have thought through the way in which the changes will hit grant-making trusts. It will be very difficult, if not impossible for grant-making trusts to make up that income shortfall, and although those few tens of millions will make little difference in the context of the whole Budget--for the Treasury, it is only a drop in the ocean--the measure will make a substantial difference to and cause difficulties for the bodies in receipt of money, such as those running projects depending on lottery grants and pledges of money by grant-making trusts. I therefore ask the Government to consider leaving the window open. I hope that, if they discover, in the course of their two-year review, that the changes will genuinely hit grant-making trusts, they will be prepared to re-examine the legislation with a view to amending it in a later Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I intervene partly because of my personal interest in the charities sector. Until I became a parliamentary private secretary to a then Treasury Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), I was chairman of the all-party committee on charity law. I suspect that I was asked to serve on that committee because of my involvement--as president for the six years prior to that and as a council member for many years before that--of an endowed charity that awarded grants in research and education. I therefore continue to have, as do many hon. Members, a keen interest in and appreciation of the problems of the charitable sector. I should like to cite as an example that trust, for which I had effective responsibility until about eight years ago--until I had to forgo that role when I became a member of the Government--and which; had a capital abroad of approximately &#163;2 million and an annual income of approximately &#163;100,000. My back-of-an-envelope calculation on the likely impact of the change on that trust, as it will work out over a five-year period, would be an annual reduction--in increasing increments--of income of the order of &#163;10,000.
<P>
For many years, it has been the case--I accept that to some extent this dampens the effect of the Government's proposals on ACT--that charities with endowment funds have been constrained, unless they are special investment funds, by the Trustee Investments Act 1961, although that constraint has now been relaxed to some extent; the old rule was 50 per cent. equities and 50 per cent. in fixed interest, if I may use that shorthand. At one point we wanted to invest for the long term in British industry and we were anxious to put up our effective equity proportion; we were advised by our experts to put a sum into convertible loan stock because a part of that was retained within the narrow band that could effectively be used to increase the equity hearing. So it has been the experience over the years of that charity that an involvement with equities was appropriate. The effect of the changes will mean--we acknowledge that the Government have given organisations time to examine their dispositions--that charities may seek to rebalance their portfolios, not necessarily only for income through the purchase of additional gilts but, bearing in mind that charities are broadly exempt from capital gains tax, as a strategy for making gains rather than equity income.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, given that the Government are planning, on their own figures, to take about &#163;350 million out of the sector, some charities will obviously be affected. Of course, charity trustees will have time to consider the matter and to decide how best to rearrange their affairs; but it will be quite difficult and I suspect that the Treasury do not necessarily want them to be completely successful.
<P>
Although the amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold moved has the blessing of the Church Commissioners and others, including senior Members of the House of Commons on both sides, I did not formally put my name to it because I realise that the Government will want to consider and respond to the Revenue implications.
<P>
The other point that I would like to make is that, for the first time we have a clause on charities, which drove me back to consider the provisions of the review. We were given some helpful clarification this morning. We are anxious that the review should be comprehensive and that everyone should be able to contribute to it, including Conservative Members. I am sure that the Committee would wish it to be broadly positive to charities.
<P>
As I and my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) have described, not all charities are endowed charities. It is therefore interesting to note that the Revenue press release mentions that fact, even though it is not the subject of the clause. Changes should clearly be contemplated and it is right that the review should consider them. One of the side effects is to suggest that it is not quite so important to consider only charities' relief from direct taxation--that is, not only the &#163;350 million of ACT but the other benefits that accrue to them such as income, for instance from rents or from bonds, which the Revenue estimates at about &#163;1 billion per annum.
<P>
That is a substantial sum and I do not suggest that we should take it away immediately--or at any time. But it is right that the Revenue should consider the matter objectively. However, given the size of those sums, I am concerned that the Revenue and the Treasury should apply themselves seriously to considering the direct tax side. They should bear in mind also that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold set out, the proposals on ACT have a byproduct, acknowledged by the Government; they will cause some damage to the charitable sector in so far as endowed charities are in receipt of income. It is difficult to see how a tax regime on charities that in effect replaces a tax credit and a zero liability for income tax can be better or even remotely as good.
<P>
There is a strong feeling among Committee members that we would like to support charities in their work. It is often a more cost-effective and more sensitive way of doing things than central Government assuming the responsibility and financing such matters directly from taxpayers' money. Given that, I hope that those on the Treasury Bench will be able to say a little more about the review, and to emphasise the importance in that review not only of the impact of VAT, but of direct tax. We should be given some reasonable assurance that the Government will deal with the matter in good faith, and attempt to support and restore the benefits to the charitable sector, which I am sure we all wish to encourage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have heard some good contributions from Conservative Members about a subject on which they have considerable expertise. I welcome the fact that the debate has been so considered and concise.
<P>
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 48 and 59 together, because one cannot work without the other. The Committee is well aware of the strength of the Government's opinion on the need to abolish advance corporation tax. The arguments have been put time and again, and I shall not insult the Committee by reiterating them. We think it an essential measure to tip the balance of the tax system in favour of long-term investment. We believe that companies and all who invest in them will benefit in the long term from our proposals--indeed, charities will be no exception.
<P>
The Government spent much time considering the position of charities. I do not pretend that the changes that we are introducing will not affect charities; they will be affected because tax credits cannot be paid when there is no longer any liability.
<P>
However, I disagree with what Opposition Members have said--perhaps it is as well that I say this now--in that the amendments would offer charities a permanent subsidy from public funds to replace their present tax credits. At the most conservative estimate, that would cost at least &#163;300 million, and we must take account of the impact of such sums on the general taxpayer.
<P>
The changes that we propose to ACT must apply across the board, or, frankly, they make no sense at all and the full benefits of the reform that we propose would not be felt, so no sector can be permanently left out.
<P>
The impact of the changes will vary between charities. We considered a broad raft of charities to measure that impact. The impact will depend on the extent to which their income comes from United Kingdom dividends. Many charities do not depend on such dividends for their incomes, but we were always conscious that some charities would be hard hit in the short term if the loss of tax credits were to apply immediately.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney drew attention to the fact that, in the previous changes in tax credits, allowances were made for charities. However, the Government are going further this time. We are taking two steps to help charities. First, unlike any other United Kingdom exempt body, charities will retain tax credits for a further two years until April 1999. Furthermore, we propose additional compensation which will taper off over a further five years, which will cost the Exchequer almost &#163;1 billion.
<P>
We have not proposed compensation for any other sector; we regard charities as a special case. Everyone in the country appreciates the valuable work of our maintstream charities, and all hon. Members are alert to that fact from experience of our constituencies.
<P>
I applaud what the hon. Member for Cotswold said about the huge amount of work that charities do in our communities. It is with that in mind that we have adopted a long transitional period. The hon. Gentleman asked about the wholesale review of charitable status--a rather different point from that which the hon. Member for Daventry made, which was on the taxation review of charities.
<P>
It would not be appropriate in this setting for me to try to prejudge the long-term review of charities. There has been a recognition throughout the community that there is a need to deal with the issue of charities and their status. Indeed, the charitable community has much advice to give us on how best to set up the framework for charities in future.
<P>
I do not ignore the impact that the national lottery has had on charities. The hon. Member for Daventry referred to some of the positive effects of the lottery on charities, but every hon. Member is well aware that there has been a negative impact as well, because when some people buy a lottery ticket, they think that that absolves them from any further contribution to charity. Charities are concerned about that, as are we, and I know that that concern is shared across the House.
<P>
We have no hidden agenda of seeking to suggest to charities that they change the way in which they do business. It is not up to me as a Minister to say how charities should adjust their future portfolios; some may choose to do so at the margin, but in many cases dividends are only one element of their returns. Charities, like pension funds and other investors, have recently found all-in yields from United Kingdom equities most satisfactory. If they choose to adjust their portfolios, they will have to take into account what happens to markets during the seven-year period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> If in the course of the prolonged review that the Government will perform during the next few months, they were to discover that there were grant-making trusts that had substantial amounts of equities and which, as a result of the Bill, would suffer a significant fall in the amount of money that they could give away, would the Government consider whether it might be appropriate to make future legislative changes? Or are the Government saying that simply becuase they have taken a view on advance corporation tax credits, they will implement it across the board? While I do not suggest that the Government do no care about charities, is the Economic Secretary saying that charities will just have to live with the changes?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We recognise that some grant-making charities will be badly hit; that is why we have decided on the two-year delay and the five-year transitional period, which is an extremely generous period, to allow them to adjust how they carry out their business. Any wider review of charities may also affect them.
<P>
However, I have again to make the point that we cannot cherry pick in proceeding with the abolition of ACT credits. Many charities will suffer little or no impact from the package--those that rely on fund raising or have their capital resources invested in other ways. However, that does not detract from our recognition of the difficulties that grant-making charities will experience.
<P>
I also remind the hon. Gentleman of my earlier point about the impact of corporate performance on charities' holdings. If companies are performing well and returns to charities are good, they will also have to take that into account, which returns us to the point about their rebalancing of portfolios in the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I would like to press this point one more time. Until last week, I was deputy chairman of Childline, which has indeed been affected by the national lottery. Much of our income depends on individual giving, and we discovered that our income fell short by between 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. a year.
<P>
However, Childline also depends heavily on grant-making trusts. It has just instituted a project to install new computer equipment to record the difficulties about which children telephone us. That project depends on a grant from one of the large grant-making trusts. It would have a double whammy effect, as it were, on charities such as Childline if, having already been hit by the decline in money as a result of the national lottery, they were to find themselves hit again as a result of the changes to grant-making trusts--although those changes may be well-intentioned on the Government's part.
<P>
I want to press the point and ask the Government, if they discover during their review that charities will be substantially affected by the changes to grant-making trusts--even if they do not reverse those changes--to look for other ways of compensating the charities. I do not believe that the public want charities to suffer because of the proposal. If the full &#163;300 million or more cannot be made up, I think that the public would want the Government to look hard for ways of compensating the charities.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I regret to tell the hon. Gentleman that I cannot make a commitment in addition to the &#163;1 billion for the transitional arrangements over--I stress it again--a seven-year period. I commend the hon. Gentleman for his involvement with Childline; I am well aware of the difficulties that that charity has experienced, as it is particularly active in Scotland and I know many of the people involved. I should add that a general review of charities is under way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned the tax review of charities. The main focus of that review will be the current VAT arrangements, but charities may also raise their concerns about direct taxes or business rates. We want to be as helpful as possible, but we have to be fair across the board. I say with regret that the Government cannot support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I should have made it clear that I moved the amendment in my capacity as vice-chairman of the Charities Property Association, which covers most property-owning charities in this country. I moved it also with the full sanction of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), who represents the Church Commissioners in the House of Commons. Those organisations, which have a serious involvement in charity, are extremely concerned about the withdrawal of the &#163;300 million.
<P>
I appreciate that the Economic Secretary is giving charities a seven-year transitional period, and I note that the seven-year cash flow will amount to &#163;1 billion. The range of objectives of this country's charities, however, covers some of the most tragic human endeavours, as well such matters as animal welfare and the environment, both here and throughout the world.
<P>
The Government--I hope that they will be of a different colour in 2004--should think seriously about how the loss of money for such worthy charitable aims could be made up in another form. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry mentioned some possibilities, including indirect taxation and uniform business rates, from which some charities particularly suffer. I accept that advance corporation tax credit withdrawal will hit some charities disproportionately, but other charities may benefit from changes to indirect taxation and uniform business rates.
<P>
Whatever one's stance, one should start from the position that charities exist for the good of the community--we should not treat this as a cost issue. I should have thought that the Committee could agree that the Government, through the taxpayer, would want to continue to support charities at the current rate of expenditure ad infinitum.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> In 1993, the Conservative Government changed the advance corporation tax rates from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent., giving charities a five-year transition period. Even though, despite our protests, the Government do not intend to change their minds and accept the principle of retaining the advantage for grant-making trusts, does my hon. Friend agree that they might be inclined to extend the transitional period significantly if they were to learn during their review that the provision would impact badly on the grant-making trusts? Just as we gave five years for the 5 per cent., the Government might even, because the clause will hurt charities so much, extend the period not to five years but to 15 or 20 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have sympathy with what my hon. Friend says. That is one way round the problem. But if the Government will not change their mind on the principle of the withdrawal of ACT credits and the transitional period, I appeal to them to think carefully about the way in which this additional money can be made up to the charitable sector elsewhere.
<P>
I wish to quote from my brief and then leave it at that. The Charities Property Association says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Budget proposal in this context:--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) would be a massive increase in the rate of tax on charities, to a level far in excess of any previous levels except those applying from 1965 to 1972;
<P>
(b) would put charities, for the first time ever, on the same footing as a basic rate taxpayer. Previously charities have been exempt and individuals have always paid their appropriate rate of tax.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I urge and appeal to the Government's sense of community and duty to ensure that this money is put back into the charitable sector somehow after the year 2004. In that context, I think that this has been a useful debate and I wish to press my amendment to a vote.

Clause 35 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limitation of Entitlement to Relief under Section 35</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Those of us who are lay persons may find that these matters do not leap off the page, and section 235 of the Taxes Act 1988 is not often my bedside reading. Perhaps if it were I would sleep better.
<P>
I want briefly to flag up for the Treasury Bench the Institute of Directors' welcome for the transitional protection. It expresses concern, however, that the anti-avoidance rules in the schedule could be used in inappropriate cases and calls for a ministerial statement.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales goes into the matter more thoroughly. It concedes the logic in not making a payment to a charity in relation to income on which a tax charge arises under the anti-avoidance rules of section 235. It makes the point that part I of schedule 5 denies relief for the entire dividend received by the charity, although only part of it may fall within the scope of the anti-avoidance provisions, which is inequitable. Many of us are aware of the European concept of proportionality; it is the kind of thing that upsets farmers when they do not receive arable payments because they have made some minor 2 per cent. mistake in expressing what went into a particular field. Indeed, there has been recent litigation on that matter. Clearly, it would be unwise to enact legislation that goes further than is strictly necessary to curb the avoidance.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants makes the point that a charity that owns 10 per cent. of a company has no control over the dividend policy adopted by it, and in many cases it will not know whether section 235 applies. I mention that because the institute submitted it to us and because that is my experience of the charitable foundation to which I referred earlier. We were significant shareholders in a limited company; our shareholding, although it was in a complex capital structure, amounted to more than 10 per cent. of the total. From my experience as a trustee, or council member of that charity which, incidentally, was a company limited by guarantee, I can say that we had absolutely no control of the dividend policy of the company in which we had a substantial stake.
<P>
The principle is simple and I feel strongly that the institute has a good point. It is wrong that a charity should be at risk of having to refund a tax receipt when it is not proportional to the situation. The institute also makes a technical point, on which I should be grateful for a response, that in respect of a post-acquisition dividend a charity might have to refund tax in addition to being taxed on a pre-acquisition element of the dividend simply because a small part is found to be pre-acquisition. We all know what we want to do; the assurance that I seek from the Government is that they will not take a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the proposal will not give rise to inequitable results for charities, which are trying to do their best. They are not seeking to avoid tax or to create an artificial situation and yet may find themselves swept up by this rather difficult schedule.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I rise briefly to respond to the hon. Gentleman and to urge the Committee to accept schedule 5. In respect of the technical point raised by the hon. Gentleman, and because we wish to be as helpful as possible, I undertake to write to him after taking full advice from Revenue officials with a view to providing information as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am happy to accept that.
<P>

<P>
Schedule 5 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 36</center></H4>
<H4><center>Foreign Income Dividends</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I was slightly expecting the Paymaster General to explain himself at this point about foreign income dividends. All that we have had from the Government Benches so far has been Delphic utterances, both on the Floor of the House and elsewhere, that a big rethink is taking place. As well it might, because nothing illustrates the unseemly haste of this legislation better than the rush to abolish FIDs. It was done without any consultation with those affected.
<P>
Anyone with any professional expertise or knowledge of international tax or investment could have told the Government that it would be disastrous to rush ahead with a wholesale abolition of FIDs, and so it has turned out. We learnt that the Government are considering some changes, some modifications or perhaps a U-turn. We do not know. We do know, however, that the proposals in the Bill as drafted would inflict lasting damage on the British economy.
<P>
The equally horrid rethink that is going on is important to us because we do not want to let the Bill out of Committee without an absolute assurance from the Government that they are not going to proceed along the path that they first outlined and will return, if they cannot do so immediately, with some revised proposals. We think that the entire clause and accompanying schedule should be withdrawn.
<P>
Hon. Members may know that FIDs were introduced by my then right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames, Mr. Norman Lamont, to relieve the problem of the build-up of surplus ACT by United Kingdom multinationals. I hope that I can explain it reasonably simply to anyone who is not familiar with the working of ACT on multinationals as follows: take a company like BAT--British American Tobacco; it has modest domestic products on which it is taxed and very large foreign earnings and is therefore taxed on those foreign earnings in the various countries in which it operates. It has large factories in Brazil for instance. Those taxes can be set against corporation tax in the United Kingdom.
<P>
I hope that I am not misleading the Committee about BAT in particular. I am not familiar with its actual tax computation but am theorising what I think its case would be as a large, British multinational company. What I am saying would be valid generally for that category of companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I may be able to help my right hon. Friend. I did an 18-month Industry and Parliament Trust exchange with BAT and what he said is exactly correct. BAT markets no cigarettes in this company; virtually all its income from cigarettes comes from elsewhere in the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing his usual expertise to bear on matters before the Committee. A company like BAT would therefore frequently completely extinguish its UK liability to corporation tax. But, when it pays a dividend to shareholders, it has to pay ADC, which cannot be relieved. There is no mainstream corporation tax against which to set ACT. Therefore, ACT is an additional burden on the company. Many companies, which are important to the British economy, are in a similar position. International earnings and operations are vital--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Member is entitled to a hearing. Conversations, which should take place outside the Room, are in progress beyond the Bar of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for any audience that I can find. The effect of your comments, Mr. McWilliam, has been to make the offenders leave the Room. Doubtless they will read my remarks in the Official Report.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The general intention was to make the hon. Members leave the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am much obliged to you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The companies that I am considering are central, not incidental to the British economy. Our balance-of-payments deficit in goods--so-called visible trade--is offset by our surplus in invisible trade and investment earnings. We have a large balance-of-payments deficit with the European Union in all categories. That, however, is balanced by surpluses elsewhere in the world. We rely especially on the surplus in invisible trade in services, and, crucially, in investment earnings.
<P>
The Red Book acknowledges that our current account was close to balance in 1996. That is another achievement of the previous Government. Their stewardship of the British economy was successful in many respects, but the near balance of our current account in 1996 was a particular achievement.
<P>
It is important that we do nothing to disturb trade not only in goods and services but in investment. We benefit from inward investment through other countries locating in Britain, and groups and companies that are centred here make large investments in developed countries such as north America and in countries in the developing world, to their benefit. The opening passages of the Red Book acknowledge that. The second paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The development of the global marketplace is bringing new challenges and new opportunities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has sunk in with the new Government that the global perspective is important.
<P>
British Ministers spend a great deal of time arguing in Strasbourg and Brussels, and they become immersed in the intricacies of European Union legislation. Yet Britain earns its living in the wider world. That is in tune with our historic mission, which was to reach outwards from our continent and invest and trade with the rest of the world. Therefore, it is vital that we do nothing to put that trade and investment at risk.
<P>
The abolition of foreign income dividends would remove the advantages that I described and jeopardise that trade and investment. Companies such as BAT and Rio Tinto Zinc would be tempted to relocate overseas. Why should they stay in the United Kingdom if they are treated in that way and if there is no way of relieving the additional burden of the surplus ACT? It is not a burden that would be borne by equivalent foreign companies located in the United Kingdom because they would be able to set out international headquarter companies, as they are known, to remit dividends overseas without paying ACT. An immediate advantage is created for foreign companies here as against their UK-owned competitors. That in itself would create incentives for takeovers. It is easy to appreciate that a vulnerable company bearing excessive corporation tax in this country would be a target for a foreign company which, overnight, would register it in a different way so that it would be treated more favourably for tax purposes. We are at least glad that a rethink is apparently in train but we want the details.
<P>
We believe that clause 36 and schedule 6 should be withdrawn forthwith. In any case, these changes are not due to become effective until April 1999, so why the hurry? There is plenty of time for the Government to do what they say they want to do--listen and consult: nothing would be lost by withdrawing these damaging, ill thought-out proposals and bringing forward fuller, better measures in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I note that my right hon. Friend was surprised at the absence of movement from the Government Front Bench to support the clause. This is clearly a trend--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) should know better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That has been the trend throughout our debates. Throughout the day not one Government Back Bencher has been moved to support any of the clauses being debated. Clearly this is not a strategy because, in the early days of Committee debates, several of them defended the Bill. One can only assume that enthusiasm has waned as time has elapsed. It is now impossible for a Government Back Bencher reputably to stand and defend. We have now reached the apogee of the trend when not even a member of the Treasury Bench will stand and defend his Government's Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is my hon. Friend not being a little unfair? Most Labour Members have made a contribution to today's debates; it is merely that it has been restricted to the monosyllabic aye or no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. I was about to invite hon. Members further in that they have clearly become so convinced by the tone of our debates that they cannot bring themselves to support them in speeches. We may yet reach the stage at which they do not support them with votes either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): Is not my hon. Friend being a little ungenerous? Should not we express at least some human sympathy for Labour colleagues? After all, they are supporting a Government who have clearly introduced a complete shambles of a measure in terms of foreign income dividends. They did not know what they were doing when they put pen to paper to draft the Bill. They were too arrogant to consult outside bodies while doing so. They have produced a Bill which they have to accept will have a disastrous effect on those British companies that have substantial foreign earnings, so they beat a retreat. Labour Members cannot possibly support finance policy in the Bill because they themselves run from it. Equally, they do not know what sort of retreat is planned so they cannot support a new policy either.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for those perceptive and true remarks. Heaven forfend that I should be accused of ungenerosity. I intended to point out that it is reasonable for Labour Members not to want to defend the clause because it will be impossible to know what they are meant to be defending. We may have broken the all-comers record for U-turns already. Less than 48 hours after the Chancellor stood up to announce the botch that we are considering, the Paymaster General was on his feet in the House to announce that the Government were looking for a way out--or, as he put it, that they were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``looking sympathetically at the position of UK-based groups with a substantial amount of foreign income.''--[Official Report, 4 July 1997; Vol. 280, c. 586.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a slightly surprising remark, in that the purpose of the FID scheme was to deal with the problem of those groups. To announce on a Wednesday that one is abolishing a scheme specifically aimed at helping one category of companies, and then to announce on the Friday that one is sympathetically considering their plight bears comparison with a bomber pilot who after destroying a town on his first run flies back, announcing through a megaphone that he is sympathetically considering the plight of the townspeople whose houses have been razed. That in many ways is the perfect symbol of the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is rarely to be caught out on a technical point, but does not he agree that the present case is comparable not even to a completed bombing run, but rather to a warning of a bombing run to take place after two years--a warning that will have to be rescinded? I say that partly to emphasise the concern that perhaps other hon. Members share--that the problem is not immediate physical damage, but the implications for confidence of the Government's announced intentions, which have been withdrawn but not superseded: That is the cause of the damage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I concede that point to my hon. Friend. Perhaps a better metaphor would be that of a blackmailer who writes to his victims announcing that unspeakable things will happen to them after two years, and by the following post writes again that he is sympathetically considering their plight. That is perhaps a more accurate representation of relevant Government policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the possibility of something similar affecting those involved in a rather important recent exercise--the Walworth road bombers engaged in littering the countryside with little red Budget leaflet bombs--and whether the Walworth road bombers, having returned to base, are also wondering whether they have committed a terrible error, so that they may need to issue future leaflets to correct many of the assumptions that have been made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a good point. To continue the metaphor--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Which one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall revert to the bombing metaphor for the time being, as it was used by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. The raid that has been imagined may be unique in the history of warfare, in that the victims have been forced to pay for it through their taxes. That is true of the pocket Budget leaflet, which, as my hon. Friend pointed out, has been rendered obsolete in certain respects by the inadequacy of the planning.
<P>
One can only hope that if the Government muddle through to a conclusion on the clause, or, as we should wish, withdraw it, they will not feel minded to spend another &#163;50,000 of taxpayers' money sending a letter of apology to everyone in the country, explaining that the relevant part of the Budget was, in the phrase so beloved of Richard Nixon's spin doctors, inoperative--which is what they should say.
<P>
As to the substance of the clause, I am sure that whenever any business organisation says anything in favour of the Government's economic policy, Treasury Ministers will trumpet it loudly as they have in the past and, I dare say, will in future. So, in their own interests, I urge them carefully to consider what the CBI says. It believes that the clause is unnecessary and damaging, and we echo the call from the CBI to withdraw the clause and attendant schedule.
<P>
It is clearly already apparent to the Paymaster General that this policy is not sensible. It is not as if any instantly damaging consequences would result from a retreat by the Government. The measures are not supposed to come into effect until 1999, so the Government should withdraw the clause today and decide what they are trying to achieve. I assume that the Government do not want to damage British multinationals. If they are trying to achieve equalisation of the tax structure, intelligent discussions can be had both across the Floor of the House and with business interests and tax experts.
<P>
The Government have already said that they will introduce another Finance Bill next spring, which would be early enough for them to introduce any measures on FIDs that they want to take effect from 1999. That would cause no practical difficulty--as I remember, the scheme was introduced in the 1993 Buget and came into force on 1 July 1994--and the timetable would include a 12-month period, which would allow for a successor scheme, if the Government wanted to change it. That would seem to be the most practical and dignified approach for the Government, who have got themselves into an appalling pickle over the clause.
<P>
Conservative Members who are more expert technicians than I will know more about this, but it is clear from the submissions of various taxation bodies that it would be possible to avoid any abuse of the system--indeed some steps have already been taken by treating certain UK company dividends as trading receipts. It is clear that taxation bodies are prepared to consider the necessary methods of avoiding abuse of the scheme.
<P>
I urge the Government not only to think of the state of British multinationals--as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells mentioned, multinationals earn a significant chunk of their income overseas and we should not disadvantage them and encourage them to move their headquarters from London, which would damage the British economy--but to consider the fact that the clause will make them more vulnerable to takeovers. If many great multinational companies based in Britain were damaged by the clause, and if it seemed that they would be run better from other domiciles, they would be more vulnerable to takeovers.
<P>
I also urge the Government to consider the collective funds. We have had long discussions in Committee about the damage done by other clauses to investment trusts and unit trusts, but this is yet another hit against them. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Fund says in relation to the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The uncertainty and apparant lack of commitment of the UK to maintaining competitiveness is already leading managers to consider staying outside the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be extremely damaging to the London market. We have heard how important the funds are to the London market and the Finance Bill puts yet another weight on them.
<P>
Clause 36 is the clock that struck 13. It is the clause that renders dubious and untrustworthy everything around it and everything that has gone before. If no other clause does so, clause 36 proves to everyone who looks dispassionately at the Bill that it has been assembled in too much of a hurry. It is technically incompetent in too many areas and for large swathes of it, and especially clause 36, the only sensible action is for the Government to take it away, think again and return with a completely new proposal, which might be workable.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A very bad breach of discipline occured a short while ago when the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), who is not a member of the Committee, invaded it and began a conversation with the right hon. Member for Wells. I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member for Ashford for too long, but such action will not be tolerated again. If it recurs, I shall use the power that was available to me when the breach occured--I shall suspend the Committee and report the matter to Madam Speaker on the Floor of the House, so that she can dispose of the hon. Member who committed that appalling breach of discipline. That might not be in the hon. Gentleman's interest because I think I know what his purpose was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is nothing further to that point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In phrasing my comments about the problem with FIDs--it is undoubtedly a large problem--I shall try to refrain from a bonfire of metaphors such as we have heard up to now. The problem can be summed up as a clause too far. The issue is a large one involving a sum of money in excess of &#163;250 million in current dividends. I shall not go into the detail of how FIDS work because my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells ably elucidated that earlier. The Committee should not take my word for the fact that there has been enormous outrage against the bungled clause. I crave your indulgence a little, Mr. McWilliam, to quote some of the reactions.
<P>
On the day after the Budget, the Financial Times--given its proximity to new Labour, it must be right--stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chancellor introduced his Budget by saying that his `central purpose' was `to ensure that Britain is equipped to rise to the challenge of the new and fast-changing global economy'. But by abolishing foreign income dividends...he has upset many of Britain's multinational companies...In a global economy, long-term investment will come to those countries that demonstrate stability in their monetary and fiscal policies''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear!''] The Chancellor is being lauded by Labour members of the Committee. The Financial Times continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Yet, by ending FIDS--which were introduced only three years ago--he has demonstrated how quickly the tax authorities can change their minds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us not take the word only of the Financial Times. Let us hear what the Confederation of British Industry said, to elaborate on the earlier comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). It stated categorically that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``opposes the abolition of Foreign Income Dividends...and argues that Clause 36 and Schedule 6 should be deleted from the Bill to allow Government business consultations to take place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is categorical from a party of business men in recent months has been so oft quoted as a friend and supporter of new Labour.
<P>
The Association of British Insurers is another esteemed body that has much to add to our debate. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The measures should be withdrawn and any changes in this area should be the subject of full consultation| The measures in the Bill will thus place them''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, companies--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at a competitive advantage over their British counterparts. It is also likely to facilitate takeovers of British groups and to encourage them to relocate abroad with a consequent loss of employment in this country.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are damning words. I shall finish quoting with the words of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which stated in its submissions to the Treasury and most members of the Committee that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Members''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have expressed grave concern about the proposed abolition of the FIDs regime without any prior consultation| To the extent that it was not fully recovered by the payer this will result in ACT being paid twice on the same income flow by the time it reaches the ultimate shareholders.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those comments have been echoed across the City and the financial world, and by the Institute of Directors. The key theme is that the measures are hasty and ill-thought out. They were prepared without consulting people who know something about the highly detailed way in which British multinationals work and who might, therefore, be expected to add to the argument.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The measures have been condemned not only by commentators from the financial world, but by the companies that will suffer when they are imposed. The press has often referred to RTZ as a major casualty of the proposals. RTZ paid 23.7p out of its 31.7p dividend as a FID for the year 1996. Without the FID system, the company would have had to pay an extra &#163;50 million in ACT.
<P>
If FIDs are abolished--we hope that they will not be--RTZ will face four main choices this year. First, it could take the tax charge on the nose and pay 5 per cent. more of its large earnings--a great deal of money--to the Exchequer, which would reduce its earnings by 6 per cent. Its second option would be to cut its pay-outs of dividends to shareholders. A major casualty of that, as I tried to make clear this morning, would be worried of Worthing and the less well-off investors who have invested in good blue-chip United Kingdom companies as a nest egg.
<P>
A third option for RTZ and other big payers would be to blow up their UK balance sheets by increasing their gearing through foreign borrowing. That makes a difference to where interest is paid, but would make a company highly vulnerable to swings in interest rates internationally and in the exchange rate. That is not a Conservative course of action. The fourth option--which has been suggested by many commentators and hinted at by RTZ--is far more worrying. It could up sticks and move its headquarters overseas, outside British jurisdiction. After all, RTZ employs only 220 people at its headquarters. It would be relatively easy for it to relocate to another country, and what an enormous loss of tax revenue that would be for the Exchequer.
<P>
The proposal will affect many top UK blue-chip companies. We are not talking about the highways and byways, smaller, more esoteric companies but blue-chip UK companies that have prospered here for tens of years and successfully expanded overseas.
<P>
BTR is another top 10 FTSE company. It has been experiencing many difficulties around the world and is involved in the building and the rubber industries in Australia through its dealings with, for example, Dunlop. The impact of the proposal on BTR would be more considerable than the impact on RTZ. It would take a hit of some &#163;96 million additional ACT. The options for RTZ are equally available to BTR and are not very attractive--difficult times for BTR, which has to make tough decisions in its long-term investment policy, if faced with this invidious measure.
<P>
I recently spoke to the finance director of Coats Viyella, the largest textile company in this country. Some 80 per cent. of its earnings are from overseas. It will be especially vulnerable when the Government adopt the social chapter because that will have a particularly harsh effect on the UK's textile industry, which has been in decline for many years. Measures promised by the Government will only hasten that decline. The finance director of Coats Viyella said that it will become difficult to service dividends if FIDs are abolished and he described the proposals as highly undesirable.
<P>
Moving to another sector, Burmah Castrol is one of our leading oil and lubricants companies. It will be hit on another score, as it is one of the few companies that corporation tax reductions will affect adversely by hitting the ability to offset ACT. Burmah Castrol has been greatly prejudiced by the remorseless rise in sterling in the past couple of months, which the Labour Government view as a macho sign of economic prowess. The detrimental impact of that on British industry is a chicken coming down to roost. Burmah Castrol is likely to suffer at least a 4 per cent. hit on profits from the rise in sterling. Since 1994, a third of dividends have been paid in FIDs. Last year, it paid two thirds of its dividend in FIDs. It is highly vulnerable to these proposals.
<P>
Another oil company--LASMO--is probably our most effective in terms of the overseas earnings in its profits profile. That is unsurprising, given that the company is a first-class oil exploration stock with exciting acreage in Indonesia and Latin America. Joe Darby, its chief executive, has said that UK multinationals will be turned into sitting targets for foreign buyers, as LASMO would be worth more to a foreign acquirer than on its own.
<P>
The Government appear to be putting a ``For Sale'' sign over much of UK plc. Companies that have been through difficult times in recent years and are vulnerable to the volatility of oil prices are feeling very sick indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Might my hon. Friend comment on the impact of the proposal on the likelihood of attracting new multinationals to the UK?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I will come to the point, if I may crave my hon. Friend's indulgence for a moment.
<P>
Joe Darby of LASMO has written to the Chancellor and one hopes that the force of his words will have some impact on the Government. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The very independence of LASMO, and all British companies which have had international success, is put at risk by your proposals, as we will simply be worth more to a foreign acquirer than we can be on our own.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fairly clear.
<P>
I must mention another sector and a company--SmithKline Beecham--to which I alluded this morning, which is one of the largest employers in my constituency. I spoke to a director this morning and the company has produced an excellent second quarter set of figures today. There is good news on the development of new heart drugs, Coreg in particular. The company took the Government's proposal so seriously that it devoted a large part of today's statment to a plea that the FID proposal should be dropped or that the Government should adopt an amendment proposed by the company that all multinationals with more than 50 per cent. of earnings accruing overseas should be given an exemption from the abolition of FIDs. One director stated that the company would consider moving its headquarters to the United States of America if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an uncomfortable tax environment developed in the UK''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He regarded the Government's plans as a first step towards that.
<P>
Ninety per cent. of SmithKline Beecham's profits are earned overseas, which is not surprising as pharmaceutical companies tend to be large overseas earners covering the whole globe. SmithKline Beecham was formed out of a merger involving the UK company Beecham and the US giant SmithKline. It was an apposite move because the pharmaceutical sector had been consolidated into mega-giants. This country needs companies of that size, with the appropriate research and development pipeline and research and development spend and the management expertise to take on global companies. SmithKline Beecham is an important resource to the UK. The rumpus last year--when the chief executive, Jan Leschly, who is Danish, moved to New York--was a sign that SmithKline Beecham is looking elsewhere. Its main office operates from New York. We are, therefore, half way down that path and the Government seem hell-bent on encouraging the company to go all the way down that path.
<P>
The Government completely failed this morning to consider the prospect of attaching tax credits to research and development spend, as we have mooted and as happens in more favourable environments in other countries, including France and the United States. All the ingredients for tempting large multinational companies such as SmithKline Beecham to leave this country are in place and the Government are ready to put those ingredients into the cake tin and pop it into the oven. SmithKline Beecham is not alone in considering relocation: Glaxo and, increasingly, Zeneca will be vulnerable to the proposal about FIDs.
<P>
I want briefly to mention three more companies and to quote The Independent of 4 July. That newspaper has shown some support for the Government, and I hope that Labour Members will take its words seriously. Michael Prideaux, a spokesman for BAT--another major company that we heard about earlier--was quoted in that article as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This is completely inequitable. I can't believe that a supposedly pro-business government wants to penalise UK companies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the same article, a director of Reckitt and Coleman was quoted as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We have until 1999. This is a double taxation on our overseas profits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Allied Domecq, another major UK blue-chip company, last year wrote off &#163;47 million in irrecoverable ACT and has previously paid FIDs to recoup some of that sum.
<P>
The point that I am making at length--for which I hope you will forgive and indulge me, Mr. McWilliam--is that the proposal about FIDs will affect many sectors across a wide range of major UK blue-chip companies. Most Committee members will have at least one of those companies operating in their constituency. How many Labour Members have taken the trouble to ask those major employers--they are multinational earners--for their views? Why are Labour Members so sheepish about contributing to our debate? Given the outrage about the FIDs proposal, the Government would earn some brownie points by holding up their hands and saying, ``Okay, we got it wrong. We shall consider the matter. Not even new Labour is completely infallible.'' What response has there been? An absolute stone wall of silence.
<P>
The Government should not accept my word or the evidence of my quotes; they should look at the stock market. We have been bored rigid since 2 July by Labour Member after Labour Member asserting that the stock market has gone up and claiming that that is an endorsement of the Labour party's new approach in its first Budget. We should look at the figures, which show that the claim is a bit of a smokescreen. Between the close of business on Budget day and the close of business last night, the FT all-share index rose by 1.2 per cent. The figures are up--not dramatically and they are not record breaking--and we are, of course, all happy about that fact and plan to have a party to celebrate. Let us look at the figures in an international context, however, over the same period, the world ex-UK index, which is a broad measure of all world stock markets, is up by 2 per cent., the German Dax stock market is up by 7 per cent., and the Dow Jones index by 2.7 per cent. That is not such a ringing endorsement of the special features that the Government have introduced.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When we examine the figures in more detail and the price movements in companies that are most vulnerable to FIDs, the story is different. I mentioned BTR earlier when going round the houses of some UK blue-chip companies. BTR's share price has fallen by 7.6 per cent. between those two dates. That is a big movement. The Labour Government point to the rise in the stock market as an endorsement. On the same premise, will they acknowledge that the fall in BTR's share price is a ringing indictment of their proposals? BAT, the tobacco company, is down 5.3 per cent. and Coats Viyella, the textile company, is down 5.9 per cent. If we examine in detail those figures, we see a different picture that undermines the claim that the City, the stock market and the professional investor have endorsed the Government's early moves and Budget proposals.
<P>
I want briefly to talk about the history of FIDs. When they were proposed by the former right hon. Member for Kingston on Thames in his 1993 Budget, they received a ringing endorsement from British industry--the complete opposite of the reaction that I mentioned earlier. They were introduced to counter a stark choice that UK companies with multinational earnings faced--the fact that it was more expensive to do business abroad for companies operating from the UK than for companies that migrated. That is now the prospect for several large companies.
<P>
If those companies decide to up sticks and move abroad, the Chancellor will have cut off his nose to spite his face. The loss of ACT to the Exchequer and the loss of jobs to the country, which would require even more phoney welfare-to-work programmes for senior executives, will have a huge impact. If the proposals are accepted, the ACT take could be seriously dented post April 1999.
<P>
As for dividend payments, the premise--a result of the prejudiced approach of the mutes on the Labour Benches--is that companies have paid out dividends to service their fat-cat friends in the City and so have deprived British industry of the investment that it needs to compete with the world in the long term.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the International Monetary Fund's verdict, announced today, that the Budget represents an excellent start? If not, why not?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I advise the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham not to follow the hon. Member for Croydon, Central down that road and to stick to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I greatly regret not being able to follow the hon. Gentleman down that little yellow brick road. Some eight hours have passed before a Labour Member has mentioned today's headline in the Financial Times. I am surprised that the Government were not crowing about it earlier.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must press on.
<P>
<B>Mr Loughton:</B> If you, Mr. McWilliam, will crave me the indulgence, the IMF cares not a fig about investment in Britain--it has many other countries that it is happy to look after. In that same report, the IMF urges the Government to slap VAT on a host of items because it is confident that the Labour Government are more likely to do that than the previous Government were. That undermines what the IMF is saying but the Labour party has much more experience of the IMF than my hon. Friends, because it had to get into bed with it back in the 1970s. Before you pull me up again, Mr. McWilliam, we shall not go down that road.
<P>
As the Economic Secretary acknowledged this morning--although I am not sure whether she realised that she did so--investment retained and dividends paid out are not mutally exclusive. In fact, during most of the past 18 years, when dividend payments have increased, income retained for investment has similarly increased. The two things can and have gone together.
<P>
Of course, there is a red herring. One of the reasons that dividend payments have increased by amounts well above the RPI is that in many cases, since 1993, they have been enhanced by FIDs and other forms of dividend payments. If I may, I shall refer to a piece of City research that puts the matter into a graphic, pie-chart form that I shall try to elucidate in words.
<P>
Back in 1994, cash pay-outs from United Kingdom companies were made up as follows: ordinary dividends accounted for about 93 per cent., share buy-backs accounted for 5 per cent. and special dividends, which includes FIDS, accounted for only 2 per cent. In 1995, the proportion accounted for by special dividends, including FIDs, had increased to 7 per cent., and in 1996, special dividends accounted for 9 per cent. of pay-outs, while the proportion accounted for by ordinary dividends had fallen to 83 per cent.
<P>
The implication of that is that companies were paying increased dividends from tax-efficient incomes from overseas that would not necessarily have been available for longer-term investment in the United Kingdom. We have already mentioned a raft of advantages accruing to those United Kingdom companies as a result of the cheapness of equity finance and the willingness of shareholders who have seen a good return on their capital to put up further capital investment for expansion, for research and develeopment, and so on.
<P>
Finally, you may be relieved to hear, Mr. McWilliam--[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I am glad that the mutes are chirping up again; we very much look forward to another stab at a contribution from one of them.
<P>
Finally, there are other effects of the proposed abolition of FIDs. As the Association of British Insurers has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Foreign-owned groups will . . . still be able to set up their International Headquarter Companies''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in this country--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to remit dividends overseas without paying ACT.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an advantage that they will have over United Kingdom companies if FIDs are to be abolished.
<P>
Another upshot is that the proposals are possibly inconsistent with the treaty of Rome, as they favour domestic investment over equal continental European investment from our European Union partner countries. The Paymaster General is always able to tell us that he has consulted far and wide without being able to tell us whom he has consulted, and without those people that he has supposedly consulted being aware of that consultation ever having taken place. However, I wonder whether the Paymaster General has consulted our EU partners; I am sure that he has had plenty of opportunities to do so if he saw fit.
<P>
I shall elaborate on a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford on the effect that the proposals will have on investment vehicles in this country. Another City research note states that overseas-invested unit trusts and open-ended investment companies--the ubiquitous OEICs--will be affected, because from 1999 they will not be able to pay FIDs.
<P>
The upshot of all that--I think that this is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford was getting at--is that offshore centres, Luxembourg and Dublin in particular, will become much more attractive locations for the management of foreign equities. That poses a serious competitive threat to an important part of City business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the pattern over recent years has been that most of these footloose funds that could be invested anywhere have been invested outside the United Kingdom? It is only in the very recent past, as a result of the FID regime introduced only four years ago, that for the first time a serious opportunity was developing to have such funds brought to the UK for administration, creating jobs and supporting skills here, while at the same time encouraging the domestic collective investment industry that could share the same overheads and expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend clarifies the position. The other implication is that, if we see a mass haemorrhaging of fund management to Dublin and Luxembourg, the regulatory regimes in those countries, especially in Luxembourg, are not nearly as stringent as we have come to expect in the City of London. The Government--inadvertently, one might hope--might be encouraging sincere investors to put a greater risk premium on their invested moneys by going to centres outside the City of London. That point is important, particularly given the hue and cry that they have rightly made on pensions mis-selling and abuses of the regulatory regime within certain corners of the financial community.
<P>
The Budget proposal reverses the use that had made the United Kingdom extremely efficient for international portfolio management. The City will also make the case that United Kingdom funds that are invested internationally are akin to international holding companies, for which the FID regime will remain if they can make out that they are earning more than 8 per cent. of their earnings and qualify with the international holding companies. Surely UK funds invested internationally should be treated in the same way.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> Can the hon. Gentleman reiterate his definition of the international holding company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I invite the Paymaster General to define the international holding company, because there has been enormous confusion among all concerned about how he intends to define it. If he comes hot foot with updated news, which, hopefully, will be engulfed in the entire abandonment of the entire clause, we shall be delighted.
<P>
The clause will have a serious impact on many internationally successful United Kingdom businesses, industries and UK fund management. It could be retrogressive and be a cost to the Exchequer in terms of the actual tax that it will receive, let alone the concomitant problems with unemployment that could be created and the costs that will go with that. Foreign income dividends have been a good source of bringing earnings from other parts of the world to the United Kingdom. The Government are at risk of putting a ``for sale'' sign over much of UK plc, a measure that I am sure is inadvertent, but, as many potential big candidates have mentioned, it will come about.
<P>
I urge the Government to listen to financial commentators and to their own champions in the stock market--new Labour, new stockbroker's friend, as they want to make themselves. I want them to drop the clause and consult properly. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, there is no need for such a hurry and to steamroller through the proposal. I ask the Government to consult and to come back with a much more practical proposal that will please both industry and Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> For the covenience of the Committee, I wish to deal with one or two points that have been raised. As for the incompatibility of the proposals with the treaty of Rome, I am sure that that point would not have escaped my predecessor as Paymaster General, the right hon. Member for Wells, if that had been the case. In fact, we would have heard about it at some considerable length. It is not true. After all, the previous Government introduced the role for the international headquarters company. I do not think that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) was sure of his ground; he may have been confusing the matter with the multinational company to which the Bill refers. There will be no change to the status of international headquarters companies under clause 36 or the schedule. They will continue as before. Their defining criterion is that they should be 80 per cent. owned abroad. I think that the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was trying to make, which was a reasonably valid one, was that it will cause a problem with multinational companies. They could lose, if in the process of consultation--which the whole thing is about--they do not come up with a new arrangement.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall try briefly to make our position clear on dividends. We are certainly not against dividends; we just believe that we should remove any fiscal incentive to pay out too much in dividends. That is the purpose of the clause. We have nothing against dividends, but we do not think that the tax system should subsidise them.
<P>
An hon. Member--perhaps it was the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham--suggested that there should be tax credits for research and development. He was not here, but for 18 years, that idea came up year after year--often in amendments tabled by the Labour party. The Government of the day never saw fit to do that then, and I see no reason for doing so now.
<P>
The reaction of Opposition Members strikes me as rather strange. We gave notice, by the clause, that we could not cintinue with a system that leads to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer of perhaps &#163;1 billion. At the same time, we have said that we know that it will create certain problems for major multinational companies whic are based in London and which we want to retain, so we are prepared to consult them to discuss new arrangements that will meet their needs. I cannot understand what the problem is for Opposition Members. We have made it clear that we shall consult and we look forward to doing so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. It might be helpful if I explained the background. After the hon. Gentleman has heard and understood the background to the debate, he will be in a good position to make a better intervention. I shall be going into some difficult technical areas, but if I do not do so, the hon. Gentleman will not understand the position. I hate to say it, but I need to immerse the Committee in the obscure world of advance corporation tax.
<P>
ACT is payable when a United Kingdom company pays a dividend. It is set in due course against tax. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order to heckle and it is certainly not in order to use unparliamentary expressions when doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam. I am coming to the point, which I am surprised that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham with his brilliance has not picked up, so perhaps he will bear with me to see what it is.
<P>
If the company has insufficient tax on its profits to absorb the ACT, the surplus ACT is normally carried forward for use against profits in later years. There are two exceptions to that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to inform us what they are because that is what he was becoming confused about before. One is for international headquarters companies which can pay dividends out of foreign income without paying ACT and the other is for foreign income dividends. We went back over the history and it is true that it was brought in to help groups that derive most of their income from overseas. Those groups need to pay dividends to their shareholders, but may have little tax to pay in the UK on their own profits. That is because the bulk of their income is fully taxed overseas. The FID scheme allows the group to pay a special type of dividend. ACT still has to be paid but any surplus ACT on the dividend paid out of foreign income can be reclaimed by the group or from the Exchequer. If the group pays an FID, there are also consequences for the shareholders. We did not hear that mentioned before. If there is no tax liability on the dividend they receive, they cannot claim any payment of tax credit from the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment, as I can see that hon. Members want to intervene.
<P>
We recognise that the UK is an important base for international business. It is good for our economy, jobs and growth in the City. We are keen to maintain and increase the attractiveness of the UK as a base for multinationals. I have already announced that we shall be keeping special rules for international headquarters companies after April 1999. They will continue to be able to pay dividend out of foreign income without paying ACT. We shall introduce legislation to achieve that in the next Finance Bill. As I said, international headquarters companies have to be 80 per cent. owned by non-residents.
<P>
I accept that surplus advance corporation tax can also cause particular difficulties for United Kingdom-owned companies that obtain a high proportion of their profits from overseas. As I said during the Budget debate, we are looking sympathetically at their position following the abolition of foreign income dividends. The change to FIDs does not take effect until 1999.
<P>
I have made it clear that we wish to listen to the companies involved. We shall invite and welcome their views, listen to what they say and find a way forward that balances the interests of the Exchequer with those of business. We shall also seek to ensure that the solution takes account of the position of authorised unit trusts and United Kingdom open-ended investment companies with a high proportion of tax from overseas, a matter to which Opposition Members have also referred.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment; I can see that Opposition Members want to intervene.
<P>
We will consult. I want to put our various schemes to the Committee before I give way. They are just possibilities; there might be many others, and I ask Opposition Members to propose other, perhaps better, ideas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Just one second; there is plenty of time for interventions. The hon. Gentleman can hardly contain himself, but he spoke for 20 minutes. If he had not repeated and contradicted himself and talked completely off the point by mentioning research and development, he might have been speaking now.
<P>
Before I give way to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I shall put forward our ideas. First, we could relax the shareholding condition for the international shareholding company rules. At present, non-residents must own 80 per cent. of international holding companies, but we could reduce that percentage. It would be reasonable and sensible to consider that option, although it might suit some companies, but not others. I do not know whether any one of these suggestions will solve the problem.
<P>
A second possibility would be to allow surplus ACT to continue to be reclaimed by companies which derive 90 per cent. or, perhaps, a lower percentage--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Just one second. We have heard that SmithKline Beecham has suggested a figure of 50 per cent., which no doubt would solve its problems, but we do not know whether it would solve everyone's problems, or whether it would pose too great a problem for the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Ask them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There will be two years in which we can not only ask but consult them, and we have made it clear that we will do so. What is the hon. Gentleman on about? I cannot understand the sense of his remarks.
<P>
Another option would be to limit the amount of FIDs that a company could pay to the amount that it had paid historically, perhaps in the average of the past two or three years. That would obviously avoid a large build-up in the cost of the scheme, but it might not properly respond to companies' problems.
<P>
I shall make a final suggestion for the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to consider before giving way to him. A fourth option would be to say that a company could pay no more than a specified proportion of its dividends as FIDs. The proportion could be set at a level to keep the cost to the Exchequer within acceptable bounds. Again, we need to ask companies for their views; we will consult them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way to me. I am flattered that he asks me for my advice. If he wants an off-the-cuff reaction, I should say that the first and third options that he suggested are completely barmy. The first would work against British shareholders as opposed to foreign shareholders. I cannot believe that even a Labour Goverment would want to do that. The third option would provide a deterrent against companies increasing their overseas investments and, thereby, reduce he overseas stream of earnings reaching this country, so that would not be very sensible. So my immediate reaction is that he should consider the second and fourth options, which seem slightly more promising.
<P>
The Paymaster General is sounding very reasonable. He is a reasonable and honest man. Nevertheless, he has got himself into an extraordinarily difficult position. I can tell him what is wrong with the position on which he is now suggesting holding consultations and asking us for our advice. First, he has demonstrated the point that we have tried to make throughout our debates: it is much better to consult before putting pen to paper to produce a Finance Bill. That would have ensured that the Paymaster General did not find himself in such an embarrassing situation. He is in that situation through no fault of his own, so we must feel sympathy for him in his quandary. The second thing that is wrong--and it is much more serious for the country--is that we have a Budget--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is supposed to be making an intervention, not a speech. Will he please resume his seat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I was speaking in the interests of a complete debate. My final point--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must resume his seat; he has spoken far too long for an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> At times, I have the feeling that I am intervening on my own speech.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I dare not give way to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr Davies).
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful finally to have the opportunity to speak. The Paymaster General accuses me of chafing at the bit--he might therefore let me intervene. That is the point that we have been making; he asks Opposition Members what we would do, but is not prepared to let us say, just as he claims that British industries can have their say about the measures--if that were true, why not let them have their say before formulating that highly flawed legislation? Before you pull me up, Mr. McWilliam, I should like to say that his criticism of the points I made earlier might be more convincing if he were able to give us the ABC guide to ACT and FIDs without having to read it verbatim from the script given to him by Treasury officials. Does he know what he is talking about or only what he is reading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I knew I was wrong to give way for so silly an intervention. I shall not do so again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The answer the Paymaster General gave a moment ago is unacceptable; the damage that was done by the Budget occurred on 2nd July and every day and every hour that passes without the Government coming to a firm decision on FIDs is damaging not only British industry but the City of London and the competitiveness of the open-ended investment companies. That is a disaster for British industry. We are hoping that the Government would make a firm statement to the Committee today, but we have been disappointed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about every minute and second counting in the situation; one cannot be judged by such a time scale and enter into meaningful consulation. One requires a sensible period to get a right answer--it cannot be done in seconds and minutes. Everyone knows that we shall soon enter a period of consultation. We have received letters and have made it clear--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to contain himself. We shall listen and will consider all our decisions carefully, but just as when FIDs were introduced, we must create a balance between companies, shareholders and the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The second thing that the Government did wrongly by proceeding in the way that the Paymaster General described is to produce a very tightly drawn Budget--that is the kindest thing one can say about it; many people say that it is unrealistically tightly drawn--and it relies on &#163;200 million coming into the Exchequer from the abolition of FIDs. If the Paymaster General, as a result of the consultation process, reduces that anticipated sum, where will the shortfall come from? He must answer that question before we end our debate on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's figures are wrong; if the hon. Gentleman checks the figures on page 40, he will see that he was mistaken. We shall not accept the wrecking amendment, which must be the mother of all wrecking amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is clear from those exchanges that the Committee faces a serious situation. In a minute's time, we shall have to vote on a clause that the Government admit is defective and damaging and will have a perverse effect. Schedule 6, which is also integral to the measures, will go entirely unscrutinised by the Committee. It is most serious that we are being invited to legislate before consultation when the Government themselves admit that consultation is necessary before legislation.
<P>
My point of order to you, Mr. McWilliam, is this: can you institute an amendment to the business motion to allow us to return to the subject after dinner--

On resuming--
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interest to be paid gross</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After the excitement of clause 36, we can be a little more welcoming to clause 37. We should occasionally recognise those happy moments when the Government--even a Labour Government--do something thoroughly sensible and welcome. For reasons that we have already rehearsed, that is what they have done here. They are giving people the option of receiving interest on the gilt-edged securities gross or net.
<P>
That is a welcome extension of the principal of freedom of choice. We cannot object to it. We do not object to it. That option has been available for many years to those who were prepared to invest limited sums on the national savings stock register, but by a rather roundabout route. It is good to open that up.
<P>
I wish to ask the Economic Secretary three brief questions, but before doing so, I should say that I have no particular points to make about clause 38, although my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) may have something to say. First, does the Economic Secretary feel that the new element of competition will have any impact on the envelope of national savings? Secondly, will she confirm--in this case, the Government's generosity amazes me--that the cash-flow impact will reduce revenue in the initial years, although it will be made up in subsequent years? That is my reading of the notes on clauses and the explanatory material available at the time of the Budget.
<P>
My third question is perhaps a little more substantial and I shall hypothetically don the guise of a Treasury Minister for the purpose. Can the Economic Secretary assure the Committee that the revenue will not be at risk in any respect? It is self-evident that if interest is paid gross and the tax is to be accounted for subsequently, the revenue is less secure than if the tax is deducted at source. I wonder whether the hon. Lady can reflect on that point.
<P>
Subject to those questions, however, we give the clause a warm welcome.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his welcoming remarks. I told him that there would be cause for celebration today, but there are now two clauses on which we can agree. I am not convinced only by the hon. Gentleman's welcome, because the clause has also been warmly welcomed by the City, not least by the London Investment Banking Association.
<P>
I shall take the points made by the hon. Gentleman in order. He first asked about the PSBR costs to the Exchequer. The cost shown in the Red Book reflects the one-off changes in cash flow. In 1998-99, the sum will be &#163;75 million. In 1999-2000, it will be &#163;30 million. Those costs arise because tax from gilt holders who presently receive their interest net of tax will be received later if they choose in future to receive it gross. There is absolutely no loss of tax.
<P>
The next question was about the clause's impact on national savings. We do not expect one. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I take considerable interest in the subject as I am the Minister responsible for national savings. The national savings stock register is unaffected because interest in gilts held on that register will continue to be paid gross.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final question was whether the revenue would be at risk. As he said, there are already ways in which investors can obtain gilt interest gross--we have just spoken about the national savings stock register--so there is no tax avoidance here. The Inland Revenue will continue to receive information from the Bank of England about the amount of gilt interest paid to holders and will be able to use that to ensure compliance. I am happy to commend clauses 37 and 38 to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Carry-back of trading losses</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I understand it, the clause restricts the carry-back of losses to the position that ruled some years ago and indeed that which ruled also in the non-incorporated sector. I should like the Financial Secretary to give the Committee a brief explanation about it.
<P>
Concerns have been expressed by a number of quarters, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants, about the position in the economic cycle. The institute does not always comment on economic matters as opposed to taxation matters. It says that it is not persuaded by the economic cycle rationale for the reduction in the loss carry-back period that different sectors have different cycles. It is particularly worried that the three-year carry-back of capital allowances that existed for many years prior to the recession has not been reinstated. That seems to require some explanation from the Financial Secretary.
<P>
The institute has also said--although, given the exigencies of time, the Opposition have not tabled a probing amendment--that it believes that there is a problem with clause 39(9), because it seems to apply the new one-year carry-back rule to the pre-Budget day part of an accounting period straddling 2 July. It suggests that the word ``applied'' in line 38 should read ``did not apply''. I am not sure whether that is right, but I should be grateful for an explanation on that point. The institute's final point is that a provision similar to subsections (11) and (12) is needed in relation to terminal losses.
<P>
Those are small points, but I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's explanation on the economic point and also on the institute's representations on this matter.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> The clause amends the rules applying to companies' carry-back of losses and broadly restores the pre-1991 carry-back position, as the hon. Member for Daventry said. Therefore, his first point about crossing the 2 July period is right: the losses will straddle 2 July and be apportioned accordingly. But the three-year carry-back is retained and is the pre-1991 position in cases where a company is in its last 12 months of trading, because the losses cannot be carried forward.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to whether the three-year provision is retained for the decommissioning of North sea oil and gas installations, in recognition of the high cost of decommissioning. Hon. Members will doubtless recall the difficult trading conditions caused by recession in the early 1990s, when the three-year carry-back was introduced. But the current conditions, with a growing economy and companies' profits over 50 per cent. higher than they were in 1991, create a very different economic climate. Therefore, there is less need for the measure.
<P>
I think that that covers the points made. Three years has been kept as it was pre-1991; there is a straddling of the period around 2 July. There will therefore be apportionment: pre-2 July can go back three years and it will be on a time basis; post-2 July can be carried back one year. If exceptional reasons that apply to different companies at the time of apportionment create a situation that is unjust to a company, there will be negotiations with the Inland Revenue to ensure that that apportionment is fair and just. So the initial rule is the time of apportionment, but in certain circumstances--I cannot think of any but there must be some--if that did not represent fairness there would be negotiations to deal with the problem.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Has the hon. Lady considered that there may be a mis-drafting in clause 39(9)? I understand what she is saying--that there should be apportionment between the two periods pre and post 2 July 1997--but the clause as drafted does not provide for that because line 38 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subsection (2A) of that section applied to the pre-commencement part''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2A) was introduced earlier, in subsection 39(3), and substitutes the words ``three years'' for 12 months. The (2A) part provides that there is only one year's worth of lost carry-back but the way in which it is worded implies that the one-year lost carry-back is applied to the pre-commencement part of that loss.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. As I explained to him, the apportionment around 2 July is our intention. He said that that was not clear and I shall therefore look at the matter closely. I am happy to write to him and to other members of the Committee making our intentions absolutely clear. If the hon. Gentleman is correct, we shall have to return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am still not clear about it. I thought that the hon. Lady said that, to some extent, the three-year carry-back would be allowed. My understanding of the clause is that effectively it abolishes the three-year carry-back. If I am right, is not the clause in danger of ignoring the economic cycle, being over-optimistic and simply saying that although these provisions may not be appropriate at this stage when we are at the end of a long upswing in the economy, they may well become appropriate again at some future stage? I am sure that the Financial Secretary agrees that no Government can abolish a trade cycle. Will she reassure the Committee that the Government will look again at this issue if it becomes appropriate in the future, as it was in the past?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, as his suggestion is sensible and straightforward. Any Government will need constantly to look at the interaction of these reliefs. I may have said it before he could be present in the Committee, but the three-year carry-back exists only when a company is in its last 12 months of trading and therefore there has to be a three-year carry-back, and in decommissioning North sea oil and gas installations, in recognition of the very high cost involved and because sometimes the companies involved are not necessarily enormous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to add one final point to the hon. Lady's last remark. When the Conservative Government introduced the three-year carry-back rule they effectively abolished an existing three-year carry-back rule to which the hon. Lady has not referred: first-year allowances under capital allowances regulations. The loss was able to be carried back to the extent that it equalled the first-year allowances on capital allowances. It could be carried back three years. Since that time, first-year allowances have been abolished but it would have been nice if the Government had reintroduced that three-year carry-back rule for writing down allowances.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have explained to the hon. Gentleman what the clause involves. I hear what he says about what would have been nice. I am sure that every hon. Member heard that, but, as currently drafted, the clause presents the carry-back for 12 months in the way that I have described.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Financial Secretary has made a genuine effort to help the Committee on this, and has given some rather helpful responses on a number of points. She showed herself willing to listen to the representations that have been made. Rather than debate them further, it is now probably for the professional bodies to consider whether her assurances are satisfactory. The question of the carry-back of losses for capital allowances or for writing down allowances, which I touched on and which my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) explored with greater expertise, may still give rise to some concern.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has shown herself ready to respond to those detailed problems. I also note the assurance that she gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford--one that I was going to seek myself in these closing remarks--about the need to keep the matter under review in case of an economic downturn. Some Opposition Members think that that is by no means an impossibility, given current policy stances, but we need not debate that tonight. My advice to my hon. Friends would be to allow the clause to go through.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Financial Secretary explain a couple of points? First, on my reading of the notes on clauses, the concept of how this is to be treated is very similar to that in clause 39, which we have just debated. Secondly, given that this is the amendment of virtually new legislation from 1996 and there is no question of any great political heat or divergence on the matter, is this being amended simply because of the change in the carry-back provisions, or is anything else being materially altered? If so, why?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I confirm that this follows on from clause 39. It introduces changes to the treatment of non-trading deficits arising on loan relationships, certain financial instruments and foreign exchange transactions similar to those introduced to the treatment of trading losses by clause 39. The effect of the clause is to reduce the period for which companies may carry back non-trading deficits to set against the profits of an earlier period to 12 months in all cases. The hon. Gentleman asked whether anything else was hidden in the clause. No, nothing is hidden in it. That is what it does and it is the same principle following through from clause 39.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the chance to come in on this. It just occurred to me, as Whips from both parties are present, that in cases of gross dereliction of duty or lateness back on parade, defaulters might well be set either to learn the schedule by rote, or in cases of extreme dereliction, to explain it in detail to the Committee. [Hon. Members: ``Go on.''] Hon. Members are inviting me to perform a task that I would not willingly undertake. I do not believe that it would be for the edification of the Committee if I did that, even after dinner.
<P>
We have reached the higher plane of tax issues. I accept that the Financial Secretary is trying to make the provision fair and sensible, to tidy up matters and to remove anomalies whose existence creates the potential for friction or distortion. That could be genuine economic or commercial distortion rather than the sort of distortion that, in our view, did not fully apply to the clauses that we discussed earlier.
<P>
It is not always made clear, even by those who try to explain matters to us, that the professional institutes have some anxieties about the provision. We should share those anxieties with the Committee and, if the Financial Secretary is unable to deal with them definitively tonight, she could perhaps reconsider with her advisers and, if necessary, with the professional institutions to ensure that we get the measure right.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has drawn three specific points to our attention. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton may be warming up to make a speech on those points. The anxieties relate to paragraph 4. While I am looking up the paragraph, I shall provide some adult education and remind new Members that, by convention, a clause remains a clause until it forms part of an Act, when it becomes a section, but a schedule contains paragraphs. That is germane to amendment No. 46, which the Government kindly accepted earlier because reference to a subsection in schedule 4 should have read, ``subparagraph''.
<P>
The institute believes that paragraph 4 of schedule 7 is defective. The old rule provided that when a consortium company was also a member of a group, the amount that it could claim as group relief from other members of the consortium was restricted to an amount equal to the profit of the consortium company, minus the group relief that it could claim within its group, regardless of whether it claimed it. The maximum amount, therefore, that could be claimed from each member of the consortium was calculated by taking that net amount and multiplying it by the percentage holding of that particular member in the consortium company. I have read that provision two or three times and it contains some internal logic. Does the Financial Secretary believe that paragraph 4 complies with or departs from that principle? If it departs from the principle, does it do so deliberately or accidentally?
<P>
The institute claims that paragraph 4 seems to reverse and get back to front the two stages of the calculation. It is not fair to the Committee--and it would probably be out of order--to read out the detail of the brief. I am sure that the Financial Secretary has got the drift from what has already been submitted.
<P>
Paragraph 5(4) of schedule 7 seems to have an unintended result. The consortium company is potentially able to claim group relief from the consortium member--the so-called link company--and other companies within the member's group. Proposed new section 406(8) would restrict the aggregate amount of such claims to the amount that could be claimed in a hypothetical consortium relief claim, in which the link company was the only surrendering company. That opaque prose also has some internal logic. However, the amount that could be claimed in those hypothetical circumstances would be limited to the lower of the consortium company's profits multiplied by the percentage interest in each case and to the amount that the link company was able to surrender. The institute suggests that, in the case of the hypothetical consortium claim, an assumption is required that the link company had unlimited losses. That is parallel to the corresponding assumption in proposed new section 406(4) that one should disregard any profit deficiency in the reverse situation. I am sure that that will be entirely clear to the Committee and I hope that the Financial Secretary can give me and those who are practitioners an appreciation of the position, and say whether the schedule as drafted adequately reflects and tackles these concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The schedule is welcome because it deals with a long-standing loophole in the group relief provisions. The essence of the problem that it seeks to resolve is that the special rules in section 403 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 deal with group relief provisions. Group relief enables companies in the same group to offset losses in one company against profits in another. But all sorts of problems arise when a group of United kingdom companies acquires companies part-way through an accounting period. The concept of coterminous accounting periods is set out in the original section 403, which enables companies to apply a formula to the profits of the acquirig company and another formula to the losses of the acquiree company. The schedule extends to six pages because the provisions that it amends are phenomenally complicated for what, in essence, is a very simple and straightforward aspect of group relief which it attempts to tackle--namely, how you apportion the profits and losses of companies acquired and existing in the group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have never done any such thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. I have, and I assure you that it is dreadfully complicated, and a great headache to deal with.
<P>
The basic problem is that when a group of companies acquires another company from outside, the law attempts to instill fairness. If, for example, the existing group acquires a loss-making company part way through the year--perhaps at a December year end, when it reports its figures, having acquired the company in June--and it finds that it has a large loss for the whole year, it would be wrong, would it not, if a full 12 months of the loss were available for group relief by the company which acquired it? Equally if you acquire a profit-making company in June, half way through your accounting period, it would be wrong, would it not--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have no such commercial intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is difficult, Mr. McWilliam, to concentrate on group relief provisions as well as parliamentary procedure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I help the hon. Gentleman? I am encouraging him to try. I know that this is an extremely complex schedule and I shall be kind to him, but I would be grateful if he could try.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Start again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have no intention of starting again, but I will resume my comments about a UK company acquiring a profit-making rather than a loss-making company. It would be wrong, would it not, if the loss-making group that acquired the profit-making company again would be able to offset its losses for the full 12 months of the accounting period of the acquired company--notwithstanding the fact that it acquired the company part way through its accounting period. That is the essence of group relief provisions and the coterminous accounting period provisions: the purpose is to avoid the whole accounting period's profits or losses being offset when the company is acquired part way through the year.
<P>
There is a potential loophole which schedule 7 seeks to close. Let us imagine the strange position whereby a group of UK companies acquired, say, two or three companies part-way through an accounting period--I give the example of a UK group acquiring two companies in June with the accounting period of the acquiring companies being December. In this case it would be possible to use the whole loss of the surrendering company, even though, technically, it should only have been able to surrender six months' worth. By way of an example, we might consider a profit-making group--making a profit of, say, &#163;10,000--acquiring half way through the year, two companies making of loss of &#163;10,000 each. It should not have been possible to use up the whole profit of the acquiring company, because it would be acquiring the loss-making companies only half way through the year. As those companies were separate, however, it would have been possible to time apportion the profit of the acquiring company on the occasion of each acquisition. That would have meant that, effectively, the acquiring group would be using all its profit against those losses, instead of being able to use only half.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The same system would apply in reverse--if the United Kingdom group was loss-making and had been acquiring two profit-making companies. The loophole has existed for many years, mainly because the Revenue and practitioners, while perceiving it as a loophole, judged that such an acquiring group would not be using up more losses than existed. The loophole was thus not a very serious one and not urgently in need of plugging.
<P>
Schedule 7 to the Bill is welcome, however, and should close the loophole, albeit that it will make dealing with group relief claims even more complicated than at present. I refer the Financial Secretary to the representations by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which found three different problems in schedule 7--two in paragraph 4 and one in paragraph 5. I do not want to discuss those provisions in detail, but the essence of the problem highlighted by the institute is that the relevant companies are consortium companies. Those differ from group companies in the matter of ownership. A group company is mainly a United Kingdom holding company which might own various 100 per cent. or 75 per cent. subsidiaries. A consortium company, by contrast, is a holding company that is owned by many shareholders, who are a consortium. In the attempt to apply the coterminous rules, the group relief rules and the opening, closing, acquiring and disposing company rules to consortium companies, complications often arise. Those, no doubt, are the complications spotted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to provide the Committee with an answer to their representations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I must make a few brief comments on schedule 7, which comprises six pages of highly complex tax regulations. It raises again the issue that I dealt with this morning in relation to clause 32 and the need for the Revenue to write corporation and taxes Bills in plainer, simpler English. Some of the schedule could have been simplified greatly.
<P>
I draw the attention of the Committee to paragraph 8, and ask members' indulgence in deciding whether they agree that my version would be better than that in the schedule. The passage in quotation marks in paragraph 8 is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, and sections 403A and 403B of the Taxes Act (limits on group relief) shall have effect accordingly as if the actual circumstances''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and this is a bit of gobbledygook if ever there was one--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```were as they are treated as having been.'''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I suggest that a better version might have been, ``shall have the effect accordingly as if the circumstances were as actually having effect.''
<P>
That is a much more precise way of putting the same thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that this Committee does not need an accountant so much as a theologian to explain the provisions--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The schedule is sufficiently impenetrable to be worthy of study without the sound of the Greek chorus on one side of the Committee. It would be nice if the hon. Gentleman could be heard in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sure that some members of the Committee would need divine intervention to understand the schedule.
<P>
I am serious when I say that we ought to examine the schedule more carefully. It is an attempt to prevent artificial loss-making schemes creating a bigger loss for the purposes of corporation tax and capital gains tax than has actually occurred. That seems to be a fairly simple concept and yet in the schedule it is treated in an extremely complex manner.
<P>
Paragraph 9 concerns commencement. These highly complex provisions would take effect more or less immediately after 2nd July--the date of the Budget. Companies will have spent many hours of accountants' expensive and precious time working out how to manage their affairs to mitigate tax losses. They should be allowed some time in which to complete the transition required by these highly complex provisions. There are numerous instances elsewhere in the Bill of a reasonable transitional period being allowed--I stress the word ``reasonable''.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will address the issue in her wind-up speech. I know that corporation tax is paid nine months after the year end; that might well not be for 10 or 11 months after 2 July, but there again, it might be only a month, in which case the tax will be due in 10 months' time. That would not give companies much time in which to re-organise their affairs to take the provisions into account. We are, therefore, justified in asking the hon. Lady for a little more transitional time.
<P>
Paragraph 9(3)(b), also under the commencement heading, talks about reducing the maximum amount
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by the amount (if any) of the relief withdrawn in respect of the part of the claimant company's accounting period beginning with 2nd July''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Presumably, that provision is supposed to apply to those companies that have acquired loss-making companies deliberately to reduce their gain, a situation to which paragraph 8 refers.
<P>
Again, companies will have taken a great deal of time and trouble to acquire those loss-making companies to substantiate such a claim to the Revenue. Where a company has gone out into the market--perhaps for good commercial reasons--and bought a loss-making company whose losses it wants to take advantage of, it should be allowed a reasonable time in which to do that. In some cases, we could be talking about substantial sums and substantial company restructuring. The companies, therefore, deserve a little more consideration from the Revenue.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary say how much money the schedule will raise and on what time scale it will come into effect? It appears that it will raise money over several years--not just in the first year of operation--and affect losses several years down the accounting periods.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for allowing me a second bite of the cherry. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Costwold--by referring to paragraph 8, he reminded me that I had omitted to raise the representation that was made by the Law Society's Revenue Law Committee, which has a specific concern about schedule 7(8). As he said, paragraph (8) refers to section 179 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. That is one of those anti-avoidance sections that are well known in the accountancy profession and which can cause great difficulties when companies restructure or dispose of companies on sale to a third party.
<P>
The essence of section 179 is as follows. You may want to dispose of a company outside your group, but may, within the past six years, have transferred into that company from another company within the group under the no gain, no loss provisions of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act. Under those provisions, the capital gains of one company can be acquired tax free by another. If your company were to dispose of the other company to a third party within six years of availing itself of that relief, that would trigger a capital gain on the acquisition of the asset. The idea of section 179 is to prevent companies from availing themselves of the tax-free provisions for transferring capital gains assets.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is giving way to only one person at a time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for putting me at the top of the queue of those of us who are anxious to intervene in my hon. Friend's most interesting and stimulating remarks.
<P>
To enable those of us who have less of a background in these matters than my hon. Friend, will he illustrate what sort of companies will be adversely affected by the defective drafting of the schedule? He talked about groups of companies that engage in particular activities. What sort of companies will be particularly adversely affected if the schedule proceeds in its current defective form?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. While the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is still in his place, I should tell him, first, that I have no intention of doing any of the things that he mentioned. Secondly, I hope that he is not under the misapprehension that the briefs to which he referred are not sent to every member of the Committee, including Ministers. Companies even send them to me, and I have to send a dusty letter back, saying that I could not possibly take a view on any of the matters in them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend for the good point that he made. Section 179 applies to most companies in this country. It and the leading provision, which is, I think, section 171, enable groups of companies, of which there are many throughout Britain, to transfer capital gains assets freely within the group without the burden or expense of having to pay corporation tax on the chargeable gain on the transfer. The assets to which the section refers include buildings and cars that are held as fixed assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a further technical point, under section 179, where a company has transferred a capital gain out of the group, will there be a capital gain clawback if the new rules come into effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend realises that, in my previous profession I would have charged at least &#163;350 an hour for such advice.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I did not hear his last point. Will he repeat it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was merely saying that, in my previous profession, the advice that my hon. Friend sought would have been charged for at the rate of &#163;350 an hour.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised that free advice is worth exactly as much as one pays for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am happy to give advice for nothing today. To refer back to the substantive point in the schedule, section 179 is an anti-avoidance provision that prevents companies from acquiring assets inter-group on a tax-free basis under section 171 and then merely selling on the company. If it were not for that section one could sell a capital gains asset, pregnant with gain, tax free to a third party by simply selling it from one company in the group to another and selling the shares of that company on to a third party to avoid a capital gain. The section was introduced to prevent that abuse.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The problem is the question of what happens to the tax liability that the company will incur if it falls foul of the anti-avoidance provisions. The section is worded so that when the provision is triggered, a capital gain is deemed to have occurred at the time that the capital gains intergroup transfer took place and is deemed to be calculated by taking the market value of that asset at the time of transfer and deducting from it the base cost of the capital gain. The company that holds the shares in the company being disposed of--
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> I am confused by what you have said. Are you in favour of or against the schedule?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not in favour of or against anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The schedule is worth while because it closes a loophole, and Opposition Members support any measure that legitimately and sensibly closes a loophole. I am raising this issue because the Law Society has made representations which are worth listening to, about the wording of the paragraph.
<P>
If the section bites, a tax charge arises in the company that disposes of the company that has acquired a capital gains asset within the past six years under the no-gain, no-loss provisions of section 171 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Law Society has written to all members of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am not 100 per cent. sure that it has done so, but I will take the hon Gentlemen's word for that. None the less the representations have not been raised in the Committee and I believe that they ought to be raised so that the Financial Secretary can respond to the point in her reply.
<P>
To return to my point, there is a corporation tax charge arising in the company disposing of the company, if the section is triggered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) has made an interesting and in some ways disturbing point. If it is true that such important representations have been received by Labour Members, does not my hon. Friend agree that it is disturbing that throughout the day none of them seems to have taken notice of any representation from any outside body? If it is the case that Labour Members have received all the many representations that Opposition Members have received and have chosen to ignore them, is it not all the more important that Opposition Members fulfil our duty to scrutinise the schedule in great detail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. I seem to recall that the only representation from an outside body that has been mentioned by a Labour Member was one put forward by the Economic Secretary when we were discussing clause 37 and interest received on gilts. That was because she agreed with that representation and it agreed with the Government's proposal. Labour Members must have received many representations that they have not put forward in the Committee, and it is beholden on us to do so in default of members of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend was interrupted in his excellent technical explanation of how paragraph 8 of schedule 7 works. I think that his technical explanation confirmed my suspicions that if the paragraph were enacted there could be a clawback for capital gains tax purposes where a company had sold off another company within its group which contained a capital gain. I suspect also that that clawback could take place up to six years from 2 July 1997. If my understanding is correct, does not he think that the legislation is retrospective, and that that is a bad general principle of taxation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I think that my hon Friend is partially right, but may I continue my explanation in my own way? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) should not heckle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am hoping that Hansard can be used as the standard text on the subject in due course.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman? It has been possible to use Hansard as the standard text on such matters for two years. It could not be used in such a way before that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to Accountancy Age for that, Mr. McWilliam--I shall no doubt submit my speech to it as an article.
<P>
Section 179 triggers a gain when a company that has acquired an asset intergroup free of tax is disposed of. Section 179 was introduced when the pay-and-file provisions were introduced a few years ago. It replaced section 178 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The difference between those sections is the site of the taxable gain that is subject to tax. Under section 179--I hope that my memory is serving me correctly--the capital gain arises at the beginning of the accounting period in which the company is sold. The question then is whether that chargeable gain can be covered by group relief, because at that point there are arrangements in place to sell the company which is making the gain clawed in by section 179.
<P>
The Law Society representation concerns whether paragraph 8 deals with that long-standing problem. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The amendment in paragraph 8 does not appear to address the substantive question of whether the whole gain deemed to arise under section 179 can be group relieved, as we believe it should, as falling prior to the company leaving the group, or whether it must be apportioned over the whole accounting period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was concentrating on the excellent second contribution from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I am sure that he will be paid if he submits it to Accountancy Age. I congratulate him on his detailed technical knowledge of the provisions and welcome his comments on the need to deal with the problems with group relief and the loss of revenues. He was supported in that argument by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
I shall answer the points raised on this detailed schedule by each contributor. First, I remind the Committee of its purpose in a form somewhat simpler than that used by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton--in a nutshell, perhaps. We are trying to prevent a situation in which the relief obtained within groups totalled more than the surrendering company's losses for that period. Therefore, the groups went back over a longer accounting period and had access to a relief they were never intended to have access to.
<P>
The legislation is complicated. It is also narrowly targeted; thank goodness that it is, given its complexity. It is a specific response to the exploitation of group relief, which both sides of the Committee agree should be dealt with. Schedule 7 has a clear structure and provides a single set of rules that cover most circumstances in which there is an overlap in the accounting period. Beleive it or not, the provision is simpler and clearer than the complex separate rules in sections 409 and 411 of the Taxes Act 1988 on companies leaving and joining groups, which can now be repealed as a result of the schedule.
<P>
I was asked about capital gains and clawback. I can tell the hon. Members for Cotswold and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that the rules will work in exactly the same way in respect of capital gains as they did before. It was also asked about paragraph 4.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Surely, with great respect to the hon. Lady, that cannot be right. The rules cannot be exactly the same as under the existing section; otherwise, what is the point of the new schedule? That comes to the heart of my point about clear English in paragraph 8, which is meant to say that losses or gains should be treated as if they actually occurred. That is probably the same meaning as the convoluted wording in the schedule. Will the hon. Lady confirm that?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was coming on to paragraph 8, but I can deal with it now. I should remind the hon. Gentleman that groups of companies were deliberately using accounting periods to gain access to relief that they should not have had. Before I answer the specific question about paragraph 8, I should like to answer his other point about the likely yield. I can tell him that, taken together, yields from the restrictions on capital allowances, financed lessors and group relief of companies would amount to &#163;200 million in the current financial year, 1997-98, and &#163;300 million in 1998-99.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I an grateful to the hon. Lady for allowing me to intervene. I assume that the answer to the question will be that it is not possible to disaggregate the numbers. However, I suspect that the group relief provisions in schedule 7 will not increase the yield of tax revenue to the Government. They are merely a cash flow measure, as before the provisions were introduced, companies were able to obtain use of losses earlier than they otherwise could. Does it not amount only to a speeding up of the cash flow to the Government rather that a real gain in tax revenue?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, to give a shortened answer. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for following the argument so closely and also for his clear support for the intention behind the measures.
<P>
With regard to paragaph 8, the hon. Members for Cotswold and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton picked up the point raised by the Law Society. The concern was whether the gain deemed to arrive under section 179--dealing with companies leaving a group--must be apportioned over the whole acccounting period. The answer is no, it need not. A provision allows for a just and reasonable apportionment rather than a simple time apportionment. Thus a just and reasonable apportionment may be appropriate in such cases, so the whole gain is deemed to arise from the company that leaves the group.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the change to section 405(4), which relates to joint consortium and group relief claims. I do not think that what he said was right. Section 405(4) has much the same effect under the new rules as it had under the old. I am advised that the point may have been raised as a result of some confusion between the corresponding accounting period mentioned in section 405 and the overlapping accounting period mentioned in new section 403A. If the hon. Gentleman would like me to explain that precisely in writing, I shall endeavour to do so in order to put his mind at rest.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That would be much appreciated as it would put the matter beyond doubt. I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for the clear way in which she has addressed these issues.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That brings me to the hon. Gentleman's second point, which relates to the limits on relief for linked companies. I must apologise to the hon. Gentleman because I did not follow his question as closely as I should have done in order to understand it properly. I shall pick that point up when I write to him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To if not short circuit the process, then at least facilitate the process of getting this right, will the Financial Secretary write also to the institute so that it has a chance to make representations? In that way, if there are any adjustments to be made--I am not necessarily claiming that there are--they can be taken into account, perhaps by a Government amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have no objection to that, although I am sure that the hon. Gentleman could ensure that his letter found its way to the institute. I agree to his request in the spirit in which it was asked. The Committee is trying to find a sensible solution to a complex problem that we all want to see resolved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was making the point that the timetable is compressed. I do not want to put unreasonable burdens on the Financial Secretary or her officials, I am just anxious that communication should take place in parallel, so that it can properly be considered by those professionals and put right before next week.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The final point that was raised on this subject was that it would make the work of groups claiming far more complex. It should not because, typically, groups tend to have the same accounting date, in which case the new rules will make no practical difference. Where companies have different accounting dates, the new rules will not result in more claims being made but I acknowledge that companies will have to consider carefully the order in which they make claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have been trying to understand the Financial Secretary's response to my point about paragraph 8 of schedule 7. It is now just beginning to sink in and I have a query on it. It would be helpful to the profession generally to have a categorical response, either from the hon. Lady's officials now or by letter in the next day or two. My question was whether the section 179 charge occurs at the beginning of the accounting period of the company that leaves the group or whether it needs to be time-apportioned over the whole accounting period of that company and therefore is not available for group relief. The hon. Lady's answer that it is just and reasonable apportionment does not go to the root of the matter. Will she confirm the answer that the Law Society seeks--does the gain arise at the beginning, all at once, as capital gains usually do, at the beginning of the accounting period of the company which leaves the group, or should it accrue over the whole accounting period of the group, in which case the group relief provisions will apply to it?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am advised that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes. He is correct in his specific summary of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If the hon. Lady's answer is correct, will she explain the last point I made in my speech? Paragraph 9(3)(a) and (b) seem to be contradictory. Sub-paragraph (3)(a) states that if the overlapping period begins on or before 2 July the provision--presumably paragraph 8--would not apply, but sub-paragraph (3)(b) states that the amount will be reduced, presumably as if paragraph 8 does apply. That seems to be a total contradiction and I should be grateful for the hon. Lady's explanation.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have said that we do not believe that paragraph 9(3)(a) and (b) are contradictory and I have given an explanation to the Committee. However, in the sprit of the Committee's discussion this evening, I shall scrutinise the Hansard report of our debate very carefully, as I am sure will my officials. Our intention is to prevent unintended relief from going to group companies. That was not the intention of the Conservative party when in Government and is not the intention of the Labour party now.
<P>
I am grateful for the support from members of the Committee on what is still not the simplest of measures but is making progress in the right direction.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order on clause 42, Mr. McWilliam. There are some amendments to the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, we have disposed of clause 42 and, secondly, the hon. Gentleman in whose name the amendments were tabled was not present so I presumed that he did not wish to move them. I put the clause to the Committee, which agreed to it, but hon. Members are free to return to it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. McWilliam. Your ruling, by definition, must be correct, but I want to make one small point for future reference. If an hon. Member is not in the Room, it is open to any member of the Committee to move an amendment. I would like the matter elucidated for future reference.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct, but we must be quick on our feet because my duty is order and progress.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Expenditure of a small company or small business. 1990 c. 1</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 38, line 17, leave out `or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 55.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clauses 42 and 43 make available temporary first year allowances on expenditure incurred by small or medium businesses on machinery or plant. It has come to our attention that as drafted the definition of small and medium companies excludes small or medium building societies and certain other bodies which are not formed and registered under the Comanies Act 1985, such as friendly societies, industrial and provident societies and charter companies. That was not our intention and the amendments to clause 43 will restore those organisations to their rightful place in receipt of the relief.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 55, in page 38, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) a registered friendly society within the meaning of Chapter II of Part XII of the principal Act; or

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish to say a few words about clause 43. In some respects, clauses 42 and 43 cover the same subject. We have passed clause 42 without debate. Clause 43 is important in that it sets out which companies benefit from the temporary first-year allowances. Conservative Members have no objection in principle to higher capital allowances for small companies, although we are mindful of the fact that previous experiments in singling out types of companies for special treatment have caused anomalies and difficult definitional problems, as well as problems with administration and enforcement in cases where, to put it delicately, some practitioners try to gain maximum benefit for themselves or their clients. We need to scrutinise the borderline between those who benefit and those who do not.
<P>
The history of temporary capital allowances is not altogether encouraging. I am not sure whether such inducements lead to any increase in total investment. Increases are determined by larger forces and, certainly, an attempt to encourage investment through temporary inducements can lead to a time shift but not a gross increase.
<P>
The issue of which companies apply is important, but one that should be put into context. Overwhelmingly, most companies in this country are small or medium in size. Indeed, in our earlier debates, we have touched on the fact that those companies provide most of the extra employment created in recent years. Generally, large corporations shed labour or, as they choose to call it, downsize, leaving the smaller, almost invisible sectors of the economy--with which, through our constituency work, we may be more familiar than most people--to be the motors for employment generation. We have to accept, however, that larger companies, although fewer in number, overwhelmingly undertake most capital investment, particularly in plant and machinery. The clause's provisions--probably intentionally--would completely miss most of the companies that undertake most investment and, therefore, would be of no assistance to them. The overall effect would be cheapened. The Red Book contains figures on the total costs of the measure. For the current year there is no cost but, in 1998-99, the cost to the Exchequer will be &#163;230 million. That is a not insignificant sum, but a tiny one compared with the gross amount of investment or the normal capital allowances that are claimed in respect of that investment.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need to investigate a little more carefully how the clause will single out and identify the companies concerned. It takes a slightly cumbersome definition from company law in which a company is assessed on the basis of whether it falls into the definition over a two-year period. It will not be easy to ascertain whether a company, partnership or sole trader--or aggregation of such enterprises--qualify for the accelerated and larger first-year allowances. Does the United Kingdom branch of an overseas company have to be aggregated with all the company's foreign operations to qualify? That is not clear.
<P>
I do not expect a clause necessarily to list every eventuality. It is, however, important that it gives generic guidance so that we can determine what is not included in the definition and what will, therefore, cause problems for the tax authorities and businesses.
<P>
An individual who is carrying on more than one sole trade--which might not be uncommon--may also cause a problem. Sole traders are dealt with in the clause, but an individual may have several different and unrelated independent activities. Would all those businesses have to be aggregated together to ascertain whether the sole trader qualifies for the temporary first-year allowances? A sole trader could trade in partnership with a number of other people. Although not a member of that partnership, his trading is related to it. Would all the sole traders and all the partners in the partnership have to be aggregated together to discover whether they fall within the definitions in the clause?
<P>
Trades with different accounting periods may not be especially common, but we must anticipate possible problems. It is one of our functions to highlight difficult cases so that they can be tackled and resolved now rather than waiting for a difficult dispute to occur between a business and the Inland Revenue or the tax authorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> While my right hon. Friend is listing the problems that need to be addressed, will he add to the list the representation made by the Revenue law committee of the Law Society? It asks what the compliance burden would be for unincorporated businesses; what will they have to demonstrate to be entitled to the new first-year allowances? It is keen that the bureaucracy of the compliance burden for unincorporated businesses is kept to a minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point Clauses 42 and 43 are designed to benefit businesses in the small and medium-sized sector. We must be especially alert to any suspicion that that could be undermined by additional compliance costs. It will not be much use to a small trader trying to get on with his business if he has to employ an army of accountants and lawyers to determine whether he falls within the definitions in the clause.
<P>
We are faced with a well-meaning attempt to give a capital allowance injection to the small and medium-sized sector, but the borderline between that sector and the larger is not easy to define. One knows that provisions elsewhere in the law try to define that sector, but none has done it in quite this way and for quite this purpose. The previous Government introduced accelerated capital allowances for all sizes of business and that, clearly, was easier to administer. The clause is a new departure and I should like the Financial Secretary to address herself to my questions and to the workability of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for allowing an intervention that saves me from making a separate contribution. Would my right hon. Friend ask the Financial Secretary to clarify the timing involved? Companies will have only a year in which to carry out expenditure, but operations are often complex and involve a lot of planning. Will a capital expenditure payment on account be acceptable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, that is a fair point and the Financial Secretary will have heard it. My hon. Friend emphasised that a year is a short time in which to do the paperwork, make the capital investment and enter a claim. If there are additional problems, the timing could be a burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The clause is designed to provide 50 per cent. capital allowances over one year for small companies. That is its essence and three material principles are enshrined in it. Are 50 per cent. capital allowances a good idea or not? Is one year a sensible restriction of those allowances? Is availability for only small companies acceptable or sensible? If I may, I shall address those three issues in turn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not. He should have addressed those points under the previous clause, but he was not present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not know whether you agree, Mr. McWilliam, that clause 43 does enshrine those three principles?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. It qualifies those principles, which are set out in the previous clause, which has already been accepted by the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I bow to you, of course, Mr. McWilliam, and to your interpretation of the clause. But I repeat that I understand clause 43 to provide for 50 per cent. capital allowances for small companies over a period of a year. It seems to me that those are the three essential elements of the clause. One could not subtract a single one of those elements and still have a clause that had any effect, never mind the effect that the Government desire.
<P>
The question is whether those three elements are a good combination. I hope that I will be allowed to address that issue. It seems to me that the concept of 50 per cent. capital allowances is problematic. It is not certain to what extent cheapening the cost of capital by--for tax purposes--allowing faster depreciation that would be--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is completely ignoring my ruling. The 50 per cent. principle came in under the previous clause. He was not here to make his speech on that. He should not attempt to make it on another clause, which does not bring in that principle but merely qualifies it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps I can ask your guidance, Mr. McWilliam. Am I allowed to talk about these allowances being limited to small companies? Or to one year?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Those matters were the subject of the previous clause. If the hon. Gentleman wants my guidance, he should be on time and he was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I apologise profusely for not having been in the Committee Room for our debate on the previous clause. I am sure that you, Mr. McWilliam, do not think that I was trying to delvier on this clause the speech that I had anticipated delivering on the previous clause--that is not the case. I should not during our debate on the earlier clause, have been able to deliver the remarks that I have just made because they would not have applied to it.
<P>
I am most confused about the guidance that you have given, Mr. McWilliam, and I am having difficulty fidning whatever element of logic or coherence may lie behind it. Of course, I do not deny that your guidance is the very epitome of coherence, lucidity and good sense.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not accusing the Chair of lacking logic or coherence. If he were, that would consitute criticism of the Chair and would be out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You must have been so engaged in the conversation that I noticed that you were having with your Clerk that you did not quite grasp what I said, Mr. McWilliam. I said that I regard your guidance as being--by definition--the epitome of coherence and wisdom. I founder in my own inadequacy and I apologise for that--I found it extremely difficult to follow the abstruse reasoning that you were adducing. I am struggling in my mind--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must assist the hon. Gentleman. If he were to read the notes on clauses, which were helpfully provided by the Minister, he would find that the matter is quite clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> From time to time, I also have a problem with notes on clauses. I find them much more abstruse, obscure and difficult to follow than the Bill--which is saying a great deal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I feel that this is the moment to remark that rarely , if ever, has my hon. Freind been so contrite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend--whom I thought was indeed my hon. Friend in every sense of the word--does not do me justice. He is being uncharacteristically unfair to me this evening. I had always thought that contrition and modesty were self-evident parts of my personality. I can hardly imagine--
