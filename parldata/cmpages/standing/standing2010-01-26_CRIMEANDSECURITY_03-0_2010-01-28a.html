<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160160</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000200"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much. I shall ask each of you to
make an introductory comment lasting a minute&#151;no more&#151;on
the overview of those you represent on the Bill. When you answer
questions from members of the Committee, could you please be as
succinct as possible, not least because in this sitting we have five
organisations giving evidence and we have to finish by 10.25. Could you
begin, Mr.
Moore?</div><a name="10012859000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> The Association of Chief Police Officers,
through its council of 43 chief officers, has discussed its support for
a domestic violence protection notice and order. The council agrees in
principle that this is a necessary piece of legislation to improve the
safety of victims of domestic violence. We have discussed with the
Police Superintendents Association of England and Wales its support as
its members are likely to be key to the Bill&#146;s implementation.
It supports the need for the Bill and will support it if Parliament
approves it. That is the position of the senior echelons of the police
service on the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="10012859000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> We welcome the proposal because it is based
on need and it will assist the police to uphold their duty to protect
the public. It should form part of a co-ordinated community response to
domestic violence. Our last annual survey showed that on one day in a
refuge, 65 per cent. of the women had reported to the police, yet
prosecutions were being taken forward for only 16 per cent. of those
women, so there is a big gap in police responses and provision of
protection. Space away from the perpetrator will enable women to become
free and consider their options and their children&#151;we must not
forget any children who are involved. Evaluation of such orders in
other countries shows that they are effective because the specialist
support service enables the victim&#151;it may be a male victim, we
should remember&#151;to look at their options and to be free from the
perpetrator&#146;s control. Our main concern is that in other
countries the legislation ensures that the police make a referral to
the support service. At the moment the Bill does not provide for
that.</div><a name="10012859000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> The Fawcett Society also welcomes the
proposed revisions. We think that they address a really important gap
in the protection for victims of domestic violence, particularly in the
immediate aftermath of an incident, when evidence shows that women are
particularly vulnerable. We also think that the provisions allow an
additional safe space for those women or men to be free from coercion
and intimidation, which is the very specific nature of the crime that
we need to bear in mind when we are thinking about general legal
applications. Should they choose to avail themselves of longer term
existing civil protections, we also agree that it is vital that the
provisions are accompanied by wider support services for victims, and
also perpetrator interventions and support for male and female
perpetrators, for example, in securing housing, should that be
necessary.</div>
<a name="10012859000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude,
we think, critically, that the provisions will strengthen the
state&#146;s ability to fulfil its positive obligation and its duty
under the European convention on human rights to protect
victims&#146; right to life and their right to a home and family. We
also think that the provisions are compatible with the European
convention on human rights in terms of the right to a fair trial for
alleged perpetrators.</div>
<a name="10012859000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> We are the largest domestic violence legal
charity in the country and we specifically deal with legal remedies
that are available at the moment. Of course, under the Family Law Act
1996 there are various orders and a raft of provisions that can provide
very valuable protection at the moment, but there are some gaping holes
and problems with the current system, particularly the inability of a
third party, such as the police, to make an application on behalf of
the victim, who is usually very intimidated, daunted and fearful at the
time. The police force having the ability to make that application is
welcome.</div><a name="10012859000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Timing
can be a problem as well. It is usually very hard for a victim of
domestic violence to have a safe space to make informed decisions and
to allow them to move forward with their life. We are very much in
support of the legislation. I think, as has already been mentioned, one
of the key elements is the co-ordination as part of a co-ordinated
response working with agencies out there to provide continued support.
We are certainly in favour of the
legislation.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div><a name="10012859000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> Refuge positively welcomes the proposals as
filling a serious gap in current remedies. The point of
crisis&#151;immediately after a domestic violence assault&#151;we
know is the time when 75 per cent. of homicides occur in domestic
violence cases. That is the period when all our agencies need an
opportunity to work together to provide a co-ordinated response to the
victim and her children. That will assist the police, in
Refuge&#146;s view, in providing much needed initial protection in
those early days, so that we have the opportunity to get to the
victim&#151;she will usually have experienced years of control of her
every action by the perpetrator and will be terrified. She is
frequently totally ignorant of the support services that are
potentially available for her and of the measures and remedies that
might be open to her. There is a need for counselling and for her to
feel safe and that she is being protected, to start to make some calm
decisions about her and her children&#146;s future and to make safety
plans with specialist domestic violence agencies. Refuge welcomes the
proposals.</div><a name="10012859000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000201"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am most grateful for those overviews from all
of you. The questioning will begin with Tony
Baldry.</div>
<a name="10012859000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><a name="10012859000202"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): We are all agreed that domestic
violence is a serious issue that has to be tackled. It is particularly
serious because it inherently involves a breach of trust. I was
fortunate last year to be part of the police parliamentary scheme,
which involves spending a number of days with the police&#151;in my
case, the Thames Valley police. I was very impressed by the seriousness
with which domestic violence was taken&#151;specialist officers and
specialist units&#151;and by the fact that whenever there was a
report of domestic violence, it was dealt with as an immediate
blue-light incident that officers went
to.</div><a name="10012859000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is to look at the practicalities. On Second Reading, one of our
colleagues, Humfrey Malins, who is a part-time judge and sits as a
Crown court recorder, made rather an interesting speech. He said that
he
was</div><a name="10012859000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;old
enough now to be released from Standing
Committees&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 18 January 2010;
Vol. 504, c.
78.]</div><a name="10012859000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you
can see, he is not on the Committee, so clearly we are all young enough
to be on such Committees. I want to put my question to Mr.
Moore, but if others want to chip in, please feel free to do
so.</div><a name="10012859000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Humfrey&#146;s
first point was: why does one need a domestic violence protection
notice? If there is an incident of alleged domestic violence, why does
one not simply charge the perpetrator for assault, actual bodily harm,
grievous bodily harm or whatever the appropriate criminal charge is,
and then deal with exclusion from the matrimonial home, if need be, by
bail
condition?</div><a name="10012859000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> The position is that we want exactly that. The
domestic violence protection notice is not an alternative to a criminal
justice approach. The police service will always try to arrest and
prosecute for an assault on a victim. There are 200,000 arrests per
year, but only about 60,000 prosecutions&#151;there is a gap of about
140,000 cases where there is insufficient evidence available to bring a
prosecution. In those circumstances, the perpetrator is released from
the police station and goes back to the very address where he was
arrested perhaps 24 hours earlier. That is an extremely dangerous time
and that is the gap we are trying to close. When the police have done
all they can to bring a prosecution 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>after arrest and it is simply not possible to do so, there remains a gap
where there is a high level of risk. In that period, we want the
superintendent to be able to issue a notice to buy the victim some
protected space while other legal remedies are worked through. I agree
with Mr. Malins to the extent that we should be trying as
hard as we can to bring a prosecution, and that is what we will
continue to do, but there is a significant and substantial gap that
unfortunately leaves victims very much at risk when a person is
released from the police station without
charge.</div><a name="10012859000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000203"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Could we go through the practicalities of this? I
do not know about Wiltshire, but my impression in Oxfordshire is this:
Oxford is divided into divisions and, of a night, each division has a
sergeant, maybe four constables, a duty inspector for PACE purposes,
and there is one superintendent for the whole county based in Oxford.
Under the provisions of the Bill as drafted, the superintendent has to
listen to the representations of those upon whom a DVPN&#151;domestic
violence protection notice&#151;might be imposed, which indicates
that the superintendent has to have the individual physically in front
of them to hear their
representations.</div><a name="10012859000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us suppose that there is a domestic violence incident in Banbury on my
patch. Two officers will have to take the alleged perpetrator in a
police car to St. Aldates in Oxford to find the duty
superintendent. That would mean two police officers being taken away
from the usual four&#151;only four&#151;in Banbury at night. If
that to happen, why does it have to be the rank of superintendent? Why
not inspector? If it is a superintendent, do you not see a lot of
logistical
issues?</div><a name="10012859000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> No, I do not. We have discussed this carefully
with the Police Superintendents Association. There is at least one
superintendent on duty in every policy force 24 hours a day. Under PACE
provisions, they have been doing that very successfully for 25 years
and have been available to deal with issues relating to bail and human
rights. It will not be a problem for the superintendent to engage
properly in his or her responsibilities in this case&#151;we have
discussed
it.</div><a name="10012859000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the duty should be at the rank of superintendent. This is a serious
issue of potentially depriving someone access to their home, and that
is the minimum rank that we think should be engaged. If, for whatever
reason, the superintendent was totally tied up with a serious terrorist
matter, a chief officer would be engaged to fulfil the duties of the
superintendent on the matter. We think that a serious deprivation of
rights and liberties is being contemplated, and it should be done at a
senior level by someone who is already experienced, through using the
PACE provisions, to understand the effect upon liberty. The joint view
of ACPO and the Police Superintendents Association that it should be at
least the rank of superintendent. We are confident that we can provide
coverage across the country, as and when cases
arise.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000204"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I do not dispute that every force might well have
a duty superintendent who is there, as you say, to cover a whole number
of things. My concern was more that police constables will be taken off
patrolling duties, often to travel quite large distances, to find a
superintendent. They do not do that at the moment. If it is a PACE
inquiry, they will find the duty inspector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>who will be in their police station. I do not know about Wiltshire, but
people are going to have to travel quite large distances, are they
not?</div><a name="10012859000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> I have never come across the example that you
have outlined, where the prisoner is taken to the superintendent.
Superintendents are on call, in vehicles, and their job is to travel to
various custody suites to deal with various aspects of PACE. It will be
the superintendent who is mobile and travelling, discharging a number
of obligations. They will carefully sequence this, so they will deal
with all the PACE applications and the domestic violence applications
at the same time. We have been managing the multiple demands upon a
superintendent&#146;s time quite successfully for 25 years. In my
experience, it is the superintendent who travels to the custody suite,
rather than prisoners being ferried all over the place to meet the
superintendent.</div><a name="10012859000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000205"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> There seems to be a lacuna here. Say a person
accused of perpetrating domestic violence is brought into the police
station and the custody sergeant does not think it appropriate to
charge them with an actual offence. One of these notices is issued, and
then they will have to come before the magistrates within 48
hours. If this happens on a Friday night, Oxford or Banbury magistrates
court will hear all these orders on a Monday morning. What test will
the magistrates have to apply that they would not apply in an instance
of common assault? What issues will they have to consider at that
time?</div><a name="10012859000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> A prosecution will not be possible because the
Crown Prosecution Service will have advised that there is no likelihood
of conviction on the basis of the available evidence. There is a high
burden of proof: beyond reasonable doubt. The superintendent and the
magistrates will be considering, on the balance of probabilities, if
there has been violence and there is going to be violence again in the
future, unless an order is put in place by the magistrates to keep the
protected space going, so that the victim&#151;properly supported, as
my colleagues have said, by advisers&#151;may decide to pursue a
civil order to keep that perpetrator away. One test is that beyond
reasonable doubt there is sufficient evidence to bring a prosecution.
The magistrate and the superintendent consider, on the balance of
probabilities, there has been violence and there will be violence
again, and it is necessary to act to keep that victim
safe.</div><a name="10012859000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000206"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I have a couple of questions for Dr. Connor, but
this is my last question to you. Humfrey Malins made the point that
there was under-charging, so that police officers or police forces tend
to charge common assault</div>
<a name="10012859000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;because it does
not go to the Crown court, so they get a quick guilty plea and a lesser
sentence. Very nasty violence is not being dealt with in the courts as
it should be due to under-charging. The problem is endemic among police
forces in the south-east, as far as I can
see.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 18 January 2010; Vol. 504,
c. 81.]</div><a name="10012859000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do you
think there is under-charging at present, because the CPS prefers
matters to go for a quick plea to magistrates
court?</div><a name="10012859000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> I was surprised at Mr.
Malins&#146; comments. The police service and the CPS have been left
in no doubt about the seriousness of domestic violence and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>try to prosecute to the maximum. His view does not reflect my
experience. We try very hard to bring charges that reflect the gravity
of what has gone
on.</div><a name="10012859000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000207"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> May I ask Dr. Connor some quick questions? There
appear to be orders under the Family Law Act 1996 and the Domestic
Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, so they are already on the
statute book. If I understood the Second Reading debate correctly,
those provisions have simply not been implemented. If those provisions
of those Acts, which are already on the statute book, were to be
implemented, would there still be a need for this new piece of
legislation?</div><a name="10012859000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> The two orders have obviously been
enacted&#151;in 1996. The section to which I think that you refer is
the one that allows an interested third party to make an application on
behalf of the victim. Is that the section that you
mean?</div><a name="10012859000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000208"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I assume so,
yes.</div><a name="10012859000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> It certainly would assist if that section
were implemented to allow someone else to make an application. The real
difficulty in using the Family Law Act as a very quick emergency remedy
is that it puts the application in the hands of the victim themselves,
so they have to go to court and make the application&#151;they are
the applicant in the case. The proposed system would allow the police
at that point to take the perpetrator into custody. If a charge is not
made, they could issue, with the permission of the superintendent, a
domestic violence protection notice. Although we have always said that
ultimately a non-molestation order or an occupation order may be
granted during the duration of the domestic violence protection order,
the measure would speed up the process and allow the victim to have a
safety barrier during that first 48 hours that they would not
ordinarily have.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000209"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> The proposal uses the word
&#147;molesting&#148;, which comes from matrimonial and family law
and civil legislation. What we have here is a concept of the police
effectively bringing civil proceedings before the magistrates court. Is
not part of the issue that it is now so difficult for people to get
legal aid? In days gone by, people could get non-molestation
orders&#151;in fact they still can&#151;or ouster orders in the
county court, but the difficulty is accessing legal aid to do that.
Effectively, what used to be done at the county courts or the civil
courts will be done in a rather hybrid way in the magistrates court,
with a mixture of the police and magistrates having to apply, not a
criminal test, but a civil test to proceedings brought by the
police.</div><a name="10012859000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>You are absolutely right. I
completely agree with the first part of what you said. People not
qualifying for public funding is a monumental problem. The Legal
Services Commission&#146;s stance that everyone who is a victim of
domestic violence qualifies for public funding could not be further
from the truth in practice, and we deal with that day in, day
out.</div>
<a name="10012859000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving that
issue to one side, even if public funding were available to everybody,
the problem still arises that it is in the victim&#146;s hands to
make an application to the county court for the protection that they
need. Even if they are eligible for public funding, it can take some
time to be able to get that legal protection in place. They have to
find the solicitor, an outreach worker, a McKenzie friend or an
advocate to go to court.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="10012859000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
police having to bring a civil action to the magistrates court, there
will, as Mr. Moore said, still have been an arrest; the case
will have gone through the police process, and it will still go before
the magistrates court at the lower burden of proof, but that is not
much different from the present position with things such as ASBOs,
which are brought on a lower burden of proof. Since the introduction of
the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which has
criminalised the breach of the civil order&#151;the non-molestation
order&#151;we are already dealing with a hybrid mix of both criminal
and civil law, with two different burdens, so I do not see that that
will be a major problem or a major
change.</div><a name="10012859000047"></a>

<a name="10012859000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

Home Department that this should be a pilot, so that we can properly
understand all the implications and all the unintended consequences
that might flow, particularly to make sure that we resource our
intentions properly and that we understand the implications of
resourcing. We think it would be a wise and prudent step to limit this.
We think that, between the Home Department and the Ministry of Justice,
officials can put in place an evaluation plan from which an objective
decision can be taken about whether the scheme has been successful or
not, before it is rolled out
nationally.</div><a name="10012859000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><a name="10012859000214"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I have
only two brief questions and am quite happy to hear from everybody,
because I expect very brief answers. I always approach these matters
from the civil liberties point of view and I am concerned about the
civil liberties of P. You have obviously focused more on the other
party. I note that in clause 25 there is no requirement, as I
understand it, for the court to consider representations made by P, if
P is available to make them. I take it that none of you would have any
objections to a requirement being written into the Bill that the court
should listen to the representations of P.</div>
<a name="10012859000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly and
differently, as far as I can see in clause 25 or the related
clauses, there is no ability for P to apply back to the court during
the currency of the domestic  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>violence protection order for the court to vary or discharge the order.
Again, I take it that none of you would have any objection to my
writing into the Bill a right for the P to apply back and the court to
have an ability to discharge or vary the order if it thinks
fit.</div><a name="10012859000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> I will come in on the first question, and I
might have to hear the second one again. My understanding is that the
courts are subject to article 6 of the European convention on human
rights&#151;the right to a fair trial. That piece of legislation
already, exists with certain bars that protect civil
liberty.</div><a name="10012859000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000215"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> So you would say that you have no objections to its
going in the Bill, because you think it is in the law
anyway?</div><a name="10012859000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> I think we would have to take advice from
lawyers, but as far as I understand it, it is not a requirement,
because the courts already come under the European convention on human
rights. All of the court&#146;s proceedings have to follow the
standards of civil liberties and a fair trial for
both&#151;</div><a name="10012859000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000216"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Would you not think it a good idea to put it on the
face of the
Bill?</div><a name="10012859000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> In every Bill that is produced that requires
courts to consider it, that has not necessarily been the case to date.
I think it is a moot point, but I certainly agree in principle that the
court must uphold the standards of article 6. If, for some reason, that
needs to be outlined in the Bill, let it be so; but I would be
surprised if that were necessary, because the courts have to operate
under that
standard.</div><a name="10012859000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000217"></a>The

this?</div><a name="10012859000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i>
No.</div><a name="10012859000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> In principle, I agree. I would ask you to
consider that the duration of the order may be as little as 14 days. It
should be a proportionate court hearing. Some great trial, with lawyers
everywhere, for a maximum of 14 or 28 days, needs a proportionate
hearing and testing of whether violence has occurred or may occur
again. If we are clear about the brief, then of course in principle
what you say is right, but I ask you to consider the proportionality of
the hearing in relation to the nature and duration of the
order.</div><a name="10012859000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000218"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> You are saying that you do not object to the
principle, but wonder whether it is worth incorporating on the grounds
of proportionality. Am I right in thinking that that is your
view?</div><a name="10012859000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Correct.</div>
<a name="10012859000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> As far as I understand it, at least the
perpetrator or respondent is made aware of the date of the magistrates
court hearing. That reflects the current situation in the civil law
with a non-molestation order or occupation order. Once that is granted
without notice at the initial application, the respondent is made aware
by service of the return date, but they are not required to turn up at
the return date. They are simply made aware of it. In our experience,
about 40 per cent. of respondents do not turn up on the return date, so
I do not think that there is anything controversial or new in that. I
think that genuinely reflects the current situation, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>using the protection available under the Family Law Act. I may have
misunderstood this point, but I think it would be quite hard to require
the
respondent&#151;</div><a name="10012859000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000219"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am not requiring any response. If he turns up, he
should be given the opportunity to make representations. If he chooses
not to turn up, that is bad luck for the
respondent.</div><a name="10012859000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Yes, and the county courts, dealing with
without notice applications, are now stepping away and even going in
the other direction by not having return dates. Under the case of re F,
they are taking away the automatic return dates, which were seven
or  10 days down the line, and putting the burden on the
respondent to make an application back to court to have the order
varied or discharged or to make representations about the initial order
that was granted. I think it reflects perfectly what is already
there.</div><a name="10012859000069"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000220"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Are you suggesting that an order can be made without
the respondent being told of the return date?</div>
<a name="10012859000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> No, that is not the point I am making. In the
Bill as it is at the moment, the respondent is made aware of the return
date. I am saying that that is exactly the same, traditionally, as what
has been happening on the without notice applications through the
county courts for both non-molestation orders and occupation orders.
Relatively recently, the county courts dealing with non-molestation
orders and occupation orders have been stepping away from having a
return date, so rather than having the return date on the face of the
order, stating that the respondent can come back to court on 7 March,
for example, they are now taking that out and simply having in the
final provision of the non-molestation order the provision that the
order will remain in force for 12 months. If the respondent feels that
it is necessary to come to court and make their representations, the
burden is on them to come to the court and make an application to be
heard. The theory is that that will save a massive amount of court
time.</div>
<a name="10012859000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
there are concerns and arguments about human rights and whether there
should be an automatic return date, but that was summed up in the
relatively recent case of re F&#151;unfortunately, I do not have the
reference to hand&#151;which said that the human rights aspect was
satisfied by allowing the respondent the right to come to court and put
their representations, but not making that an automatic right. With
that in mind, there is nothing really controversial about that at
all.</div>

that?</div><a name="10012859000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

adequately summed up that this is akin to measures in an injunction,
and there is an established acceptance of practice there
now.</div><a name="10012859000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
174</b><a name="10012859000222"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): It is clear that
all the panel members are very strong advocates of the domestic
violence protection notice, but I would like to examine a little
further the circumstances in which you think it should apply. Clearly,
there will be cases of one-off incidents, perhaps where both parties
are involved in domestic violence, for example. In those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>circumstances, would you expect the notice to be applied, and is there
not the risk that a one-off problem that might have been resolved
within the household could actually be escalated by the application of
a DVPN? To play devil&#146;s advocate and make a counter-argument, is
there a risk that the impact of a DVPN on a partner who has a history
of violence will escalate that violence and that the victim will be on
the receiving end of
it?</div><a name="10012859000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000223"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would you like to answer
that?</div><a name="10012859000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000224"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Whoever feels it is
appropriate.</div><a name="10012859000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> You raise a number of points. Yes, we are
strong advocates for the orders. It is very important, first, to
understand that domestic violence is not an equal thing that goes on
between two people. There are very clear perpetrators and victims. Our
understanding of how the orders will work is that the police will
clearly identify the victim and the perpetrator&#151;there should be
no confusion about that. One of the current problems is that a lot of
counter-allegations are being made by male perpetrators who then claim
to be victims. Respect&#151;the national organisation that works with
male victims and that runs the male victims helpline and the national
perpetrator organisation&#151;has developed special assessment
processes for determining who is the perpetrator and the victim where
there are counter-allegations.</div>
<a name="10012859000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
something of which the police are obviously aware and have to take into
account. The police will have to separate the parties, as they normally
do when they respond to an incident. They will then talk to both
parties and, having done that, they will also carry out a risk
assessment, which will indicate the risk. Again, that reiterates the
need for the orders, because the order will ensure that the victim can
be safe and protected and that the perpetrator is removed from the
scene. The police will have to get the address of the perpetrator, so
they know where the perpetrator is, and they will have to put in place
measures to manage the perpetrator risk. That is where it is very
important that the support service immediately comes into play, because
it has to work with the victim and the children&#151;where there are
children&#151;to develop safety and support plans and begin work with
the victim. I do not think I have covered all of your points
there&#151;you made a number of them&#151;but I hope that answers
to an extent some of your
questions.</div><a name="10012859000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
I add a further point about prosecution and conviction? Where a
prosecution can be upheld and taken forward, that is great, but once
again, the police will take into account any previous incidents. We
have to remember that, on many occasions, most of the victims in our
services have reported to the police at least once, and they have
usually experienced incidents of domestic violence many times before
they actually report to the police. The other factor to remember is
that although the police respond to incidents, domestic violence is a
pattern of controlling behaviour that the perpetrator uses. They use
physical violence and other forms of violence, such as psychological,
emotional and sexual violence, to control the victim.</div>
<a name="10012859000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given what we
responding to, that is where we think we need the orders. We have
already heard that not many prosecutions go forward; the new provisions
will fill that gap. The other thing that the Committee needs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>to realise is that a prosecution and a conviction do not necessarily
increase the safety of the victim. Whether the conviction results in a
custodial or community-based sentence, victims will still very often
have to take measures and put things in place to make themselves safe,
because the sentence does not mean
protection.</div><a name="10012859000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> I want to express the fact that domestic
violence is never an isolated incident. By its very nature, it is a
systematic pattern of a range of coercive behaviours of power and
control, involving financial abuse or, in  50 per cent. of
cases, physical or sexual abuse of the children. Physical violence is
merely one of the many patterns of behaviour that we see when we work
with domestic violence cases. So only some of the things that the
perpetrator is doing may constitute a crime, but when organisations
such as Refuge are involved, we see a whole pattern of complex
behaviours that are very challenging for the victim to deal
with.</div><a name="10012859000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is perhaps hard for people who have not had personal contact with
domestic violence to understand it&#151;one might imagine it is to do
with phenomena such as marital breakdown or conflict between a couple.
Domestic violence is nothing to do with that. It is not an expression
of an interpersonal problem. It is rather that, because there is no
equality between the partners enabling them to have a healthy argument
in the first place, it is a systematic pattern of power and control and
it is not going to be resolved by sorting out a conflict. It needs to
be sorted out by a co-ordinated response from appropriate specialist
organisations&#151;the police and organisations such as ours here
today&#151;to protect victims and their
children.</div><a name="10012859000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Our research in Austria and Germany, where
such orders have existed for a number of years, suggests that they are
most effective in interceding at an early time in the offending
pattern. They are most effective earlier on. We think that in our
jurisdiction, just because of volume, we are more likely to use them in
more risky cases. The research says they are effective at preventing
less serious cases from becoming more serious, if applied
properly.</div><a name="10012859000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is that it is important that the perpetrator understands
that it is the police making the decision about risk, not the victim.
We are making a professional assessment of the likelihood of violence
occurring again and the victim is out of the equation. It is not her
decision: it is the state, through the police, deciding there is an
extant risk. That way the perpetrator will know it is the police
officer&#146;s&#151;the police service&#146;s
decision&#151;which we hope will not increase the risk to the
victim.</div><a name="10012859000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> I agree with the second point that you were
talking about on the potential for escalating the situation and the
violence, but to a certain extent it really strengthens the argument
why this is so important. Any incident of domestic abuse, as we already
heard, is systematic: it is a cycle; it is power and control; it is not
akin to any other type of violent crime. Any point that the victim gets
the strength together and decides that they are going to make a move
and that this is the time they need to get out of that violent or
abusive relationship is an incredibly dangerous time. A person leaving
is one of the most serious and potentially risky times: they are a lot
more likely to be killed or assaulted at that
point.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="10012859000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are right
that any type of action, whether leaving the home, approaching people
for emergency accommodation or going to and getting help from the
police or a solicitor&#151;whoever it may be&#151;could well
escalate the violence. That is one of the potential problems, which is
not going to go away. Hopefully it will not escalate, but that is the
point at which it will. That emphasises why this protection is really
needed. The police need to be able to grant these orders to allow the
person to have a period of time where they can get their life together
and make these moves in safety, where the situation cannot escalate and
where at least, if it does, the police have the power to do something
about
it.</div><a name="10012859000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000225"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I do not know whether Ceri Goddard wants to respond
as well. I have a quick supplementary for Brian Moore after
you.</div><a name="10012859000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> I will try to be brief. I think the core
point you raise about whether the orders will take into account
different individual circumstances and will not just be applied in a
blanket way is important, but I do not think that means that we should
not support the orders. It is for the police to take account of the
particular circumstances in each case, which I do not mind raising. For
example, there may be an impact from extended family and community
networks, or there may be a danger in relation to the woman&#146;s
wider family if a notice is ordered&#151;for Traveller women and
ethnic minority
groups.</div><a name="10012859000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are certain groups, such as lesbian, gay and bisexual groups, or
religious faith groups and minority groups, that are reluctant to
engage with the police and protection orders may not be appropriate for
them. There is also evidence that female perpetrators of domestic
violence are more likely to be arrested than men; we would not want to
see these orders being disproportionately used against them. You would
have to provide alternative support if an order was issued to the carer
of a victim, for example&#151;domestic violence is often between a
carer and, say, an older person. All those things would need to be
taken into
consideration.</div><a name="10012859000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
your colleague Tony Baldry mentioned earlier, we are talking about
specialists and trained police officers who I trust to know what they
are doing. I do not think that that means that the order is flawed. The
provisions are entirely adequate, but this is why things like the pilot
are quite important, because it will actually give you more guidance
and good practice for the particular circumstances that will need to be
taken into
account.</div><a name="10012859000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
176</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000226"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I want to come back to Brian Moore on the point
made by Ms McIlveen about allegations and counter-allegations. In your
experience, will your officers always be able to identify the real
perpetrator, even though they may be making counter-allegations?
However many allegations and counter-allegations are flying backwards
and forwards, will you be able to apply the DVPN to the appropriate
person?</div><a name="10012859000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Clearly that would be our intention. The
existing training and practice is that we should try to identity the
worst perpetrator and bring them to justice&#151;so one arrest from
the scene. The background to the case will throw light on that. There
is often a history. That is why it is important that before this power
is exercised there has been an investigation and

his lawyer, and an investigation will take place that will throw light
on this. We have up to 24 hours to get to the heart of what
has gone on. If we cannot bring a prosecution, the superintendent is
invited to consider the DVPN option. I cannot say that we get it right
in 100 per cent. of cases, but it is our intention, our training, our
policy and our process to identify the perpetrator where one

177</b><a name="10012859000227"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I have a query about
the involvement of the Ministry of Defence in this part of the Bill. My
constituency has one of the highest levels of domestic violence in the
country. Much of it, unfortunately, is in the forces. When a forces
family divorces, the children and wife, if she is not a member of the
forces, have to get out. What is the legal position on debarring the
perpetrator from an MOD home? I assume that the MOD is brought into
this fully and is prepared to allow the wife and children to remain in
the home while the member of the forces is removed. Does anybody have
any idea where the rights to the home lie if this is taken
further?</div><a name="10012859000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000228"></a>Alison

to re-house a perpetrator temporarily because they have accommodation,
which is not necessarily the case outside the forces. But there might
be a complication
here.</div><a name="10012859000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve

across any form of tenure. The MOD, I would guess, whatever its tenancy
agreements, will have some kind of arrangement, perhaps not for this
specific circumstance, but for circumstances such as divorce or
separation for other reasons. So it would not make any difference to
the tenure. Outside in civilian life the perpetrator may own the
property and the victim may not. My understanding is that that would
not matter for the period of these
orders.</div><a name="10012859000098"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000231"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you for those comments. My final
question is about the experience of other countries. Brian Moore has
already touched on Germany and Austria; there, when an order is in
place, there is an automatic requirement for support services to get in
touch with the victim. A lot of that happens now in the UK, but is it
an automatic requirement, and should  it
be?</div><a name="10012859000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> Refuge is very concerned that the requirement
to involve support services for the victim ought really to be included
in primary legislation. The whole point of these notices seems to be
that they give us a breathing space in which we can work with the
police, and in which the police can provide initial protection for the
victim, so that crisis services, such as those run by organisations
that are represented at this table, can get access to the victim and
offer them support. It is very important that the measures to ensure
that the support gets to the victim in this immediate aftermath are, if
at all possible, enshrined in primary legislation. We are anxious that
that measure could become eroded because of worries about funding and
so on. It is so important&#151;it is the whole point of
this&#151;that it should be built
in.</div><a name="10012859000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
181</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000232"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> In a sense, do the police need a one-stop place
to go to, rather than having to try to select part of the support
network?</div><a name="10012859000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> The appropriate kind of agency would be
something like the independent domestic violence support
advocates&#151;or the IDVA services, as they are often
called&#151;who are able to provide an immediate wraparound service.
They are familiar with how the CPS operates and with bail conditions,
and they are specialists in protecting and supporting
victims.</div>
<a name="10012859000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> It is critical that the support service be
brought in. In terms of safety and risk, it may well be very dangerous
not to provide that support. Certainly, in Vienna, that is written into
the legislation. I know that they have not missed referrals because in
Vienna, the specialist support service works closely with police. They
have regular monitoring meetings where they cross-reference everything,
and say, &#147;The police have issued this many notices.&#148; Even
though they work closely together, they still formally make sure
that  there are not more notices issued than they have had
referrals
for.</div><a name="10012859000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
a victim and their children not to get the appropriate support would
undermine the whole way in which the process is intended to work. It is
okay keeping the perpetrator away, but it is very difficult if the
victim is left there with nothing. We have heard about the pattern of
coercive control. Victims have no self-confidence; their esteem is
usually completely damaged, so people need support and to be told,
&#147;Yes, you have a different option in your life, and you can be
free from this.&#148; People need to be given the choices to be able
to move on with their lives.</div>
<a name="10012859000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
how to access the support services, the ACPO guidance on domestic
violence already has written into it that any officers attending a
scene should provide the victim with information about their local
specialist support service. That is already in the ACPO guidance, and
we have heard about the co-ordinated community response to domestic
violence. In local areas, the different statutory and voluntary-sector
agencies should already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>be working together, so it should be a simple process  to make
that referral, which is critical. It is dangerous not to have
it.</div>
<a name="10012859000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
182</b><a name="10012859000233"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): My first
point picks up on something that Mr. Moore said about it
being a police decision, rather than the victim&#146;s decision, to
go ahead with this. I am just curious to hear the comments from the
rest of the witnesses about what the perpetrator&#146;s perception is
likely to be, regarding whether it is a police decision or the
victim&#146;s decision, and what the knock-on effects might be for
the victim, in terms of the perpetrator&#146;s
perception.</div><a name="10012859000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> That is a really important point, and that
would need to be included when training police officers and
magistrates. It is an absolutely crucial point that needs to be made to
the perpetrator or the respondent&#151;that the decision to exclude
them from the home is a decision of the police, not the victim. I
emphasise that that is a crucial message to get across.</div>
<a name="10012859000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> I appreciate your question, but it is also
important to think about the victim&#146;s perception. We probably
all understand that this is an intervention in response to a package of
behaviour. We should think about how important it would be for the
victim to hear from the police that what was occurring might result in
a loss of life, was a crime and was unacceptable behaviour. Despite
what a victim may say or feel, there is rightly provision for the
police to undertake a duty to protect that individual.</div>
<a name="10012859000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
perception of the victim is important. That is why the support services
point is so important. Ultimately, practically, you are just buying a
bit of time and space for the woman or man, whatever the circumstances,
so that they are able to make that decision themselves and to act for
themselves&#151;to take civil proceedings, which already exist. This
is a recognition that you do need that specific intervention to give
that person time. The autonomy and perception of the victim are also
important.</div><a name="10012859000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> I think the police, the general public, and
all those working in Government and the domestic violence field already
want to send a clear message to perpetrators that what they are doing
is wrong. This measure could help the police say, &#147;What you are
doing is wrong, and we are going to take this action.&#148; The point
about victims is very important, and that has been made.</div>
<a name="10012859000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">One further
point may interest you. There is already a situation in specialist
domestic violence courts where the victim may not want to make a
statement and appear in court, and may try to withdraw. It has been
called a victimless prosecution, where victims have been forced to go
to the court to give evidence, because the CPS has pressed ahead with
the prosecution irrespective of the victim&#146;s wishes. That has
happened in only 2 per cent. of cases, but the victims afterwards have
said, &#147;We are really glad that that happened.&#148; We have to
remember what we have already heard a lot
about&#151;coercive  control, threats and fear.
Women&#146;s Aid is supportive  of this process, because we
want to empower victims and give them choices. Where a perpetrator is
breaking the law of the land, that matter should be enforced by the
police.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="10012859000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> Domestic violence continues because it is
underpinned by social attitudes about norms, about what is acceptable.
We think it is very positive that perpetrators who think they have the
right to behave in this way in their own home are given the message
that it is not acceptable to society; it is not acceptable to the
police. They are often astonished when the police arrest them: they
were only beating up their wife.</div>
<a name="10012859000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think it
is positive that victims are also learning that this is not acceptable.
We know the behaviour is associated with the children being directly
physically or sexually abused by the perpetrator, as well as the
children witnessing the abuse&#151;usually of their mother. It is not
acceptable. Victims are so isolated, but with this response, they will
learn that they are not alone, that the perpetrator is not
all-powerful, and that there is help out there.</div>
<a name="10012859000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> That is a really important point regarding the
role of the state and the purpose of the state in intervening at this
time. We have been clear that we think that in an emergency situation,
the state should intervene and perhaps override the views and wishes of
the victim, for their protection. That should be a temporary position,
until the victim is properly supported to make competent and informed
choices about their future and their safety. If, once they are in that
competent position, they decide that they do not want the help of the
state, that must, of course, be a matter for them. It is not a
permanent position of overriding their views, but a temporary one at a
time of trauma and, effectively,
emergency.</div><a name="10012859000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
183</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000234"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I want to take up the point about children in this
situation, which has been mentioned a couple of times in passing. Does
the Bill provide sufficient support in respect of children who witness
domestic violence and sometimes, horrendously, are party to what is
happening? If not, what measures should be taken to strengthen the
Bill, as regards protecting
children?</div><a name="10012859000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> The Bill gives further protection to children
affected by and living under domestic violence, because the gap that we
have identified, and that all of us around the table say is
there&#151;the 140,000 cases every year&#151;involves thousands of
children who currently may experience the police intervening in their
home. Those children, if they eventually get to organisations such as
ours later, say, &#147;Why did no one do anything? The police were
called. Why did nobody help us?&#148; Children are learning from
experiences such as those that it does not matter and is not important.
The Bill creates the opportunity to intervene and protect children.
Often the most effective way to protect children from domestic violence
is to get help to the non-abusing parent&#151;the victim&#151;and
the Bill does
this.</div><a name="10012859000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> I shall be as brief as possible. Jane has
already indicated that it is vital that children get support. The
violence impacts on the children. That does not necessarily mean that a
child who has experienced or witnessed it will become either a
perpetrator or a victim. However, it does affect their behaviour in all
sorts of ways, particularly with regard to their education. So it is
vital that they get support as
well.</div><a name="10012859000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me mention one of the current key issues and problems. Most refuge
services have children&#146;s workers, so if a referral went to a
specialist domestic violence service that was a refuge, of which there
are about 400 across England, the children would get some specialist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>support. There are also outreach services that do not generally have as
much specialised support for the children. It is a key issue, because
it is about enabling children and young people to achieve their
potential. Not giving them the appropriate support can impact on their
further lives. So the Bill could do a bit more to ensure the provision
of support planning for children and young
people.</div><a name="10012859000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> I will be quick. We have talked
comprehensively about the protection that is available through the
civil courts&#151;the non-molestation orders and the occupation
orders. We should not forget that similarly, there is a raft of child
protection legislation available under section 8, so we can apply for
prohibitive steps orders or contact orders and, subsequently, residence
and whatever
else.</div><a name="10012859000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we use this quick, emergency protection period, in which someone can
have that space to make decisions, with the violent perpetrator
excluded from the property, we have some automatic, quick protection
for children, because the perpetrator cannot come back. In that time,
we can then go to the county court and make applications to protect the
children in
future.</div><a name="10012859000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
184</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000235"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I am concerned that if the court issues the notice
but does not subsequently issue an order, that may make the situation
worse.</div><a name="10012859000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> It is a risk to be considered in the
guidance to be developed for the front-line police. I am sure that
these orders will not be given lightly: they will be given in a
particular set of circumstances, when a front-line constable and, in
turn, his or her superiors feel that there is a real threat of death,
possibly, and certainly serious injury to a victim or her children. So
it is a risk that can be considered in guidance and training, but it
should not knock proposals out of the
Bill.</div><a name="10012859000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> Ultimately, the answer is yes. If the police
issue a notice and the court subsequently does not grant the order,
there is at least a risk that that may escalate the situation. But that
is no different from the current situation, where you would go to a
court and apply for a non-molestation order. The key is ensuring that
the notices are granted only in relevant situations where they are
needed. That is why the superintendent&#146;s intervention is so
important in ensuring that they are issued only at those crucial
points.</div><a name="10012859000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
185</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000236"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have two brief questions. My first is to the chief
constable. I imagine that everybody agrees that this is essentially a
temporary order. You are not contemplating a series of orders made on
the application by a constable. You would say, I think, that if there
was a continuing situation, there should be an application to a county
court.</div><a name="10012859000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Separately
and differently, on clause 21(2), on the threat of violence, where a
person&#151;let us call him P&#151;has been violent to his partner,
but not violent at that stage to a child, the officer may contemplate
that, because the person is of a violent disposition, he may be violent
to the child. I am not sure that subsection (2) is broad enough to
justify the issuing of the notice. The officer might think that&#151;
notwithstanding that the child has not been threatened with
violence&#151;because the person has threatened violence to the
spouse, he might threaten violence to the child. Should we therefore
enlarge subsection (2)?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="10012859000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Yes, it is our view that this is a temporary
emergency protection while civil law ultimately provides adequate
support.</div><a name="10012859000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
answer to the second question is, on balance, no. I think that would
take the Bill into another area altogether. This is primarily about
protecting a principal victim from a principal perpetrator. The
existing law is sufficiently clear, strong and available that, where a
constable called to a scene has concerns for the safety and well-being
of children in that household, there is adequate protection elsewhere.
There is a danger of drawing together two things, one of which is
already well dealt
with.</div><a name="10012859000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see no gaps in child protection legislation; it is how well we
choose to draw it in, so I think that one should be cautious about
going too far down that road. Our training on domestic abuse already
tells us to look for the other victims in the household, particularly
vulnerable people, after establishing the safety and well-being of the
primary victim. We do that once we are at the scene, and I think that
the law is adequate to enable us to do that. My colleagues may take a
different view, but that is mine. I would caution against going too
much further down that route through the
Bill.</div><a name="10012859000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
186</b><a name="10012859000237"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): Clearly, all the witnesses
today have supported the introduction of domestic violence protection
orders for various reasons. Will they succinctly say precisely why the
current law is
inadequate?</div><a name="10012859000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
may I have a specific answer from Brian Moore to this question: if a
crime is about to be, or has been, committed, surely there would be an
arrest? Given the time it would take to issue a protection order,
surely an instant arrest would be the police&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10012859000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
how will the courts cope with the additional work load? Will this
happen quickly, or will it take several days to issue an
order?</div><a name="10012859000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Succinctly, every piece of available
legislation requires a victim to go out and do something. We are saying
that the victim is in such a traumatised state that they are not
competent to make such decisions at that time. The state needs to
intervene to protect them so that they can make informed choices. No
piece of available law provides that protection. That is why this is
necessary.</div><a name="10012859000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly&#151;I
must be absolutely clear about this to the Committee&#151;the police
envisage the notices being sought only after an arrest has been made,
not instead of. The police will pursue a criminal prosecution to the
best of our ability&#151;by arrest and through investigation. It is
only when that potential has been exhausted and where the evidence is
not available that the police should consider using a domestic violence
protection notice. They should not be used instead of an arrest or
investigation, but
after.</div><a name="10012859000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
there be increased work, particularly for the magistrates court? Yes,
there will. It is difficult to say how many of these notices will be
taken forward to orders, which is why it is appropriate and, indeed,
wise to have a pilot, so we can properly understand the throughput and
the effect on the existing system of what we are
proposing.</div>

on what Brian Moore has said or add
anything?</div><a name="10012859000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> I will be as brief as I can be. We have
already heard that the current law does not allow the police to exclude
the perpetrator from the home  and that the victim has to do
that. Steve can put me right on this, but I know that one year there
were about 22,000 non-molestation orders issued across England. You
have the statistics: police attended 700,000 incidents and there were
200,000 arrests. So, in relation to 500,000 incidents, one
has to ask what happens. This gives something to protect the victims of
incidents where nothing happens. Victims call the police because they
want help, which is why we think the measure is a good idea: it will
offer the public some protection that they do not get
currently.</div><a name="10012859000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri
Goddard:</b></i> I just want to agree with Brian,
particularly on his first point about where the current law is
inadequate. That would be our position, too. It is a practical, timing
issue. We are talking about real women&#146;s everyday lives and the
reality is that it can take days, weeks or even months to get access to
legal representation and for the civil provisions to kick in, by which
time, the evidence shows that women are being killed or seriously hurt,
as are their children. I think that the temporary nature of this does
provide for that gap in the law&#151;it is not instead of
anything.</div><a name="10012859000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
it be more work for magistrates courts? Possibly, but personally I
think that that is a price worth paying given the shocking statistics.
It should be a priority for our common law justice system to lower what
are highly unacceptable levels of violence and
death.</div><a name="10012859000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Keeper:</b></i> The proposals fill a vital gap where victims
and organisations assisting victims would currently frequently be
looking to the police to provide some protection and would be
disappointed by what police are currently able to do. This is such a
huge problem in our society. It is the 21st century, but huge numbers
of women and children do not have the right to be safe in their own
homes. There is a glaring gap in the current remedies available. Refuge
feels these proposals go a long way towards filling that gap, so we
positively welcome
them.</div><a name="10012859000143"></a>

Connor:</b></i> No, other than to mirror what has been said
and perhaps add one thing rather controversially about male victims of
domestic violence. Approximately 18 per cent. of the 6,000 calls per
month that we deal with are from male victims of domestic violence.
That is a huge problem. Research shows that it is usually much harder
for a man to contact the police or a support agency, because as well as
having the usual violence, intimidation and emotional fear factors, you
have the additional hurdle of feeling embarrassed that you are a man
and you are being abused. Having the measure in place would be another
step towards assisting with that, because it is the police&#146;s
decision that they are taking the matter forward and that the
perpetrator is being taken into custody and one of these orders is
being put in place. I know I have gone slightly off on a tangent, but I
think that is very
positive.</div><a name="10012859000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000240"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is most
helpful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="10012859000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
187</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000241"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I have a couple of disparate points. We have heard
a lot about children being victims, which clearly they are in the
overwhelming majority of cases, but occasionally children will
perpetrate the violence. The measure does not apply to children under
18, so I wonder whether you are happy that existing legislation on
domestic violence that is perpetrated by those under 18 is
adequate.</div>
<a name="10012859000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
think that we heard from Dr. Steve Connor and Brian Moore that it is
extremely important that the perpetrator hears that it is the police
taking action and that the police are responsible for taking action.
However, you did not explain how you were going to ensure that the
perpetrator heard that message. Is the fact that you will turn up and
walk into someone&#146;s household where, as I think Jane Keeper
said, the person&#146;s response is, &#147;Oh, I was only beating
up my wife&#148;, going to be sufficient to convince the perpetrator
that it is the police taking the action and not the victim?</div>
<a name="10012859000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
was a bit surprised to hear you, Brian Moore, say that you did not know
how many cases might turn up in the magistrates courts. I would have
thought that officers often come back saying, &#147;If only we could
get this victim to take action&#148; or &#147;If only we had the
powers to take action for them&#148;, and you would therefore have a
feel for the number of cases. However, if you do not know, perhaps the
Minister has done the homework on the impact that this change might
have on magistrates courts, in terms of increased demands on their time
and resources, and if so he might give the Committee that information
when he responds to questions this
afternoon.</div><a name="10012859000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10012859000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000242"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does anyone want to intervene quickly? We have
precisely four minutes before we need to wrap
up.</div>
<a name="10012859000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
188</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000243"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Does the chief constable agree that this measure
has been discussed across government with the Ministry of Justice and
that it therefore has the support of the MOJ in its pilot?</div>
<a name="10012859000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> Yes. I cannot give you precise figures. In my
report to the Home Office, we suggested some levels and numbers, so
there are some figures, but I cannot answer your question with
precision. Nevertheless, I agree with you that this matter is actively
being discussed.</div>
<a name="10012859000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My colleagues
will address the other points.</div>
<a name="10012859000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000244"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Children as perpetrators first, perhaps.</div>
<a name="10012859000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Steve
Connor:</b></i> Sorry, I was just about to respond to the
other point first.</div>
<a name="10012859000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was asked
whether a police officer turning up at a domestic incident is enough to
give the message to the perpetrator that it is the police taking the
action, and I think that the answer is probably &#147;no&#148;. I
think that explicit terms need to be used and that there needs to be
explicit information given to the perpetrator that is the police who
are taking the action, because I think that the thought in a lot of
people&#146;s minds will probably be that if they can persuade their
wife, girlfriend or boyfriend not to press charges, no further action
will be taken. Therefore, if action is taken there will be a concept in
people&#146;s minds that the partner must be supporting that action
or that prosecution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="10012859000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Moore would probably know a lot more about that issue than I do, but I
would have thought that, first, the police officers themselves, having
been trained, will need to make it clear directly to the perpetrator
that the nature of this order or notice is that it is made by the
police. There may even be a need for some wording on the notice that
specifically identifies, in categorical layman&#146;s terms, that the
notice has nothing to do with the intention of the victim and that it
is specifically made on behalf of the police. I assume that there would
be a way of dealing with that
issue.</div><a name="10012859000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Deborah
McIlveen:</b></i> Shall I make a quick point about children
as perpetrators? I think that the system of youth justice would deal
with that issue. However, there is one point that I would like to draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to, which is that a lot of domestic
violence goes on in the relationships of people who are aged between 16
and 18, and that issue is problematic. I am not sure whether something
can be put into the Bill to deal with it. However, we would certainly
welcome a measure that would address it, because, as I say, there is a
significant amount of domestic violence in those teenage
relationships.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000245"></a>The

anything?</div>
<a name="10012859000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ceri

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012859000247"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Shall we finish with Brian Moore? You have been
drawn into this.</div>
<a name="10012859000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>In terms of the children aspect
of these orders, it is certainly possible that these orders could
apply. The more contentious aspect is the requirement that someone
should vacate their home, which is generally  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>someone who is slightly older and who has acquired a property. That is
the more contentious aspect of these orders.</div>
<a name="10012859000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
non-molestation, non-contact aspects of these orders could equally
apply to people below 18, where, say, two young people live in their
respective parental homes. So, yes, the measure would fit the
circumstances and if Parliament was minded to emphasise that in the
Bill, that would be welcome. I do not envisage specific problems in
requiring people not to have contact with each
other.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
189</b><b class="B"><a name="10012859000248"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Are you advocating that the Bill should be changed
to allow a DVPN to be issued against those who are under 18? Currently,
it is clearly stated that people have to be 18 or older.</div>
<a name="10012859000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Moore:</b></i> If Parliament thought that the public
requirement was for under-18s to be included, ACPO would not stand in
the way. We think that it would be worthwhile for Parliament to press
for a little more information.</div>
