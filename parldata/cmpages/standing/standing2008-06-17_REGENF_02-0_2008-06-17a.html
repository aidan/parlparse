<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000404"></a>The
Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr.
Pat McFadden):</b> I was coming to the conclusion of my
remarks on amendment No. 16 at the end of the previous sitting.
Essentially, as the hon. Member for Solihull said, those remarks deal
with whether the relationship can be forced. That is at the heart of
the question.</div>
<a name="08061815000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of safeguards in clause 26 regarding the primary authority
relationship. It mentions, for example, that the Local Better
Regulation Office may only nominate a local authority
if</div><a name="08061815000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
authority and the regulated person have agreed in
writing&#148;</div><a name="08061815000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
when</div><a name="08061815000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
regulated person has requested LBRO to make a nomination under section
25(1)...and LBRO considers the authority suitable for
nomination&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to give LBRO powers on such matters, partly because we think that
there could be unfairness if many authorities simply opt out of the
responsibilities that go with primary authority status, and if that
work is being done by only one or two authorities. In the vast majority
of cases, the relationship will be voluntary&#151;after all,
arranging such a relationship will be preferable to forcing
it&#151;but we want to give LBRO the power.</div>
<a name="08061815000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
amendment, if a business can simply opt out unilaterally, the danger,
from a regulatory point of view, is that it could shop around, perhaps
looking for its version of the right answer to a particular regulatory
question. We do not think that a situation in which the relationship is
forced should be the norm, but we do think that, as a backstop, it is
important that LBRO can bring two parties together, rather than
allowing a continual opting out of the primary authority relationship
for a business in a
multi-site&#151;</div><a name="08061815000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061815000405"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): Will the
Minister say, from a practical point of view, what steps a business
should follow if it decides or feels that it needs to terminate or
revoke the nomination of the primary
authority?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="08061815000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000406"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We spoke in this morning&#146;s sitting about
a situation in which one supermarket chain takes over another. The
business could go to LBRO and say, for example, &#147;We have been
taken over by another group in another part of the country, so we think
that the primary authority should no longer be local authority A, but
local authority B.&#148; That would be a perfectly rational thing to
do. One would hope that LBRO would look kindly on such a situation.
There are mechanisms whereby, for completely rational reasons, a
business can say that it wants the primary authority to be changed. A
similar circumstance could arise if a business moved its headquarters
or principal centre of operations from north to south, for example. It
would make sense for such a business to have a different primary
authority relationship.</div>
<a name="08061815000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
saying that the arrangements should be frozen for ever once they are
established, but there should be circumstances in which LBRO can say,
&#147;This is the relationship that we want to put together.&#148;
Under the amendment that the hon. Gentleman has proposed, the business
could continually withdraw from primary authority relationships simply
by giving notice, without the kind of reason that I have described. The
danger is that we could have regulatory shopping around for the best
deal, as it were, which I do not think would serve the Bill&#146;s
purpose.</div><a name="08061815000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061815000407"></a><b class="B">Ann
McKechin</b> (Glasgow, North) (Lab): Will the Minister confirm
how the LBRO will determine the suitability of Scottish local
authorities as primary local authorities, given that there is no
specific requirement for the membership of the LBRO to contain anyone
with a Scottish background, be that a member of the Scottish Government
or a person from the Scottish local
authority?</div><a name="08061815000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000408"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> By the same criteria as anywhere else. It would
depend on whether the company, which operates in multiple areas, has
headquarters in a particular Scottish local authority, or has its main
operations in a Scottish area. It may also have operations in different
parts of Scotland or across Scotland and England. The same principle
would apply in all those cases. There is a clause in the Bill that sets
out the territorial application on which we touched. Assuming that
territorial application applies and that we are talking about functions
that are reserved, then LBRO&#146;s primary authority principle will
operate in the same way in Scotland as
elsewhere.</div><a name="08061815000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000409"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The debate has been useful because it has helped to
clarify an issue that is not very clear in the Bill. Clause 26(5)(b)
refers to when LBRO &#147;considers it appropriate&#148;. The
Minister has now made it clear that a number of avenues are available
to businesses to enable them to terminate any particular relationship
with a primary authority. That has been helpful. In some ways, it would
have been better for it to have been explicit, but with that
clarification, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

and

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="08061815000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000410"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I shall be brief. The clause defines the core
role of the primary authority as giving &#147;advice and
guidance&#148; to the business for which it is the primary authority
and to other local authorities regarding how they should regulate the
business. Therefore, it is a three-way relationship between the
business and what we are calling enforcing authorities in the Bill.
This clause allows the primary authority to be the business&#146;s
first port of call for advice on enforcement issues with national
implications and allows the primary authority to make recommendations
about the handling of particular issues that arise in its work to other
local authorities.</div>
<a name="08061815000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (2), a business and its primary authority may make
arrangements to manage their partnership. The Bill does not prescribe
what should be included in such an arrangement, but it may include, for
example, a memorandum of understanding setting out the rights and
obligations of each party. When a business and a primary authority
choose to make arrangements, the primary authority must have regard to
guidance issued by LBRO. The clause sets out the advice and guidance
function of primary authorities, which will be an important part of
their work.</div>
<a name="08061815000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000411"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for those
initial remarks. As the Minister says, the clause sets out the advice
and guidance elements of primary authorities, in particular their role
to advise and guide regulated persons as well as other local
authorities through the regulations set out in the schedules of the
Bill. The Government&#146;s explanatory notes shed a bit more light
on the matter. They show that that would mean that a regulated person
in the primary authority should make agreements &#147;as they see
fit&#148;. That could raise the vexed question of how to strike a
balance between improving regulatory practice to lower the regulatory
burden on the one hand and ensuring consistency on the other. The Bill
is trying to straddle that classic balance between achieving
consistency and raising standards individually. What principles does
the Minister think that the LBRO will follow to ensure that one
business does not gain over its competitors from a less regulatory
environment, and if an enforcing local authority fails to follow a
primary authority&#146;s guidance, what legal responsibility does it
have to the business
involved?</div><a name="08061815000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000412"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> On the issue of consistency, which is what this
part of the Bill is all about, LBRO acts as an arbiter. For example,
the enforcing authority might feel that the arrangements between the
primary authority and the regulator&#151;the hon. Gentleman quotes
from Government guidance&#151;are actually a bit of a sweetheart
deal, as I think I mentioned this morning: that they have entered into
a cosy arrangement with each other, with the effect that the enforcing
authority does not believe that the regulations are being properly
enforced.</div>
<a name="08061815000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart from
the advice and guidance function of LBRO, it also has an arbiter
function, and that takes us back to some of this morning&#146;s
debates about advice and direction. In those circumstances, the
enforcing authority can appeal to LBRO to look at the situation and see
whether the regulations are being properly enforced, or whether the
primary authority relationship is not conducive to better regulation
with regard to the public interest in the area that the enforcing
authority  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>represents. That arbitration role of LBRO is important. It is something
that is not enforced as it might be under the current regime, which is
another reason for establishing the body.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000413"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000414"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 13, in
clause 28, page 13, line 26, after

31, in
clause 28, page 14, line 13, leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000415"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I will discuss amendment No. 31 in a moment, as it
is distinct. The first three amendments seek to return greater
flexibility of power to primary authorities&#151;something that was
in the Government&#146;s first draft of the Bill. There are three
amendments to subsection (2) on page 13, and rather than deal with them
individually, to aid members of the Committee I will read how the new
subsection would read once amended, so that the picture can be seen in
its
entirety:</div><a name="08061815000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a primary authority determines within the relevant period that the
proposed enforcement action is inappropriate and that compliance could
be secured by alternative enforcement action, it may within that period
direct the enforcing authority not to take the originally proposed
action and to take the alternative enforcement action mentioned
above.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061815000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be the net
effect of the three amendments, although I stress that they are probing
amendments and seek to understand the subsection.</div>
<a name="08061815000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">As currently
drafted, the clause is much narrower than in the original Bill as
presented to the other place. As such, it limits the primary authority
to intervening by preventing one form of action by an enforcing
authority. The amendments, which have the support of the British Retail
Consortium, seek to re-establish a wider remit so that where better
alternative actions exist, the primary authority can direct the
enforcing authority to implement them. That would enable the primary
authority to act more positively, and not be negative in its
activities.</div>
<a name="08061815000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that the wording that I used is not perfect&#151;that is my
error and not that of the Clerks. However, I wish to consider the
practical issues and perhaps the Minister could focus particularly on
why the Government decided to change the original wording. Secondly,
does the Minister recognise that more flexible powers would better
enable primary authorities to fulfil their role? That is the heart of
the amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="08061815000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
31 relates to subsection (9) on page 14. It defines the
relevant period within which a primary authority must decide whether
enforcement actions can or cannot proceed. Subsection (9)(a) specifies
that that might
be</div><a name="08061815000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
period of five working
days&#148;,</div><a name="08061815000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
for most companies is a normal working week. It means that during that
time the business is in limbo about whether it will face a sanction,
fine or whatever. In business, time is money and that is particularly
the case for small businesses who may be affected by such legislation.
The matter should be hanging over them for as short a period as is
reasonably possible.</div>
<a name="08061815000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(9)(a) is good, because five working days is perfectly reasonable and
sensible. My problem is that paragraph (b) then states that
&#147;relevant period&#148; can
mean</div><a name="08061815000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
longer period beginning with that day as LBRO may
direct.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
does the Minister believe that the LBRO should need any longer than
five working days? That would cause difficulties for smaller
businesses. Rather than the major organisations with large legal
departments, this concerns the smallest family businesses that have
only two or three people who are just trying to get on with their job.
They have a personal sanction and are waiting to know what will happen.
Is not five days enough? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): The area of greatest discomfort for
me is that the clause will bestow on one local authority the power of
veto over another authority&#146;s enforcement decisions. That not
only is undemocratic, but gives the primary authority de facto powers
of legal interpretation that are the proper function of the courts. The
amendments and the new clause that I have tabled would remove that veto
and leave it to a court rather than a primary authority to decide
whether enforcement action was unjustified in the light of advice given
to a company by the primary authority. I should be grateful if the
Minister would try to give some reassurance and a little more
information on that
matter.</div><a name="08061815000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000417"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford posed
two questions in moving his amendment. One was why the Government had
changed their position somewhat on the issue since the draft Bill was
published and the other related to the relevant time, so I shall try to
cover both points. He is right that there was something of a change in
the position and that the amendment he proposed would take us back
closer to where the process started in the original consultation. I
will explain why the Government changed their view on that during the
consultation. Subsection (2) is clear about what the grounds are. It
states:</div><a name="08061815000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the primary authority determines within the relevant period that the
proposed enforcement action is inconsistent with advice or guidance
previously given...it may within that period direct the enforcing
authority not to take the enforcement action.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061815000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test, therefore, is
inconsistency with advice or guidance previously given, and that test
is narrower than the one we originally proposed and the one outlined in
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, which would be whether it was
inappropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="08061815000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
consulted on that issue before the final version of the Bill was
published, a number of stakeholders and local authorities told us that
they were concerned about that because it would give the primary
authority a role that was more akin to a free-ranging right of review,
rather than asking it to answer what is a clearer and more narrowly
defined question on whether the enforcing authority had acted in a
manner consistent with the advice that was given. We took those
representations on board and narrowed them down somewhat. In doing so,
I believe that we have, to some extent, eased the burden on primary
authorities with regard to what they are required to look at in those
circumstances. Some primary authorities&#151;even very experienced
ones&#151;have a number of headquarters in their areas. We are
concerned that a wide test, such as the test of inappropriateness,
would leave them having to play a much more interventionist role,
rather than judging enforcement action on the basis of consistency of
advice.</div>
<a name="08061815000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061815000418"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I can see that my hon.
Friend is saying that it gives a narrower power of discretion and
judgment to the primary authority. However, there could still be
circumstances in which the enforcing authority felt that it had a good,
specific, local reason to take different action from that in the
original guidance. Will my hon. Friend tell me what the situation will
be? Will there be a right of appeal to the LBRO and whose view would
ultimately prevail in that
circumstance?</div><a name="08061815000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000419"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is where LBRO&#146;s arbitration role
comes in. My hon. Friend is right to say that. If the test was the
original, wider appropriateness test, rather than the consistency test
that we have now written into the Bill, there would probably be many
more appeals to
LBRO.</div><a name="08061815000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that helps the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford in relation
to his amendment. I understand what he is driving at, as it is pretty
close to the position where the Government began on this. However, we
have listened to the representations about the burden that would be put
on primary authorities. As I said, significant concerns were raised by
people charged with enforcement. They said that giving primary
authorities such a general right to block enforcement action would be
wide-ranging&#151;much more so than the consistency test&#151;and
that it would put a substantial burden of liability on the primary
authority, which would find itself required to make a thorough
investigation of every aspect of a particular enforcement
action.</div><a name="08061815000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, we discussed the concerns of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s local
authority about the burdens that will potentially be imposed on it by
the Bill. My fear is that, compared with the consistency test, the
amendment would increase those burdens. That is why we have made the
change.</div><a name="08061815000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I turn to a further point made by the hon. Gentleman, I will mention a
couple of the stakeholders who have commented on this. Representatives
of the professions involved, such as the Trading Standards Institute
and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, have welcomed the
change we will make in this regard. The consistency test gives the
primary authority more of an objective role, which is founded on
judging the action against the advice that it has given. That is why we
have narrowed the power in that respect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div><a name="08061815000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about the extension to the normal deadline of five working days, the
hon. Gentleman is right that the normal deadline would be five working
days. However, subsection (9)(b)
states,</div><a name="08061815000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
longer period beginning with that day as LBRO may
direct.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the conversations that we have had with local authorities, including
Hertfordshire council, five working days is thought to be sufficient in
the vast majority of cases and is normally enough to give the enforcing
authority time to judge the consistency test, about which we are
talking in relation to the clause.</div>
<a name="08061815000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ability
to extend the deadline has been included to provide some flexibility in
situations where, for one reason or another, it might not be possible
for the primary authority to respond in five days. For example, a
particular event in the primary authority area might mean that staff
are diverted on a short-term basis and that the primary authority is
unable to commit resources to considering such a referral. A case might
be particularly complicated and occasionally might take longer than
five days. The Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory
Services&#151;the local authority regulation body&#151;has
commented on the Bill and has recommended that we extend the term from
28 days as a matter of course. We do not want to do that because we
agree with the hon. Gentleman: time is money and we do not want
unnecessary extensions. Five days should be the norm in most cases.
However, we do think that the provision for some flexibility makes
sense. I hope that on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will not choose to
press the
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000420"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The debate has been helpful. I understand that it
was slightly ironic to propose what the Government were originally
proposing and then to watch the Minister explain why they have changed
their mind. It is very good to
see&#151;</div><a name="08061815000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000421"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is all part of the
consultation.</div>
<a name="08061815000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000422"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The listening Government. I am sure that that is
all part of the process and we just hope that it is more successful
than it has been elsewhere in Government business. It is entirely right
that the Minister should reflect that consultation and that is
welcome.</div>
<a name="08061815000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment No. 31, I confess that the moment the phrase &#147;28
days&#148; loomed I suddenly thought that we were in another place,
discussing other matters. Thankfully, I do not feel so passionately
about it that I feel the need to leave the room, but the debate is
important.</div>
<a name="08061815000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
particularly helpful that the Minister made it clear that the
Government&#146;s wish and the LBRO&#146;s wish is that five days
is the norm and that there has to be a jolly good reason for going
beyond that. That is an assurance that I know small businesses will
want. The idea that 28 days should be the norm is nonsense; it might be
convenient for the local authorities, but in the end the paying
customer is the small business. Small businesses are the ones who all
of us in the public sector rely on to generate the wealth to pay for
our incomes and we should not forget that. Although I understand that
there will be exceptional cases, as long as that is the case and as
long as we recognise that five days is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>normality, it would seem that we have made a gain today. On that basis,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000423"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I should like to raise some short questions,
principally with regard to subsections (1) and (2). I am sure that the
Minister will want to provide clarity to us. First, subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="08061815000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall by order with the consent of the Welsh
Ministers prescribe circumstances in which section 28(1) to (4) shall
not
apply.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if he described the circumstances in which
consultation would not take place as it is not clear what that would
extend to.</div>
<a name="08061815000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
subsection (2)
states:</div><a name="08061815000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a local authority other than the primary authority takes enforcement
action against the regulated person in circumstances prescribed under
subsection (1), the authority must inform the primary authority of the
enforcement action it has taken as soon as it reasonably
can.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
informing a primary authority of enforcement action, given that people
are waiting to know the sanction that may or may not be imposed on
them, what would the Minister regard as unreasonable?</div>
<a name="08061815000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, can
the Minister tell us when it would be impractical to contact the
primary authority? That is clearly a concern and it would be useful to
know what exactly the Government have in
mind.</div>
<a name="08061815000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000424"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I hope I can shed some light on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions. As he rightly said, clause 29 allows the
Secretary of State to prescribe the circumstances in which the
procedure requiring an enforcing authority to notify a primary
authority of proposed enforcement action shall not apply. I shall
provide some examples later, but I think that we can all probably think
of examples where action needs to be taken then and there, where it may
not be practical to do what is proposed, but I shall come on to that in
a moment.</div>
<a name="08061815000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The primary
authorities scheme is intended to provide consistency and certainty for
businesses operating in a number of local authority areas, but it is
also important that that should not be allowed to delay essential and
routine action by local authorities where it is appropriate. Our
extensive discussions with local authority enforcement officers and
their representatives have demonstrated that although it is important
that exemptions are made, the complexity and diversity of the
underlying regulations dealt with in the Bill mean that secondary
legislation is probably the most appropriate way of doing
so.</div><a name="08061815000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="08061815000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
order-making power of clause 29 will allow for exemptions to be drawn
up. That would include exemptions where the enforcement action was
required urgently, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>example to avoid a significant risk of serious harm to human health or
the environment. I am sure that if we found somewhere serving unsafe
food we would not want to wait five days, 28 days or whatever may be
determined. Other cases might involve the financial interests of
consumers&#151;if there is a serious fraud going on, or financial
interests are under threat&#151;or where referring the case to the
relevant primary authority might be wholly
disproportionate.</div><a name="08061815000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
order may include, therefore, exemptions where delay would inhibit
effective evidence-gathering or investigation of a breach, or where it
would be impractical to seek the view of a primary authority when
exercising powers&#151;for example, under the Noise Act 1996. If
speakers were blaring at 4 am, I do not think that we would want to
wait five days. The underlying regulations are deliberately local in
nature, and that could be another reason, as for example with many
aspects of the Licensing Act 2003, or where the enforcing authority
already has to seek approval for its proposed enforcement action from
another force&#151;that would meet the purpose of the notification
requirement.</div><a name="08061815000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have committed to laying an order under clause 29 as soon as
possible after the Bill has come into force. I am happy to repeat that
commitment to the hon. Gentleman today. I would also like to take the
opportunity to clarify that the primary authorities scheme will not
become operational until the exemptions have been drawn up and come
into force. That is the context and content of clause
29.</div><a name="08061815000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000426"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I apologise to you and the Committee for being
too slow off the blocks, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="08061815000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes provision for a primary authority to draw up an inspection
plan containing recommendations as to how other local authorities
should inspect a business for which it is the primary authority. That
is important. It takes us back to the point made by the hon. Member for
Solihull about risk-based inspection. The clause is intended to bring
about greater consistency and co-ordination of regulatory enforcement
for businesses that adopt the primary authorities scheme. That is one
of the prizes in the regulatory regime&#151;there can be an agreed
inspection plan, which gives local authorities and businesses some
clarity about what is inspected and what is appropriate in those
circumstances.</div><a name="08061815000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
another authority departed from the recommendations of the inspection
plan, it would be required to notify the primary authority of that
before carrying out the inspection, giving its reasons. That would help
to support the sharing of strategic information between authorities. It
would be important for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>primary authority to learn why an enforcement authority might want to do
that. It also might give the primary authority a better picture of how
the business is operating throughout the
country.</div><a name="08061815000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) lists examples of issues that can be addressed in an inspection
plan, such as paragraph
(a):</div><a name="08061815000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
frequency at which, or circumstances in which, inspections should be
carried
out&#148;</div><a name="08061815000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="08061815000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what
an inspection should consist
of&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list is not exhaustive. The Government&#146;s expectation is that
inspection plans might address a number of other issues, including
those areas where a business is dedicating resource to raise compliance
itself, where that is an ongoing problem to which enforcement
authorities should pay particular
attention.</div><a name="08061815000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are constraints on the content of an inspection plan. A primary
authority must consult with the business before making such a plan and
it must take into account any relevant recommendations relating to the
frequency of inspection when drawing up an inspection plan. Again, that
is an important part of the overall regulatory regime to encourage a
more co-ordinated and strategic approach. I am sure that all of us in
our constituencies regularly meet businesses that are asking for that
kind of consistency. Any reasonable business expects, and does not
mind, that it will occasionally be inspected. I recall visiting a
business in my constituency a couple of weeks ago, when the owner said,
&#147;The trouble with inspections is that they are a bit like buses,
you get none for a long time and then four turn up at once. We are not
sure why, we have not been inspected for years&#148;. An inspection
plan, agreed between the primary authority and the enforcing
authorities, would give businesses and the enforcing authorities
clarity about what was expected.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000427"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I entirely agree that inspection plans have
considerable merit. They provide what most businesses seek, namely, a
degree of consistency, clarity and, most important,
certainty&#151;knowledge as to what they can expect, when they can
expect the inspections and how they work from the business&#146;s
point of view. As the Minister describes, the fear is of not having
been inspected at all and suddenly having three gentlemen or ladies
with clipboards arrive within a week. First, it is immensely intrusive,
and, secondly, it puts into the back of the mind the fear that,
&#147;Hang on, am I being targeted or do the three not talk to each
other so we end up with this kind of nonsense?&#148;</div>
<a name="08061815000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the plan is right, but how prescriptive do the Government expect the
plans to be? How far should the issues be detailed? Would the plan need
to include a get-out clause, or an option to cover circumstances where
something changes and there has to be a departure from the plan? Could
the Minister clarify how the Government anticipate that it will
work?</div><a name="08061815000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000428"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Subsection 3 of the clause refers to frequency
and circumstances, and what an inspection should consist of. We have
not been more prescriptive than that in the clause. The hon. Gentleman
is right to say that an enforcing authority may decide that an
inspection is needed even if&#151;to continue his metaphor&#151;the
bus is not due; it would be expected to inform the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>primary authority, but we are not so rigid as to say that an inspection
in those circumstances should be banned. In fact there may be good
reasons why it has to take place; we touched on those in our debate on
the previous clause. Overall, an inspection plan would help to give
clarity, both to local authorities and to businesses. There may be
exceptions to the plan but at least having it will give business some
idea of what is expected of them and how frequently to expect
inspections.</div><a name="08061815000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

31</h4><a name="08061815000011"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Power
to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000429"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is important; it is about the power
to charge&#151;a point we touched on this morning. It
states:</div><a name="08061815000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
primary authority may charge the regulated person such fees as it
considers to represent the costs reasonably incurred by it in the
exercise of its functions under this
Part&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision recognises two important points. The first is that there are
costs in acting as a primary authority. The primary authority is, in
effect, acting as an advice broker, both to the business and to other
enforcing authorities. Secondly, it helps to address the concern of
some small business organisations that primary authorities might devote
whatever expertise they have in regulatory enforcement to dealing
solely with the concerns of multiple-site, rather than single-site
businesses. In that respect, clause 31 makes provision for a primary
authority to recover the costs of carrying out its functions under part
2 from the business for which it is acting as a primary
authority.</div>
<a name="08061815000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also provides that a primary authority may charge only for costs that
it has reasonably incurred and does not, therefore, allow a primary
authority to profit from its functions under part 2. Furthermore, where
a primary authority chooses to charge a business, it must have regard
to the relevant guidance issued by the LBRO under clause 33.</div>
<a name="08061815000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
small businesses welcome the power to recover costs and can now
confidently expect a local authority that takes on the primary
authority role not to divert resources away from the advice and support
that they look to it to provide. One might ask why businesses should
pay for that service when they already pay their business rates.
However, participation in the primary authorities scheme will give
businesses access to a range of services over and above those available
to businesses in general.</div>
<a name="08061815000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in clause 31 are important to the functioning of the primary
authorities scheme and respond to some of the concerns about costs
raised by Hertfordshire and other
councils.</div><a name="08061815000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000430"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> This is an important clause, not least because it
goes to the heart of several of our debates.</div>
<a name="08061815000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hertfordshire
may have been considering the Bill as it was before we debated it
today, but the council was clearly concerned about the due costs, which
we debated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>before lunch. Clearly, it has been decided that those costs will now be
met by business, rather than through an adjustment within local
authorities, which I am sure will please the Chancellor. I can
understand the reasoning behind that decision, and there is an argument
that the person who benefits from a service should contribute towards
it. However, that raises the point&#151;to return to an earlier
debate&#151;that only multi-site businesses can benefit from the
primary authorities scheme, which provides quite a beneficial service
for them to tap into. There is therefore a regulatory distinction
between the businesses that can nominate primary authorities and the
single-site small businesses that cannot. It is important that we bear
that in mind.</div>
<a name="08061815000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific point about the power to charge, the clause says that fees
must</div><a name="08061815000130"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;represent
the costs reasonably
incurred&#148;</div><a name="08061815000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
the authority, and that phraseology is perfectly acceptable. However,
although the arrangements seem fair on the face of it, there are
concerns, and I want to tease out a further response from the
Minister.</div>
<a name="08061815000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the Bill is to improve regulatory standards for businesses,
principally by enabling them to nominate a primary authority as their
sole local regulator. As the Minister said&#151;almost in
anticipation of my point&#151;some businesses will say, &#147;Hang
on a moment. We&#146;re already paying corporation tax and a range of
other things.&#148; They are paying their national non-domestic
rates, or business rates as they are better known, so what are they
paying for in addition? The CBI is not alone when it says:</div>
<a name="08061815000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not see a compelling argument for why business should apply additional
sums or why there should be a net increase in
costs.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI&#146;s essential point, which is not unreasonable, is that
although it wants better regulation, why must business pay for what the
Government should deliver anyway? That is a perfectly good point, and I
would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="08061815000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point, which is just as important, is who will decide that a primary
authority is making reasonable charges&#151;to use the language of
the clause? Will the LBRO be able to intervene or will it be the
Secretary of State?</div>
<a name="08061815000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000431"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman has given me the opportunity
to refer to the impact assessment for the Bill, which details some of
the costs and benefits. Referring to it will perhaps help to answer his
question about what the benefit in all these things will be.</div>
<a name="08061815000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">As ever with
impact assessments, we are talking about an assessment. The purpose of
the Bill is to review all the issues in three years, but the assessment
of benefits to business from, for example, consistency of advice could
be anything from &#163;24 million to &#163;48 million. Consistency
of risk assessment could be anything between &#163;3 million and
&#163;5.8 million and savings from more effective priority setting
provision of guidance could be up to &#163;32
million.</div><a name="08061815000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="08061815000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
there are substantial potential cost benefits to businesses from a
regime under which the advice is more consistent and they are more
certain that they can, for example, introduce more product lines,
knowing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>how that might be judged in different parts of the country. Although
cost recovery has been built in, to ensure that the primary authority
principle does not become too much of a burden to the local authorities
that take it on, there is still substantial benefit&#151;in fact, far

<a name="08061815000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
32</h4><a name="08061815000012"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">LBRO
support</div><a name="08061815000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000432"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The clause is an interesting addendum to what we
have been talking about. Subsection (1) states:</div>
<a name="08061815000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;LBRO
may do anything it considers appropriate for the purpose of supporting
the primary
authority&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is quite a wide statement and, while we do not want to be nonsensical,
given that it is in the Bill and we are dealing with an unaccountable,
non-departmental public body, it is questionable whether it should be
able to do anything that it regards as appropriate. There is no
requirement, for example, for the LBRO to act in a proportionate
fashion. The clause does not say that it should act in an open and
transparent manner. It would therefore help if the Minister clarified
matters.</div><a name="08061815000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am worried because it feels as though the clause has been inserted
quickly and without due consideration. That feeling is reinforced by
the fact that, having given us large, sweeping potential power under
subsection (1), the clause suddenly realises that it may have gone a
bit far, and suddenly we get subsection (2), which says, &#147;Oh,
and that includes making grants&#148;. There is the impression that
the clause has not entirely been thought through. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman can reassure me about
that.</div><a name="08061815000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fine,
I accept that the LBRO has the power to make grants. On what basis? For
how much? Where will it work? What will the grants pay for? The clause
is not well drafted. It gives a wide, sweeping range of examples and
then someone has tacked in grants at the back of it as an afterthought.
It does not feel like a coherent thought. I should be interested to
know what the Minister believes would not be appropriate, so that we
can understand how far the LBRO can extend
itself.</div>
<a name="08061815000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000433"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This is an enabling clause. We talked this
morning about LBRO&#146;s budget, which has been set at about
&#163;4.5 million a year. That is a relatively modest amount with
which to carry out its functions. It would enable it possibly to give
some support to local authorities in respect of functions that it asks
them to do, which is why the clause includes making grants to local
authorities. The Bill does not prescribe the circumstances in which
LBRO may do that and it will ultimately be for its board to decide
whether it wishes to exercise the functions. It is sensible to allow
LBRO such a power to ensure that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>is able to carry them out. It is sensible flexibility to provide the
support that, as an independent body, it should
provide.</div><a name="08061815000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are constraints on LBRO&#146;s expenditure within the normal Treasury
rules. We talked this morning about the presentation of accounts to
Parliament. That discussion was about time limits, but the normal
Treasury rules would apply to expenditure. We think that it is sensible
to have some flexibility to support local authorities in the work that
we are asking them to do in this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061815000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000434"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in
clause 34, page 16, line 16, leave
out from &#145;Part&#146; to end of line 17 and insert</div>
<a name="08061822000003"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;may not be made unless a draft of
the instrument had been laid before, and approved by resolution of,
each House of
Parliament.&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was confused by the numbers. I heard 33 and assumed that it was the
amendment. My apologies for that, Mr. Chope.</div>
<a name="08061815000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members will see, clause 34 refers to various orders that Ministers may
present to complete this legislation through this part of the Bill. The
amendment seeks to ensure that they require the positive resolution of
both Houses before becoming law. Part 2, which we are considering at
the moment, introduces primary authorities which will affect most
employers and every single local authority in our constituencies.
Primary authorities will mean that many businesses in our
constituencies will no longer be subject to the authority of our local
authorities, and that is something that we need to consider. It is a
radical departure from current practice. It is important that we, as
hon. Members of this House, ensure that the workings of the new system
are subject to proper scrutiny. Given that the LBRO will not be
directly accountable to the House, is it not important that we ensure
that the system is accountable to us? Rather than pursuing the negative
resolution, I think that it is important to ensure that the system is
covered by the positive resolution. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="08061815000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000435"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I support the hon. Gentleman. It is extremely
important that with legislation of this nature, we should have the
positive resolution. I hope that the Minister will give some thought to
implementing this one important
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000436"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> There are two amendments that one can guarantee
will be moved during the passage of any Bill. One is the amendment that
turns the word &#147;may&#148; into &#147;shall&#148; and the
other will raise negative and affirmative order-making powers.
Therefore, such an amendment was always going to come up.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="08061815000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 34 is
specifically about the order-making powers under part 2 of the Bill.
There are various other order-making powers that are subject to
affirmative resolution procedures, which we will discuss in part 3.
This is about the order-making powers in part 2. There are four
specific order-making powers in this part. The first of these, under
clause 24, allows for the legislative scope of the primary authority
scheme to be defined for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The next two
orders in clauses 28 and 29 allow for exclusions and exemptions to the
primary authority scheme to be specified. We discussed those in the
debate on clause
29.</div><a name="08061815000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
schedule 4 allows for detailed provision to be made for procedures in
which matters raised by the primary authority scheme go to arbitration.
The Government made it clear in their submission to the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that we believed these
to be essentially technical matters, and that the negative resolution
procedure was appropriate in those circumstances. None of the powers
can be used in a way that would either extend the scope of the Bill or
make other amendments to primary legislation&#151;there is no sense
of a Henry VIII power. We therefore believe that the negative
resolution procedure is
appropriate.</div><a name="08061815000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
issues were raised in the debate on this in the other place. The
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not comment on the
negative resolution procedure. However, that was on the condition that
the orders establishing Northern Ireland and Scotland&#146;s scope
should not specify functions that did not already appear in schedule 3,
which we discussed this morning. This is still about those headings set
out in the enactments in schedule 3 about trading standards, fire
safety and so on. It does not go broader than
that.</div><a name="08061815000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was also a view expressed in the other place that it should be made
clear that the exemption orders should be required to exclude cases in
which serious harm might result from the delay that the primary
authority provisions could create. We are happy to make both of those
changes, which are reflected in the Bill. We will shortly be consulting
on the orders and will focus the consultation on enforcement
specialists in local authorities and businesses, because they are
likely to be highly technical, as I have said.</div>
<a name="08061815000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
always a debate about whether orders should be subject to the negative
or affirmative procedures. We certainly do not take the blanket view
that the negative procedure should be used throughout the Bill. As I
have said, order-making powers under part 3 will be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure, but we feel that the negative
resolution procedure should suffice in relation to the orders covering
the issues in this part of the Bill&#151;particularly because the
matter has been discussed in the other place and considered by the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000437"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> This has been a helpful debate. I accept that a
number of the orders principally relate to technical matters. As the
Minister highlighted, the orders in parts 1 and 3 are subject to the
positive resolution. However, that is not the case here. I considered
the issue with some care and looked at the matter in terms of schedule
4. Enforcement action is quite an extensive part of the Bill in
relation to the way it reaches the operations of the LBRO. That is
particularly the case in those areas 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>where the actions of the LBRO will impinge upon the businesses
concerned&#151;the regulated person, as it were.</div>
<a name="08061815000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
problem is that the LBRO itself is not accountable to us. Therefore it
is important that we strengthen our ability to scrutinise the
Government&#146;s actions wherever else we can. Although I accept
that, for the most part, the principal purpose of the orders for this
part is technical, the enforcement action is nevertheless important. If
I might refer to the metaphor used by the Minister, enforcement action
will be the teeth that are often seen and, indeed, felt by the
regulated persons. It is therefore important that we have the
opportunity&#151;no more than that&#151;to debate these matters in
an appropriate fashion. Although I understand the assurances of the
Minister and do not always think it is appropriate to pursue the
positive resolution on technical matters, on this occasion it is. I
therefore seek to press the amendment to a

Bill.</div>
<a name="08061815000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000451"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> If you will permit me, Mr. Chope, I
will go slightly wider than may be appropriate and pause for a moment
to talk about part 3. This takes us into the second significant area
identified by Hampton in his report. The first area was inconsistency,
and we talked about that a lot in parts 1 and 2 regarding the
establishment of LBRO and the primary authority principle that we were
debating.</div>
<a name="08061815000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now turn
to Hampton&#146;s other significant criticism of the regulatory
regime&#151;inflexibility. This part of the Bill begins to address
that issue, and gives greater flexibility to regulators in terms of the
sanctions that they can impose. Some of those sanctions are monetary,
some involve corrective actions or instructions for corrective measures
to be taken, but they all address the issue of inflexibility and the
disproportionate nature of having a one-club policy to
enforcement&#151;that of criminal prosecution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="08061815000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hampton&#146;s
work was built on by Professor Richard Macrory who, if memory serves
me, published his report in November 2006. Macrory recommended a number
of the different sanctions outlined in part 3, which acknowledges and
introduces different powers, including fixed penalties, available
monetary penalties, stop notices and so on. We will help ensure that
rogue traders&#151;or, as it says in my speaking note, &#147;rouge
traders&#148;&#151;will not continue to receive an unfair advantage
by failing to adhere to the law, and we will increase confidence
further in the regulatory regime.</div>
<a name="08061815000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
have been welcomed by bodies including the Engineering Employers
Federation, the Federation of Small Businesses, local authority
enforcers and the Institute of Directors. There is widespread support
for more flexibility in the system and clause 36 specifically allows a
Minister of the Crown or a Welsh Minister to make an order providing
for those new civil sanctioning powers as an alternative to criminal
prosecution.</div>
<a name="08061815000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, the sanctions will provide regulators with more proportionate,
flexible and effective ways of targeting regulatory non-compliance.
Before making an order, the Minister must be satisfied that the
regulator will exercise such powers in a manner that is in line with
the principles of good regulation&#151;we talked about that this
morning&#151;in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportional,
consistent and targeted and used only in cases where action is needed.
The Minister must seek the approval of the Panel for Regulatory
Accountability, whose terms of reference include ensuring that the
burden of regulation on business is kept to a minimum. That process is
set out on pages 28 and 29 of a guide to the Bill published by my
Department.</div>
<a name="08061815000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
requires the Minister to consult before making an order, and subjects
it to affirmative resolution procedure. That means that the relevant
parliamentary processes will apply to that order. Part 3 is an
important part of the Bill. It addresses the issue of inconsistency, it
gives greater flexibility to the regulators and it ensures that we will
tackle these rouge
traders.</div><a name="08061815000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000452"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I welcome some of the remarks that the Minister has
made. He has identified that this clause seeks to provide powers to
make orders providing for civil sanctions, but it then proceeds to do
so right across the whole of the part. To follow his remarks, which
edge slightly beyond clause 36, without testing your patience,
Mr. Chope&#151;I am sure that you will guide me should I
stray too far&#151;he is right to say that this part of the Bill,
which provides many of the order-making powers, introduces a wide range
of sanctions. We have fixed monetary penalties, discretionary stop
notices and other enforcement actions. Those are provided not just for
a single regulator, but for 26 different regulators, as well as all the
local committees, so probably 30 bodies. Those include the Financial
Services Authority, the Charity Commission, the Health and Safety
Executive, the Football Licensing Authority and even the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority&#151;so a really wide range of
regulatory bodies.</div>
<a name="08061815000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legally, the
sanctions according to schedule 6, which I am sure we will come to in
due course, apply to no fewer than 142 separate laws. Almost every
aspect of our constituents&#146; lives will be covered by this: from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>housing to jobs, from animal welfare to protecting our children, from
disability discrimination to Sunday trading. All of those statutes are
listed in the Bill and are affected by the new range of sanctions that
we are considering in the clause.</div>
<a name="08061815000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most notably,
the sanctions, which are often fines, will be imposed without recourse
to the courts. The Opposition do not oppose civil penalties as a matter
of principle, but we believe they are most appropriate for minor
offences such as parking or speeding. The danger is that we may end up
with the regulators handing out the equivalent of parking fines, which
may prove rather attractive to them. That is bad for business and it
undermines what we have debated so far&#151;the concept of a
risk-based approach to regulation as set out in parts 1 and
2.</div>
<a name="08061815000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many business
organisations are concerned. The Minister said that there was wide
support. Let me joust briefly with two or three proponents on this side
of the argument; he has mentioned two or three on his side. The British
Retail Consortium is very concerned. It regards the section as
&#147;unacceptable&#148;. The Forum of Private Business regards it
as a deal breaker. The CBI says
that</div><a name="08061815000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;business
is still concerned that introducing more administrative fines will
foster a &#145;parking ticket&#146; mentality amongst inspectors,
which will fundamentally change the existing relationship between
inspectors and
businesses&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us be candid with one another: there are mixed views rather than a body
of opinion that is wholly on one side or the
other.</div>
<a name="08061815000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000453"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> While the hon. Gentleman is talking about a parking
ticket mentality among inspectors, does he agree that a parking ticket
of &#163;70 might be nothing to someone who has a good
income&#151;such as a Member of Parliament, dare I say it&#151;but
to a pensioner a parking ticket is a huge imposition? I certainly could
not use the example of a Member of Parliament as regards changing
behaviour, but a lot of people can disregard parking tickets and treat
them as part of doing business, whereas for other people they make a
big difference.</div>
<a name="08061815000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That was a long intervention. This Bill is not
about parking tickets.</div>
<a name="08061815000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000455"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> My
allusion&#151;</div><a name="08061815000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000456"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> A
metaphor.</div><a name="08061815000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000457"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It was a metaphor rather than an allusion. The
metaphor was to illustrate not that we were talking about real parking
tickets, but that we are talking about the danger that simply handing
out fines or sanctions is not the way in which compliance is achieved.
Obviously, the principles of Hampton and Macrory, upon which the Bill
is based, are anxious that we do not go down that path. It is that
mentality that the hon. Lady was referring
to.</div><a name="08061815000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern about this section of the Bill and about the clause, which
introduces many of the related powers, is not limited to business.
There were serious and extensive debates in the other place, with
contributions from members of all the political parties. The reason is
that, while providing for what the Minister described as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>simpler process of enforcement for the regulator, the provisions remove
the right to be heard in an ordinary court of law. The orders in the
clause, which would relate to fixed monthly penalties and discretionary
monthly penalties elsewhere in part 3 of the Bill, mean that instead of
any one of those 27 or so regulators only being able to investigate a
possible breach, they would also be the people that would decide on a
person&#146;s guilt and who would hand out the sanction. They would
have the dual role of investigator and prosecutor, and judge and jury,
all in one
body.</div><a name="08061815000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading and in earlier debates, Ministers have been keen to say,
&#147;Ah, but there is an independent tribunal
process&#148;&#151;an appeal process is available. There is, but it
is just that, an appeal process. In other words, that process only
happens after the sanction or the fine has been handed out. To use the
criminal law equivalent, that only happens after the accused has been
found guilty. There is, therefore, no opportunity for an innocent
person to defend themselves until appeal. That is the crux of the
concern.</div><a name="08061815000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
orders set out in the clause, which relate to the rest of part 3, are
important. If the clause related to just one regulator or one piece of
legislation, it might not be regarded as such a significant incursion.
However, we are talking about over 27 different regulators, with 142
different pieces of legislation. It is therefore a huge shift in the
law. Whatever the Minister&#146;s original intentions, the clause has
the potential to result in a significant reduction in our civil
liberties. It is worth remembering that a regulated
person&#151;someone who could receive such a sanction or
fine&#151;is not just a business, but a person. Hon. Members may wish
to reflect on that and what impact that might have on, say, a shop
worker, who might suddenly find that those 27 regulators and 142
different pieces of legislation might well relate to them. That is
worth bearing in
mind.</div><a name="08061815000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
party and I have serious reservations about this part of the Bill. We
understand the benefits of, as the Minister rightly says, not simply
relying on one, crude, one-size-fits-all criminal approach and we
understand that there is a good argument for the civil procedure, but
our worry is about a wide range of powers for a wide range of
regulators. Therefore, as we go through this and subsequent clauses, I
hope that the Minister will be able to demonstrate why the approach is
both right in principle and appropriate in
practice.</div><a name="08061815000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000458"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I shall try to answer some of the specific
points without going into a Second Reading debate on part 3 of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061815000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised two points, the first being about a parking
ticket mentality and whether that would be encouraged&#151;although I
have said that we are not talking about parking tickets as such. There
are safeguards against that developing too easily. Regulators will have
to be satisfied to the criminal standard of proof&#151;beyond
reasonable doubt&#151;that a person has committed an offence before a
regulator can impose a fixed monetary penalty. The person will be able
to make representations to the regulator before the sanction can be
imposed. The hon. Gentleman was somewhat dismissive of the right to
appeal against the sanctions to an independent tribunal, but it is
there, in the Bill, and is an important safeguard against an abuse of
the powers by a regulator. Also, regulators will not directly benefit
from penalties, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>as any moneys gathered as a result will be paid into the consolidated
funds. We are not setting up a money-making scheme for
regulators.</div><a name="08061815000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about businesses being concerned about judge,
jury and so on all being one. In the end, we must make a judgment about
whether we want to have a regime that includes such sanctions in
addition to the traditional route of criminal prosecution. Criminal
prosecution has been used until now&#151;or often not used, because
of various issues. It can be a disproportionate response to many
instances of non-compliance, and we believe that regulators need access
to a range of more flexible
sanctions.</div><a name="08061815000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="08061815000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Professor Macrory said, civil sanctions are an established part of the
enforcement landscape. A number of regulators already have the power to
impose them. It is not a new constitutional departure. It will give the
regulators listed under the schedules to which he referred the capacity
to use the sanctions as they do not use them at the moment, but the
principle of them is not new. The powers will be conferred on
regulators only if the Minister is satisfied that they will act in
accordance with better regulation principles. We have talked a lot
about them today when using the powers, so I shall not repeat that
now.</div><a name="08061815000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses
will have an opportunity to make their case against the imposition of
the sanction. They can make representations and objections, and have
the right of appeal to an independent tribunal. We will argue the case
further in respect of the individual amendments that we shall discuss,
but we must make a judgment about whether we shall implement Professor
Macrory&#146;s recommendations and vary the mix of sanctions
available under the regulatory regime. We have decided to do so, and
that is what this part of the Bill
does.</div><a name="08061815000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

perhaps my comments can refer to clause 37 and touch on clause 38, as
both clauses are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000460"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000461"></a>Mr.

Subsection (3) makes it clear what is not included, such as the Crown
Prosecution Service, the police and so on because those organisations
retain a role in respect of criminal prosecutions that are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000462"></a>Mr.

we are talking about in respect of a designated regulator. The Bill
confers powers on the regulators set out under schedule 5 to have
access to the new sanctions for relevant offences under schedule 6,
which is why the two parts come together to define both the regulators
and the offences to which we are
referring.</div><a name="08061815000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
39</h4><a name="08061815000017"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Fixed
monetary
penalties</div><a name="08061815000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="08061815000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000463"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause sets out the first of what could be
called a suite of powers and sanctions and is specifically about fixed
monetary penalties. Fixed monetary penalties will provide regulators
with an effective tool, enabling them to deal quickly with low-level
examples of non-compliance, rather than pursuing a costly criminal
prosecution. Perhaps here more than anywhere, we see the stark contrast
between what might be done under the new regime and the policy
available under the current one.</div>
<a name="08061815000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fixed
monetary penalties are aimed at factually simple cases of
non-compliance, which may or may not involve culpable conduct. For
example, they could be used for strict liability offences, where it is
not necessary to show intention to commit the offence, but they should
benefit both regulators and business. They should also help to address
the compliance deficit identified by Professor Macrory. That is
important&#151;one of the points that Professor Macrory made in his
report was that not only was the system inflexible, but by having only
one main tool to ensure compliance, there was actually a compliance
deficit. Low-level non-compliance was either not being prosecuted or,
in some high-level non-compliance cases, it was resulting in a fine
that did not match the crime involved. It was not only a case of
inflexibility; it was about not producing the desired results on
compliance.</div>
<a name="08061815000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000464"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Can my hon. Friend assist me by explaining what
kind of offences he is talking about? In the company where I used to
work, I remember that our administrator was always hugely affected by
the advertisement from Companies House which stated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>that if accounts and orders about who was on the management committee
were not returned on time, there would be a &#163;2,000 fine. No one
was sent to jail, but it was remarkable having that advertisement
there&#151;knowing that there might be a charge of &#163;2,000 was
certainly an incentive to get it done. Is that the sort of example that
the Minister is talking about?</div>
<a name="08061815000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000465"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is a very good example. The previous
Government introduced such penalties and civil sanctions for late
filing, exercised by Companies House. That came up on Second Reading
and, if I am right, rates of compliance following the introduction of
those penalties went up. In 1991, the compliance rate was 86 per cent.
In 1992 it immediately increased to 92 per cent., and it continued to
increase to a level of 96 per cent. It shows that the previous
Government were correct to introduce civil penalties in those cases. My
hon. Friend is right that it is a good example, which I believe can be
built on in some of the areas that we are talking about.</div>
<a name="08061815000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the clause, subsection (2) requires that regulators may only impose a
fixed monetary penalty when</div>
<a name="08061815000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;satisfied
beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061815000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is an important point referring to the criminal standard of
proof&#151;</div>
<a name="08061815000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the person
has committed the relevant
offence.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) states that the amount of the penalty will be specified by the
order made by the Minister. For example, the level of the fixed
monetary penalty could differ according to whether the person liable is
an individual or a body corporate. Subsection (4) caps the level of
fixed monetary penalty at the maximum fine that would have been
available for that offence if it had been tried summarily in the
magistrates court. That is usually &#163;5,000. There are other
safeguards in clauses 40 and 41 for persons upon whom the fixed
monetary penalties are imposed.</div>
<a name="08061815000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
sets out the basic regime for fixed monetary penalties. It is one of a
number of sanctions that Professor Macrory recommended. We believe
that, if enacted, it will be an important addition to what regulators
can do to ensure compliance. It is also, importantly, an addition with
safeguards built in for those who are subject to these
procedures.</div>
<a name="08061815000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000466"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s remarks. I confess
that for a moment, when he said the previous Government, I was not sure
whether he meant that led by Mr. Blair or the previous
Conservative Government, but I think that by the look on his face he
meant the Conservative Government. I am happy to confirm that he
concurs.</div>
<a name="08061815000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
strong role for this kind of penalty. The Minister is absolutely right
to say that built into the clause, thankfully, are some sensible
safeguards. In subsection (2) we have the important principle,
&#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;. Although hon. Members will
realise that that is usually a criminal matter, it sets the bar high.
The other point is that subsection (4), as he rightly said, puts into
place the cap, which is also an important principle.</div>
<a name="08061815000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
there are problems with the related system, but the principle of these
penalties can and does work, as the hon. Member for Amber Valley
referred to in her own example. And they do, the evidence suggests, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>help drive the compliance rates up in a reasonable way. So the principle
of fixed monetary penalties has some merit. The two particular limits
or restraints give me confidence and therefore the clause is to be
welcomed in principle.</div>
<a name="08061815000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000467"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I agree with everyone who has spoken on this issue.
It is a good principle to have penalties. We have had a lot of
discussions about metaphorical parking tickets. I just want to make one
point about fixed penalties. It is important that the penalty is
appropriate, just like in &#147;The Mikado&#148;: let the
punishment fit the crime. We should be wary of developing the mentality
whereby one fixed penalty for one small company might be just as
appropriate as a fixed penalty for a larger company. It is important to
bear that in mind.</div>
<a name="08061815000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to subsection (4)(b), that the relevant
offence
is</div><a name="08061815000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;punishable
on summary conviction by a fine (whether or not it is also punishable
by a term of
imprisonment)&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
referred earlier to the appeals system being through a tribunal. Does
he not think that if we are talking about penalties that have the
potential for someone to go to prison, we should have an appeals system
that, if the company so wishes, goes through the courts and not through
a tribunal?</div>
<a name="08061815000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000468"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> To turn to what the hon. Lady has just said, the
company can appeal beyond the tribunal if it wishes to continue the
appeal, but the appeal is to the tribunal.</div>
<a name="08061815000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the level
of fines, those are related to the offence, which is why we get the
limit that we do. Subsection (4) sets out that the limit applies where
the relevant offence is triable summarily and punishable on summary
conviction by a fine. These sanctions are an alternative to
prosecution; they are not the same as prosecution. Perhaps that might
set out the difference between a fine and criminal prosecution as the
hon. Lady outlines. The principle behind this is that the penalty
should fit the crime involved. One of the problems that Professor
Macrory identified was that only having criminal prosecutions as a
sanction for some of these lower-level offences did not actually result
in the compliance that we want to see. That is why a regime more akin
to what my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley set out with regard
to Companies House is something that we want to add to the
regulators&#146; options in such a
situation.</div><a name="08061815000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08061815000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
level of fixed monetary penalty is related to the offence. The amount
that we specified is in the order, and the regulator will simply file
the appropriate amount based on the characteristics of the offence and
the offender. In that sense, the punishment shall fit the crime.
Regulators can apply that important new option to the lower-level but
important offences that our constituents expect to see punished, but
that sometimes go unpunished under the current regime because the only
tool available is
prosecution.</div><a name="08061815000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Q</i><i class="I">uestion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000471"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I spoke earlier of the potential injustice of a
regulator both issuing a notice of intent to find somebody and then
being the recipient of objections to that decision. Amendments Nos. 34
and 35 seek to correct that injustice by providing the option of having
an independent person hear those objections. Specifically, the
amendments would allow the LBRO to appoint that person, but they must
be independent of the regulator concerned and they must have the
relevant qualifications and experience. Although I think that parts of
the procedure have merits, other parts have problems and the amendments
will help by giving the accused&#151;if we can use that phrase in
this context&#151;the sense that they have an option to seek some
form of independent perspective on the matter rather than simply being
able to turn back only to the regulator who is trying to fine them in
the first place. I hope that the Minister will consider the matter with
care.</div>
<a name="08061815000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagine
that I address amendment No. 41 a little later on, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="08061815000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000472"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="08061815000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000473"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment proposes
the alternative that an independent person be appointed by the LBRO.
Does he, therefore, see the LBRO appointing someone to operate, say, in
the Environment Agency as a judge of whether a client of the
Environment Agency&#151;if we may use that phrase 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>rather than the accused&#151;has broken the law? How would the LBRO be
able to ensure that level of specific expertise in the Environment
Agency&#146;s
remit?</div><a name="08061815000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000474"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The intervention is helpful because it gets to the
heart of whether the person involved has both ability and independence
from the original representation. My reading of clause 40 would be that
it would be quite appropriate for an independent person appointed by
the LBRO to be able to make reasonable judgment as to whether the
representations and objections made were appropriate. Therefore, it
would be right for the LBRO to appoint someone who has the capability
to do that. That is why the amendments do not simply say that we should
appoint an independent person, but would give the system the
opportunity to ensure that that person is appropriate and qualified. I
think the amendments allow for that, but I am happy to debate it in due
course. We will come to amendment No. 41 in a moment, but that is how I
believe the proposal would work.</div>
<a name="08061815000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that the process is seen to be fair and reasonable. There is
nothing worse than a system that is generally appropriate being let
down by the perception of the client&#151;to use the
Minister&#146;s word rather than the word accused&#151;that they
are facing a regulator who has already determined that they should be
fined and that objecting will therefore have no purpose.</div>
<a name="08061815000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
the small business that looks at this and thinks, &#147;Hang on a
moment, I&#146;ve just been served this notice. Where do I turn to
object? It&#146;s the very people who will serve the notice back, so
I&#146;m just going to pay the fine and get on with my life because
I&#146;m not going to get a fair hearing.&#148; That is my
concern.</div><a name="08061815000258"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000475"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The amendments and clause 40 are important
because the clause sets out in detail how the fixed monetary penalties
that we were discussing will be applied. There is a great deal of
detail in the clause&#151;for example, the issuing of a notice of
intent under subsection (2)(a). A person may make written
representations to the regulator in relation to that and they may
ultimately appeal against the final decision, as we have
discussed.</div><a name="08061815000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would intervene in the area of a notice of intent before a
sanction has been imposed&#151;that is their focus. We already know
that there will be an appeal to an independent tribunal when a sanction
is imposed. The amendments would add a second appeal earlier in the
process when a notice of intent has been issued. They cover similar
territory to the amendments discussed at length in the other place, but
they are slightly different. I am still not entirely clear about who
the independent person referred to in the amendment might be. My
broader concern is that if the amendments were accepted, further
provision would need to be made for that in the Bill. Details would
have to be given about the powers of the person and the procedure for
considering representations and so
on.</div><a name="08061815000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us remember where we started: the recommendations from Professor
Macrory that there should be greater simplicity and speed, and that
there should be a greater variety of options available to regulators to
ensure compliance. My worry is that the amendments will make the system
over-complex by giving us two different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>appeal processes&#151;one where a notice of intent is issued and one
where a sanction is imposed, as already in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08061815000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides a right of appeal to an independent and impartial tribunal on
the final decision, as I have said. An appeal would be able to consider
matters such as whether the regulator had unreasonably dismissed the
objections referred to in the clause under subsection
(2)(c)&#151;objections raised to the sanction after the notice of
intent.</div><a name="08061815000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is whether we need two rights to have the case heard by two
different persons, both before and after a sanction is imposed. The
amendment would add a further level of bureaucracy and additional
resources would be needed to set up and maintain a body that would hear
all the representations. The process of imposing a sanction would be
made much more lengthy and cumbersome. The amendment might actually
take us back to the problem we are trying to resolve, which is how to
give greater flexibility to regulators and have a variety of options in
relation to the kind of offences we are talking
about.</div><a name="08061815000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the debates in the other place, my noble Friend Baroness Vadera
addressed similar issues on similar amendments. She agreed that there
was a need for high quality decision making by regulators, and we made
changes to the guidance to the Bill to strengthen that. The guidance
states
that</div><a name="08061815000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
regulator should have arrangements in place to review or monitor
individual decisions. This will ensure that there is confidence in the
regulatory
system&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that there is some quality in the decisions, but it is
important to remember that there is a right of appeal against the final
decision. The question before us is whether we need two rights of
appeal in the process. I hope the Committee agrees that the right of
appeal to an independent tribunal covers the issue of one regulator
being judge and jury together, so we would not need the additional
right of appeal at the earlier stage, around the notice of
intent.</div><a name="08061815000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000476"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The debate has been useful. I fully recognise that
there are weaknesses in the amendments, but the central issue is that
all that is available to someone who has a sanction placed against them
at the moment is an appeal to disprove their guilt&#151;in other
words, we have an appeal process after the event. The purpose behind
the amendments was to find out how we could establish a means by which
a person who has been accused is able to correct something or to
challenge the process with someone who is not making the notice in the
first place. The amendment is not necessarily about its own merits, but
about highlighting a weakness in the existing system. Of course, if we
are to have a civil procedure, it needs to be reasonably unbureaucratic
and reasonably efficient. If it is to have the confidence of the
community that it is trying to police, there needs to be confidence in
an element of fairness. I am not confident that the procedure has that
appropriate
balance.</div><a name="08061815000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a moment I will seek to withdraw the amendments, Mr. Chope,
but I do so on that basis, which I hope the Minister will consider too.
I will continue to see if there is a way through. Again I highlight the
fact that we are talking about a regulated person, who may be a sole
trader or an individual, who would look at the system, feel intimidated
about going back to a regulator and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>therefore feel that they should just pay the fine and get on with it. I
want to make sure that we have done everything that we possibly can to
get the right balance between efficiency and fairness. I am not sure
that it has been achieved so far&#151;indeed, I am reasonably
confident that it has not. I am not sure that the balance is
appropriate. I have not found the magic answer, but the purpose of my
amendments was to see whether there was a degree of reason. I hope that
the Minister can indicate from a sedentary position that the Government
are open to such
suggestions.</div><a name="08061815000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000477"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Always
reasonable.</div><a name="08061815000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000478"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Always reasonable, always open. I am pleased that
the Minister is happy to say that from a sedentary position. It is
important that we can find some way forward, to make sure that there is
confidence in the system. The danger, I suspect, is that there will not
be, as currently constituted. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000479"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 53, in
clause 40, page 18, line 16, at
end insert</div> <a name="08061822000011"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;may require
the regulator to withdraw the notice and pursue the matter as a
criminal offence under the relevant
provisions&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000480"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 54, in
clause 43, page 20, line 24, at
end insert</div> <a name="08061822000012"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and may
require the regulator to withdraw the notice and pursue the matter as a
criminal offence under the relevant
provisions&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
55, in
clause 47, page 23, line 24, at
end insert</div> <a name="08061822000013"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and may by
notice require the regulator to withdraw the notice and pursue the
matter as a criminal offence under the relevant
provisions&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000481"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> The amendments all have the same purpose. The
provisions would enable the business to opt for court action, if
preferred, even though it could face the prospect of a criminal
conviction as a result, thereby ensuring that the option was available
at the request not only of the regulator but also of the company.
Businesses should not have to face the risk of unsubstantiated damage
to their reputations until and unless they have been proved guilty. For
many businesses, the risk to loss of reputation is worse than the cost
of the appeal. Consequently, many businesses would take the sanctioning
decision to appeal, and they should have the option of taking the
decision through a criminal court, if they so
wish.</div><a name="08061815000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000482"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> In a sense, the amendments are not too
dissimilar from those that we discussed previously. They are coming at
the issue from a slightly different angle, but I suspect that they are
motivated by a similar concern. The hon. Lady said that the
client&#151;or the accused, whatever phrase we use&#151;should have
the choice, and the amendments would apply the choice to fixed monetary
penalties, discretionary requirements or stop
notices.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="08061815000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="08061815000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new sanctions under the clause and following clauses are an alternative
to criminal prosecution. They will be imposed only when a regulator is,
as I have said, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt with the criminal
standard of proof that a criminal offence has been committed. The
regulator will have undergone a thorough and rigorous investigation
and, at the end of the process, will have determined that a person is
liable for the offence. The important question to be answered is
whether we think that, after that process, it should be for the person,
the business concerned or the regulator to decide what route the
sanction
takes.</div><a name="08061815000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000483"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am interested in the route that the Minister is
taking. He seems to be implying that, if a case is considered strong,
the judge and jury have already gone out, come back and decided that
the company is guilty. Given what he has said, I am even more concerned
about pressing my
case.</div><a name="08061815000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000484"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I do not know whether what I have to say will
ease the hon. Lady&#146;s concern. The alternative set out in the
amendments could leave the system open to abuse. For example, it could
give someone who was accused of an offence a mechanism to delay the
enforcement process by opting for a criminal prosecution and thus
requiring the regulator to undergo another process after it has gone
through the process of setting out its case and presenting all its
evidence. There is a right of appeal to an independent tribunal but, as
I said in respect of the previous amendments, we want a system that
does not have to go through the same processes over and over
again.</div><a name="08061815000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing
a person to choose which route to go down would not be in keeping with
the Macrory review. In a proportionate sanctioning regime, criminal
prosecution should be reserved for the most serious cases. That remains
a weapon for serious breaches of the law. We are not saying that the
new sanctions should replace that system entirely, but that they should
replace it in some circumstances, and that can be assessed by the
regulator only in view of all the cases before
it.</div><a name="08061815000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
choice between civil and criminal sanctions should remain at the
discretion of the regulator, not the person who is accused of the
offence. We understand the concerns that members of the Committee might
have about the new sanction powers being
misused.</div><a name="08061815000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000485"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Can my hon. Friend confirm that, in Scotland,
such measures would be inappropriate, as the decision whether to
prosecute is in the hands of the procurator fiscal who takes the action
on behalf of the regulatory authority? The regulatory authority does
not have the discretion in that
regard.</div><a name="08061815000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000486"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The principle to which my hon. Friend referred
is right. It is not for the accused to choose their route, which would
be the result of the amendments. For both fixed monetary penalties and
discretionary requirements, there will be an opportunity for a person
to make representations to the regulator before the sanction is
imposed. It will enable the person to raise defences and challenge the
case against him or her and to challenge the evidence relied on by the
regulator.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="08061815000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ultimate
appeal will be referred to an impartial, independent tribunal. The
tribunal will also have the power to overturn or reduce the level of
the penalty imposed by the regulator or take any other steps that the
regulator could have taken in relation to the incidents of regulatory
non-compliance. The Bill contains broader safeguards in the form of the
review clauses that we referred to earlier&#151;such as that relating
to part 3&#151;and suspension provisions, which we discussed in
relation to parts 1 and 2.</div>
<a name="08061815000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000487"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It is a peculiar argument that, if someone is
allowed the option of choosing the criminal path, that will somehow
lead to a flood of cases. The truth is that an individual would choose
that path under only the most exceptional circumstances. Does the
Minister recognise that it would be a tiny number? Clearly, most
businesses would not wish to go down that path. It is a thin
argument.</div>
<a name="08061815000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000488"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman allows me to turn again to
the impact assessment. That states that from the Bill&#146;s overall
estimated benefit to business&#151;which comes to an annual sum of
&#163;200 million&#151;the biggest proportion will probably come
through this part of the Bill due to savings made from fewer court
appearances for businesses and fewer lengthy legal costs in criminal
prosecution cases. Those are significant savings to business.</div>
<a name="08061815000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000489"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It is a fascinating extract, I am sure, but it does
not answer the point. The idea that having that option available will
suddenly regularly increase the burden to business is not right. This
will affect a tiny handful, a very small proportion of businesses. It
is about ensuring, where there are no other options and no independent
person to appeal to before being found guilty, that this option exists
should a business feel that it would like to have its day in court and
stand before the law. That is why it would exercise it and that is why
it is an important principle.</div>
<a name="08061815000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000490"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> In the end it comes down to a judgment about the
safeguards in the Bill. We had this discussion on the previous set of
amendments that were moved by the hon. Gentleman and this is a similar
matter. The Government&#146;s view is that there should be the right
to make representations to the regulator on the basis of a notice of
intent being issued&#151;something set out in the clauses that the
amendments seek to change. The notice of intent must include the
grounds for the proposal and set out the right to make such
representations, objections and so on. There is also the right of an
independent appeal to the tribunal, which is independent, impartial and
separate from the regulator. As I said, should we judge that the powers
are not being used properly after the enactment of the Bill, the wider
review and suspension provisions provide adequate safeguards. In the
end, it is also a judgment about whether the person accused or the
regulator should decide the path of its
function.</div>
<a name="08061815000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000491"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Does the Minister agree that we should stick to
the general principle that prosecutions should be taken if they are in
the public interest, not because of personal requirements? I am
disappointed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>that the Opposition do not recognise that prosecutions should be taken
in the public interest. There is a general principle that should be
applied here and that is what the Bill tries to put in
place.</div>
<a name="08061815000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000492"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, and I am happy to
confirm to her that officials did consult the office of the procurator
fiscal on the measures.</div>
<a name="08061815000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000493"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I was interested to listen not only to the Minister
but to the hon. Lady. I do not agree that public interest should
override individual fairness. I have listened carefully to the Minister
when he talked about people who might try to exploit the system and
delay the process for their own financial ends. Even so, if justice is
done then in the end these individual companies will be punished. The
delay in punishment of a few rogue traders should not be at a loss to
everyone else, particularly companies that are innocent or that value
greatly the loss of their reputation, which is an extremely serious
consequence for them. I do not believe that the regulator or anybody
else should take that right away from them.</div>
<a name="08061815000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">To use an
analogy from civilian life, a person might be accused of stealing a
loaf of bread, but they have the option of electing to go before a
jury, not because of the value of the loaf of bread but because of the
value of their individual reputation. I do not believe that that option
should be taken from companies. I therefore wish to press the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000508"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in
clause 40, page 19, line 4, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) The final
notice must offer the person the opportunity to pay the prescribed sum
mentioned in subsection (2)(b) within a specified time
limit.&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would insert between subsections (5) and (6) of clause 40 the
phrase:</div>
<a name="08061815000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
final notice must offer the person the opportunity to pay the
prescribed sum mentioned in subsection (2)(b) within a specified time
limit.&#148;.</div><a name="08061815000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is this about? It is very simple in a way. It is the classic dilemma
that one faces when confronted with a notice to pay something or an
accusation: should one make a representation and lose out as a result?
The amendment would correct that. A defendant should not be at a
disadvantage simply because they want to make a written representation
or an objection. Justice is not well served by placing a pressure on a
defendant to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>accept a penalty regardless of their innocence in order to reduce the
potential fine. The amendment would ensure that if someone decided, as
they are entitled to, to make a written representation and if that
representation was overruled, that defendant would still receive a
discount for any other payment. There should be no financial inducement
one way or the other; they should be able to make those
representations.</div>
<a name="08061815000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000509"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I understand the sentiment behind the amendment.
I do not want to put words into the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mouth and I
am sure he will correct me if I am summarising this wrongly, but I
think that what he is trying to say is that people should not be
penalised for choosing to make representations. I understand that, but
I believe that the amendment is not necessary to ensure that that is
the case. Clause 40 allows the discharge payment to be set at a lower
level than the fixed monetary penalty to, for example, reflect
procedural savings from an early admission to liability by a business,
so we have that already. Once the penalty has been imposed, clause
52(1) deals with the situation that he is concerned about. The clause
states:</div><a name="08061815000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under this Part...confers power on a regulator to require a
person to pay a fixed monetary
penalty.&#148;</div><a name="08061815000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may include provision &#147;for early payment discounts&#148; and
so on. The provision allows the regulator to offer an early payment
discount should a business decide to pay the penalty immediately. That
is once the penalty has been imposed. The discharge payment and early
payment discount could be set at the same level. We obviously need to
specify that in the Bill as there may be circumstances in which the
amounts could differ. The amount of the discharge payment and the fixed
monetary penalty and any subsequent early payment discount will be set
out in the order made under part 3. As I said before, such orders will
be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so Parliament will
have the ultimate say in deciding
that.</div><a name="08061815000382"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000510"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> May I take it that the Minister is saying that it
is the intention of the Government, when presenting such an order, to
ensure that no such penalty&#151;from making a representation or
seeking an objection&#151;will be unintentionally permitted through
any order? Do the Government intend to ensure that someone in the
circumstances that I have described in my amendment would not be
penalised?</div>
<a name="08061815000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000511"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I think that the situation is certainly covered.
I hesitate to say that it is covered in every instance. The discharge
payment and the early payment discount, as set out in clause 52(1),
could be set at the same level and that would be determined when the
order comes forward. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is necessary, but I hesitate slightly in saying that that

Prisk:</b> That has been very helpful. The Minister has
married clause 52 together with clause 40. I was not clear that the two
welded together quite as neatly as he and his advisers were able to
adjudge. I am encouraged by the fact that it is clearly not the
Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>intention for someone to suffer such a penalty. I understand that one or
two areas may slip through. If it is going to be an order by positive
resolution to come before the House to ensure that such arrangements
are made in detail, that gives me due comfort. On that basis, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

serves a notice of intent on a person prior to imposing a fixed
monetary penalty, that person cannot be criminally prosecuted for the
same event to which the notice relates during the period within which
they can discharge their liability to the penalty. Similarly, a person
cannot be prosecuted for the same event if they discharge their
liability to the penalty or the regulator decides to go ahead and
impose it. That is down to familiar reasons of double jeopardy. Unpaid
monetary penalties will be forced through the civil courts. The Bill,
and clause 52 in particular, will ensure that regulators have access to
an efficient and streamlined procedure for recovering monetary
penalties.</div><a name="08061815000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000514"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in
clause 42, page 19, line 35, after
&#145;determine&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="08061822000014"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;subject to a maximum amount to be
prescribed by order by a Minister of the
Crown&#146;.</div><a name="08061815000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 42, ironically to clause 42, deals with discretionary requirements
and tries to put some form of cap, some maximum limit, on the amount of
fine. At the moment, the regulator can impose whatever fine it wishes.
There is no stated maximum in the Bill. Given that the regulator has
wide powers to investigate, effectively prosecute and be the jury, it
seems inappropriate to provide unlimited powers regarding the scale of
the fine. There needs to be some appropriateness, not least given the
principles that we are meant to be following in terms of Hampton and
Macrory. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to send
that signal. There is a need for the regulators to have a clearly
defined limit, but the amendment would allow the Minister to set that
limit, and do so by order. There is some flexibility; we have not
sought to put a figure on that limit. I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s response to the points that underscore the
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000515"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The amendment intends to impose a cap on
variable monetary penalties. We have a cap on fixed monetary penalties,
but that goes back to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>point made by the hon. Member for Solihull about the punishment fitting
the crime. The cap for fixed monetary penalties relates to the nature
of the offences; having a cap for variable penalties would be analogous
to capping Crown court fines. A cap on variable penalties, while
debated a lot in the other place, is different from a cap on more
minor, summary offences. We continue to believe that a cap for the most
serious offences would not be appropriate. I would be interested to
know what level the hon. Gentleman thought might be appropriate. Even
in the current regime, without the new powers, sanctions and fines that
run into millions of pounds have been imposed. I am not sure where such
a cap would be set in any meaningful
way.</div><a name="08061815000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is not just the level of the fine, but the kind of offence. The
hon. Member for Solihull is right that the level of penalty should be
related to the level of offence, rather than being a number that a
Minister may set down in an order. Regulators must be able to capture
any financial benefit gained from non-compliance. One of the weaknesses
of the current system is that sometimes fines imposed are small in
relation to the benefit that the offender has gained by committing the
offence. That was one of the recommendations in both Hampton and
Macrory. If a business knows that profit gained from committing the
offence will be removed, with the possibility of an additional penalty
on top, a potential incentive to try to break the law and get away with
it is removed. We fear that if a cap on the fine is set down, that
could deter compliance and militate against ensuring a level playing
field for compliant
businesses.</div><a name="08061815000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
making an order under part 3 of the Bill, the Minister may consider
whether a cap is necessary, but we do not think that there should be an
obligation on the Minister in every case, as I believe would be the
effect of the amendment. Setting a cap on the monetary penalties is not
simple, because it involves deep knowledge of the regulatory law, the
relevant market conditions and the amount of benefit that has accrued
to the offender through committing the offence, over what could be some
time. Professor Macrory ruled out a cap based on a business&#146;s
turnover, as he thought that that would pose undue legal complexity.
The regulator will be required by clause 62 to publish guidance,
setting out the criteria that it is likely to take into account when
setting the level of variable monetary penalties, so there will be some
transparency in the process, but the amendment proposes a mechanism
that would effectively cap variable monetary penalties in every
case.</div><a name="08061815000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000516"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> My hon. Friend referred to the Macrory report.
Does he agree that some of the fines that it quotes for health and
safety offences are absolutely shocking? Some businesses have benefited
10 times as much by non-compliance as they have ended up being fined.
Any cap on discretionary fines would not enable the necessary
discretion to charge a business a low fine where appropriate while
ensuring that an organisation doing something completely out of order
was not left in pocket as a result of
non-compliance.</div>
<a name="08061815000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000517"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is one danger of capping in every case. I
am not saying that a cap would never be appropriate in any
circumstances, but the amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>as I understand it would cap in every case. Making the punishment fit
the crime, or imposing a penalty appropriate to the gain accrued to a
business for its non-observation of the law, is an important and
relevant problem.</div>
<a name="08061815000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">A list of
possible criteria for the variable monetary penalties is set out in
page 38 of the guide to the Bill. They include the seriousness of the
non-compliance, the business&#146;s disciplinary record and whether
the business has taken any action to address the harm caused by
non-compliance, and they may differ from area to regulatory area. A
business will, of course, be able to raise objections to and make
representations about the level of penalty after the notice of intent
is issued and, again, will be able to appeal against the penalty if it
considers the amount unreasonable. If the tribunal agrees with the
appellant, it will have the power to withdraw or vary  the
penalty
imposed.</div><a name="08061815000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
sum up, requiring a cap on variable monetary penalties in every case
might mean that regulators were tempted back down the road of criminal
prosecution. There is no limit on Crown court fines, and many of the
offences that we are discussing would be triable in Crown court. We do
not want to create an incentive between the two regimes for regulators
to favour criminal prosecution in the Crown court, which has no cap, to
a system with a cap in every case. I understand the point made by the
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, but I hope that he will decide
on that basis not to pursue his
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000518"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It has been a helpful debate. As the Minister
rightly said&#151;I think that it is the most important point in the
Bill&#151;guidance has already been established. He explored several
instances, which I did not notice in reading the explanatory notes,
that set out the options available when considering a cap, and not only
the options available to Ministers. The Government, rightly, do not
reject the principle of a cap but rather recognise the dangers of
limitation. I fully
understand.</div><a name="08061815000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important, however, to bear in mind that the amendments are a
symptom of a wider concern. The nature of the system is such that
someone whose guilt must be proved against them does not have the
option of putting their case before an ordinary court of law, so one
wants to make sure that the Government are aware of the dangers in the
other parts of the system, hence the amendment and some of the previous
amendments.</div><a name="08061815000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
purpose in tabling the amendment was to establish exactly what the
Government&#146;s view of the caps was. They clearly accept the need
for caps in certain cases, and I agree, but on balance, I think that
the Minister is probably correct to say that it would be a mistake to
write a statutory, narrow and strict requirement into the Bill. That is
a perfectly reasonable argument. It has been a useful debate, and on
that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061815000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000519"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is important. We covered some of the
ground during debate on amendment No. 42, but clauses 40 and
49 are about fixed monetary penalties. This clause is about
discretionary requirements, and, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>again, expands the suite of options available to regulators in trying to
ensure compliance with the law. Subsection (2) requires the regulator
to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a person has committed the
relevant offence before imposing a discretionary requirement. The
discretionary requirements themselves are set out in subsection (3) and
include variable monetary penalties, which we have just discussed;
compliance notices, which are notices requiring a business to take
steps within a time period as may be specified to ensure that the
instance of non-compliance does not continue or recur; and restoration
notices, which are notices requiring a business to take steps as far as
possible to restore the position to what it would have been had the
non-compliance not taken place.</div>
<a name="08061815000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of us,
when we talk to local enforcement officers, will recognise this and see
the sense behind it. Most enforcement officers I have talked to do not
want to go around fining everybody and taking everybody to court and
issuing penalties right, left and centre. What they most want to do is
ensure compliance, and sometimes that just means restoring the position
to what it would have been had the non-compliance not taken
place.</div><a name="08061815000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discretionary
requirements are aimed at addressing offences where a greater degree of
flexibility may be required in order to sanction the offence
appropriately. This may be more suitable in more complex cases of
non-compliance, where there are a number of different effects and
consequences that need addressing. For example, if a business has
spilled toxic waste or chemicals on parkland, a regulator might want to
impose not just a fine, but a restoration notice to order the business
to restore the position to what it would have been had that offence not
occurred. The regulator may also want to impose a compliance notice to
make sure that a business takes steps to ensure that the offence does
not continue or reoccur. If the business has clearly gained a benefit
from failing to comply with regulations, the regulator may in addition
want to impose a variable monetary penalty. In the public interest,
this gives regulators a greater variety of options to ensure not just
that monetary penalties are imposed, but that action is taken to
rectify the initial breach of the
law.</div><a name="08061815000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) prohibits a regulator from imposing a discretionary requirement
upon a person on more than one occasion in relation to the same act or
omission, and subsection (6) goes back to our discussion about summary
only offences, which are capped, and the maximum fine available to the
magistrates court is usually
&#163;5,000.</div><a name="08061815000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discretionary
requirements will allow regulators to deal with instances of
non-compliance in a more proportionate and targeted way, and the clause
is very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>important in carrying forward the recommendations made by Professor
Macrory for more flexibility and proportionality in the
system.</div><a name="08061815000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061815000520"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause ensures that where a business is
required to pay a variable monetary penalty, whether alone or in
combination with non-monetary discretionary requirements or
undertakings, the order made by the Minister must secure that the
person may not be prosecuted at a later date for the same incident of
regulatory non-compliance. This, again, is because of the principle of
freedom from double jeopardy. Variable monetary penalties will be
enforced through the civil courts. The Bill, particularly clause 52, to
which I referred a little while ago, will ensure that regulators have
access to an efficient and streamlined procedure for recovering
monetary
penalties.</div><a name="08061815000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw attention to clause 44(3), by virtue of which the restriction does
not apply where a non-monetary discretionary requirement is imposed or
an undertaking is accepted without the imposition of a variable
monetary penalty. In such cases, where the business fails to comply
with the sanction&#151;we talked about a business that might have
spilt chemicals on parkland and so on&#151;it may be prosecuted at a
later date for the original offence. The nature of non-monetary
requirements is not as punitive, and therefore we believe that it is
fair to allow regulators to pursue a prosecution in such cases, where a
business fails to comply with the original requirement to restore the
situation. Subsection (4) allows for the period within which criminal
prosecutions may be instituted to be
extended.</div><a name="08061815000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
