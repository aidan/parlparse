                  </span> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Gale. When I was speaking earlier, I was asking a
few questions of the Minister. I will briefly refresh his memory with a
quick run-through of those questions. When we were last talking, I
could not bring to hand the National Health Service Act 2006, which is
relevant to the clause, but I now have
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause effectively compels foundation trusts seeking to merge to apply
to and alert the regulator. My first question was: which regulator? As
we learned on Tuesday, there are to be several regulators, or arms of
regulators, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 526<a class="bkMark" name="Column526">&#160;</a>
                  </div>involved in mergers: the Office of Fair Trading, Monitor and Monitor
through or with the Co-operation and Competition Panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The relevant
section in the 2006 Act is section 56, “Mergers”, which
says simply:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“An

               <p class="hs_brev">(b)

regulator”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000802">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
which regulator? Will the Minister clarify how it will be
distinguished?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When the
Minister spoke to us on Tuesday, there was some confusion. He suggested
that it was on our part, but I suggest that it was not entirely clear
what he was saying about who will do what. I will not quote him at
length, but the key question is this: is it the case that the OFT will
be responsible for considering only mergers between a foundation trust
and a foundation trust, and/or where the turnover of one or both of the
trusts is above the £70 million threshold?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will Monitor
consider mergers between foundation trusts and non-foundation NHS
trusts? I think that that was what the Minister implied on Tuesday, and
the CCP thinks that that is the case. If so, what will happen to the
£70 million threshold where a non-foundation trust and a
foundation trust merge? Will it disapply at that point? If so, where
does it say so in the Bill? That is not clear to me at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
third question concerned expertise; I was only halfway through it when
we broke. Does the OFT have the expertise to engage in such analysis?
The key point is that the Minister said on Tuesday that the OFT has
discretion not to refer where patient benefit outweighs the adverse
effects on competition. Patient benefit includes patient choice,
innovation and high-quality service provision. What expertise does the
OFT have in respect of health care? As the hon. Member for Southport
pointed out, if one rings the OFT and asks to be put through to its
health division, one will be told that it does not have one. I
therefore contend that its evident expertise in health care is
extremely limited, to say the least.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
point that I wish to make about expertise concerns Monitor and the
Co-operation and Competition Panel. On Tuesday, the Minister said that
it might be suggested that Monitor could consider all
mergers—NHS and private. However, there are several
complications with that approach, not least that mergers is a
specialist area. I agree that the Office of Fair Trading is the expert
in respect of mergers in a commercial setting.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
went on to say that with the lower number of mergers that will be
caught under the higher £70 million threshold—it is not
clear whether that applies to NHS trusts as well as foundation
trusts—Monitor would struggle to build up the expertise to
consider those appropriately. I thought that that seemed an odd thing
to say given that Monitor is ostensibly the sector-specific expert and,
as we have now learned, it will be operating through the
CCP.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
spoke to people at the CCP and was told that the CCP has so far dealt
with 160 mergers. When I said to the Minister on Tuesday that the CCP
principally dealt with mergers, he said that it does lots of other
things apart from mergers. There are some other things that it does,
but so far—and this is its information—it has dealt with
160 merger cases, five to 10 conduct cases, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 527<a class="bkMark" name="Column527">&#160;</a>
                  </div>around five procurement disputes and two market studies. Therefore, it
has dealt with 160 merger cases compared with about 20 other things. I
will come back to the question on market studies in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Surely
the Minister will concede that if Monitor is going to operate through
the CCP, there can be no question of its not having expertise to deal
with mergers, because the CCP has dealt with 160 of them. What is this
issue about its not having sufficient expertise? Crucially, the
question of cost then raises its head. If the CCP has successfully
dealt with 160 merger cases in its short period of office, at a cost of
£2.8 million per annum, can it really be necessary to create
Monitor, which apparently will not have the expertise to deal with
mergers, at a cost of £130 million per annum?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It would be
simple if we just used the expertise of the CCP. We could even put it
on a statutory footing. Apparently, the fact that it is not on a
statutory footing is a problem because there is a danger that its words
will not be heeded when it protests about the conditions of a merger.
It is simple—put the CCP on a statutory footing and save
£127.5
million.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000080">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What is
equally unclear is how this body, which is evidently expert—it
has dealt with 160 mergers at a cost of just under £3 million
per year—will be configured now that it has to sit within
Monitor. If Monitor will be operating through it, what happens to the
way in which it is structured right now? At the moment, it has a panel
of very eminent and expert people, including Lord Carter of Coles,
Andrew Taylor, Guy Beringer QC, John Wooton, John Swift QC, Professor
Peter C Smith, one of the world’s leading health economists, and
Professor Dame Janet Husband. They are all eminent people who are
expert in health care and competition law.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Are all those
people being kept on in addition to the non-executive directors who
will sit at the top of Monitor? Are we going to have a set of
non-executive directors at the top, and then a separate panel of
non-executive 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 528<a class="bkMark" name="Column528">&#160;</a>
                  </div>directors advising an arm of Monitor—“the CCP
division”, or whatever it is going to be called—that will
apparently have around 15 staff and is the front end in dealing with
competition? It all seems a bit confused to me, so I would be grateful
if the Minister cleared up what will happen with respect to the panel
and how exactly the CCP will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
final point that I would like to raise about this merger clause is
about consultation, and the nature of the consultation that FTs will
have to engage in before they consider a merger. The clause completely
cuts from the 2006 Act subsections (5) to (10) of section 56, which is
entitled “Mergers”. Crucially, section 56(8)
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">“In
the course of the consultation the applicants must seek the views
of—</p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">(a)
any Patients’ Forum for an

               <p class="hs_brevIndent">(b)
the staff employed by the
applicants,</p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">(c)
individuals who live in any area specified in the proposed constitution

constituency,</p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">(d)

               <p>and
so on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is an
important clause, which essentially compels potential mergers, or
mergees, to consult with the wider constituency. I would be grateful if
the Minister pointed out where, under the new legislation, a similar
duty is placed on them, or whether that might be specified in the
licence conditions, as other things might be. Can he offer us a
guarantee that that consultation will be specified in the licence
conditions? I think that patients and the public around trusts that
might be merged or might take up FT status would be extremely keen to
hear that reassurance from the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000091">&#160;</a>

Thank you, Mr Gale; it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
for this last home stretch of our Committee deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To inform this
debate on clauses 165 and 166—and, I hope, to avoid the
confusion that exists around these issues—I would like to
clarify what we are proposing on three related issues. I mean, first,
the types of mergers that NHS trusts and foundation trusts will be able
to participate in; secondly, the requirements for NHS trusts and
foundation trusts to secure approval for such transactions; and,
thirdly, the arrangements for reviewing the potential impact on
competition of such transactions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I should say,
however, that so far much of this debate has centred on clause 71,
which we debated on Tuesday. Clause 71 was about mergers in relation to
activities. The clauses before us today are about organisational
mergers. They are distinct things, and the opportunity to explore
mergers around activities, which is what the Enterprise Act 2002
provides for, came when we were scrutinising clause 71. However, we
have already raised some of these issues in this stage, so I want to
ensure that there is clarity about both by the end of the scrutiny of
this set of clauses. There are clear distinctions, which is, I think,
why there is some confusion on the part of the hon. Member for
Pontypridd and some of his hon. Friends.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For context,
it is also important that this debate should recognise as a first-order
issue the legal difference between the status of NHS trusts and
foundation trusts. Unlike foundation trusts, NHS trusts remain
subject  to the Secretary of State’s powers of
direction. As a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 529<a class="bkMark" name="Column529">&#160;</a>
                  </div>consequence, all mergers involving NHS trusts, whether these are around
activities or organisational issues, continue to require the Secretary
of State’s approval. Autonomous, accountable foundation trusts,
however, would not be subject to the Secretary of State’s
direction, as established in legislation brought forward by the
previous Government in 2003, and then in 2006.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
hon. Members will forgive me if I refuse to take interventions at this
stage; I want to make sure that this is clearly on the record, so that
hon. Members have a chance to be clear about where this all takes
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The first
issue is about what types of mergers NHS trusts and foundation trusts
would be able to participate in. Legislation would permit
organisational mergers between foundation trusts, between NHS trusts,
and between foundation trusts and NHS trusts. An organisational merger
would involve both organisations ceasing to exist and a new one being
established by statutory order. Legislation would not permit an
organisational merger between an NHS trust or a foundation trust and a
private entity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000869">&#160;</a>
               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">An
acquisition by an NHS trust or foundation trust would be a different
form of transaction, where the acquiring trust would continue to exist.
The legislation would permit a foundation trust to acquire all or part
of another foundation trust or NHS trust, and will permit an NHS trust
to acquire all or part of another NHS trust. However, legislation would
not allow an NHS trust to acquire an NHS foundation trust, nor for
either an NHS or foundation trust to be acquired by a private
entity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Joint ventures
involving an NHS or foundation trust would be different again. These
transactions would involve the merger of activities between two or more
organisations—for example, providing pathology services, but the
organisations each continuing to exist separately.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will deal
with some of the hon. Gentleman’s other specific questions, then
come on to the second issue of approval requirements for mergers
involving NHS or foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the Co-operation and Competition Panel
continuing to review trust-to-trust and trust-FT mergers. The Secretary
of State, as I have said, will continue to have the ability to seek the
CCP’s advice on these specific mergers where it relates to an
NHS trust merging or a trust and an FT merging. The OFT will not review
mergers involving NHS trusts. As we discussed while debating clause 71
on Tuesday, the CCP will transfer to Monitor. My right hon. Friend the
other Minister set out last week the basis on which that would be given
effect in regulations and elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A question was
also asked about the expertise of the OFT—again, we debated that
at some length on Tuesday in clause 71. The OFT has experience and
expertise in regard to mergers and will always seek the views of
Monitor, and through it, the CCP, on FT-to-FT mergers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I move on to
the second area, the approval requirement for mergers involving NHS
trusts or foundation trusts. Any form of merger involving an NHS trust
would remain subject to the Secretary of State’s approval, as
now. That is not the case for foundation trusts, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 530<a class="bkMark" name="Column530">&#160;</a>
                  </div>clauses 165 and 166 apply to organisational mergers and acquisitions
where two whole trusts merge, or a trust acquires another
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 165
deals with a merger between a foundation trust and another foundation
trust or an NHS trust, and clause 166 deals with a foundation trust
acquisition of another foundation trust or an NHS trust. The current
wording of clause 165(2), which deals with mergers, and clause 166(2),
which deals with acquisitions, requires that foundation trusts obtain
the approval of the majority of their governors before a merger or
acquisition can take place. That is an important safeguard and
assurance for the local community, from which those governors come, and
an essential part of the increased accountability that the Government
want to see in this
model.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of our amendments 194 and 196 is to clarify that the
requirements for governor support apply only to foundation trusts. When
it comes to reviewing mergers involving NHS trusts and foundation
trusts—this is the third strand—as to their impact on
competition, we agree with the previous Government’s principles
and rules of co-operation and competition. Those require that mergers
involving NHS trusts or foundation trusts should be permitted
only<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“where
there remains sufficient choice and competition or where they are
otherwise in patients’ and taxpayers’
interests”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000805">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
was in the principles and rules for co-operation and competition that
were in place in March 2010; they have not changed since the election
one iota in that regard. That is consistent with the principles of the
UK’s general merger control regime, as set out in the
legislation introduced by the previous Government under the Enterprise
Act 2002, and is reflected in the approach to merger reviews currently
operated by the Co-operation and Competition Panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, there
is currently legal uncertainty as to when and where the 2002 Act would
apply to mergers of activities involving foundation trusts. As a
result, under the current arrangements for review of mergers involving
foundation trusts by the Co-operation and Competition Panel, there is
always potential risk of duplication or—worse
still—double jeopardy.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is why we
have proposed under clause 71 that mergers involving foundation trusts
should be referred to the OFT for review. That would establish a single
merger control regime for foundation trusts and reflect the models of
sector regulation and concurrency that the NHS Future Forum supported,
and it would minimise duplication of specialist skills and expertise by
doing so. We would always expect the OFT to take advice from Monitor
and secure objective evidence of the costs and benefits of proposed
mergers, including the likely impact on access to the quality of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For NHS
trusts, we do not face legal uncertainty, in so far as we would not
expect an NHS trust under the Secretary of State’s direction to
be subject to UK merger controls of activities merging under the 2002
Act. Given that, it would not be appropriate for mergers involving NHS
trusts to be referred to the OFT. In any event, we are committed to
supporting all NHS trusts to achieve foundation trust status, or become
part of a foundation trust in due course. However, during the
transition, we would still wish to consider the potential impact on
patients and patient choice, and competition

			Column number: 531<a class="bkMark" name="Column531">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of mergers involving NHS trusts, in line with the principles set out by
the previous Government, as I have just reported. That is why the
Secretary of State would retain the ability to request advice from
Monitor through the Co-operation and Competition Panel, as I have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000109">&#160;</a>

from a sedentary position that he was quoted out of context. I
challenge him to find the reference and look back at it, because I do
not think he was. That comment about Scotland, Wales and foreign
mergers was dropped out of a wide blue sky by the Minister, in the
midst of a discussion about clause 71. At the time it raised a question
in my mind: is it possible for a merger to take place between an NHS
trust or a foundation trust in England and one in Scotland or Wales? I
think that is wholly impossible, unless the Minister is rewriting the
rules of devolution as we go along, but if it is possible to do it,
that is news to us and we should be grateful if he enlightened
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000117">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A gaping hole
that I raised with the Minister during my last set of remarks was the
rationale for excising section 56(5) to (10) of the 2006 Act, which
relates to consultation. I think the Minister was trying to indicate
that the fact that more than half the governors of an FT would have to
agree to seek a merger made it okay. I agree that that is a good
provision, but I think he was implying that that was somehow sufficient
safeguard for the local populace, and I am not sure that that is
correct. Can he point to where else in the Bill it states, as it did in
legislation introduced by the previous Government, that when seeking to
merge trusts would need to go out to consultation with staff, the local
populace and the local authorities. That is a crucial question and I
should be grateful for an answer on that, as well as elucidation on the
possibility of mergers with bodies in Wales and
Scotland.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000120">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s confusion. On Tuesday we were dealing with mergers
of activities and the way they are regulated now and will be in future,
in relation to the Enterprise Act 2002. That was clear in the way I set
it out again today. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman found it so
surprising that clause 71, which is explicit about the application of
the Enterprise Act, would not therefore apply the thresholds, which I
shared and which he today has acknowledged are in that Act. He only
discovered that afterwards, not having done his homework
beforehand.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have set
out matters very clearly. I am still puzzled by the fact that on the
one hand the Opposition have deployed arguments that suggest they are
wholly opposed to the notion of concurrency and having a
sector-specific regulator, while on the other they seem to be in favour
of it. It is not clear whether they are for or against that, which is a
great pity for those outside the Committee who are trying to understand

to their feet if they wished to intervene, I would not normally expect
to call anyone from the Back Benches. It is up to the Minister to
decide to what extent he wishes to answer points that have been raised;
that is not the duty of the Chair to determine. Where the Minister
indicates that he would prefer not to give way, but is prepared to take
further interventions once he has sat down, that is a different matter.

it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000126">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The amendments would require an NHS trust to
obtain the Secretary of State’s support for an application
either to merge with or to be acquired by a foundation trust. The two
changes together would align the requirements for Secretary of State
approval for mergers and acquisitions in an organisational sense.
Achieving foundation trust status is a significant step for an NHS
trust: it moves from being subject to the Secretary of State’s
direction to being an operationally autonomous organisation that is
accountable to the patients and the community that it
serves.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Section
33(1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 requires an NHS trust to
obtain the support of the Secretary of State for an application to
Monitor to be authorised as a foundation trust. These two amendments
would extend the requirement for the Secretary of State’s
support to an application from an NHS trust to achieve foundation trust
status by merging with or being acquired by a foundation trust. That
would ensure that an NHS trust must have the Secretary of
State’s support for an application to Monitor in this
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
195 would therefore retain the current requirement under section 56 of
the 2006 Act for an NHS trust to obtain the support of the Secretary of
State in an application to merge with an FT. Clause 166 creates a new
specific power for a foundation trust to acquire another foundation
trust or an NHS trust. Amendment 196 would add to that by requiring
that where an NHS trust is to be acquired, the NHS trust must first
obtain the support of the Secretary of State in the same way as they
would for a merger. The amendments, therefore, bring the requirements
for the Secretary of State to support an NHS trust application to be
acquired by a foundation trust into line with requirements for the
Secretary of State to support an NHS trust in regard to
mergers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000132">&#160;</a>

                  </span> It is lovely
to see you again, Mr Gale. This group of clauses relates to what is at
the heart of the Bill: maximising competition. The Secretary of State
has said that he wants to maximise competition and create a health
system in which the number of purchasers and providers is maximised,
and in which a citizen-consumer competitive market drives forward the
forces of “creative destruction” in the NHS. Hon. Members
may remember that from earlier discussions and it does relate to the
different parts of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
can hear people ask, “Won’t constant entry and exit from
the market be prohibitively expensive? After all, you can’t just
set up a hospital at the drop of a hat.” That is true, unless
there is a system in which the barriers to market entry and exit are
low or non-existent, and that is what these clauses do. In effect, they
set up a new insolvency regime for foundation trusts. The Bill allows
FTs to fail and the clauses enable them to be bought out by new market
entrants. We are already seeing that. My hon. Friend the Member for St
Helens North (Mr Watts) has seen documents to that effect in relation
to Whiston hospital; there is also evidence from Trafford health care
trust as well. What about the patients in all this? The Bill pays scant
regard to patients. There are no protections for them, as we are seeing
with Southern Cross. The first duty of such companies is to maximise
the money that the company generates for their shareholders, as
enshrined in company law.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure that
the Government will say that I am scaremongering, but there are direct
parallels between the Bill’s effect—opening up the NHS to
wholesale competition, removing the private bed cap to generate income,
replacing the social purpose of NHS trusts with an economic focus and
allowing foundation NHS trusts to dispose of their assets as well as
raise loans—and the events at Southern Cross.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The conditions
that led to the failure of Southern Cross will be repeated under the
Bill. In effect, it allows foundation trusts to fail and private equity
companies to buy NHS facilities and equipment. That may not be confined
to foundation trusts. In an article in <em>Primary Care Today</em>, a law
firm questions what will happen to primary care estates. I urge the
Government to think again, and I appeal for the support of Members who
are concerned about the
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000136">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In some respects, this is another amendment that we
welcome. It clarifies that the Secretary of State must be consulted
before an NHS trust, not a foundation trust, is acquired or seeks to
make an acquisition. That was clear in the National Health Service Act
2006. It was also clear that the trust would have to consult its local
patients, local populace and local authority, but that is no longer
clear—it has been wiped from the Bill, unless I have misread it.
I have twice asked the Minister about that, and he has singularly
failed to comment, so I assume that I have not misread the Bill, the
Minister just does not want to talk about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000137">&#160;</a>

as “reverse takeovers”, which describes what happens when
a small company acquires a large company at a knock-down price. We all
know that is effectively a merger because, although it has been
acquired, the larger company effectively runs the smaller company. It
would be interesting to know whether there are any provisions in the
Bill that would stop an FT from acquiring part or all of Bupa or Assura
Medical, which is part of Virgin and is active in the consortium in the
Minister’s constituency, in what would effectively be a reverse
takeover.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000140">&#160;</a>

or a subsidiary of  a very large company, being taken over. Let
us say that a big pharmaceutical firm decides that one of its arms that
provides services to the NHS—an arm’s-length,
stand-alone, separately listed company—can be acquired by an FT.
What certainty can there be that that is not in effect a reverse
takeover, in which the larger parent company exercises some degree of
control over the public foundation
trust?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000143">&#160;</a>

mechanisms for allowing trusts to take over private businesses already
exist, so the Bill is redundant. In addition, we are ignoring the

it does not define whether the most prominent position in that
relationship would be occupied by the trust or by the other bodies,
other businesses or other enterprises.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000148">&#160;</a>

touch on the concept of Chinese walls within Monitor. As the

becomes more and more
labyrinthine—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> With respect,
the Minister, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, can read back over
his extraordinarily labyrinthine description of the architecture in
Tuesday’s Committee, including the stuff about Scotland, Wales
and overseas territories, which he has again failed to explain to us.
It is labyrinthine and confused, and I suspect that those in another
place will agree with me.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000150">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Given the
confusion, I would also like to address how on earth Monitor is going
to operate the Chinese walls that we have heard about. There will
apparently need to be Chinese walls between the parts of Monitor that
deal with competition, mergers and the regulation of the FTs. How on
earth can that occur within one building? Each aspect will undoubtedly
have a bearing on the others. The decision about whether an FT is
allowed to merge or acquire another company is clearly relevant to
competition and to regulation. All three are interlinked, and it is
extraordinary that we are asking Monitor to be poacher and
gamekeeper—regulator and preventer of anti-competitive
behaviour, or promoter of competition, depending on what time of the
year we are talking to the Government about it. That is an untidy and
unsatisfactory scenario. If the Minister could spell out
again—because he has failed to do so in the past—how the
Chinese walls will work in practice, we would be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000151">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth started the debate by
repeating a set of arguments that those who follow our proceedings will
have noted that she has turned to on several occasions. They are truly
fantastical. She wants people to accept a conspiracy theory about the
Government’s intentions. The idea that the plans drive at solely
competition, quite regardless of patients’ interests, is
manifest nonsense. The way that the clauses are now amended makes that
absolutely clear. Monitor’s role is not about promoting
competition; it is about protecting and promoting the interests of
patients and enabling integration.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the heart
of the reforms is the essential concept and belief that we want to
hardwire into the NHS: that no decision about a patient or carer should
be made without their involvement. That means in both how the NHS is
run and how an individual’s health care is provided. That is an
essential part of a modern, high-quality national health service. I
suggest that if the hon. Lady’s rhetoric is endorsed by her
colleagues, it would be fair to describe the Labour party as having
emerged from the general election and abandoned its manifesto
commitments to become anti-choice, pro-poor standards and in favour of
propping up failing organisations. One might reasonably draw that
characterisation from the gross distortions that have been cast on the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me deal with one or two of the issues raised by the hon. Member for
Pontypridd. First, foundation trusts do not have shares. They cannot be
traded on the stock market and, as a consequence of that, they cannot
be acquired. We have made it clear that they are public benefit
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000161">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That knowledge did not come across in the way the
hon. Gentleman made his arguments. To repeat: the Bill makes it clear
that the guiding principle of the legislation is that foundation trusts
continue to be public benefit organisations that are there to provide
services to the NHS. Along with their duties to have regard to the NHS
constitution, that is the ultimate safeguard. FTs cannot be taken over
by private entities. We have already discussed that at length, but I
want to make it clear again. FTs can, however, as they do under the
existing arrangements, have joint ventures. That was fine under the
previous Government and it is a good way for capacity to be extended
and for services to be
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth asked whether there could
be staff buy-outs of FTs. I undertook to write to her, but if I deal
with that question now, that might save the correspondence. The answer
is absolutely not. FTs have no equity, as I have just said, so they
cannot be bought or sold. We want to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 538<a class="bkMark" name="Column538">&#160;</a>
                  </div>encourage staff-led organisations. Indeed, the previous Government, of
whom she was not part, supported the idea of the right to request for
staff, and they provided public money to support NHS staff to acquire
and set up social enterprises. Many of them were trumpeted by the
Labour party when it was in government. we think that the idea of
social enterprise is of the time, and it is something that we want to
continue to
support.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for East Lothian asked about mergers between FTs and
Scottish and Welsh trusts. That probably strays back to clause 71, but
it is possible that an English NHS trust could combine
activities—I stress activities—with those of an NHS
organisation over the border in Wales or Scotland. It is not possible,
however, for the English NHS trust to merge with an organisation such
as a Scottish health board. I hope that finally puts that particular
concern to
rest.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000165">&#160;</a>

and we will continue to support it, and people will continue to trust
us to do so. Again, however, the Minister did not adequately answer the
questions about acquisition, nor did he address at all—for the
third time now—the question about
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000176">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As I have said, the previous Government first
created foundation trusts because they recognised that top-down
management of all NHS providers was never going to achieve the best
care for patients. Indeed, many speeches in which previous Government
Ministers say just that are littered across the past six years of
<em>Hansard</em>. Like them, we remain committed to supporting the
pipeline for all NHS trusts to become foundation trusts in their own
right, or part of one, so that all patients and staff can benefit from
providers that are autonomous and locally accountable. Foundation trust
status shows that a trust has demonstrated its clinical and financial
stability and
sustainability.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
approach of setting a clear deadline for the repeal of the NHS trust
legislation has already had  an impact in countering the
relative inertia that existed under the previous Government. That
deadline has 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 540<a class="bkMark" name="Column540">&#160;</a>
                  </div>been a key determinant in the change in mindset needed to support all
NHS trusts in achieving foundation trust status. We have backed up the
deadline with local focus and national co-ordination and support, and
are looking at areas where specific help might be needed. We have
already seen a change in the mindset, and most NHS trusts have agreed
good plans for achieving foundation trust status. We must ensure that
that momentum is not
lost.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have listened, however, and have heard the concern that quality and
patient care could be damaged if NHS trusts are pushed to apply for FT
status before they are ready. We discussed that concern only this
morning. We can see that some NHS trusts may benefit from more time,
rather than a change in plan or management. We acknowledge that the
challenges of transition to an all foundation trust sector will be
considerable, but just as it would be wrong to move too quickly it
would not be in the interests of patients or the public to abandon the
goal
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Together,
the amendments remove the 2014 deadline from the Bill, as well as the
related reserve power for the Secretary of State to change the date and
the current commencement provisions; they do not change the proposal to
repeal NHS trust legislation, or Monitor’s authorisation powers.
It remains the case that it will no longer be an option to stay as an
NHS trust. We continue to expect the vast majority of remaining NHS
providers to meet the high standards needed to become foundation trusts
by 2014 and for them to benefit from the freedom that foundation trust
status brings. To do this, we recognise that some NHS trusts may need
to come together, merge with existing foundation trusts, or enter into
franchise arrangements. However, if a small number of NHS trusts cannot
meet Monitor’s test we will not arbitrarily abolish them in
their current legal form in 2014. All NHS trusts are expected to become
foundation trusts as soon as clinically feasible, with an agreed
deadline for every trust.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NHS trusts
applying for foundation trust status will continue to be subject to
stringent tests set by Monitor and there will be no lowering of the
bar. In order to succeed, applicants will need to have strong boards
and be financially and clinically robust. We are all agreed that it is
in neither the patient nor public interest for organisations that
provide poor care or are not well run to become foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000190">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I think we could call this the “shambles
clause”—or the “shambles
amendment”—because it is one of the clauses in the Bill
that shows very clearly what an utter mess the Government have made of
this legislation. It is an absolute, complete and utter shambles. Only
a couple of months ago they were proposing to set the hard date of 1
April 2014. That was going to be the point at which trust status would
fall, with everybody ready to be a foundation trust by then. We said at
the time that that was a very bold and foolhardy commitment from the
Government and so it is proven, because they have had to remove it from
the Bill. In excising subsection (3) from clause
176—the date, 1 April 2014—they are clearly acknowledging
that trusts will not be ready. In particular, the 20 trusts that we
understand are in financial difficulty will not be ready to move to
foundation trust status. This shambles is important because the
Government, in creating an unholy mess and such chaos in the NHS, have
made it far harder for those 20 trusts, and for other trusts that are
not foundation trusts, to get ready to take on foundation trust
status.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000195">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is absolutely not true to say that the previous Government did not push
as hard as they could to get the trusts ready to adopt foundation trust
status, if they so chose. The uncertainty that this Government have
sown with the Bill—on top of the stringent, unprecedented
savings that both this Government and the previous Government asked the
NHS to make over the comprehensive spending review period—makes
taking on that status far harder. The chaos makes it much more
difficult to imagine that those trusts will be ready, which is why the
Government have had to change the clause; it is their acknowledgement
that it is extremely unlikely that all those trusts will be ready to
assume foundation trust status. In proposing the amendment, the
Government recognise that they are making a mess of the NHS, and they
should be decent enough to say so
explicitly.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000196">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I may be in a minority of one, but
I was never seriously convinced that turning every NHS trust into a
foundation trust was a good idea. I was never convinced, actually, that
foundation trusts were a good idea, which is why I voted against them
and why I am relatively unrepentant now. They offer strong autonomy to
the organisation with a very weak model of accountability, but this
afternoon, the Government have strengthened that
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The advantages
that I can see of foundation trusts are primarily that they put behind
us the sad history of brokerage in the NHS, whereby inefficient
hospitals are bailed out by a bond from a strategic health authority at
the end of the financial year, and certain financial freedoms are
offered. I will not rehearse those arguments, but I want to make the
point that the hon. Member for Pontypridd has said that it will be very
difficult for the Government to stick to their original remit of trusts
becoming foundation trusts by a particular date, which 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 542<a class="bkMark" name="Column542">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is entirely true. I do not want to pre-empt my Adjournment debate next
week, but one reason why that is true—and this was stated by the
hon. Gentleman—is that the previous Government insisted on a
£20 billion efficiency target. That is one express reason why
the deadline would be tight.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What the hon.
Gentleman has not said, and our views may differ on this, is whether he
thinks it is a wholly good idea for all trusts to become foundation
trusts. Although I assume that that is Labour Members’ point of
view, it is not mine, and it is clearly not the Government’s, so
we have that in common.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000199">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to echo some thoughts of my hon. Friend the
Member for Pontypridd. This group of amendments distinctly reveals the
shambles of a Bill—not this re-committed Bill—that was
introduced a few months ago. The deadlines that were laid down were
impractical. The fact that the Minister says that he has been listening
makes me wonder why the Government did not listen before.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsection (4)
of clause 176 gives the Secretary of State the power to bring in an
order to use a date beyond what was originally laid in the Bill, which
prompts the question of why it was not just left out. Perhaps the
Minister did not want to propose an order with, potentially, dozens of
hospitals included that could not make the deadline, and therefore, the
Government did not want to expose problems in the original Bill by
getting rid of the deadline altogether. That is no way to
legislate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is clear in
everybody’s mind that the original Bill—now
re-committed—was more driven by ideology than common sense, and
the clause and amendments show exactly that. What faith can people have
in the Bill? In particular, there are areas that lie dormant,
unamended, which we have asked questions about in the re-committed Bill
proceedings. I hope, given the tight time scale—which was not
altered—we have been given to scrutinise the rest of the Bill,
that if changes cannot happen on the Floor of the House, they happen in
another place. Somebody needs to pick up on the defects in the Bill,
because some remain, in my view. It would be wrong to let this clause
go, and particularly these amendments, which show what hasty
legislation this is, and how different it is to what was said in
manifestos, or even coalition agreements. That just shows how bad it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Here we are,
with only a few minutes and hours left, looking at a Bill that has all
these other amendments. It is wholly unsatisfactory, Mr Gale. I know it
is not your problem, but as a legislator, I think it is wholly
unsatisfactory that an institution like the NHS has been thrown to the
wolves. We have had competition clauses and everything else thrown into
this Bill; and here we see people who cannot and dare not even keep the
legislation as it was, because it would expose what a tight and
unrealistic timetable the original Bill gave
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000203">&#160;</a>

several times during our consideration of the Bill. Can he or any other
Opposition Member name a single non-hybrid Bill introduced between 1997

I can tell them the answer: none. We have had 40 sittings, 28 in the

which is undermining our greatly loved national health service? In
those circumstances, the amount of scrutiny that we have been allowed
to give it is pathetic. Yes, we are against this Bill, but we also want
to scrutinise and improve it, as we have done, and we have been
entirely honest with him: we voted against it on Second Reading and we

I am struggling to perceive the coherence in what the Opposition are
doing. The hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury said earlier in
the Committee’s proceedings that she was actively trying to put
in, as one my colleagues described, wrecking clauses. Now we are
hearing complaints about not making quick enough progress. That does
not add up. The hon. Member for Pontypridd has, quite rightly, been
advocating in favour of patient choice, but in our previous
proceedings, the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury
questioned the basis of patient choice, which her party’s
Government introduced. Does the Minister not agree that that is
incredibly intellectually incoherent, and it is difficult for us to
follow where the Opposition are coming
from?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000219">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
tabled the amendment in response to concerns raised about strengthening
the status and influence of HealthWatch England. The views of patients
and other service users should be, as I said earlier, central to the
role of the Care Quality Commission in regulating health and social
care services, and informing the action that the CQC takes in
circumstances where services do not meet essential levels of safety and
quality. The Bill establishes HealthWatch England as a committee of the
CQC, and with that purpose in mind, we want to go further in clarifying
its role. The CQC’s new HealthWatch England committee will place
the views and experiences of patients and other service users at the
heart of the regulator. It will provide a direct channel for the
concerns of patients and other service users to the regulator, and
HealthWatch England’s committee will therefore provide the CQC
with advice and information that it needs to take action where the
views of patients and other service users highlight substandard service
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000226">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">New section 45A
of the Health and Social Care Act 2008, as inserted by
clause 178, sets out the functions to be exercised by HealthWatch
England operating as a committee of the CQC. They include giving
information and advice to a range of persons, including the CQC, on the
views of patients, other service users, the public and local
healthwatches. Most of those persons are required, by new section
45A(5), to provide HealthWatch England with a written response to such
advice. Currently, however, the CQC is not. The amendment creates that
duty for the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me deal directly with the criticism that I am sure will be made: that
the amendment is identical to one moved by the Opposition, in
particular the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury, who made
some of these points in the Committee before. I freely acknowledge that
that is the case. What we have here is an excellent example of what our
decision to pause, listen and reflect was all about, and how it enables
us to improve the Bill—a tendency that, I have to say, I never
saw Labour exhibit during my time in opposition and that party’s
in government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s original thinking was that it would have been
unusual and unnecessary to require the CQC to make formal written
responses to one of its own statutory committees; moreover, we wanted
to avoid creating the perception that there was a highly formal
relationship between the CQC and HealthWatch England. We believe a
clear distinction between the two bodies is needed, and we want and
expect communications to be formal but also collaborative, with a
continual two-way flow of information between them. Those views have
not changed: we still need a collegial approach, as well as one that is
formalised by such reporting requirements. However, we have listened,
heeded and reflected upon the points that have been made, both in this
Committee and since. As the NHS Future Forum put it in its remarks on
HealthWatch
England,<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Although
it is technically part of CQC, it needs to be allowed the independence
to discharge its functions
freely.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000807">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Government unreservedly agree with that view and we believe the
arrangements set out in the Bill will achieve that. Nevertheless, we
heard the point about changing the basis on which it should operate.
That is why we have tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000230">&#160;</a>

re-committed Bill Committee that the cost of new Monitor, which is
currently £20 million a year, will increase to between
£50 million and £80 million a year, so Monitor
will get each year an additional sum of between £30 million and
£60 million. The impact assessment for the original
Bill—nothing in the amendments would change
the core functions of HealthWatch
England—states that HealthWatch England will receive £3.5
million a year. HealthWatch England, the new, supposedly powerful voice
will get three and a half million quid to do its job, whereas Monitor
gets up to £60 million extra resources a year to do the job. As
Bernstein and Woodward said, “Follow the money”. We have

third point is a question for the Minister and a practical and
constructive suggestion of help for the Government. I may have got this
wrong; if I have, I hope I will be forgiven. As I understand it, both
HealthWatch England and local healthwatch will come into being by
October 2012. The National Association of LINks Members submitted
evidence to the Committee on 2 July
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“HealthWatch
England is to be established at the same time as Local HealthWatch.
This makes no sense. It is needed in October 2011 to pave the way, in
collaboration with LINks, the NHS and local authorities for local
Healthwatch which start in October
2012.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000810">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Will
the Minister consider bringing forward the timetable for HealthWatch
England’s establishment, so it can be there to get things going?
Will he also explain why the Government have had so little ambition
about putting patients and the public at the heart of the NHS? Will he
give serious consideration to giving HealthWatch England a stronger
voice and greater independence, so it can do what it says on the
tin?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000251">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Fundamentally, HealthWatch England is a good
idea and welcome, because it will provide patients with a greater
opportunity for engagement. The real issue is that to be truly
effective HealthWatch England must be an entirely independent advisory
body, but in its current conceptual form, it is not quite there yet.
The Government have missed an opportunity to act upon their own
listening exercise and the Future Forum recommendations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Nothing is
more evident of that than the fact that HealthWatch England will still
sit entirely within  the CQC. In the Government’s new
architecture for  the NHS, there will be three big players: the
NHS commissioning board, run by Sir David Nicholson; the CQC, which
will ensure that basic standards of care are met, run by Cynthia Bower;
and Monitor, which will promote competition as a means of improving
quality, as the Government claim, run by David Bennett—for now,
apparently. However, there will be a fourth crucial 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 548<a class="bkMark" name="Column548">&#160;</a>
                  </div>arm, which is a much stronger voice for patients and
the public. I do not agree with the Government’s approach. I
firmly believe that, if patients and the public are to have a far
greater say, the body to achieve that should be more important than the
other three bodies. HealthWatch England should be
independent.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">HealthWatch
England will lack independence because it will sit within the CQC,
which creates two problems. It will have to work closely with the CQC,
as it will with the other bodies, including the NHS commissioning
board, so that it can ensure that information is passed up through the
CQC to allow it to conduct inspections and investigations. However,
what if HealthWatch England thought that the CQC had failed to do its
job or work as effectively as it
should?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other problem is resources. By the end of 2012, the CQC has to register
30,000 new providers, including 9,000 providers of primary medical
services, which have never before been registered, and 12,500 new
providers of social care. In addition to those providers, the CQC also
has to inspect and register individual sites, which, as the hon. Member
for Stourbridge mentioned, is a huge task. The Ministers know about
those concerns, which are being looked into, but the CQC’s
resources are, like those of other arm’s-length bodies, being
reduced, despite its huge tasks, and there is a real concern that
HealthWatch England might not receive sufficient resources. My
colleagues and I will be grateful if the Minister guarantees a
ring-fenced
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How
can HealthWatch act as the Minister envisages when it is situated
within the CQC? How can it function independently when it will
effectively be line managed by the CQC and, simultaneously, its chair
will be line managed by the Secretary of State? The chair of
HealthWatch England might have been appointed by the Appointments
Commission, as mentioned in the original Committee by my hon. Friend
the Member for Leicester West, but that is no longer possible because
the Government have abolished the Appointments Commission, too. I
cannot see how HealthWatch can behave freely, independently or robustly
enough to hold its line manger, the CQC, to account. Is not the real
danger that HealthWatch will be created with all the negative aspects
of a quango, but without any of the benefits of being an independent
body?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government had not acted to fulfil their promises to the Future Forum
until Monday, when, fortunately,  a few new amendments were
tabled. Having looked at the their promises to the Future Forum, we
expected  the Government to introduce an explicit requirement
that local healthwatch memberships be representative of different
users, including carers. Fortunately that has now been done. The
Government also agreed to introduce a new duty on health and well-being
boards to involve users and the public, but, until Monday, that had not
been done. My colleagues and I are predisposed, both politically and on
an everyday level, to optimism, so I endeavour to be as positive as

sympathise with the point the Opposition are trying to make on behalf

HealthWatch England is able to have its own distinct identity within
the CQC. However, the amendment could work against the building of
effective working relationships between HealthWatch England and the
CQC. Staff working for the committee and the wider commission should be
having an open and ongoing dialogue about their work. Formalising that
as the amendment proposes would give the impression that communication
between the committee, with its independent role, and the CQC should be
conducted by means of correspondence rather than open and ongoing
dialogue. For that reason, we do not support that approach to
prescribing the nature of that
relationship.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health

concerns? Does the Minister feel that HealthWatch’s impact will

input? What will the general structure be? Will there be different
structures at local level, or similar structures? Will those local

the lack of a voice for children and young people in the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although it is
to be an arm of the Care Quality Commission, HealthWatch will need to
be equipped with the freedom it needs to perform its functions
effectively. In that, I am in agreement with the Future Forum. I am
concerned about the degree of freedom afforded to HealthWatch England
by the Bill. The Patients Association has highlighted that concern in
its written evidence, stating that<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000271">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
Minister needs to act to defuse that potential conflict. What can he
say to the Committee to allay those concerns? It is vital, as the
Future Forum and Patients Association have highlighted, that
HealthWatch’s independence is guaranteed. I welcome, as
everybody would, greater accountability and public participation in the
national health service, but if the Minister fails to address these
concerns and if HealthWatch England is kept on the CQC’s leash,
it will lack the necessary bite to discharge its functions
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000272">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A
voice for children and young people is vital. The NHS Future Forum was
clear in its prescription for representation of children and young
people, but the Bill makes no reference to that group in relation to
either HealthWatch England or local healthwatch. The Royal College of
Paediatrics and Child Health has rightly argued that the reforms have
been lacking in providing the structures and frameworks for young
people and children to be properly represented. That group must be
given a voice. They are too often ignored or disregarded by this
Government. How will their views be represented on HealthWatch England

representative of different users. The Government have tabled several
welcome amendments, as I have already said, but there is still too
little mention of children and young people in the Bill and the
Government’s changes. Will the Minister respond to my concerns
and those of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the
National Children’s Bureau? What are the Government doing to
ensure that children and young people will be properly represented on
HealthWatch?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000274">&#160;</a>

First, I apologise for my absence. I wanted to take part in the debate
on the closure of coastguard stations. Secondly, I will also be
referring to notes that I prepared myself, but I will have to hold them
close by, because I left my glasses in the room after a previous
sitting of the Committee. I returned last night to try to find them,
but they were not here. However, I am now a member of the all-party
group on Kashmir, and I had my photo taken and made a short speech.

opportunities.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
suppose that, given the hasty arrangements of this partnership, we
should have expected shotgun legislation, and, with reference to clause
178, its legitimacy is not improved. Government Members have accused us
of scaremongering, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon
Hull East said, concerns are not just coming from Opposition Members;
they are also coming from patients and patient organisations. The
Government need to listen. However, I welcome the fact that the
Government are so enthusiastic about equality duties that they are now
part of HealthWatch England’s
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
is an opportunity to create a strong voice for patients, but if it is
to live up to its objective it must have clarity in its purpose and
operation. I am afraid that, as far as patients are concerned, that
clarity is not there at this stage. Goodness knows the Bill in its
entirety has created enough confusion. Patients need to know where to
go when they have a complaint or when they want to influence the shape
of services. If they are to meet these objectives it must be clear how
HealthWatch England and local healthwatch organisations will be
accessible, user friendly, inclusive, properly resourced, independent
and
autonomous.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000278">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
on accessibility, the Department of Health has already said that there
will not be a budget for advertising to tell patients how all this fits
together and where they can go to make their voices heard. I hope that
the Minister will reassure us as to how patients and carers will become
aware of HealthWatch’s duties and how they will be able to
contact
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000279">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Regarding
the user friendly and inclusive aspect, my hon. Friend has already
mentioned how important it is that the voices of children and young
people are heard. I hope that the Minister will tell us how that will
be realised by the clause. Also, what advocacy will be provided for
people with learning disabilities, those possibly unable to speak for
themselves, so that their views and input can be heard and
valued?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000280">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
terms of independence and autonomy, it is important that HealthWatch is
seen not just as part of the Care Quality Commission, but as an
independent body with a clear and distinct role. Looking at local
organisations and funding by local authorities, how can we be confident
of their autonomy and independence from the people who fund them when
those people also commission and deliver services that the local
healthwatch organisations 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 552<a class="bkMark" name="Column552">&#160;</a>
                  </div>may have responsibility for feeding back on? The Government must respond
to these legitimate concerns and clarify the relationships. When an NHS
or social care service crosses local authority boundaries, where will
local healthwatch organisations feed in those views? How will the
weight be divvied up—I hope that that is not just a Scottish
expression—between the
two?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000281">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
terms of funding, at a time when local authorities are under such
pressure, how can we be sure that the necessary money will be available
to give bodies the independence and resources they need? I seek
reassurance on those points and look forward to hearing the
Minister’s response, because this is an opportunity to ensure
that patients genuinely have a say, but the Government must be much
clearer about what they want to achieve with the clause. They must tell
us how they will provide the support and training so that this is not
just about tokenism. When views from HealthWatch on how it feels about
the service are put to the various bodies—the Secretary of
State, Monitor—that individual or body must not simply have a
duty to record receipt. Their response and the action that follows
complaints must also be in the public
domain.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000282">&#160;</a>

                  </span> It is a pleasure to speak
under your chairmanship, Mr Gale. I will speak briefly because I was
not going to speak on these clauses. However, as the Minister knows,
the issue of patient and particularly public involvement has always
been very close to my heart and I have mentioned my thoughts in this
area to him many times. The comments from the hon. Members for
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and for Kingston upon Hull East
prompted some thoughts, so there are some things that I want to put to
the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland talked about
three main bodies in the NHS: the commissioning board, the CQC and
Monitor. He also talked about the importance of patient and public
involvement, and I agree with him. The tragedy of this Committee is
that we have spent so long talking about bodies that are irrelevant to
patients and the public. When people go to their GP or hospital for
treatment, they are not necessarily worrying about competition, patient
caps, tariffs and everything else. What they want is good
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000284">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for East Lothian is absolutely right. If someone is unhappy
about treatment, they want somewhere to go and complain or express
thoughts. If someone suffers from a long-term condition—hon.
Members will know I have spoken about mental health issues a number of
times—they want somewhere to go and put thoughts about treatment
and care pathways, and be heard. That is why these clauses dealing with
HealthWatch England, local healthwatch and the health and well-being
boards are so important. It is a shame that, because of everything else
we have discussed for so many sittings, we are only now getting to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000285">&#160;</a>

frustrations of the Bill has been all the discussion here and outside.
I hesitate to use the word scaremongering, but it is true about the way
it is to be worked out. We are forgetting the patient and public
involvement. The hon. Lady may well be right about parliamentary
procedure, but there is no doubt that hon. Members, particularly
Opposition ones, have spent a lot of time talking. There is no reason
why, if we had got through clauses earlier, we could not have rushed on
to talk about these sooner.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000287">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but I will take
the Chair’s ruling. There are three points I want to make.
First, the hon. Member for East Lothian mentioned local healthwatch. My
understanding is that local healthwatch will play just as critical a
part as HealthWatch England in raising patients’ concerns. We
should not forget that it will take quite a lot of the
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
CQC will have to respond formally in writing to advice it gets from
HealthWatch England. Ministers will have heard earlier of concerns from
all parties about the burden on the CQC and the way it exercises its
powers. It is a good thing. I echo the hon. Member for Leicester West
in saying that HealthWatch England must be independent of the CQC. I
think the Minister has already said that, and I invite him to put that
on record.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A more
important point—not just in the Bill but across
Government—is that for a lot of these bodies it is about having
the right people and the right ears listening. We can talk about money
and budgets. We as Members of Parliament do not get advertising
budgets, but people know where to come and find
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                  </strong> Well, perhaps the hon. Lady has had more success
with IPSA than I have had. If the right people are in position doing
the right job and are the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 554<a class="bkMark" name="Column554">&#160;</a>
                  </div>right advocates, there is a lot that can be done in telling the public
how to come and describe the treatment they have had. We should worry
less about process and the way that Committees are constituted. We
should get the right people in, because they have the right ears for
hearing about cases of bad treatment, or listening to people with
long-term conditions making it clear how care pathways can be
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000296">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have had a good and thorough debate, and while
perhaps the tone has not suggested it, there is a good deal of
consensus across the Committee about the importance of this particular
clause and amendments. There is a shared purpose, it seems, about how
we can strengthen patient involvement in the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, I
detect a slight contradiction in some of the arguments, in that again
we seemed to be condemned when we do listen and condemned when we do
not. I suppose the luxury of opposition is to be able to condemn both.
It certainly seems to have been the substance of these particular
points. In passing, I want to pick up on the comments by hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull East about involving young people. I very much
agree with him and I want to say what we are doing on that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000298">&#160;</a>

Government did, and I would not disown any of it, but the Minister
would accept that we were always determined to do more. More could be
done to put patients at the heart of the NHS, and we have tried to be
constructive in suggesting to the Minister that the Bill is not
ambitious enough and will not achieve
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000311">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will take from that that the hon. Lady accepts
that it was unfinished business, and we know it was unfinished, not
least because during those 13 years we saw the abolition of community
health councils, which were replaced with patients forums, the
establishment of a Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in
Health—which I believe was largely loathed by local patient
organisations—and the final iteration, or attempt, to get this
right under Labour: the introduction of local involvement networks.
When we talk about a shambles, that epithet might apply to the
endeavours of the previous Administration in this
area.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000312">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the hon. Lady makes some important points about the timing of the
establishment of HealthWatch England. She discussed the concerns of a
number of organisations, and I am aware of those concerns. We are
determined to do as much as we can to bring forward the date at which
HealthWatch England can be established, for the very reasons given by
outside organisations, as they have an important part to play both
during the transition and in ensuring that the new structures work. I
hope that that reassures the hon. Lady about the work of HealthWatch
England. She also asked about local
healthwatch.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000313">&#160;</a>

a programme of early implementers with regard to local healthwatch. She
also asked about funding. HealthWatch England, as a committee of the
CQC, will have £3.5 million to help with its start-up and
estimated ongoing costs. As I said when we debated this in March, the
CQC will provide infrastructure such as IT, and financial and other
expertise. In effect, it will have access to the resources that the CQC
has as well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000315">&#160;</a>

and supporting them?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000316">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Training is an essential part of making sure that
the committee does its job, but also training at a local level for
local healthwatches. That is one of the things we are exploring through
the early implementation of local healthwatches.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000317">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was also
asked whether the CQC had failed and whether a body that was part of
the CQC could blow the whistle on it. Healthwatch England certainly can
do that, because of the clear statutory independence that the Bill
provides. If it considers that it is appropriate to advise the
Secretary of State on relevant matters within its remit, then the
Secretary of State, under the amendments and other changes we are
making in the Bill, will have to have regard to advice on how he
discharges his functions with regard to an organisation’s
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000318">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Healthwatch
England can therefore formally advise the CQC, which would have to
respond—this is one of the amendments that we will come to
later—and Healthwatch England could publish that advice. It can
raise an issue with the CQC, the CQC has to have regard to it, and
their exchanges can be published as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000319">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland made a number of
points and a key question I want to address is who do people complain
to. If someone has a complaint about a service that they received from
a provider, they would write to the provider. I would imagine that, as
a constituency MP, that is what the hon. Gentleman does now, so he
would write to  the NHS trust or the foundation trust that
provided the service.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the issue
was about a service that was not well specified, the hon. Gentleman may
well choose to write to the local commissioner, so he would write to
the clinical commissioning group. If he continued to have concerns, he
could raise them with the local healthwatch and seek its support.
Ultimately, if he felt that the complaint had not been dealt with
satisfactorily through the various stages that each organisation would
have to set out, he could take it up with the health service ombudsman.
There are therefore a number of stages that he or his constituents
could use to proceed with a
complaint.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East spoke about the importance of
involving children and young people, and I know other hon. Members
share that view. It is important to make sure that, as organisations
are established nationally and locally, they hear and respond to the
voices of young people. That is particularly the case in later
amendments which deal with representativeness. The measures capture
that concern, and we should make sure that in establishing those bodies
they involve young people.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will give a
couple of examples of good practice. The first is the work of the
National Children’s Bureau, which runs a young inspectors
programme, which is a good model of how local healthwatches could
engage with young people and use their eyes, ears, views and
imagination to improve services for them. That is one of the things
that we want to explore through the early implementers
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is worth putting one other example on record. We are in the process of
redesigning child and adolescent mental health services in England to
extend the idea of talking therapies to young people. That is something

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 557<a class="bkMark" name="Column557">&#160;</a>
                  </div>new that the Government have committed themselves to implementing, and
we are working with Young Minds, an expert charity in the field, which
is bringing young people directly into the process of redesigning the
services. That is a model of how services should be redesigned in
future, ensuring that they are tailored to the experience and expertise
that young patients can bring to services, and it is very much at the
heart of how we want the NHS to be
reformed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000324">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is being very generous in
accepting interventions. Given that local healthwatch organisations
follow local authority boundaries and that public health duties will
sit with local authorities, will local healthwatch organisations have
any role in feeding into the development of public health campaigns and
in ensuring that young people’s voices are also heard in
those?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000325">&#160;</a>

However, there is concern in many communities, certainly in my area in

given to investigate and represent patients. Often the agenda of one or
two individuals can skew the whole agenda of what a LINk is trying to
do. The issue of accountability for the several hundred thousand pounds
it receives is not properly addressed, and it would be better addressed
if it had a closer link with the local

Whether it is under LINks, the old CHCs or whatever patient and public

organisation is not genuinely representative of the local community but
has been captured by one or two individuals. I accept what the hon.
Gentleman says about the fact that being part of a local council might
give such an organisation greater democratic accountability, but
anybody who has run an organisation that is solely reliant on funds
from a local council, such as a local charity, will know that it can
sometimes make people worry about speaking out. Sometimes they do;
sometimes they do not; some charities do not care. They will go out
there and champion their cause wherever they get their funding. Others
are nervous.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000361">&#160;</a>

to come on to. National Voices—the national organisation that

answer is to protect local healthwatch funding, which it says is being
cut due to pressures on local authorities. Ring-fencing is the best way
to enable an effective local champion. It is pretty simple; I do not
know whether the Minister has discussed that matter with his right hon.

evidence was provided to the Committee by the National Association of

to LINks, which is entirely understandable, because they have to keep
funding for child protection and care for older people. The evidence
showed that local authorities have cut funding to LINks by an average
of 24%, so a quarter of their budgets have been cut. Some councils have
cut funding for LINks by up to 76%. I say to Government Members,
including my relatively close neighbour, the hon. Member for
Loughborough, that if they want to back that patient and public voice,
which I believe the hon. Lady wants to champion, LINks should be
independent and they should not have their budgets cut by a quarter.

question about the funding of local healthwatch organisations, and my
concerns go beyond ring-fencing and the need to protect budgets. In
responding to the previous clause, the Minister seemed to adopt a
passive rather than proactive approach to the duties that would be
expected of local healthwatch organisations. I absolutely want them to
be able to respond, develop and emerge to reflect local need, but I
think we also need an assurance about the quality of services and
access to them over different local authority areas. My concern is that
when budgets are tight, advertising and training, for example, are the
first things that are cut, even though they are essential to the
quality of services that healthwatch organisations will deliver
locally. Will the Minister give us assurances about how we will know
that those organisations will genuinely reflect local views? How will
that be measured? How will the local community be able to intervene if
it thinks that its local healthwatch organisation does not reflect its
views and is not acting in its best interests?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000370">&#160;</a>

satisfied with the Minister’s response about the provision of

local knowledge that has built up. I hope that the Minister will at
least provide some guidance to local healthwatch organisations to
encourage them to use local mental health advocacy services and
carers’ organisations, so that we can be sure that there is a
known standard in health care organisations. I am sure that we have met
people in our surgeries and on our visits who complain about the
service that is provided, but when we approach the local authority, we
are told, “Well, they have told us that everything is
fine.” It is often difficult for older or vulnerable people to
speak up and complain about the service when someone from the same
organisation will be delivering very intimate care to them the next

They may purport to represent the interests of patients—in many
cases, they may well do that—but in some cases they may be
pursuing the agendas of a very few people in an area, which are not
necessarily for the general benefit. Having a link with the local
authority helps to provide better joined-up thinking, greater
accountability and a better voice for patients because of the larger
agenda that the local authorities are engaged in for
health.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000375">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Before I address the points raised by Opposition
Members, I want to correct a term of art related to the shadow bodies
that are being established. I used the term “early
implementers” when talking about local healthwatch when I should
have used the phrase “pathfinders”, and in future I shall
refer to local healthwatch as such. The pathfinders are an important
part of ensuring that we draw lessons about good practice from LINks
into the new system and that we build on good practice elsewhere when
involving patients in the work of local
healthwatch.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000379">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for East Lothian asked about raising the profile of local
healthwatch. It is not all about advertising. As I have said, we have a
development programme in place. Our advisory group, which is made up of
stakeholders from LINks, local authorities, voluntary groups and
community groups, is working through the way in which the profile of
local healthwatch can be raised at local level. The communications
working group is looking at developing a toolkit of materials to help
patients understand how and where to access local healthwatch from
October 2012. We hope to benefit from earlier implementation with the
pathfinder
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000380">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
made a sedentary remark during the comments of the hon. Member for
Leicester West, which is uncharacteristic for this Committee, and I
apologise unreservedly for doing so. I reacted in that way because I
was casting my mind back to the debates on the role of the Commission
for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. I recall that many people
involved in local patients forums at the time felt that the
organisation they often called “Chippy” was overweening
and overbearing in the exercise of its functions, not least in its
distribution of resources, so I had a feeling of déjà vu.
It is interesting that those organisations now feel the
opposite.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000381">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
noble Friend Earl Howe and I are happy to continue engaging with the
National Association of LINks Members on such issues, but I remind
LINks members, some of whom were involved in previous iterations, of
their concerns about being told what to do by national organisations.
Learning may be necessary on all sides when it comes to such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000382">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West suggested that local healthwatch will be
part of the local authority. It most certainly will not. Local
healthwatch organisations will be separate bodies, and we are providing
for their establishment as bodies corporate. They will have a variety
of legal identities, including as social enterprises, so legal
independence will be
established.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000383">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to reassure Opposition Members on that independence by
rehearsing some of the issues. A local healthwatch organisation will
set its priorities based on information and intelligence gathered on
local health and social care. Although some requirements will be
imposed on it, a local healthwatch organisation will, in general,
choose independently how to deliver its work, which is further
reinforced by its place on the local health and well-being board. The
local healthwatch organisation has a separate status in shaping local
health decision making.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000384">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
local healthwatch organisations have independence because they feed up
to HealthWatch England. Local authorities cannot arbitrarily veto the
plans of local healthwatch, they cannot stop it publishing advice,
including advice to local authorities, and they cannot abolish it
without the Secretary of State’s consent. Not only are there
local safeguards, such organisations have clear
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000385">&#160;</a>

second-guessing my remarks, but first I shall say something on
funding.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000387">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are making available £60 million to fund local healthwatches. It
is for local authorities to make the funding available through local
determination, and we are working with local authorities through our
healthwatch advisory group and the pathfinders. We recognise the
importance of making the funding available to local healthwatches in
full, which is similar to what we are doing in other areas. We do not
think it would be right to ring-fence local healthwatch money. The NHS
Future Forum agreed with that view and said that it was not appropriate
for central Government to ring-fence funds in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000388">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are aware of the concerns of the National Association of LINks Members
and of its report this year on funding cuts to local involvement
networks, which says that the cuts are causing difficulties to LINks as
a result of the problems that local authorities face. We want to ensure
that we raise the profile of HealthWatch and the importance of its role
from 2012. The funding that local healthwatches receive will ensure
that the voices of patients, service users and the public are not lost
during the changes. That brings me to why I disagree with the assertion
that the hon. Lady made.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000389">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Local
authorities will have a duty to seek to secure local healthwatch
arrangements that operate effectively. Local authorities will also have
a duty to make those local healthwatch arrangements, which inevitably
means providing the necessary funds to enable those activities to take
place. The hon. Member for East Lothian said that a local healthwatch
should be a champion, not a poodle. That is certainly the
Government’s intention, which is why we have established checks
and
balances.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000390">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
the hon. Lady then posed an important question, and asked what do we do
when a wayward healthwatch is not representative of its population and
does not properly take concerns into account? That is where there is a
legitimate role for a democratically elected and accountable local
authority to step in and make an appropriate challenge. It is one of
the checks and balances that we are trying to construct with the Bill,
which is why we have a pathfinder programme  to ensure that we
get it right as we implement the changes. With that, I propose that the
clause stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000391">&#160;</a>

the forum also reported concerns about the extent to which local health

The forum

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It

               <p class="tabbed">The
NHS Future Forum took the view that the way to deal with those concerns
was to place a duty on commissioners and providers to have regard to

accordingly. That is what the amendments do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000411">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I can assure
hon. Members that the duty applies in relation to both health and
social care service functions for the people receiving those services.
The amendment refers to “care services”, and adds a new
subsection  to section 221 of the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007. Section 221 defines “care
services” as services provided as part of the health service in
England, or services provided as part of the

that hon. Members will accept the amendment as a way to ensure greater
patient involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000412">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> To a certain extent, the amendment illustrates
the Government’s lack of understanding of how HealthWatch ought
to be and function. If HealthWatch is truly representative of a local
area and patients, then any local authority would be foolhardy not to
listen to it. That is why an important part of HealthWatch is how to
ensure that it is properly representative. We believe that the
Government have missed a golden opportunity to firm up legislation in
relation to HealthWatch, such as the amendments and arguments we put
forward earlier. Structure by itself is simply not enough. Proper
public engagement is the key. We do not believe that the legislation as
it is currently formulated does that sufficiently.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000413">&#160;</a>

feel that they can answer the legitimate concerns of the community
about HealthWatch by simply saying that health and well-being boards
must pay attention to what it says. The fact that we need that in
legislation shows that the Government appreciate that people are not
confident that HealthWatch will be sufficiently robust, independent or
strong to fulfil the very important role that we all want it to
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000414">&#160;</a>

Let us return to the clause in front of us and what the amendment is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 568<a class="bkMark" name="Column568">&#160;</a>
                  </div>about, which is how we ensure in one way—it is not
exclusive—that the work of local healthwatches is seen as
important in the local system. That goes back to the point that was
made by Jeremy Taylor when we received evidence at the start of the
Committee stage, which is that the legislation and the amendments are
certainly essential, but they are not sufficient. That is why we have a
pathfinder programme, and that is why we have a collaborative process
to roll out both HealthWatch England and local healthwatch. We are
working with existing stakeholders from LINks, with local authority
colleagues and with all those who have an interest in getting right the
design of this important vehicle for delivering patient voices into the
system. It cannot, as the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury
quite rightly said, simply be a matter for legislation. It must be
about attitudes and culture. We have quite a  lot of work to do
to undo the damage that has been done by the constant changes that
occurred over the past 13
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000419">&#160;</a>

right. Many in local authorities might say that they would have done
that anyway, but we heard the concerns that were expressed during the
listening process, and we wanted to ensure that they were clearly
addressed,

merely “consult” local healthwatch organisations and

                  </strong> These amendments are minor and technical in
nature. They amend the provisions governing which joint strategic needs
assessments and joint health and well-being strategies the local
authority, the NHS commissioning board and clinical commissioning
groups must have regard to. This is a point on which the provision in
the original Bill was too narrowly drawn, as it required commissioners
to have regard only to the most recent assessment and strategy, whereas
there might be other assessments and strategies that were also relevant
if they were specialist, covering particular areas rather than every
aspect.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000443">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments accordingly require commissioners to have regard to any
joint strategic needs assessments and joint health and well-being
strategies relevant to the exercise of their functions. For example, as
part of a locality’s planning cycle, the JSNA and health and
well-being strategy may have to be prepared several months in advance.
There might, therefore, be a period during which the most recent joint
strategic needs assessment and joint health and well-being strategy are
not the relevant ones for the purposes of the current commissioning
plan. We are trying to make that clear with these minor technical
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000444">&#160;</a>

                  </div>groups from cherry-picking the functions that they choose to focus on,
on the basis of their determining which functions
are relevant. We think that that is important. The
responsibilities of local authorities and consortia are redrafted and
widened so that they have regard to joint strategic needs assessments
and joint health and well-being strategies, but the amendments do not
go far
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000445">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
debate on this issue has been about the connection between health and
well-being boards and the commissioning consortia. Does the Minister
really think that the proposed changes amount to making, as called for
by the Future Forum, health and well-being boards the focal point for
decision making about health and well-being? The Future Forum
recommended that health and well-being boards should agree clinical
commissioning consortia plans, but the amendments require consortia to
involve the boards at all stages and to refer back to the commissioning
consortia, or upwards to the NHS commissioning board. That is not the
sign-off that we expected, and the Local Government Group shares our
concerns. It has said
that<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000446">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“this
falls short of the power of sign-off and in the LG Group’s
opinion, this is not sufficient to ensure that commissioning plans are
firmly based on the health and wellbeing needs and priorities of the
local
community.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000826">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister might remember the Secretary of State at one stage saying that
the original Bill—before the pause and the
amendments—would give health and well-being boards the ability
to sign off commissioning consortia’s plans. It has never said
that. It did not say that before it was amended, or before the pause,
and it certainly does not say that now. That is what the Future Forum
wanted, and that is what we called for, so the plans still do not go
far
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000447">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
the Minister will again reject these concerns, as he did during the
previous Committee, as being “inflated and exaggerated”,
but perhaps he would also like to answer some questions. If the health
and well-being board does have any power, it seems to be to complain to
the national commissioning board. What is that about? What will it
mean? Perhaps the Minister could help us with that. What evaluation
have the Government made of the relationship between pathfinder
commissioning consortia and the health and well-being boards? How is
that working, and will he publish that
information?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000448">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the health and well-being boards are to be responsible for assessing
the health needs of their population in the joint strategic needs
assessment and for writing a plan to deal with those needs in the
health and well-being strategy, they should have a decisive say in how
that plan is to be enacted. They should not be toothless. It is a
matter of great concern, not just to us but to many organisations, that
the health and well-being boards, despite the spin, still have no
teeth. During this recommittal of the Bill we tabled an amendment,
which I believe was not selected. We would have liked to mandate the
relevant health and well-being board to have the power to sign off the
consortium’s commissioning plan, but because we were given
inadequate time to consider the Bill, we have not been able to debate
that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000449">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s amendments to clauses 22 and 190 go some way to
strengthening the role of health and well-being boards, and the greater
emphasis on patient and public involvement is welcome, as far as it
goes, but will the Minister make clear that intention and reject
paragraph C76 of the Bill’s impact assessment? That paragraph
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000454">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Local
health professionals and representatives of HealthWatch sitting on the
boards could find themselves mired in national-local disputes if the
political complexion of central and local authorities differed. They
could also suffer from discontinuities of political leadership due to
political turbulence, or a clear lack of leadership if councils were
hung. One of the main aims of the White Paper was to reduce the
day-to-day political interference in commissioning decisions by
creating a statutory basis for the NHS Commissioning Board and
consortia, to protect them from interference in commissioning decisions
at both a local and national
level.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000827">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
seems fairly clear. The Government are against the idea of politicians,
either local or national, interfering with commissioning decisions
being made by the national NHS commissioning board, or by the
consortia. And yet, post-pause, we are also led to believe that the
Government are now facing the other way, and also embracing local
authorities and their ability to work with commissioning consortia and
with the national commissioning board. May I read on? The impact
assessment
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000455">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“To

responsible for their commissioning decisions, and neither are
obligated to gain approval from local councils or health and wellbeing
boards for their commissioning
decisions.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000828">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Does
this still reflect the Department of Health’s thinking? If it
does not, will the Minister publicly disown it, and look again at
whether or not he has given sufficient powers to allow the well-being
boards to sign off the plans of commissioning consortia?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000456">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand,
and I expect, that the Minister will refer to the power that is
supposed to have been given to the health and well-being boards in the
amendments to this Bill to complain to the NHS commissioning board. But
the leaked document designing the NHS commissioning board was very
instructive in what its attitude will be towards health and well-being
boards. If one looks at this document, which is some 21 pages long, it
refers to health and well-being boards only once. If we go through it,
the sections entitled “The purpose of the NHS commissioning
board”, “The values and culture”, “The
commissioning system”, contain nothing about the health and
wellbeing boards. Under “Relationships”, the boards
appear. On page 7, at the bottom, in one line, we
read:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000457">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“With
the increased strategic role for Local Authorities through new Health
Wellbeing Boards, the new arrangements for Joint Strategic Needs

               </p>
               <p>One
thing that gives the game away is the chart on page 8, which
gives the board’s key relationships. The board will have key
relationships with the Department of Health, the Treasury, Parliament,
patients and the public, the commissioning consortia, patient groups,
healthcare providers, healthcare professionals and

               <p class="tabbed">The
power of health and well-being boards hardly jump out at one from this
paper, and this, I would suggest, is the attitude likely to be
displayed by the NHS commissioning board. Given that the evidence here
is of one set of attitudes, would it not be a good idea to do a little
more than trust the attitude—possibly of David Nicholson, or
whoever is going to be dealing with it—to listen to health and
well-being boards when they are grassing up local commissioning
consortia? Might it be that the health and well-being boards will
complain to the national commissioning board, be patted on the head,
told, “There, there dear”, and ignored? Health and
well-being boards will have no power to deal with this at all.

Perhaps I should not use such frivolous language. It has been a long
few weeks. However, the point I am making is a powerful one and
deserves to be addressed, and addressed properly, remembering in
particular the views of the Future Forum report, and the legitimate
concerns that have been raised everywhere. We, on this side, may talk
about driving competition into the heart of the NHS, but I think it was
the Minister who said that the important thing about this Bill—I
may be unfairly paraphrasing him and I stand to be corrected—was
that the Bill would drive democracy into the heart of the NHS. If the
democracy is health and well-being boards that have no control over
commissioning consortia other than an ability to complain to the
national commissioning board, which will ignore them, what is the power
that we really

                  </strong> I think the hon. Lady is wrong. For new Members,
this has been a running sore through Parliament. For the decade that I
have been here, various all-party groups have been set up to deal with
inadequate democratic accountability. There have been community
hospital group campaigners, small hospital group campaigners and so on.
We are confronted with the persistent reluctance of Government to
empower the democratic voice. It is not just Government. If one spoke
to the people at the NHS Confederation in years gone by and mentioned
the prospect of local councils having any input into local
commissioning decisions they would blanch. They did not like the idea
at all; they were far more comfortable with the model they had at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000469">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To be fair,
there are some quite rational considerations behind their nervousness
on this issue. Dr Taylor gave me a good example of where this dilemma
occurs. If populism is given full rein, it can sometimes trump clinical
safety. It seems to be an empirical fact—people will correct me
if it is wrong—that maternity units with fewer than 2,000 live
births are not as safe as those  with
more.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000470">&#160;</a>

fewer than 2,000 live births and very good safety records. His general

                     </span>
                  </strong> The example was given to me by Dr Richard
Taylor, who was emphatic that we needed more democratic accountability
in the system and could see the problem that, at some point, the
popular voice could conflict with the expert voice. Equally, another
fear is frequently raised by people who are campaigning to retain
services. They fear that sometimes financial expediency and
institutional interest can be disguised as clinical safety. I had a
discussion with the Secretary of State the other day on precisely that
point. He agreed with me that this was often part and parcel of many of
the debates he had had over the years about unpopular
configurations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000472">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
general perception that if you allow councillors too great an input,
they will decide things for which they are not financially
accountable—or, worse still, get involved in the
micro-management of the service. So there is a real issue here and I do
not suppose it is an easy one. There is a general in-principle issue of
having people make decisions when they are not directly accountable for
all the consequences. However, at the end of the day, if councils and
elected bodies have to live with the consequences, they will always be
mindful of them. Contrary to what the medical world thinks, local
councils often make very tough decisions simply because they know they
have to be made. They do not invariably veer down the line of stupid
populism, particularly if they have to live with the
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Weighing all
this up, in the last Parliament I produced a private Member’s
Bill that I thought was a solution. Essentially, I suggested that there
should be an annual commissioning plan, subject to ratification and
possible amendment by a democratically elected body. Working on an
Occam’s razor principle and not wanting to create
institutions—I did not know at that stage of a health and
well-being board—I thought we could usefully use the existing
overview and scrutiny mechanism and co-opt what relevant people were
necessary to make it work effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000474">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I still think
that that is a more elegant solution, but it is not where we are. That
is the general dilemma. I say in all honesty to Labour Members that the
more I look at this legislation, the more I think it makes it difficult
for the clinical world to walk completely out of step with the
community will. For a variety of reasons, which are mapped out in
various parts of the legislation, I do not think that it could get to a
situation where, as in Kidderminster, there could be a complete
override and almost indifference to what the public see and what the
experts, though not necessarily NHS experts, have to
contribute.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000475">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we look at
the legislation—the Minister has yet to speak, and I am sure he
will elaborate on this—we see that there is no absolute veto on
the part of the health and well-being board. We have to think whether
we would be comfortable in all circumstances with an absolute veto of
clinicians if they give strong reasons for the particular route that
they are going down. Equally, within the current architecture as I
understand it, it is difficult for clinicians to proceed in wholesale
indifference to what the public will is saying—apart from
anything else, the plan to which they will be bound will essentially be
a joint strategic needs assessment into which they will appear to have
an input.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000476">&#160;</a>

idea that even local clinicians do not at times have individual
interests about things they want to do that the public might not wish
them to do. An example is what I was talking about earlier, where I was
blooded on this issue—when it was decided that children’s
A and E would be taken out of Southport and put in Ormskirk.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000478">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Speaking
to my local GPs recently, I have discovered that they refused to
recognise the problem. We want to do away with the idea that there
cannot be a conflict. What we must do is ensure that we balance out
factors such as clinical safety and the public’s legitimate
demand to have fair access to the right sort of services in some sort
of rational way. It is not easy.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000480">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we had
full-blooded local health boards, we would still have some kind of need
to finesse them so that considerations of clinical safety were not
over-ridden. It is a tricky area—one that is possibly capable of
further tweaking and improvement. When we consider the legislation, we
can see that we are a step beyond where we were in the previous
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000481">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
raising his points. For me, this goes to one of the essential parts of
the Government. We have found ourselves in a situation in the national
health service in which some £20 billion-worth of efficiency
savings need to be made. For the past year, the NHS has effectively
been at a standstill. When the NHS commissioning board, the
commissioning consortia, HealthWatch and the health and well-being
boards come into being, it may well be at a time when hard decisions
need to be made. The example that always springs to the mind of the
public is the reconfiguration of services. Who is going to make the
decision that a hospital needs to close a ward, an A and E unit or a
maternity unit? Who is to make the decision about Finsbury health
centre in my constituency?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000482">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If I have
spoken about the Finsbury health centre before, let me do so again as
it had a strong impact on me. When the primary care trust wanted to
close Finsbury health centre, I would go to see it, thump the
table—I am sure that Members will not find that hard to
recognise—and say, “Will you listen to me? I am the
elected representative of Islington South and Finsbury. People do not
want this health centre to close. What are you doing?” Again and
again, I would attend these meetings, but feel that I was not being
listened to.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000483">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The overview
and scrutiny committee of the local authority was able to send that
decision to the Secretary of State. When the primary care trust was
“consulting” 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 577<a class="bkMark" name="Column577">&#160;</a>
                  </div>over the closure of Finsbury health centre, it was
not consulting over whether it should close, but on how it should
close. We were able, through the reference to the Secretary of State,
to send the proposal back—and Finsbury health centre
remains.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000484">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What will
happen now? Who will be making the hard decisions on issues such as
Finsbury health centre? If the GP commissioning consortia have
effectively taken over from primary care trusts, how will they be
answerable? The Minister says that they will be answerable through the
health and well-being boards. What power do the health and well-being
boards have over the commissioning consortia? They have none. All they
can do is complain to the national commissioning board, which may
ignore them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000485">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill will
take away the power of overview and scrutiny boards to refer to the
Secretary of State—I would be so happy to hear otherwise or to
hear that there had been an amendment to the Bill that I had missed
that had brought back the power of the overview and scrutiny boards. I
really do not think that there has, so that power has been taken away
and what we are left is GP commissioning consortia and health and
well-being boards without the powerful link between the two.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000486">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that the changes being made may produce something that is better than
the primary care trusts, but in terms of democratic accountability, it
could not be a lot worse. After all the table-thumping meetings in the
past in which I asked representatives of my primary care trust to
listen to me, in my first meeting with them after the election of the
Tory Government—whom the hon. Member for Southport
supports—they said, “Save us.” It was difficult to
be entirely sympathetic.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000487">&#160;</a>

part and parcel of delivering a joint needs assessment that had been
agreed, and that was then referred to the national commissioning
board—not as an ad hoc decision that was suddenly made and which
did not fit with anything else—the commissioning board would be
guilty of a dereliction of duty if it ignored such a thing. Is that not
true?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000488">&#160;</a>

certain things to ensure that my point is made. It could be that a
joint strategic needs assessment is made and the implementation plan is
agreed, but then the local elected councillors on the health and
well-being board feel that the GP commissioning consortia’s
interpretation of that plan is not the same as theirs. For example,
they may say, “There is nothing wrong with closing the
Whittington hospital, because there will be University College hospital
instead, so it won’t be a problem.” My local authority,
in representing the community, would have a great deal to say about
that. In such circumstances, however, all it could do is refer the
matter to the national commissioning board, which is a large, faceless
quango with no democratic accountability. That is the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000489">&#160;</a>

Lady has misunderstood, or chosen to misunderstand, what the Bill
provides for. The NHS commissioning board will be accountable to the
Secretary of State through the mandate that he sets, as well as having 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 578<a class="bkMark" name="Column578">&#160;</a>
                  </div>direct accountability, through accounting officers, to many Committees

idea that there would be no accountability is extraordinary.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000490">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me talk
about political accountability further, because Opposition Members have
a new-found love of it that they did not seem to have when they were in
government, which is refreshing. There is a balance to be struck
between local accountability, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport raised, and local accountability for a national health
service—also an important part of this—as well as
national accountability for the health service.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000491">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Several weeks
ago, we debated key clauses at the beginning of the Bill, but I want to
stress that the Secretary of State will set a mandate, which
will be laid before Parliament, and it will be subject
to  consultation, as no similar document has been before. The
NHS operating framework, which was the previous Administration’s
tool of choice for directing the way in which the NHS operates, was
never subject to consultation. There is a change in the strengthening
of accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000492">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The focus of
all this is how we organise the NHS to deliver on outcomes. The NHS
outcomes framework was the subject of extensive consultation last year,
and of course—we have made it clear in the
legislation—the organising principles of the NHS should be
centred on quality and autonomy. When it comes to local accountability,
we want to see local services and how they are organised genuinely
fitting local circumstances and population need.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000493">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is the
role of the local health and well-being boards. It is about genuinely
understanding and holding local organisations to account, by their
being involved in the process to ensure that population needs are being
met. That has been a weakness of the national health service with a
top-down model, where it is directed from the centre. It has not been
as effective at really understanding, engaging, and therefore meeting
local needs and fitting those outcomes to local
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000494">&#160;</a>

decisions are made about the reconfiguration of services; my hon.
Friend the Member for Southport made the point about maternity
services. Sometimes, and there is good evidence for this, smaller units
may not be as safe as larger units, so there may need to be
reconfiguration. Sometimes, however, there is good evidence that
smaller units are effective and very safe. Through the mechanisms in
the Bill, would not having that local scrutiny enable those decisions
to be examined much more closely and more effectively for the benefit
of patients?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000495">&#160;</a>

The Government accepted all three recommendations. Two require
legislation to give effect to them. One is that in dealing with the
authorisation process and the assessment process, the NHS commissioning
board will have to have regard to the opinions of the local health and
well-being board. It is worth saying at this point that one of the
other recommendations that has come out in the Government response is
about recognising that these should be seen to be elected member-led
bodies. They should have a majority of councillors on them in order to
be seen as genuinely democratic bodies, leading on these issues at
local level.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000513">&#160;</a>

£20 billion of savings over, in their terms, three years, but
over four years as a result of the present Government’s
additional funding. There has been no standstill. The Government have
been working both through the pathfinder programme with consortia and

Opposition Members have perhaps missed is that we have made it clear
that we are moving away from the designation route for dealing with
failure regimes in the future. We will produce detailed proposals on
that later. As a consequence, there is a significant change to the way
in which overview and scrutiny works. The reconfiguration of services
is and will remain a fundamentally local process. If local
commissioning groups require support in planning and development of
services, they will be able to obtain that from a range of sources,
including the NHS commissioning board. The Bill gives local authority
scrutiny functions greater powers over health than any other area. Our
proposals will ensure, through regulations, that for the first time all
providers of NHS-funded services, not just public sector providers, can
be required to consult the local authority on proposed substantial
service
reconfigurations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000517">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 192 is potentially very important, with
the duty to encourage integrated working. We can all agree that that is
the holy grail. We must have more integrated working between health and
social care; between primary and secondary care; between community
services, doctors and local government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000534">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the one
hand, the health service is relatively well funded, centrally driven
and locally provided, with little democratic accountability. On the
other hand, poorly resourced social care is locally provided,
democratically accountable and means-tested. The difficulty has been to
try to integrate the two, given how different they  are.
Although the clause is worthy, the real problem is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 583<a class="bkMark" name="Column583">&#160;</a>
                  </div>changing the nature of those two organisations. If we continue
drastically to underfund social care, so that it becomes the Cinderella
of the health service, we will never be able to
achieve proper integration. There will simply be an unbalanced
relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000535">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is huge
concern that the social care system is currently underfunded by at
least a £1 billion, and it is going to get worse next year and
the year after. There is already huge strain on social care
and there will be increased strain for the health service, as well. If
the Government wish to integrate health and social care, they cannot
cut social care to the bone, while at the same time cutting the health
service, turning it upside down by the ankles and shaking it hard.
Integrated working will not happen in those circumstances. The
Government know it; we know it; everyone in the sector knows
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000536">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
fundamental criticism of the Bill is that it misses the point. The
challenge for all of us is to ensure that we get increased integrated
working between health and social care. That is challenging and hard

                  </strong> I am grateful for that, Mr Gale. I want to speak
to the amendments, because they are important, and the Minister will be
surprised to learn that I support them. They try to bring some clarity
to a clause that, quite frankly, in the original Bill—I do not
think that we had time to reach it—was a bit of a sword of
Damocles, to say the least. The National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence has been operating for more than 10 years. This
clause is headed:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000550">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Failure
by NICE to discharge any of its
functions”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000838">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is hardly a vote of confidence in an organisation that has been in
existence for more than 10 years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000551">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NICE will be
given a lot more work under clause 231, which we have not debated this
time around, which introduces quality standards. We were told at the
first sitting of oral evidence for the original Bill—I think
these figures are correct—that NICE had worked through some
seven quality standards so far and there was an expectation that it
would work through about 150 more, which would pass down to
commissioning consortia and providers to be used for the commissioning
and provision of national health services. At the time, I related that
to Joseph Stalin, but the Secretary of State did not agree. The quality
standards will certainly have cost implications, not only for NICE in
the time that it takes to work through all 150 of them but for the
national health service as a whole. Costs are an issue, as we have
said.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000552">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It worries me
that the clause as unamended is a bit draconian, to say the least, in
what it could do to NICE, which has had a level of independence from
politicians for some 10 years. It has not always worked properly, and I
could give the Committee my views about that. At least Government
amendment 220 ensures that the Secretary of State would have to be a
little bit transparent about why he was taking action against NICE, in
as much as he would have to publish his reasons for  doing so.
Government amendment 219 also clarifies in subsection (1)(b) that the
Secretary of State may take action against NICE if it<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000553">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“is failing or
has failed properly to discharge any of its functions”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000839">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>only if “the
failure is significant.” The original wording was
simply<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000554">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“to

               </p>
               <p>and few institutions do
that entirely to people’s satisfaction. I am pleased that the
amendment now states that the failure must be significant. We could
debate what that means, and perhaps the Minister will tell us in his
reply exactly what is meant by significant.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000555">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
reasons why I wanted to speak is that during the previous Parliament I
chaired the Health Committee. In 2007-08, we reported on the National

evaluated beta interferon and glatiramer acetate for MS in 2001. In
2002, it did not recommend the treatments as neither was judged to be
cost-effective. A public outcry followed. Witnesses believed that as a
result of the outcry the Department of Health sought a way to make the
drug available despite the NICE recommendation. The Department came to
an agreement with manufacturers of the drugs whereby the drug could be
used in the NHS as part of a 10-year trial. It was agreed that if the
drug was less effective than £36,000 per QALY, industry would
recompense the
NHS.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000844">&#160;</a>

issue around that. The report did not endorse it at the time; we were
quite sceptical and we were not sure whether, in the end event,
barristers or clinicians would decide whether it was

published a report and there were major issues. We will see what
happens with the two horses the Government are going to ride. On the
one hand we will have value-based pricing for new medicines, but on the
other we will have the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme for
others. I do not know how it will balance out, but we do not have time
to debate it as it is not relevant to the

pertinent to the Bill, which we cannot discuss because the Government
have not brought it forward, is what NICE’s role will be in

benefits of medicines. Indeed, somebody must negotiate with
pharmaceutical companies over price; we assume that that will be NICE.

about NICE’s overall work. NICE is doing some brilliant work and

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
second evidence session on political interference revealed the
witness’s concern about the role of the then Secretary of State
role in the availability of Herceptin. My hon. Friend the Member for
Leicester West will know that, because the then Secretary of State was
her predecessor in her constituency. In November 2005, North Stoke
primary care trust reversed its earlier decision to refuse the drug to
a patient with early-stage breast cancer after the then Secretary of
State announced that she was “very concerned”. She called
a meeting with PCT officials and asked them to consider assessing the
receptor status of their patients on the assumption that if the drug
became available it could be licensed quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000567">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I remember
that well. Herceptin had not been assessed by NICE, or licensed for use
in early-stage breast cancer, but evidence of the drug’s
efficacy for that type of cancer had been published on the
manufacturer’s investor website. The patient had threatened to
take the PCT  to the High Court to contest its original
decision not to allow her access to the drug, and shortly afterwards
the Department asked NICE to examine the drug early. In evidence to the
Select Committee, Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer
director, said that that was “a political decision”. When
Professor Rawlins of NICE gave evidence, he
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000568">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
scientific basis for Herceptin being effective and safe in early cancer
had not been demonstrated...Added to which, at that stage the company
had not even made an approach to the regulatory authorities, it had not
made an application, so it was a surprising remark from a Secretary of
State.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000845">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On the day
that that happened, there was a big rally by one of the big breast
cancer charities in Westminster Hall, and I went over there. It was an
effective lobby, and someone from south Yorkshire with early-stage
breast cancer was there. I said that we will have to see how things
develop, but the then Secretary of State moved on. Presumably she had
been pleasing the crowd, but pleasing the crowd is sometimes dangerous,
and that is what happened on that day. The consequence was that NICE
felt that it had been the victim of political interference in its duty,
which it believed was independent of politicians. It thought it was its
duty to look at things in a proper
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000570">&#160;</a>

Deputy Speaker, about political interference in NICE’s work. She
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000571">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I

               <p>We
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000573">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is on the public record, and was published in reports at the time. The
previous Government did not argue against it, which was embarrassing.
There were two instances and in one there was certainly direct action
by a Minister to destabilise NICE and to attack its independence. As we
have not had the opportunity to discuss the clause earlier, that needs
to be said, and I would like the Minister to respond, because even with
the amendment, which I am happy to support, I would like to know
exactly what role this and any other Government will have with regard
to NICE when the Bill is enacted. NICE has done some brilliant work
over the past 10 years, and it is a great pity for large parts of the
national health service that, for whatever reason, quite a lot of what
it says is not mandatory, so it is not implemented. It would have been
better for the NHS and patients if it had
been.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000574">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
seems that we are moving into an era in which quality standards issued
by NICE will be the norm for commissioners and providers. In those
circumstances, we must make sure that there will be no political
interference for any reason if we are going to accept even this amended
clause. I would be interested to see what the Minister has to say,
because I genuinely believe that institutions like NICE are here for
the good of patients in particular and its independence should be
defended at all
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000575">&#160;</a>

the clause. In the previous Committee, we touched on the question of
whether guidance is just that, or whether there will be more compulsion
for practitioners and CCGs to accept it. Will it be considered a
failure to discharge their functions if CCGs do not apply guidance,
ignore it or make up their own? There is clear guidance about cataract
surgery, for example, which is being ignored, because there is a need
to stretch the money allocated to PCTs at the moment. Will there be
more compulsion to follow guidance from
NICE?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000576">&#160;</a>

interrelate through the function of the NHS commissioning board, which

those mechanisms in place to deal with those particular
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000579">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right hon.
Gentleman rehearses some powerful concerns about lessons that need to
be drawn from past experiences. We have tried to incorporate those into
the way in which, for the first time, we enshrine in statute 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 588<a class="bkMark" name="Column588">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the independence of NICE. It is worth reminding ourselves that at the
moment NICE is a special health authority. It is not the fully
independent entity that it will become as a result of the Bill being
enacted. It is a special health authority that was created, if you
like, at the whim of a Secretary of State and could simply be disposed
of by  a Secretary of State through a negative
resolution.  As a result of this Bill, it will require full
parliamentary scrutiny and approval for any further changes of the sort
that could have been undertaken so easily in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000580">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth stressing that alongside the power to intervene where
there is significant failure—I will come on to what
“significant” means in a moment—there is a duty on
the Secretary of State to operate in a way that maximises and
facilitates autonomy in the system. We want to see that particularly in
regard to bodies such as NICE. The right hon. Gentleman referred to
Professor Mike Richards and his continuing role as the national
clinical director for cancer services. I would like to take the
opportunity today—not least because it is his birthday—to
pay tribute to him for the work that he does and wish him many happy
returns on his 60th birthday. I have not had a chance to put
that on the record in any other way. He may not thank me for sharing
his age with the Committee,
however.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000581">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I agree. We were also asked about value-based
pricing. That took the debate beyond the confines of the clause, but I
want to share this information. The Government have been consulting on
proposals on the new value-based approach to pricing branded medicines.
We began the consultation in December, it closed on 17 March
and we expect to publish our response shortly. There will be ample
opportunity to study it and, hopefully, take it into account in our
debates on Report.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000583">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I said that I
would speak about the word “significant”. The courts have
taken the approach of interpreting expressions using the term
“significant” in the context of the underlying philosophy
of the legislation in which the expression is used. There are a couple
of cases where this has been explored. There is the Pedley case of
2009. There is also a quote from the case Re A (children) (care
proceedings: threshold criteria) CA 2009. In essence, courts will look
first at the definition in a dictionary, and they will then set that in
the context of the Bill. In this case they will, I am sure, look at
issues of autonomy as against the Secretary of State’s evidenced
judgment about whether there has been a significant failure.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000584">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That means
that if NICE does not recommend an important drug or recommends a drug
that is controversial, the Secretary of State has no power to
intervene. NICE is an independent body and must be allowed to issue
guidance free from political interference. In making its
recommendations, NICE takes into account all the latest clinical
evidence and issues final guidance on the use of a drug only after
careful consideration of that evidence and wide consultation with
stakeholders. I hope that that reassures the right hon.
Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000585">&#160;</a>

arguments in respect of the powers of the Secretary of State, but there
are some specific issues about the information centre to which clause
265 and the amendments that we have just agreed relate. I would like
further clarification. For the information of the Committee, clause 265
deals with failure by the information centre to discharge any of its
functions. It gives the Secretary of State powers to direct the
information centre as he wishes. If the Secretary of State considers
that the information centre is failing to carry out its functions in an
appropriate manner, the clause provides him with far-reaching powers
either to discharge those functions himself, or to make alternative
arrangements for another body to carry out those
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000598">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I was coming on to that and perhaps the
Minister will bear with me. With regard to the information centre that
is established by the clause, the Opposition support the view that
people should have greater access and control over their health and
social care records and, indeed, more control over their care. I am
sure that that is something that the whole Committee would welcome.
However, the opportunity to access health and social care records has
to be tempered with protections for patient confidentiality and,
equally importantly, protections to prevent the misuse of information
by private bodies or the
like.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000600">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley has spoken about the
value of anonymised data in planning health policy as well as to
patients to enable them to make relevant choices. It is not a huge leap
of faith to imagine that those data are commercially valuable to
pharmaceutical companies and commercial interests. There have to be
adequate safeguards in place. I am hopeful that the Minister will
reassure us. Indeed, Professor Field in his letter to the Prime
Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State
wrote:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are fairly simple in scope and we have already accepted
them. Amendment 222 specifies that failure by the information centre
must be significant. Amendment 223 confers a duty on the Secretary of
State to publish his reasons if he uses his powers to issue a direction
to the information centre if he chooses to make other arrangements or
to discharge the information centre’s functions. I want to take
a couple of minutes to consider the implications of that
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000603">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               <p>The
buck should stop with the Secretary of State, and the clause enables
him to make other provisions in the event of failure. The Opposition
think that is a good thing and we welcome that responsibility being
placed on the Secretary of State. It also, however, gives the Secretary
of State substantial powers to intervene in the information centre at
his discretion. The amendment and the clause do not specify precisely
what those circumstances would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000607">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
previous clauses, we have looked at the possibility of failure in other
NHS organisations. Indeed, the Ministers have told us that amendments
in relation to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 591<a class="bkMark" name="Column591">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the failure regime for NHS foundation trusts will be tabled in another
place. However, I have some questions about the clause and the
amendments that we have just accepted. As I understand them, the
amendments have placed two additional safeguards on the ability of the
Secretary of State to intervene.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000608">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First—perhaps
the Minister can correct me if I misunderstand the intent—the
Secretary of State can intervene only where a significant failure has
occurred, and he must provide a reason for doing so. While I welcome
the intention of the clause and the amendments, that seems rather
superficial, because the Secretary of State chooses whether to
intervene or not, and without any checks or balances elsewhere.
Therefore, the effect of the amendments may well be negligible in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000609">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">In
this clause, we are looking at the remedy for any failure at the NHS
Information Centre, so it must be relevant to look at what types of
failure are likely to provoke the Secretary of State into acting. I
seek assurance from Ministers that support will be in place to ensure
that the Information Centre can meets its objectives from the outset.
We have raised the spectre of the Trojan horses of privatisation, and I
would hate the measure to be used as such to outsource the functions of
the Information
Centre.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000610">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will outline a potential failure scenario. This is an ambitious and
welcome project, but without proper funding it is likely either to fail
in meeting its objectives or to fail overall. In those circumstances,
it would be duplicitous for the Secretary of State to take action to
fix a problem that was essentially of his own making as a result of not
making sufficient funding available.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000611">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister assure us that proper, independently determined funding will
be laid out as soon as is practicable? There are concerns about whether
funding will be available to bring about the necessary change and to
fulfil the Government’s aspirations. It is an ambitious proposal
and the plans would be massively challenging at any time, and they are
likely to entail substantial costs. Will the Minister comment on
whether he sees institutional failure as something that the Secretary
of State would be better placed to take responsibility for, rather than
using the powers given in clause
265?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000612">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Can
we have more detail on how the Minister foresees patients gaining
greater access to their records and how quickly that will be achieved?
Will he, for example, be setting out red lines for the date for
accomplishing that? If those milestones are not achieved, will that be
grounds for invoking the powers in the
clause?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000613">&#160;</a>

year has already seen funding cuts to the NHS Information Centre, which
is separate from the new body and carries out important research for
the NHS. It has had to reduce spending on surveys, which often form the
basis of health care planning. The general lifestyle survey, for
example, carried out every year by the Office for National Statistics
on behalf of Government Departments, has, according to my information,
had its funding withdrawn by the NHS Information Centre.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000618">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The survey
provides statistics on public health issues that are particularly dear
to the hearts of many Opposition Members. It provides important
information, figures and statistics that allow health policy to be
developed and assessed, and it makes possible comparisons between one
area and
another.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000619">&#160;</a>

general lifestyle survey is one of the things that have enabled us to
track the use of alcohol, and other such things, over many years and to
form good public policy on that basis. Given that public health threats
in the 21st century are more likely to be caused by lifestyle than by
bad sanitation or lack of fresh water supplies, it is a foolish thing
to do. Does my hon. Friend wish to comment on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000620">&#160;</a>

which side of the Committee we sit on, we all want a full and accurate
evidence base on which to plan effective health interventions. The
general lifestyle survey is an important element of that. Given that
information is key to patient choice, it does not augur well when the
NHS Information Centre is being cut back. I invite the

be effective, we need a solid and reliable pool of evidence on which to
base our decisions. I regret the Government’s cutting back on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000626">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The public
health observatories are also involved in the important area of
collecting information relevant to planning health policy. The rhetoric
of openness and transparency, which is often referred to by Members on

health observatories is that they can monitor the health needs of not
just regions and towns but different electoral wards. With the
development of the new public health structure, is it not important
that organisations such as that are able to give some direction to
health and well-being boards and commissioners, to ensure that they

met?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000629">&#160;</a>

recently hosted a seminar that my hon. Friend the Member for

issue is that we no longer collect data on the incidence of congenital

heart problems in the north-east shows that the gap is closing rapidly,
getting somewhere near the national average. Statins were one reason;
another was smoking cessation and other measures introduced in the past
decade.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000642">&#160;</a>

it is. We are closing some of the major gaps of health inequalities in
the UK. I hope we are not going to lose any information on that. We are
putting in the Bill that lowering health inequalities has to be done by
statute. It seems that under those circumstances the areas that my hon.

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Member for Easington for the
full exposition of chapter 2 of the Bill, which he has managed
cunningly to weave in to a speech about a relatively narrow clause
about the Secretary of State’s functions with regard to
significant failure.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000645">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I congratulate
him on the way he did so, because he has raised a number of issues,
some of which I will attempt to address. I will not address all of them
as I would have to stray far too wide. Before we conclude today, some
hon. Members might want to ensure that we scrutinise the remaining
clauses. I am sure we all have an appetite to ensure that we
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000646">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At present the
role of the Secretary of State is in effect to veto anything the
Information Centre can do by virtue of its status as a special health
authority. The Secretary of State could do that with the stroke of a
pen, because the functions are not currently protected by statute. That
is one reason, yet again, that the Government through the Bill are
placing into statute the necessary protections for the independence of
the Information Centre. That in a way answers many of the concerns that
the hon. Gentleman has rehearsed today.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000647">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked when the Secretary of State will perform the role
of the Information Centre in the event of a significant failure. The
example might be if the Information Centre had failed or was failing to
collect and disseminate critical information relating to hospital
mortality
figures.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000648">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are also some points to make about checks and balances, with regard to
the Secretary of State’s discretion. What we have tried to do
with the amendment and with the clause is ensure that the balance is
struck in a way so as to maximise the autonomy of the Information
Centre, so that it can do its job. We have a golden opportunity,
because the NHS is in a unique position to draw on LINks data sets on a
scale unprecedented elsewhere in the world—for research and
innovation and to improve patient care, diagnosis and treatment.
Protection for patients’ confidentiality and privacy is
fundamental, and we aim to ensure that no initiative threatens it. That
is a key principle. The hon. Gentleman asked if it is some sort of
privatisation mechanism to pass off to others or parcel up information
so that it becomes the property of private enterprise. The answer to
that question is, absolutely not.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000649">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clauses are important because they are
about the Care Quality Commission. Clause 285 requires the
Secretary of State to approve remuneration policy and clause
286—“Conduct of reviews etc. by Care Quality

investigation<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000659">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“without

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
debate is timely. There is great concern about the effectiveness of the
clause, not least due to the evidence Dame Jo Williams gave to the
Select Committee on Health on 28 June. She stated that her view and the
view of the CQC was that it was £15 million underfunded. It has
350 staff vacancies, 120 of which are for inspectors. As we all know,
the CQC was supposed to be responsible for registering GPs, but due to
the backlog of work and its inability to handle everything the
Government are asking it to do, it will not be able to deal with GP
registration when it was supposed to. That task has been put off until
2014. She also said in evidence that “at the very least”
she would like to double the number of
inspections.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000660">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
changes made to the inspection regime urgently need to be reviewed. For
the clause to work properly and for the CQC and the very sensible
people who run it—I do not necessarily agree with some of the
comments made earlier—to be able to take decisions about what
they feel they should be doing, as opposed to what they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 597<a class="bkMark" name="Column597">&#160;</a>
                  </div>can do, very many more inspections will be undertaken and there will be
many more investigations. As we saw with Winterbourne View, the CQC is
having great problems coping. Given the background, the shortage of
money, shortage of inspectors and manifest failure in relation to
Winterbourne View, we now expect the CQC to register the Southern Cross
landlords who have unilaterally taken control of the more than 750
homes that Southern Cross was running. The landlords have taken back
control and will need to be able to provide alternative care providers
that will need to be registered with the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000661">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman has told us of the increased number of inspections
of Southern Cross by the CQC, but can he tell us how many more
inspections have been done and how many more are expected between now
and the middle of October when, as I understand it, Southern Cross will
cease to exist? At that point, I respectfully and somewhat
optimistically suggest, it is anticipated that all the landlords will
have found sufficient care providers that can provide care of a
sufficiently good standard, and also that care will be provided by
organisations that can be financially stress-tested, because the last
thing that we want is for a Southern Cross home care provider to cease
to exist. We do not want it to go through all the uncertainties about
what is to happen, and then for a new care provider to be found that in
turn goes out of business six months
later.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000662">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
CQC and local authorities will have a very important role. They have
already said that they want to have more investigations, but we know
what the reality is, which is why it is important to debate this now
and get more information from the Minister about how we can expect the
CQC to be able to perform its functions
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000663">&#160;</a>

conveniently coincided with the massive cuts that the Government have

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 598<a class="bkMark" name="Column598">&#160;</a>
                  </div>authorities’ ability to deliver social care. So, local
authorities are no longer being inspected by the CQC. For example, if
my mother wanted to retire and she was wondering whether she wanted to
go to Surrey or Sussex, there would be no report available to her so
that she would know what the standard of care was in those two
neighbouring counties. There is no central assessment of such data,
which there used to be. The Government have made a specific decision
about that, which means that even if the CQC had the resources and
wanted to be able to assess local authorities and their delivery of
social care in their area, it would not be able to, even if it wanted
to within this section. That is my understanding, but if I am wrong, I
will be interested to hear what the Minister
says.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000669">&#160;</a>

way in which the Department of Health is pushing the CQC out into the

“It’s nothing to do with us; it’s entirely its

absolutely share an interest in ensuring that those who are cared for

raises several questions about the role of the CQC. She suggests that
we must learn lessons about how it is working and she urges us not to
dwell on the past. That is curious, because when we try to learn
lessons, we need to look at the past to draw conclusions. The Health
and Social Care Act 2008 established the CQC, bringing together
previous regulators. The measure was introduced by the previous
Government and it had the then Opposition’s broad support. The
proposition that the regulator should move from setting standards about
star ratings to licensing on a set of essential standards of quality
and safety was, again, broadly accepted across the House.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000673">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The scheme
came into effect last October and the CQC did much work to get to that
point; ensuring that it had a satisfactory level of resourcing in order
to do its work well took a lot of business planning. It is wrong and
unfair to gloss over the necessary work that got the CQC into a
position to do its work in relation to

good job was done in circumstances that were
constrained by the resources that had been made available up until that
time—and that was the position that this Government inherited.
We should not gloss over that point and I want to ensure that it is on
the record. <em>[</em>

Government’s obligation is that the Department should continue
to have responsibility, as the sponsoring Department of the CQC, to
agree with it the necessary financial resources for it to discharge its
statutory duties. A business plan is in process and we are clear what

have decided to pause—to use that phrase—the work on GP
registration, which is being put back to April 2013. We are doing that
because we believe it will allow the CQC to refine its systems in the
light of experience, which is something that, effectively, the hon.

from the CQC’s experience of registering dentists and other NHS

made, and the Department is providing up to £550,000 to enable

future, because not only will we have an outcomes framework for the

will be able to make comparisons across a range of outcome domains in
the quality of social care. Such comparisons will be useful to those

straight to the CQC when it comes to responsibility for what happened
at Winterbourne View. The first responsibilities must sit with the
staff, the employer and the company that runs the services. Their
duties of care and the duties of medical staff in those organisations
are also relevant. We should not gloss over those things either. They
must be considered carefully and critically as we review all the

her contention that staff shortages were the reason why the CQC did not

questions about her suggestion that a review is needed. Surely we need
a review before we jump to conclusions. We should have the evidence

               <p class="tabbed">The
CQC staff who are specifically responsible for managing ongoing
engagement with companies that provide services have regular and more
detailed and extensive engagement with Southern Cross than they would
with a less vulnerable provider. There are meetings almost daily and
the CQC is in phone contact with the organisation, making sure that it
stays in touch in a way that is sensible and appropriate to reassure
everyone that it is doing its job as a regulator
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000693">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury suggests that the
landlords have unilaterally taken back their assets. The reality, as I
outlined in the House a couple of days ago and on 16 June, is that the
restructuring committee, of which Southern Cross is a part, has been
deliberating on a number of options to allow a smooth transition from
the current company to new operators running the care homes. As a
Government we have been working with the CQC and the other parties with
a statutory responsibility, such as local authorities, to make sure
that all the pieces are in place for that smooth transition. I
attempted to set that out in my statement to the House on Tuesday. It
is not necessary to conclude that the CQC is not capable of coping with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000694">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
spoke about staffing. Last October, during the staffing freeze that the
Government imposed as part of our initial steps, we exempted CQC to
enable it to recruit 75 additional staff. Since that time the freeze
has been lifted completely, so that CQC is able to recruit the staff it
believes it needs to fill its vacancies. In other words, it has the
resources and the means it needs. It is not a question of the
Government restricting it or preventing it from doing that; it is
perfectly able to do just
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000695">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause introduces a requirement on the CQC to obtain the approval of
the Secretary of State on its pay and remuneration policies before
making any determination for the staff it employs. Our debate has
probably gone somewhat wider than that, but they are important matters
that go to the heart of the way in which the CQC discharges its
responsibilities. It is wrong of the hon. Lady to gloss over the fact
that much of the work done to establish the CQC—the business
planning and the resource decisions—was undertaken by the
previous Government and the present Government are dealing with the
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000696">&#160;</a>

intervene on a number of points that he raised. What he has just said
is simply inaccurate and, frankly, it does not add to debate to take
interventions, but not from the shadow Minister. For example, the
Minister said that CQC had been set up and that the registration of the
organisations last autumn had been done well. I am sure that he
listened to the Radio 4 programme that made it perfectly clear that
homes that had failed were simply reregistering and therefore being
passed. I am sure that he knows that. I am sure he also knows that at
least a dozen high-quality homes were publicised by CQC as having
failed. I know that because one of those homes is my father’s.
To say that CQC had been established and had managed to register all
these homes in that time and done it well is simply not
accurate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000697">&#160;</a>

can understand how they can compare one local authority’s
standards of social care with another’s. If he does us the

will not go through all the points that I intended to make, but I have
to say that we should not jump to any conclusions about Winterbourne
View. Anyone visiting Winterbourne View could see that all that was
available were bedrooms and a television room. There were no functions;
there was nothing for the residents to do. The sexes were mixed.
Frankly, anyone visiting Winterbourne View would realise that the
fundamental role of those who looked after the residents was to keep
them inside the home and to keep them quiet—essentially, theirs
was a jailer’s role. I will not go into the matter further, but
it is a subject of huge debate. The CQC visited the property on a
number of occasions and ought to have understood that something was
fundamentally wrong with the organisation, without even seeing the
abuse going on. The CQC should have known simply from seeing the
structural problems at Winterbourne View. No alarm bells went off,
which shows that there are fundamental problems with the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000699">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 295(5)(a) provides for regulations to
be made to extend Monitor’s functions to adult social care
services. My concern is to ensure that that is done in a timely
fashion, because at the moment, as the Minister knows, there is a
clearly a great hole in the regulation of the private sector,
particularly in the running of social care homes. Southern Cross is the
most relevant example, and we have to learn lessons from that and move
on. Although I heard the Minister say that proposals for appropriate
regulation of the private sector in the provision of social care will
be introduced in the White Paper in the spring, I am worried that, in
the mean time, a great deal will happen in relation to Southern Cross.
How will the Government proceed on that and what will the regulation
be?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000733">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
important to put on the record that Southern Cross is not the sole
concern. As the Minister knows, a number of care homes, some relatively
large chains, are in difficulty. He does not need me to help him by
naming them; we all know which ones they are. Several hundred homes
will experience difficulties over the next few months, but there seems
to be no safety net or regulation, and no power to intervene other than
the peripheral powers of CQC and the powers of local authorities in
relation to commissioning. It is important to have some power to
intervene, particularly when one provider collapses and a new one comes
forward. When we create a new provider, we must ensure that it is
undeniably robust.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000734">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have spoken
to clause 295 because I want to put our concern on the record. If the
suggested new powers of Monitor, or something of the equipment, only
come out in the White Paper in the spring, how long will it take to get
them into legislation? We need to be able to move fast, particularly in
light of the huge cuts that are being made and the underfunding of
social care. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman saw a report from a
group that is recognised as an expert in this field that showed that
there has been the equivalent of a 3% cut in the money paid to care
homes this year.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000735">&#160;</a>

take that down from the Minister because I have lost my voice. I shall
continue. Given how difficult the situation is, the evidence before our
eyes shows that the viability of many care homes is being undermined
again and again. We will see many more go to the wall and there needs
to be some sort of regulation. I am sure that the Minister will ask why
we did not introduce regulation when we were in government and we will
take that criticism on the chin. However, at the time, we did not have
before us the lesson of Southern Cross. Now that that has happened, we
need to ensure that we

other measures that were not relevant to the people living in the

there was no consistency: inspectors in one county would say one thing,

Member for Islington South and Finsbury that I was willing to allow a
certain amount of leeway on Southern Cross because it was topical and
important, but she has stretched the point about as far as she
reasonably can—I put it no higher than that. If I were doing my
job properly, I would be inviting the Minister, if he so wishes, to
write to the hon. Lady on the specifics of the case, which is clearly
important. Equally clearly, however, while it is illustrative, it is
not entirely relevant to the clause under
discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000742">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady was developing some good points
until she descended into the last bit, asking me to comment on my right
hon. Friend’s remarks in 2004. However, her underlying point is
fair, such as why in July of last year we identified in the White Paper
the fact that we should consider extending Monitor’s role to
adult social care. It is set out in the Bill in such a way that there
is the power to introduce regulations. On several occasions, the hon.
Lady has asked why it cannot be done now. We do not have the power to
make such regulations until the Bill is enacted. One of the
difficulties that the Government have is that, in the current legal
framework, the statutory powers to intervene sit primarily with local
authorities under existing legislation. That is the cause of
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000743">&#160;</a>

Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the hon. Gentleman are
talking about extending the power of Monitor and attaching that power
to the Bill. On the 
<div class="columnNumber">

as saying that the new powers to regulate social care will be discussed
in the White Paper that we will not see until the spring. What is the
time lag? Why are we not getting on with
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000744">&#160;</a>

Bill has to be considered in another place. It will then have to return
to this place. It will take a little more time, therefore, until it is
enacted. As a consequence, the regulation-making powers that we are
discussing mean that we cannot make those regulations. However, we can
and are doing the necessary work to ensure that the right set of
regulations is in place when we have the powers. The danger—it
is a danger—is that we wind up putting in place
disproportionate, ineffective regulations that would arrive too late,
even were we to have started the Bill some months ago, to deal with the
immediate issues of Southern Cross. I have explained our approach to
the issue. Yes, over the coming months we will be considering such
issues and reaching conclusions that will inform the regulations that
will be in the White Paper next
spring.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000745">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have had an exchange of views on the role of inspection. It is entirely
right to say that inspection has to be more than just measuring the
size of rooms. It must be more about other matters such as the quality
of life and the experience of individuals. Opposition Members have made
such an argument, but it is a criticism of much of the regulatory
approach that the previous Government followed for many

not have the full ownership of outrage and shock at what happened

shared on both sides of the Committee. They are similar when it comes
to issues of the quality of care and the experience of people in
substandard care. I really find it troubling that the hon. Lady tries

Does my hon. Friend agree that the most worrying thing that we have
heard from the Government Benches today is the phrase
“liberating the NHS”? The last time that the Government
used “liberating” was in the Postal Services Bill, when
they were selling off and privatising Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000757">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend is precisely right. The reason why
there has been such anger, outrage and opposition to this
Government’s Bill is that people do not trust the Conservatives
on the NHS. From now on, neither will they trust the Liberal Democrats.
When will the hon. Member for Southport and the Minister’s
friends in the other place actually do the job that they should have
been doing if they had the principles of the NHS at heart?<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000758">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One reason why
we do not want the Bill to pass is that we have not been able to
scrutinise the Government’s intentions properly. The Minister
shakes his head. We did not get to discuss the clauses that will allow
GPs to give themselves bonuses. We were not allowed to discuss the
clauses that the Government say will deal with conflicts of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000759">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
important, I do not believe that it is just about what we in the
Committee do to scrutinise the Bill; crucially, it is about what
patient, professional and other organisations do. I point out that
earlier this week, we finally got the evidence from Monitor about its
role, but we had finished discussing the changes to its role the week
before. Today, at 4.30, we got evidence from the Royal College of
Physicians, which represents hospital doctors in this country and has
serious concerns. The first involves the Government’s proposal
that the secondary care doctor on the board of the new clinical
commissioning group must come from an outside area. The Royal College
of Physicians
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000760">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
do not support the assertion that the secondary care specialist on the
clinical commissioning group board must not be employed by a local

               </p>
               <p>It
asks for much greater clarification of how European procurement and
competition law will apply and proposes far greater and more robust
mechanisms for ensuring that secondary care is involved in health and
well-being boards, health and well-being strategies and so on. It is

               <p class="tabbed">Let us be
honest about what has happened here. There has been a massive, top-down
reorganisation, causing chaos and confusion in the NHS. The Government,
including the Liberal Democrats, have forced a restructuring on to
people, which they promised they would not do. If Members have spoken
to anyone in their primary care trusts or strategic health authorities,
or people in our hospitals who are trying to get changes through, or
anyone in the service, they will know that the Government’s
plans have caused a huge problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000774">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">What will the
result be for patients, who, after all, are what Opposition Members
believe in? Last week, we heard that, despite the Prime
Minister’s promise to keep control of waiting times, there are
four times as many people waiting more than six weeks for their
diagnostic tests than at this time last year. There are 10 times more
people waiting more than three months, and only yesterday, we heard
that 18-week waits are up by a third compared with May last year.
Waiting times are also higher than the year-to-year figures from April
to April, which were up 24%.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000775">&#160;</a>

Members do not want the Bill to proceed, and let me make it clear why.
The Secretary of State and the Prime Minister like to say that the
choice is between change and no change. They are wrong. The choice is
between the right change and the wrong change, and the Bill proposes
the wrong change. If Government Members have not picked up on that yet,
let me explain
why.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000778">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
know that the NHS needs to change to deliver better care for people
with long-term chronic conditions and for an ageing population. The NHS
also needs to centralise some services in specialist centres so that
patients benefit from technological advances and from

one case of strategic planning that has helped to improve stroke
services in London was led by the strategic health authority. I think

                  </strong> The hon. Lady will accept, and we would agree,
that one of the key problems in the NHS, as we heard from the
witnesses, is that there is too much silo working. The King’s
Fund has clearly elaborated in its recent report on silo working among
GPs, saying that it does not tackle health care inequalities or the
issues involved in dealing with an ageing population. Clearly, the
current system does not work very well. The reforms are about tackling
issues such as medical comorbidities by putting commissioning in one
place, mostly in primary care. That will help to address the problem of
an ageing population because there will be co-ordinated thinking and
joined-up
care.<a class="bkMark" name="1107153000781">&#160;</a>
