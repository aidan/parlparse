<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000150"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with  this
we are discussing amendment 21, in clause 24, page 15,
line 21, leave out paragraphs (b) to
(d).</div><a name="09020311000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000151"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b> Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I also welcome members of the
Committee back to the Bill scrutiny
proceedings.</div><a name="09020311000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was not certain whether the hon. Member for Northampton, South had
finished his intervention when we adjourned last Thursday, but I have
checked the record and it appears that he had. I get the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;I get it every time he makes
it&#151;and he will find that there is provision, particularly in the
guidance, for encouraging local authorities to deal with businesses
that have a particular interest in a project&#146;s success
throughout its delivery life, not just during the period leading up to
the potential introduction of a business rate supplement that helps to
pay for
it.</div><a name="09020311000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Cornwall explained that amendment 20 would
require the Secretary of State to give directions that provide refunds
to ratepayers in areas where she exercises her power to cancel a BRS,
but I think he understands that the Bill already gives the Secretary of
State the power to do that. The Bill therefore clearly contains the
principle that that may well be the appropriate and right thing for the
Secretary of State to do.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="09020311000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
about the amendments is that there could be wide-ranging consequences ,
probably unintended by the hon. Gentleman. The principal risk is that
the Secretary of State would find it more difficult to exercise her
power to cancel if refunds were required and automatically followed,
whatever the financial consequences for the local authority and
whatever stage a project and payments under a BRS had reached. The
provision is therefore designed to ensure that there are safeguards
that acknowledge the concerns that the hon. Gentleman and other right
hon. and hon. Members have voiced on behalf of business interests, as
well as the practicalities for local authorities and
ratepayers.</div><a name="09020311000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State has to balance those issues as part of her job and
she owes public law duties not only to ratepayers, but to local
authorities. If the amendment were made and there were an automatic
right to full refunds of all amounts paid, it could prove in practice
more difficult to cancel a BRS in a reasonable
way.</div><a name="09020311000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020311000152"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I am grateful to the
Minister for the way he has considered the intention behind my
amendment. The principle that I wish to stress is that available
surplus moneys&#151;moneys that have not been spent up to the point
at which a scheme fails or draws to a halt, or the Secretary of State
needs to intervene to force that to happen&#151;could be paid back,
rather than moneys that have already been spent up to that point being
refunded. It is clearly not my intention to penalise a local
authority&#146;s taxpayers for liabilities that have already been
incurred, but I would prefer that any surplus moneys available be sent
back, rather than sit in an account and used for some other
purpose.</div><a name="09020311000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000153"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
clarification of his intent, but it is not entirely captured in his
amendment, which is what I am addressing. The power and principle that
any surplus funds could be directed towards refunds are clearly
established in the Bill. By taking away the Secretary of State&#146;s
power to act in a way appropriate to particular circumstances that are
impossible to anticipate in detail from our vantage point, the
amendment could have the unintended consequence of reducing some of the
protection that the hon. Gentleman would like for the interests of
businesses that he wants to promote. It might create further
difficulties and make those consequences wider ranging if the refund
was automatic in the event of any BRS cancellation.</div>
<a name="09020311000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also provides the Secretary of State with a power to take a number of
steps before a full-blown cancellation of a BRS&#151;including
refunds of surpluses or refunds without a cancellation&#151;so that
the potential for a refund does not depend on the cancellation of a
BRS. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich was
understandably concerned about that, as it has the potential be an
almost nuclear power. He was concerned that it might be used not in a
measured way, but to remove a BRS at some point in the
future.</div>
<a name="09020311000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
point that the phrase in the clause, &#147;materially
inconsistent&#148; with the prospectus, is not defined, but it means
that a levying authority has made more than a minor deviation from the
terms of its prospectus. If, when the project was undertaken, the
levying authority did something extra that had a relatively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>small effect on the cost, but no effect on the level of the BRS, it is
very unlikely that that would be considered materially inconsistent and
that it would be sufficiently strong grounds for the Secretary of State
to consider a full-blown cancellation of the BRS. However, if a levying
authority diverted revenue from the BRS from one project to another,
clearly that might be materially inconsistent. From the
Committee&#146;s point of view, at this stage, any sort of judgment
on intervention, including cancellation, would be based on a test of
fact and a test of
degree.</div><a name="09020311000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020311000154"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I am
grateful for my right hon. Friend&#146;s explanation of the way in
which the phrase &#147;materially inconsistent&#148; is likely to
be interpreted in practice. The worry that I expressed in our last
sitting was that subsection (2)(c) may relate to information provided
in the course of consultation. I gave the example of what might be said
by a council officer during a consultation, which could then be used by
those unsympathetic to a BID to seek perhaps even judicial review, on
the ground that something was said that was materially inconsistent
with the objectives, even if that had not been confirmed in writing. I
do not want to push that point too hard, but I am nervous. I hope that
my right hon. Friend will reflect on whether the phrasing is
appropriate to ensure his objective, to which I entirely subscribe, or
whether there might be
loopholes.</div><a name="09020311000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000155"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for not
wishing to press the point too hard. He does not need to because I will
move on to that. Having dealt with the bigger context and what are
likely to be the core tests in the individual circumstances which any
Secretary of State might need to bring to bear, I take the point that
he has raised regarding subsection (2)(c) and will consider it further.
If I conclude that any clarification is necessary, either in the
legislation or in the guidance, I will provide it, but I am grateful to
him for raising the matter.</div>
<a name="09020311000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, there are a number of other steps short of the cancellation of
a BRS that the Secretary of State could take if she believes that there
is a material inconsistency in relation to a BRS and its use. The
clause allows the appropriate flexibility for action in specific
circumstances and, of course, there will be a range of levels of
intervention, as hon. Members will be aware, short of the Secretary of
State having to step in if there is concern or evidence that a local
authority is going off track in its use of the BRS. Those are generally
the established support and intervention powers that are available to
local and central Government in a wide range of
circumstances.</div><a name="09020311000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that my remarks have been helpful to the Committee and that the
hon. Member for North Cornwall will not need to press amendment 20. I
commend the clause to the Committee and I hope that hon. Members will
allow it to stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020311000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000156"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I welcome you to another morning&#146;s
entertainment watching our deliberations from the Chair, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09020311000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
intend to press the amendments to the vote. I am somewhat reassured by
the Minister&#146;s saying that flexibility is not an indication that
money would not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>returned to bill payers as a matter of course and that the aim would be
to return it wherever possible, although there might be occasions when
that would not be appropriate. I am sure that the matter will receive
further consideration&#151;perhaps the other place will want to
consider it, unencumbered by any
interests.</div><a name="09020311000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister has taken on board the Opposition&#146;s
concerns about possible problems were money to be held back following
the cancellation of a scheme. There is an indication on the record that
the aim would be to return money as a matter of course, although some
flexibility may be necessary. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09020311000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="09020311000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020311000157"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): It is a pleasure to welcome
you back to the Committee, Mr. Atkinson, in what might be
our final
sitting.</div><a name="09020311000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may, I will reiterate the point that I made on the audit of
information under the clause. I have not tabled an amendment, but I ask
the Minister to consider on Report expanding the remit of the clause to
place on a levying authority that chooses to introduce the BRS an
obligation to make information on the progress of the project available
to the public. That could be done not only through the
authority&#146;s accounts, but through a statement that could be made
available to the BRS payers&#151;say, annually&#151;so that there
was accountability to those payers for the levy that they have been
charged.</div><a name="09020311000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000158"></a>John
Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman made that case clearly and
strongly in previous discussions. Clause 25 is perhaps not the most
appropriate point to consider that issue or such amendments, not least
because it provides for billing authorities in two-tier areas to make
information available to the levying authority where that is necessary
for the administration of the BRS. However, in general terms, as I
think my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has indicated to him, our
basic approach in framing the legislation is to look to any potential
levying authority to prepare projects and the actual use of a BRS in an
open and consultative manner. The general question of what should be
required of levying authorities in carrying out that responsibility if
they choose to exercise the powers is dealt with in the draft guidance,
which is now out for
consultation.</div><a name="09020311000129"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09020311000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend and I have listened carefully to the points that the hon.
Gentleman and other members of the Committee have made about the open,
consultative provision of information. We will reflect further on the
specific point that he has made, which essentially is to ensure that
that approach is continued once a BRS is introduced, and not just in
the period up to its potential introduction.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div><a name="09020311000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause, as
I explained briefly, allows the levying authority to gather the
information that it needs to fulfil its duties under the Bill, while
ensuring that the information that it gains from the billing
authorities cannot be exploited or misused, but is used only for the
particular purposes. The safeguards are in place, setting out clearly
that the levying authority can use the information only for the
purposes of the BRS and not for any other use, and that the information
cannot be disclosed to another authority for other, non-BRS-related
business. On that basis, I hope that members of the Committee will see
the importance of the
clause.</div><a name="09020311000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020311000159"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I do not disagree
with the Minister&#146;s comments, and I take his point about the
safeguards. However, subsection (3) makes provision for charging a fee
on a discretionary basis. Does the Minister envisage a covering of
costs by the billing authority? Since it is all council tax
payers&#146; money at the end of the day, I should imagine anyone
will welcome any degree of cost shunting between the two tiers of
authority. I hope that that will be made clear in the guidance, and
dealt with on a sensible
basis.</div><a name="09020311000047"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000161"></a>John
Healey:</b> The guidance, which is currently undergoing a
12-week consultation in its draft form, is an important part of
explaining to local authorities, businesses and other groups with an
interest in the projects that a BRS may support how the process of
reaching a decision to introduce a BRS should work. The clause requires
the levying authorities to have regard to any guidance that the
Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers may issue. In other words, it
gives statutory force&#151;the bite that we may need&#151;to any
guidance, especially on which projects may be regarded as appropriate
to be funded by a BRS and on how the levying authority will demonstrate
that it would not have incurred the expenditure had it not introduced a
BRS.</div><a name="09020311000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that a basic level of content is included in the
prospectus, which will provide the grounding for a BRS. We expect the
documents not only to be rigorous in their assessment of a project, but
to be understood easily by the wider community, other interest groups
and local residents. The prospectus needs to be of a high standard,
setting out the pros and cons of a project for everyone. Our guidance
is an important part of that, and the Committee&#146;s deliberations
have made a useful contribution to developing any further thinking that
we  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>may need in preparation for the final guidance, which we will consider
alongside any responses that we receive during the consultation
process.</div><a name="09020311000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000162"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I understand absolutely that the guidance needs
a statutory force to have any real value. I am interested in what may
happen in the future, should the guidance be changed based on the
experience of processes that have been taken up in some parts of the
country where schemes have been successful or otherwise. What provision
is there for schemes that have reached the prospectus stage or have got
part of the way through the process, so that a great deal of work has
been done based on guidance that has then been altered? Are there
safeguards to help those in that position? I am thinking of local
authorities that have drawn up costings and a prospectus based on
guidance that may have subsequently been changed. Is there a cut-off so
that their projects can go forward under the guidance that applied
before such changes came into force?</div>

from the Local Government Association, which expressed a little
disappointment that there had not been more pre-consultation and was
hoping for more detail. I do not pass judgment on the details of that
note, but I hope that he will assure us that there will be a rigorous

know, want to give them careful consideration, I realise that he may
not be able to give us an exact timetable, but if he has some idea of
when we can expect to see the completed guidance and of how it might
fit in with the Bill&#146;s departure from this House to another
place, it might be helpful to know. I am sure that on some points,
perfectly understandably, further scrutiny will be sought, to see how
our debates and other representations have been incorporated into the
guidelines, as all of us on both sides of the Committee
want.</div>
<a name="09020311000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000166"></a>John
Healey:</b> To the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst,
let me say that of course the representations we receive and any
further discussions that are requested and are appropriate with
business organisations, local government bodies or other interest
groups will be picked up and pursued rigorously during the 12-week
consultation period. I am sure that the LGA can get its act together in
12 weeks to give us a full account of local government&#146;s
concerns and the points it wishes to make; I look forward to its
response to the consultation. My intention, as it has been with every
element of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>preparation for the Bill, is not to delay either clarification or
confirmation of the approach we wish to take, not least because for
those authorities&#151;in London, in particular&#151;that want to
make early use of the powers, should Parliament pass the Bill, the
greater certainty they have and the earlier they have it, the
better.</div>
<a name="09020311000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the relationship with parliamentary consideration of the Bill,
that approach has pros and cons. If we are able to produce the guidance
that we determine to be final early, it may play a role in informing
the debate in another place. On the other hand, holding back a little
longer, perhaps beyond the end of the formal consultation period, may
give Members of the other place the opportunity to feel that fresh
points that they may have to make could be taken into account. That is
a judgment that I will make closer to the time.</div>
<a name="09020311000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">To the hon.
Member for North Cornwall, let me say in all honesty that there can be
no guarantee regarding the possibility of updating guidance. However,
there may be a degree of reassurance for him in subsection (2), where
much of the content of the guidance is linked to duties or requirements
set out in the Bill. In other words, the guidance is developed and will
be published within the framework and the constraints of the Bill
itself. The guidance is largely a matter of filling the gaps, rather
than writing a set of rules afresh. Those who look to the guidance that
we will produce to base work on a project or a BRS must be reassured to
know that it would be difficult to change it lock, stock and barrel,
but clearly there may be updates to the guidance in the
future.</div>
<a name="09020311000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000167"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am talking, for example, about subsection
(2)(a) where it refers
to</div><a name="09020311000121"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
kinds of projects which may, and may not, be regarded as appropriate
ones&#148;.</div><a name="09020311000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be a fairly fundamental change if, for example, the guidance were
updated to modify the types of scheme that are to be included. That
would have serious consequences for a proposal that is being drawn up.
I merely want such issues to be
considered.</div><a name="09020311000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000168"></a>John
Healey:</b> I understand. Nevertheless, if the hon. Gentleman
looks at the Bill, he will see that it contains specific constraints
linked to projects that will promote economic development, rather than
other aims, as well as statutory constraints on using BRS to fund
services that local authorities have a statutory responsibility to
provide. He has helped by drawing attention to a specific example of
how the guidance will describe or fill in the gaps in the fuller
picture, but the Bill itself lays out the framework within which the
guidance and any BRS will have to be
introduced.</div><a name="09020311000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000169"></a>John
Healey:</b> I shall speak briefly to this clause because the
special introductory provision requires comment. It is needed because
big projects can take some time to get under way and we do not want to
exclude authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>that may have already been working in partnership with local businesses
and business organisations, developing detailed plans based on using
BRS as an element of their budget stream. That applies in particular to
projects that in the long term will bring real benefits to wide areas.
The clause therefore provides a general power to do that, and
subsection (6) specifically allows the Secretary of State to make
regulations on the establishment and operation of a BRS in London in
the period up to 1 April
2012.</div><a name="09020311000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020311000170"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): Is
the Minister not concerned that the nature of the provision goes to the
heart of what I suspect will be an ongoing concern for both individual
businesses and large business organisations: additionality? If a
programme is effectively already in place after much thought and
consultation with local businesses, and some sort of plan has been
devised in the preceding years, waiting for BRS to come on board goes
to the very heart of concerns about additionality. I am not saying that
it is an easy problem for the Minister to grapple with, but we risk
making business more cynical, particularly in these difficult times,
about having to pay for something through a BRS that it believes should
already have been paid for.</div>
<a name="09020311000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000171"></a>John
Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. However, we discussed
in both the evidence and the scrutiny sittings that BRS in the case of
Crossrail and London is an essential element, without which the funding
package for the Crossrail project would not stand up and that project
would come to a juddering halt. That will be the consequence if this
House and the other place do not ultimately approve the Bill&#146;s
provisions. I have not heard the concept of additionality persuasively
contested in the case of Crossrail. The importance of that certainty
and confidence in making such big projects work needs to be balanced
against the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern, and the way to deal with
that is to make the clause&#146;s powerful provision properly
time-limited.</div><a name="09020311000130"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09020311000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the special introductory provision can be used only up
until 1 April 2012. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we
are trying to strike the balance between not stopping big projects such
as Crossrail in their tracks, where a considerable amount of work has
appropriately gone on, and allowing what some might regard as a
potential loophole to the principle of additionality for BRS in any
future
projects.</div><a name="09020311000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000172"></a>John
Healey:</b> The clause is a standard but important element of
the Bill. It creates regulation-making powers for the Secretary of
State and for Welsh Ministers who can, in appropriate circumstances,
amend both primary and secondary legislation. We anticipate that the
power 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>will need to be exercised only in relation to secondary legislation, as
we have already made provision in the Bill to make amendments to
primary legislation that we have identified will be necessary for the
introduction and operation of a
BRS.</div><a name="09020311000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
provisions are fairly standard legislative practice, simply because it
cannot be ruled out that there will be provisions in primary
legislation which will need amending. Similar provisions exist in
section 237 of the Planning Act 2008, in section 145 of the Pensions
Act 2008 and in section 167 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008. Any
regulations made under clause 28 will, if they amend primary
legislation, be subject to the affirmative procedure, and regulations
amending secondary legislation will be subject to the negative
procedure.</div><a name="09020311000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000173"></a>John
Healey:</b> The clause applies to all the secondary
legislation-making powers in the Bill. We have spelt this out because,
as it is a revenue-raising Bill, it is important that there are no gaps
in the BRS system. The power in the clause is important to our ability
to achieve that.</div>
<a name="09020311000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers
are all exercisable by making regulations, apart from the power to make
a commencement order under clause 32. In particular, clause 29(3)
provides standard scope and flexibility for that provision to be
made</div>
<a name="09020311000122"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;generally or
only for specific cases&#148;,</div>
<a name="09020311000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">and for</div>
<a name="09020311000123"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;different
provision for different cases or areas&#148;</div>
<a name="09020311000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">to be made. In
addition, the subsection provides for secondary legislation
to</div><a name="09020311000124"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional, transitory or
savings provision.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020311000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said
earlier that these are standard provisions. I questioned officials on
whether &#147;transitory&#148; was a standard component of such
clauses and was told, &#147;It comes and goes.&#148; That reflects
the fact that we may make regulations under the special introductory
provision that we have just discussed, which is available for a limited
period.</div><a name="09020311000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000174"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Can the Minister can help me? Do those who advise
him think that it is transitory, or do they consider that it is
transitory?</div><a name="09020311000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000175"></a>John
Healey:</b> They are confident. They are confident that that
element that comes and goes in other legislation is required here
simply because we need to give effect to what will be transitory
provisions if regulations are required under clause
27.</div><a name="09020311000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that I have published a statement of intent that
indicates how we intend to approach the main regulation-making powers
under the Bill. I can confirm&#151;this will be of particular
interest in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>another place&#151;that I do not consider that any exercise of Commons
privilege over the regulation-making powers is required or appropriate.
Essentially, local government revenue raising could be subject to
Commons privilege, but generally that privilege is not asserted. In the
case of the BRS, that would not be appropriate because such revenue
will not come to the central Exchequer, but will be collected and held
at local authority level, so it would not be appropriate to consider
subjecting it to any form of Commons privilege. I am sure that Members
of the other place will appreciate that confirmation and will look
forward to the scrutiny role that they will play on all the
regulations, as well as the
Bill.</div><a name="09020311000089"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000179"></a>John
Healey:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson.
Before you close our proceedings, may I thank you and Mrs.
Dean for the way in which you have chaired and guided our proceedings?
You have been very fair and we have maintained a fair pace. I am
grateful to you for that.</div>
<a name="09020311000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
staff of the <i class="I">Official Report</i> and the House for making sure that
we have been well looked after and that our proceedings have been well
documented. I also thank the officials&#151;the Committee&#146;s
pace, rigour and scrutiny have certainly kept them on their toes. My
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have tried to keep on our toes as
well.</div><a name="09020311000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee is one of the strongest that I have served on, in the sense
that it brings together Members with expertise in local and national
Government and in the private and public sectors, and&#151;this
reflects the nature of the Bill itself&#151;with experience of and an
interest in both London and the rest of the country. That has come
through clearly in the way that the Committee has handled its evidence
and scrutiny sessions as part of the process of
legislating.</div><a name="09020311000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Opposition spokesmen, the hon. Members for Bromley and
Chislehurst and for North Cornwall. I pay tribute to the way in which
they have dealt with the differences between us in a rigorous but
measured way, although their positions are still riddled with
contradictions, which I look forward to debating further on Report and
Third
Reading.</div><a name="09020311000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State started his remarks by
saying that this Committee was his maiden voyage: only somebody who
represents a constituency in landlocked London could describe the
Committee&#146;s proceedings in maritime terms. However, he has
sailed through the proceedings; he has not tacked under pressure, but
has trimmed when appropriate&#151;when we have heard strong,
persuasive arguments from both sides of the Committee. I am sure that
this is the first of many Bills that he will pilot through the House,
and I look forward to his leading on other
Bills.</div><a name="09020311000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000180"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. I add my thanks and observations to those of the Minister.
For once, he and I are entirely in accord, with just one
exception.</div><a name="09020311000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
and all my hon. Friends are grateful to you and Mrs. Dean
for your courtesy. I am also grateful to the staff of the House, the
<i class="I">Official Report</i> and the officials. Some of the questions that we
have bowled up have been dealt with courteously and
efficiently.</div><a name="09020311000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that all right hon. and hon. Members agree that this has been a
rigorous but good-natured Committee. We are fortunate, as the Minister
rightly said, in the breadth of experience that has been brought to
bear. That means that although our scrutiny of the Bill was short
compared with that of some of the other Bills with which the Minister
for Local Government and I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>have had to deal recently, it has none the less been constructive, and I
am grateful for that.</div>
<a name="09020311000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Whips on both sides for the expedition with which they have dealt with
our proceedings&#151;I am told that it is always prudent to say that.
I thank both Ministers for their courtesy throughout, and the hon.
Member for North Cornwall, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats. All in
all, ours has been a civilised
Committee.</div><a name="09020311000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is, I think, the first time that I have managed to get through a
Committee without any football references, perhaps because the
situation of my team and that of the hon. Member for Wigan means that
we need to be neither defensive nor unduly triumphant. That is probably
why we passed through without any of the analogies that we sometimes
hear.</div><a name="09020311000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that all my hon. Friends will agree with those remarks, which I
have made on a most considered
basis.</div><a name="09020311000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020311000181"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. I thank you and Mrs. Dean for the way in which you
have allowed us to have a full and open discussion of the matters
before us, while keeping us firmly in order.</div>
<a name="09020311000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
staff of the House and the <i class="I">Official Report</i> for the way in which
they have ensured that we have had everything necessary to hand, which
has enabled us to work effectively. I also thank my research staff, who
have always been helpful in tabling amendments on time&#151;just
about&#151;when I have been dashing about doing other
things.</div><a name="09020311000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the Minister&#146;s comments on the way in which the Committee
conducted itself as a whole. We have had the chance to discuss the
issues. Political points aside&#151;there were undoubtedly many of
those&#151;each Member brought little insights to our debates that
helped the whole Committee, and we are collectively better off because
of
that.</div><a name="09020311000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me reciprocate the comments made by the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst and say that it is always a pleasure to serve on a
Committee with him. The Minister for Local Government has, as usual,
been generous in his praise and serious in his consideration of the
amendments&#151;if not generous in accepting them. I, too,
congratulate the Under-Secretary of State on his maiden voyage through
the choppy waters of Crossrail and the
BRS.</div><a name="09020311000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to further consideration of the Bill when it is reported
to the House and to seeing what those in the other place make of it. I
