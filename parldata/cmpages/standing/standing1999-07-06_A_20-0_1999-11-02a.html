<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we start, I should point out to members of the Committee that the Hansard record of the seventeenth sitting of our proceedings on Thursday morning contains some printing errors. It is being reprinted, and should be available on Thursday or Friday.
<H4><center>Clause 98</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to impose penalties in</center></H4>
cases of market abuse
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 311, in page 45, line 33, after `satisfied', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`beyond reasonable doubt'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the power to impose potentially substantial penalties. On hearing about that, ears naturally pricked up all over the financial markets. The amendment would ensure that the Financial Services Authority is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of a person's guilt before a penalty is imposed on him. The FSA will be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity and the standard of proof should therefore be that which applies in criminal cases. It is not good enough to rely merely on the balance of probability, not least because cases could be reviewed judicially and, presumably, under the European convention on human rights. Presumption of innocence and criminal standards of proof should both play an important role in cases in which penalties are being applied.
<P>
The Committee discussed this issue last Thursday in connection with clause 63, to which I tabled a similar amendment about the FSA's disciplinary powers. On that occasion, the Economic Secretary said that the amendment was unnecessary because the FSA should always exercise its powers rationally. I am sure that it will do so, but that argument does not entirely do the trick in this case. One can envisage circumstances in which the FSA behaved rationally—or, at least, not irrationally—but still levied a penalty on the grounds of suspicion only. It might claim that there was nothing irrational about doing so; that it was necessary in order to deter other wrongdoers or because a strong balance of probability was involved. However, that would certainly not measure up to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt. The amendment should be incorporated as a safeguard in respect of cases where penalties may be considerable and reputations and livelihoods at stake.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's other point about clause 63 was that a long process would have been undergone before someone was finally found guilty. A warning notice would have been issued, probably accompanied by informal exchanges. The FSA might have undertaken an investigation before issuing that warning notice, and following the issue of the notice, the accused person would have had an opportunity to make representations and then to refer the entire case to a tribunal. It was argued that, given the safeguards involved in those various procedures, it was perhaps unreasonable to require the FSA to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before it launched the process. I recognised the force of that argument. However, I do not think that it is entirely relevant in this case; if I am wrong, perhaps the Economic Secretary would enlighten us. As we are considering a power to impose penalties, it is even more vital, given the brevity of the clause, to insert the words ``beyond reasonable doubt'' as a safeguard.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> Amendment No. 311 deals with a matter that has already been raised by Opposition Members in relation to part V of the Bill and amendment No. 307. It also suggests that the FSA must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before imposing penalties on a person whom the authority believes to have engaged in market abuse, or to have induced another person to engage in market abuse. We discussed the issue at length previously, but I will reiterate the Government's view for the benefit of the Committee.
<P>
It is not right to talk about standards of proof when referring to a body exercising statutory discretion. As I said before, the FSA should exercise its powers rationally. I agree entirely that the FSA should be required to be satisfied of the facts before taking action, and we believe that the clause provides for that.
<P>
Under the Bill, the FSA must reach a view on whether it believes a person has engaged in market abuse, and, therefore, whether it will impose a penalty. It must issue a warning notice, which will allow the person concerned to make representations and—should it decide to proceed—a decision notice, which will trigger the person's right to take the matter to the independent tribunal.
<P>
The tribunal will provide not only a safeguard but a strong incentive for the FSA to take the right initial decision. If a case is referred to the tribunal, it will be subject to the appropriate civil standard of proof. As the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) made clear to the Burns Committee—with the support of learned witnesses—the sliding scale takes account of the seriousness of the behaviour or failing alleged by the FSA. The more serious the behaviour, the higher the standard that will be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary has said, again, that although the FSA will exercise discretion, it will have to act rationally. The opposite of rational is irrational, and a requirement not to act irrationally would be fairly low. I can imagine many situations in which it would be rational for the FSA to levy a penalty, but risky, as it would not need to be certain beyond reasonable doubt.
<P>
The FSA should measure up to the same standards that it is inclined to require of other people. It must be under strict standards of proof, because, otherwise, an asymmetry will develop—other people will be caught out for lower standards, while the FSA itself will not. I accept the Economic Secretary's point that there is a sliding scale, and a requirement that all penalties should be imposed under such a higher standard of proof would perhaps impose too much of a straitjacket. In the light of that, I shall not press the amendment to a vote. However, I should like this general point to be reiterated elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On asymmetry, it is worth pointing out that the tribunal will be able to award costs if the FSA acts unreasonably. That will be dealt with in rules made by the Lord Chancellor, which we will discuss in the context of part VIII of the Bill. Therefore, the subject is not closed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): We do not wish to move amendment No. 143, Mr Atkinson. However, I should point out at this stage that clause 98 will apply to a person who does not engage in market abuse but who induces another so to do. We welcome Government amendment No. 359, which we shall presently reach, because it goes slightly further than our own. Amendment No. 395 would have replaced the word ``induced'' with the word ``procured'', but Government amendment No. 359, which will replace ``induced'' with ``required or encouraged'', makes the situation clearer. The Government and the Opposition are getting at the same point, and we support the Government's amendment.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 359, in page 45, line 35, leave out `induced' and insert `required or encouraged'.—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 312, in page 45, line 37, after `may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, after giving him an opportunity to make representations as to why a penalty should not be imposed,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the person who has a penalty levied on him is given the opportunity to make representations. Article 6 of the European convention on human rights allows someone who is accused to make representations—it states that that right should be accorded to him. The amendment is reasonable, and failure to agree to it could bring us into conflict with the European convention. The worst that could happen to the Bill would be for some of its provisions to be dragged through the courts on the grounds of their incompatibility with article 6. That would make a great deal of money for many lawyers, but the market would meanwhile run riot. We must be certain that nothing that we do breaches any of those imported rights.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will comment on that point and on my more general point, which involves the fact that it is only fair and just for people to be able to make representations. The fact that such allowances are made elsewhere does not alter the need to make such a provision explicit in the clause.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment, which would ensure that the FSA could make representations about the imposition of a penalty for market abuse, is unnecessary. Clauses 100 and 101, which we shall soon reach, set out the procedure that will allow the FSA to impose penalties for market abuse, and they make provision for representations. Clause 100 states clearly that before imposing a penalty, the FSA must issue the relevant person with a warning notice. Clause 338(3) will ensure that the person on whom the notice is served has sufficient time in which to make representations. The FSA can issue a decision notice only if it is unpersuaded by those representations and intends to impose a penalty under clause 98. Under clause 101, the person concerned will have the opportunity to take the matter to the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary correctly says that the person can make representations before the penalty stage is reached, but the amendment would ensure that once the penalty level had been established, he could make representations about it. Do the procedures to which she alluded give people the opportunity to make representations about the level of the fine?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am advised that the answer is yes. I do not see what amendment No. 312 could add to the process. In the light of my assurance that a person will be able to make representations at that point, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for that elucidation, which I assume makes it clear that representations that can be made in the light of allegations by the FSA will include the right to make representations about the level of fines. That is important because, as was said, there is a sliding scale of penalties and a standard of proof, depending on the seriousness of the case. People who face colossal and entirely unexpected fines should be able to make representations about that and not simply about whether they are guilty of market abuse. I assume that the Economic Secretary agrees, and in the light of her assurances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 98, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 99</center></H4>
<H4><center>Statement of policy</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 360, in page 46, line 1, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Authority's policy in determining what the amount of a penalty should be must include having regard to—
<P>
(a) whether the behaviour in respect of which the penalty is to be imposed had an adverse effect on the market in question and, if it did, how serious that effect was;
<P>
(b) the extent to which that behaviour was deliberate or reckless; and
<P>
(c) whether the person on whom the penalty is to be imposed is an individual.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause has the same effect as clause 67, which we have already debated, and will require the FSA to publish a statement on its policy on imposing penalties, which must cover the circumstances in which it would seek to impose a penalty, and on the amount of any penalty.
<P>
The FSA issued consultation document number 17, entitled ``Enforcing the new regime'', which sets out its initial thoughts. Among other things, in deciding whether to impose a penalty, the FSA has said that it will have regard to the nature and seriousness of the misconduct in question, including the extent of any losses incurred or costs imposed on other users of the market; the conduct of the person concerned, including whether it has been the subject of a warning or other action by a regulatory authority; and factors such as the sophistication of the users of the market in question and the extent to which the conduct can be adequately addressed by other market authorities.
<P>
With regard to the level of any penalty, the FSA stated in consultation paper 17 that the following factors were relevant in determining the appropriate penalty: the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the amount of profits accrued or loss avoided, and the size, financial resources and other circumstances of the firm or individual in question. In general, respondents to the consultation considered those factors to be reasonable.
<P>
We have made it clear in paragraph 16 to schedule 1 that, when deciding the amount of a penalty, the FSA must take no account of the cost of the investigation. Like the policy statement for clause 67 and the general disciplinary context of clause 182, this policy statement will give those who may be affected a clear idea of the consequences of misconduct or malpractice.
<P>
Our amendment will implement the recommendation, made in paragraph 18 of the Joint Committee's second report, that the Bill should at least require that, in setting the amount of any fine, regard should be paid to the mischief achieved or intended, and to whether the offender is an individual or a firm. The Joint Committee felt that, if the FSA's power to impose unlimited fines were in some way qualified in the Bill, it would look less like a criminal sanction. In our response, we made it clear that we do not agree that the factors that the Joint Committee set out are relevant in determining whether the sanction is criminal for either UK or ECHR purposes. Our reasoning on ECHR issues was set out in full in our memorandum of 14 May to the Joint Committee and explained to the Committee by our legal advisers, so I do not propose to go into it again now. However, we agreed with the Joint Committee that it would be reasonable for the FSA to take such factors into account.
<P>
As I have outlined, prior to the Joint Committee report, the FSA proposed that such considerations would feature in its policy statement. Nevertheless, we thought it worthwhile to place a duty on it in the Bill along the lines recommended by the Joint Committee. That is another example of the Government taking careful note of the Joint Committee's recommendations.
<P>
Of course, such factors are not the only ones that the FSA could—or, indeed, should—take into account when deciding the amount of a penalty. Other factors will clearly be relevant. In the case of market abuse, for example, the FSA will be interested in the effect that such an abuse could have had on the market had it been successful, as well as the effect that it actually had.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments.
<P>
Paragraph (b) of the amendment alludes to intention, which we have debated at some length. In general, behaviour that is not deliberate or reckless should not constitute market abuse. We have covered that already. The FSA is creating hurdles for other people that are higher than those it is creating for itself, as it has statutory immunity even when acting negligently or recklessly. However, others who act negligently or recklessly are considered to be engaged in market abuse. We shall debate that when we come to discuss various forms of statutory immunity.
<P>
The amendment cites
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the extent to which that behaviour was deliberate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Almost all behaviour is deliberate, unless it is a mistake. Surely the issue is whether the market abuse was deliberate. One can imagine someone behaving deliberately, intending to do certain things. However, whether that deliberate behaviour constitutes market abuse is a different issue. Therefore, the amendment would be clearer if it stated that the authority must have regard to the extent to which the market abuse was deliberate or reckless. I trust that the Minister will have time to comment on that.
<P>
I turn to the question of the individual. A fine that is large for an individual may be a mere flea bite for Goldman Sachs or a major individual. Therefore, in practice, the FSA will want to tune its penalties to suit the kind of person with whom it is dealing. However, that is not without controversy, as it means that the FSA should treat similar offences in different ways, according to the means or standing of the person breaking the rules.
<P>
I shall address the question of criminality. A lot of evidence to the Joint Committee suggested that a large penalty is a punishment, making the entire procedure criminal, almost by definition. On the other hand, there will be a civil regime, if the aim is simply to compensate the victim or return affairs to what they were prior to the market abuse. However, once large fines are imposed, matters enter the criminal category. High-ranking lawyers gave us that advice, as did two notable peers, Lord Hobhouse and—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Lord Lester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, Lord Lester: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Both asserted that. Therefore, this part of the amendment may be an attempt to ensure that for individuals it is kept below the criminal threshold. I would appreciate the Minister's comment.
<P>
In general terms, subject to those two queries, the amendment is an improvement on what went before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Given that it is implied that the punishment should fit the crime, and that various graduations are set down, will the Minister say whether the Government propose that where an individual did not intend to abuse the market, any penalty would be light?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am slightly late coming to the debate. The whole issue of fines and the distinction between protective as opposed to punitive penalties was discussed at length in the first and second reports of the Burns Committee. Rereading some of the submissions of the second report in the bath this morning—and a long bath it turned out to be; I had forgotten how detailed some of our submissions were—and the responses in page 6 to questions from Sir Sydney Kentridge, who was retained by the Treasury to advise on these matters, I realised that often the fine is the more merciful sanction.
<P>
We also discussed a case that Sir Sydney Kentridge brought up—that of Brown, a solicitor who committed a breach of the solicitors' disciplinary rules and was fined £10,000. He refused to pay, and took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that he did not have the protection of criminal law in the proceedings. What, therefore, does the Minister think would happen under the civil regime for market abusers who were fined and refused to pay? Brown did not go to jail because his case was judged on a civil basis.
<P>
I put two questions to the hon. Lady. First, can she answer the conundrum raised by Sydney Kentridge in that last report? Secondly, changing direction slightly, can she comment on whether we could put a cap on the level of fines to try to draw a demarcation line through the grey area of whether an excessive fine would be determined by the criminal procedure and a lesser fine by the civil remit?
<P>
The Minister may remember that in an earlier sitting I mentioned the Commission des Operations de Bourses in France and the solution that it appears to have devised. This morning the hon. Lady made a comment which I believe reflected something said by her predecessor. I found that surprising because what happens on the continent is not necessarily the model that we should follow. She said that under its sanctions, the COB observes infringements of its regulations by pronouncing a pecuniary sanction amounting to as much as 10 million French francs, or, when profits have been realised, up to 10 times their amount. The COB's document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The sanction shall be dependent on the gravity of the infringements committed and in proportion to the advantages or profits derived therefrom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The added bonus for the Minister in perhaps going for something like that is that the money would be paid to the Treasury, as happens in France, rather than to the FSA. But I will not re-open that whole canard.
<P>
Will the Minister comment first on whether the Treasury has considered fully the option of a proper cap on the amount of funds, by a formula linked to either profit, or perhaps potential profit? I seem to recall that Lord Fraser mentioned the activities of BP on the London Metal Exchange. It was fined something like £250,000 for a market abuse but had its gamble come off—I use ``gamble'' loosely—BP stood to make several million pounds. The fine was pretty small beer and no questions were asked.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are obviously still uneasy with the concept of an unlimited fine entirely at the discretion of the FSA and with no recourse to the criminal procedure but rather to a tribunal. Why at the final account did the Government reject a formula linked to the profit that an individual or a company stood to make by market abuse to solve the problem of the fine? For a company like BP or a City investment house a fine of £250,000 would be pocket money but for an individual, with or without the comfort of legal aid to defend himself, it could mean bankruptcy. Could the Minister comment on how the French appear to do it and yet we have not considered it?

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for their various points and questions. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) suggested that ``behaviour'' should be replaced with ``market abuse'', particularly in paragraph (b). I have sympathy with that and we will look at it as a drafting point. There is no difference in opinion; it is simply a question of what the draftsmen regard as best.
<P>
There is no limit on fines for discipline. The size of penalties is one factor relevant to convention classification, but it is not conclusive by itself. Penalties must be looked at in the context of the regime as a whole. Disciplinary penalties are a small part of the wider regulatory regime which has a protected purpose and is confined to a limited group. Large fines can be justified on the grounds of effectiveness. Our position was set out fully in our memorandum to the Joint Committee and I am sure that hon. Members are familiar with it.
<P>
The size of the penalty will depend on the circumstances of the case. We do not intend that penalties will be light just because they are for an individual rather than for a firm. The FSA must consider the position of an individual compared with that of a firm when imposing a penalty. That may not always mean a different penalty for individuals and firms in a similar case. It all depends on the circumstances and it will be something for the FSA to consider. There will be no contempt proceedings for a failure to pay a fine under part VII.
<P>
It is not a good idea to carry out calculations by reference to profit, because it is impossible in all cases to assess the profit or potential profit. We do not consider that to be the right way forward. The Joint Committee considered the case for setting an upper limit on penalties and they considered it better that there should be no such limit. There is a reference to that in the first report at paragraph 229.
<P>
We also received advice on criminal classification. We do not think that the market abuse regime is criminal for ECHR purposes, but accept that it is prudent to treat it as if it were, but it is most definitely not criminal for domestic purposes. Therefore the question of a person becoming a criminal for domestic purposes is not relevant here. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that fines were entirely a matter for the FSA. That is not true. The independent tribunal will be able to vary the amount of penalty imposed by the FSA.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 99, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 100</center></H4>
<H4><center>Warning notices</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 397, in page 46, line 23, leave out `state the' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`indicate the proposed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 398, in page 46, line 30, after second `the', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`proposed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is another—and slightly better—case of trying to water down the principle of being guilty until proven innocent, which weaves its way through certain aspects of the Bill. The insertion of the word ``proposed'' would make it clear that the definitive amount of the penalty can be established only when the appeal procedures have been gone through. In the warning notice, the FSA should and can tell the putative market abuser—the defendant—the size of the penalty that is likely to be imposed. He would then know how far to go in making representations to the FSA about his innocence
<P>
The warning notice is issued before the facts have been spelt out to the FSA which can therefore do no more than provide an indication. The decision notice is issued after representations have been made, so the FSA then knows exactly the size of the penalty to be imposed. It still remains a proposal, however, because the putative market abuser can appeal to a tribunal, which can fix its own penalty. That is why it is important to make it clear that even after a decision notice, the penalty decided on by the FSA can be only ``proposed''.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> This clause, and the following clauses, set out the procedures that the FSA must follow when it decides to impose a penalty on a person under clause 98. The procedure to be followed is based on the standard procedures for warning notices set out in clause 338. We debated some closely related issues when we considered procedures under part V of the Bill last week.
<P>
Clause 100 provides that if, having investigated a case, the FSA proposes to impose a penalty on someone, it has to send the person concerned a warning notice, which must state the amount of the penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Proposed.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am coming on to the point about ``proposed'', if the hon. Gentleman will hold peacefully to his seat for a moment.
<P>
The Hon. Gentlemen's amendment would replace this requirement with one to indicate the proposed penalty, the key word being ``proposed''. Of course, the penalty stated in the warning notice is a proposed penalty. That is made abundantly clear by clause 100(1) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the Authority proposes to impose a penalty on a person under section 98, it must give him a warning notice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At one point, that was precisely what the hon. Gentleman seemed to be saying. While I can see the point behind the amendment, it is already fully dealt with. The clause is clear about that.
<P>
Clause 101 deals with the next step in the procedures that the FSA must follow when imposing a fine on someone who has engaged in market abuse. The FSA will first have to issue a warning notice under clause 100. The person will have had at least 28 days to make representations. Having considered them, following the issue of the warning notice, if the FSA still proposes to take action against the person concerned, it must issue a decision notice, which must state the amount of the penalty. As in clause 100, the FSA must follow the general procedures set out in clause 339 on decision notices in part XXIV of the Bill.
<P>
The person receiving the notice may refer the matter to the tribunal, which is provided for in clause 108 (5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A decision referred to the Tribunal does not have effect until the reference, and any appeal against the Tribunal's decision, has been finally disposed of.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 108, which we will debate shortly, also provides that a reference to the tribunal must be made by 28 days from the date on which the decision notice is given, or by the end of such other period as may be prescribed.
<P>
Amendment No. 401 will make changes to clause 108, allowing the alternative period to 28 days to be set by rules made by the Lord Chancellor. That will enable the provisions to keep in line with whatever is best practice for similar tribunals from time to time. If the person does not exercise his or her right to refer the matter to the tribunal, the decision notice becomes final. The FSA will then issue a notice for payment under clause 102.
<P>
The key point is that the decision notice relates to the case in which the FSA concludes, after hearing representations, that imposing a penalty remains the appropriate response. That is a decision, even though the person affected will have the right to refer the matter to a tribunal. If he does, no penalty can be imposed until the case has been disposed of. If there is no referral, the decision stands.
<P>
I am afraid, therefore, that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman by accepting the amendment, which would confuse the process that we shall debate in part VIII. If he does not withdraw it, I will encourage my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is not a major issue, and we do not want to put it to a vote. However, if the Minister reads clauses 100 and 101 carefully, she will see that the word ``proposed'' is not used in quite the way that she thinks. We are talking about a proposed penalty. Proposing to impose a penalty is different from proposing how much that penalty should be. However, we shall leave the matter for the Government to consider. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 313, in page 46, line 38, leave out ``give'' and insert ``serve personally on''.
<P>
The clause deals with issuing a notice for payment to people who are fined. As it stands, the authority must give the person concerned a notice, but what constitutes giving a notice? Might it not be better and more certain if it were served personally on him? Someone who is fined at the end of a trial is usually present, and the notice is, in some respects, served personally. In the case of the FSA, however, there will be deliberations and a notice for payment will be served, but not personally. What constitutes giving the notice? It must be in writing, so would a fax or other electronic means of communication do? Given the seriousness and size of some of the penalties, would not it be better if the notice were served personally?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment, which raises an important point. However, I cannot accept it.
<P>
Under the amendment, each time the FSA decided to impose a penalty on a person under clause 98, it would have to personally serve a notice for payment on him. I appreciate that the amendment arises out of the legitimate concern, which I share, that the FSA should ensure that notices are effectively delivered to their recipients. However, a requirement for personal service in every case is not the way to achieve that outcome.
<P>
It is important to realise that the requirement in the clause for the payment notices to be in writing is not intended to mean that they should always be on paper, and we are considering that further. We do not want the Bill to close off the possibility now or in the future of the FSA using modern methods of electronic communication. In many cases, it might be quicker and more convenient for the person concerned if the FSA sent a notice by post or e-mail instead of serving it on him personally.
<P>
A requirement for personal service in every case could present an opportunity for unscrupulous persons who were determined to avoid paying the penalty by, for example, attempting to remain one step ahead of the FSA as it tried to serve the notice. It would, therefore, be wrong to restrict the authority's options in the way suggested in the amendment.
<P>
A requirement for personal service in all cases would be costly. It could also slow down the receipt of notices where the person was, for example, abroad. That could create a loophole, which the unscrupulous might exploit.
<P>
Nevertheless, I recognise that there is serious concern that the methods that the FSA adopts in particular cases should strike a balance between efficiency and the need to ensure that a person is properly informed of the action that he is required to take. We shall, therefore, table amendments to that effect in due course. I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's thoughts on the subject, but I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 361, in page 47, line 8, leave out ``under section 98 or 138'' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to impose penalties in market abuse cases''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 362.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clause 103 allows the FSA to direct a recognised investment exchange or clearing house to terminate, suspend or limit the scope of any inquiry that that exchange or clearing house is conducting under its rules or not to begin an inquiry where the FSA considers that desirable or expedient because of the exercise or possible exercise of its powers under clauses 98 or 138. Clause 98 allows the FSA to impose a penalty on someone who has engaged in market abuse or encouraged others to do so. Clause 138 deals with the FSA's powers to appoint persons to carry out investigations into breaches of the Bill's provisions and of insider-dealing provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1993.
<P>
The reason for the provision is that it might occasionally prejudice an FSA investigation if a recognised body carried out its own investigation. For example, an abuse might take place across markets, and investigations by the different markets might upset the FSA's investigation.
<P>
The FSA will work closely, as it always has, with recognised bodies. It is in the process of agreeing with exchanges and clearing houses the circumstances in which the power provided for might be used. The FSA made it clear in consultation document number 17, on enforcement, that it would not usually take action where those bodies had adequate investigative, disciplinary and enforcement powers to deal with the conduct in question.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to bring the Bill's provisions into line with what has always been the policy intent—to allow the FSA to direct recognised bodies to suspend investigations only where market abuse or suspected market abuse is involved.
<P>
Exchanges cannot conduct investigations into other matters, which clause 138 allows the FSA to investigate. Only in the area of market abuse is there an overlap and a potential problem to be addressed. However, we envisage the power provided for being used only rarely.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 361 and 362 will limit the circumstances in which the FSA can suspend inquiries to those in which it believes that it is desirable or expedient because of the exercise or possible exercise of its powers to impose penalties in market abuse cases. That power is defined as the FSA's powers under clause 98 and clause 138(2)(b), which deals with investigations of market abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The amendments are fairly uncontroversial. We would welcome it if they put a limit on the FSA's powers and provided slightly more definition, because that is lacking in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
Perhaps I could ask the Minister about the interaction between the FSA, as the competent authority, and the stock exchange, which retains its power over alternative investment market listings, in cases where there has been an abuse by a company. Under what circumstances would the FSA overrule a recognised exchange? I am thinking particularly of our debate last week, in which we asked why the stock exchange should be left with the power to marshal AIM-listed stocks while the listing authority for the main stocks, the competent authority, is now the FSA. There would appear to be a slight discrepancy if the FSA were trying to muscle in on the stock exchange, as a recognised exchange, to sort out a problem with an AIM-listed company. That is one minor example, but will the Minister elaborate on when the power to override a recognised exchange might come into force?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) must have spent a long time in his bath today because he has thought of something that I will need to consider—although probably not in my bath—and answer at equal length. Perhaps I can correspond with him on his point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 314 and 315, which concern Scottish matters and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) will describe the other two. The clause is about how the Treasury may, from time to time, issue written guidance to relevant authorities on market abuse. We certainly agree with the need for that.
<P>
Scotland, as usual, appears to have been overlooked in the drafting of the clause. In particular, the role of the Advocate General for Scotland is ignored. He—I assume it is a he but it may be a she—was created under the Scotland Act 1998, something that I had overlooked. It is obviously an important matter because his job as a United Kingdom law officer is to advise the Government on matters affecting UK reserved issues for Scotland. It therefore seems right to recognise his role in giving consent to guidance issued by the Treasury on these matters. The advice will be essential to ensure that the guidance meets the needs of the Scots with their different legal system. To guard the interests of the many people working in financial services in Scotland we should add the Advocate General for Scotland to the clause as suggested in amendment No. 314.
<P>
Amendment No. 315 would do something rather similar. It would add the Lord Advocate. A number of relevant authorities for whom the Treasury may issue written guidance are listed in the clause. They include the prosecution authorities for England and Wales and for Northern Ireland. The prosecution authority in Scotland is the Lord Advocate. He is a Scottish Minister who, under section 48(5) of the Scotland Act 1998, is the independent head of the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland. That, again, is something of which I was not aware.
<P>
The Lord Advocate is an important person for the Scots and he should be among those for whom the Treasury can issue written guidance. Given the importance of the Bill in covering all parts of the United Kingdom, it is important to take Scottish requirements and sensitivities into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We shall not press amendment No. 145 because we have noted that the clause refers to the FSA being in breach of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).
<P>
However, amendment No. 144 is material. We propose that the Treasury should have regard to the views of other relevant authorities, as well as being obliged to obtain the consent of the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 105 intends to establish a procedure as to which prosecutor has first go. That applies to market abuse, so that, even though it is not a criminal offence, it is as good as one. Indeed, the Treasury has more or less accepted that it will constitute a criminal offence for the purposes of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The clause is a good idea as having such a procedure is important. However, the Treasury is required to issue written guidance to help the relevant prosecutors work out who may bring the first prosecution in individual cases. Subsection (2) states that, before issuing guidance,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury must obtain the consent of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As those are both political offices, it would be appropriate to agree guidance with other relevant authorities such as the director of the Serious Fraud Office. We probably cannot expect the Treasury to obtain consent from such prosecutors. However, surely it would be appropriate to take their views into account.
<P>
<B>Ms Sandra Osborne </B>(Ayr): I shall make a couple of brief comments on amendments Nos. 314 and 315.
<P>
Not having been involved in the Burns Committee, I feel that I have come to the party rather late and that everyone has been enjoying themselves for a considerable time. I feel that, not because hon. Members are inarticulate and unclear, but because, as I am sure everyone agrees, the Bill is technical.
<P>
As a Scottish Member, I am especially interested in matters Scottish, although not exclusively so. I hope that all Committee members are interested in how the Bill affects Scotland, and I thank the right hon. Member for Wells for tabling his amendments, which raise several important matters that should be taken into account.
<P>
The Bill is a reserved matter. However, when the Scottish Parliament debated the Bill on 23 June, it raised genuine concerns about sufficient account being taken of Scotland's separate legal system. That has always been the case, and would have been so, regardless of devolution. However, the existence of the Scottish Parliament means that we must be aware of how reserved matters, such as the Bill, affect Scotland.
<P>
As the Scottish Minister responsible for criminal justice in Scotland, the Lord Advocate should be among those for whom the Treasury may issue written guidance. The Lord Advocate's role is especially important in relation to the amendments. Such guidance would potentially affect the Scottish law courts, which, at that level, are the responsibility of the procurators fiscal. Subsection (3)(b) should make provision to cover the procurators fiscal.
<P>
How will those matters be wholly dealt with, as amendment No. 315 does not cover them adequately? Will the Government consider how such aspects may be incorporated into the Bill?
<P>
On amendment No. 314, I understand that the Advocate-General—who is a woman—is a UK law officer who gives advice to the UK Government on matters affecting UK-reserved issues in Scotland. In general, that advice will be important in ensuring that the needs of people affected by such measures who live and work in Scotland are met, as the right hon. Member for Wells pointed out. That is more than an assumption, as I have spoken to the Advocate-General, who is already giving such advice on a day-to-day basis, as is her role.
<P>
Surely, if the Treasury intends to issue guidance, gaining the consent of the Lord Advocate as the independent head of the criminal prosecution system in Scotland would be more relevant than gaining that of the Advocate-General. Will my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary consider how that may be done?

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> There will be some cases that fall within the overlap of the criminal offences of market manipulation or insider dealing and the new market abuse regime. Clause 105 allows the Treasury, with the consent of the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State, to issue guidance on the circumstances in which such cases should be dealt with under the criminal law or under the market abuse provisions. We see that very much as a reserved power for use when the relevant authorities set out in subsection (3) cannot agree appropriate guidance among themselves.
<P>
The FSA is currently working with the Serious Fraud Office, the Attorney-General's Office, the Scottish Executive, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers to establish agreed guidelines on whether a case should be taken the market abuse route or whether a criminal prosecution is warranted. There is also a Treasury representative on that group.
<P>
So far as they deal with criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, the guidelines will be based on the principles in the code for Crown prosecutors. Two tests must be met before a prosecution can go ahead—the evidential test and the public interest test. The FSA proposes that the evidential test will be applied in accordance with the guidance contained in the code for Crown prosecutors. No prosecution will take place unless the FSA is satisfied that the evidence is strong enough to make it more likely than not that a jury will convict the defendant.
<P>
If the evidential test has been met, the code for Crown prosecutors requires the prosecuting agency to consider whether it would be in the public interest for the prosecution to go ahead. So it is only if both the evidential and the public interest tests are met that the prosecution will finally proceed.
<P>
The FSA will follow that two-stage procedure. A non-exhaustive list of the factors that they would propose to take into account in deciding whether the public interest test has been met is set out in consultation paper 17. If, however, it is decided that criminal prosecution is not appropriate in a particular case, but that it might be appropriate to deal with it under the market abuse provisions, the FSA will consider first whether the conduct did, in its opinion, amount to market abuse, and secondly, if it is, whether it would be appropriate, in view of all the circumstances, to impose a fine. Again, a non-exhaustive list of the factors that they would take into account is contained on page 53 of consultation paper 17.
<P>
The FSA has undertaken to publish the criteria that they and the other authorities agree. It is important that the FSA and the other authorities are seen to work to transparent guidelines.
<P>
Turning to the amendments, tabled by Opposition Members I am grateful to them for amendments Nos. 314 and 315. They are quite right to draw attention to the fact that we will need to amend the clause to take account of the devolution of responsibility for criminal justice matters under the Scotland Act 1998.
<P>
The Lord Advocate is responsible for the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland. The clause will need to reflect that, but I would like to consider further how we might do it, taking into account the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne). In doing so, we will of course continue to be in contact with the Scottish Executive regarding the best way of achieving that aim. It will doubtless involve discussions with the Advocate-General for Scotland, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark), whose existence is obviously a mystery to Opposition Members.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 144, I am afraid that it is unnecessary. The ``relevant authorities'' are, of course, the prosecuting agencies named in subsection (3), who are all, apart from the FSA, part of central Government. As I have said, these bodies are currently working on guidelines. Only if it proves impossible to agree on guidelines, will we need to consider invoking the reserved power, which the clause gives us, to issue formal Treasury guidance. Having said that, it is neither necessary nor desirable and certainly not usual to impose what would essentially be a formal statutory responsibility on Ministers to consult public servants before issuing guidance.
<P>
Subsection(2) already requires the Treasury to obtain the consent of the Attorney-General before issuing guidance. It is not clear what would be gained by requiring it also to consult the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is also responsible to the Attorney General. Ministers will, of course, be accountable to Parliament for the exercise of these powers, which are very much reserved powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 is also unnecessary and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has, I believe, already agreed to withdraw it.
