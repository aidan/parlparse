<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000385"></a>John
Penrose:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Benton, as we prepare to consider these measures. The
amendments are multi-technical and seek clarification. During the
evidence sessions at the start of our deliberations, there was some
discussion with representatives of the insurance industry about
contract workers. I want to clarify whether the Government are clear
about the comparator for the clause and to know whether, when talking
about discrimination against contractors, we are talking about
discrimination against contracted workers without a protected
characteristic or non-contract workers, such as regular employees, as
the relevant comparator. I hope that the comparator that the Minister
puts on the record is
straightforward.</div><a name="09062410000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence session a couple of weeks ago sounded a few warning bells in
my mind, and it is important that we clarify matters. Without trying
your patience too much, Mr. Benton, I want to highlight the
fact that all members of the Committee are aware that separate measures
that are before the House will impact on contract and agency workers,
and I want to ensure that the Bill is not a stealthy way to achieve
something that is supposed to be in those measures and that it will do
what it is intended to do, rather than something broader. I hope that
the Minister can put our minds at rest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div><a name="09062410000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000386"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> Good morning to you,
Mr. Benton, and to all members of the Committee. The
provision is not an attempt to do anything stealthy of the type that
has been mooted, although my response will be a tiny bit more
complicated than my just saying
no.</div><a name="09062410000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes it unlawful for &#147;the principal&#148;, the person
who makes work available to contract workers, to
discriminate, harass or victimise a worker. Amendment 213
would change the effect of the law by limiting the comparison by which
discrimination was established to another contract worker. That would
be the
comparator.</div><a name="09062410000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
clause 22 already establishes the fact that, as under the current law,
the comparator must be someone whose circumstances are not materially
different from those of the complainant. That is likely to be another
contract worker, but it is not impossible that a claimant could seek to
compare their treatment with that according to a permanent member of
staff employed by the principal if there were, as clause 22 requires,
no material difference between the circumstances in the case. It would
be a question of fact about whether there was any material
difference.</div><a name="09062410000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000387"></a>John
Penrose:</b> To clarify the Minister&#146;s point, it is
important to understand what the similarities and the legitimate
differences might be. I hope to hear reassurance that the legitimate
differences might be that contract workers would be different because
of the terms of their contract and the fact that they are not permanent
employees and have different terms and conditions as a legal basis for
their engagement with the principal. However, if the task that they are
performing is, under the terms of the contract, the same as that of a
full-time employee, that would be a fair comparison. In other words, we
are not trying to eliminate the differences between contract workers
and full-time workers, those being different forms of
employment&#151;both of which have a legitimate purpose and value in
the workplace, and which we would not want to fudge or try to
elide.</div><a name="09062410000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000388"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.
The issue is protected strands and discrimination. Issues elsewhere
relate to different contractual terms, which are often different
between contract workers and employees, and there is no sneaking
elision of the
two.</div><a name="09062410000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I speak to amendment 214 before I specifically say what the hon.
Gentleman wants me to say? Amendment 214 would introduce a
comparator to victimisation where no comparator is necessary at all,
and it would turn current law on its head. I know that it is only a
probing amendment, but I need to say that we could not possibly accept
it, because it would have that peculiar
effect.</div><a name="09062410000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
8 May, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
issued a consultation document on the proposed approaches to the
European agency workers directive, which requires that agency workers
be treated equally with permanent staff in the organisation in which
they are placed after a qualifying period determined by member states,
along with social partners. According to the directive, the qualifying
period is to be 12 weeks. In our view, the document does not contain
any policy risks in relation to the
Bill.</div><a name="09062410000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal is that protection be granted to agency workers as for a
permanent staff member. It is to be decided whether a
hypothetical comparison will be permitted as a comparator, but the
entitlement will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>to equal treatment with that comparator in terms of conditions of work.
That is the directive, not the Bill. However, there might be issues
from an employer&#146;s point of view. The protection is distinct
from that provided in the Bill, which is concerned with presenting less
favourable treatment because of protected characteristics rather than
because of the nature or conditions of the work. They are two
completely separate policy streams. I hope that satisfies the
Committee.</div><a name="09062410000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000389"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Minister for that explanation. That
is indeed the point I was driving at and she has explained that the two
strands are entirely separate&#151;one does not affect the other. It
is important for businesses around the country to have that on the
record, so I thank her for it. With that assurance, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062410000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

GLA.</i></div><a name="09062410000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
really follows on from the clause 2 amendment where we attempted to
include the Greater London authority in the socio-economic duty. There
seems to be a similar anomaly, so I am trying to get the Minister to
clarify whether elected members of the GLA authorities, which include
the Metropolitan Police Authority and the London Fire and Emergency
Planning Authority, will be treated in the same way as the members of
the GLA
itself.</div><a name="09062410000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000391"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Paragraph 2 of the schedule excludes
political offices from the protection&#151;available under clauses 46
to 48&#151;against discrimination, harassment and victimisation. The
provision ensures that essentially political matters, such as
appointment to council offices or indeed to ministerial offices, do not
come before a tribunal. There is a carefully drawn exclusion of
specific offices in specific political settings, which include GLA
offices held by the Mayor and members of the assembly. That is
obviously a good
thing.</div><a name="09062410000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
connection between election and offices in places such as the MPA is
not so clear. Protection for people holding offices in such bodies will
be available in any case only if the office satisfies the definition of
a personal or public office for the purposes of clauses 46 to 48, or if
it fits under any other provision in part 5, but it will not arise as a
result of
election.</div><a name="09062410000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would cause confusion between members of the authorities
mentioned in it, some of whom are elected, although many are not. We
think it would complicate the provision. In essence, the provision
protects people who are elected, as opposed to those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>who get to their office in some different way, and it would be
unlawfully regressive if the amendment were
accepted.</div><a name="09062410000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady has made her point; she has probed the issue. I hope that she
now appreciates the complexity of the matter and I invite her to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062410000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000392"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister.
To clarify, is she saying that if someone is elected to the GLA and
then appointed to the MPA, which is what happens to elected members on
the GLA, they will not be
protected?</div><a name="09062410000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000393"></a>The

Amendments 226, 227, 228 and 229 restore the position under the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>when it comes to reasonable adjustment placed on those providing
employment services and vocational services. The amendment maintains
the existing protection by obliging an anticipatory duty. Disabled

receive information and advice in ways that are accessible to
them.</div><a name="09062410000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
who in an earlier debate were keen to test the effectiveness of the
reasonable adjustment provisions will be reassured that there is no
erosion of existing levels in that connection. The amendment also
restates the position for enforcement of the duty to make reasonable
adjustments in respect of vocational services as being via the
employment tribunal. I suspect that that will also meet with
people&#146;s approval because it is usually thought of as being
easier than the county court.</div>

concerns clause 53, which defines what the provision of an employment

makes it unlawful to discriminate, harass or victimise someone when
using such a service. We want to omit clause 52(3), which excludes from
that clause employment services provided other than by way of a trade

that employment services provided by volunteers are also captured by
the discrimination provisions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000403"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> We are back to the GLA. The amendment is
probing and based on an earlier amendment. Amendment 245 probes the
same issue to ensure that members of fire authorities across the
country are protected against discrimination. It would be helpful if
the Minister clarified where the members of other public authorities,
such as police authorities and fire authorities, stand in terms of the
clause.</div><a name="09062410000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000404"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me explain the protection&#151;I
thank the hon. Lady for the amendments to facilitate that. Amendment
244 is to include authorities &#147;in the GLA family&#148; within
the meaning of &#147;local authority&#148; for the purposes of
protection under clause 55. The amendment would even include the
members of those authorities in the definition of a &#147;local
authority&#148;, so they would be prohibited from discriminating
against themselves&#151;but never mind, I appreciate that the
amendment is
probing.</div><a name="09062410000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of those bodies may be protected under clauses 46 to 48, in respect of
the appointment and conditions of office if they are personal or public
office holders, or under clause 36 if the relationship amounts to
employment. However, clause 55 aims at elected members while they
undertake official business. It harmonises the existing law, providing
a limited exception to the exclusion of elected offices from protection
under discrimination law, recognising the importance of prohibiting
discrimination and enabling reasonable adjustments in the carrying out
of official business by local authority
members.</div><a name="09062410000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have put a power in clause 56(3) whereby bodies that exercise functions
conferred on local authorities may be added to the list, recognising
the fact that many members of local authorities are subsequently
appointed to other, quasi-local authority bodies to discharge some of
the functions of the local authority. Ensuring that such members are
protected from discrimination, victimisation and harassment in the
carrying out of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>official business in respect of those bodies as well is right, because
they operate effectively as an extension of the local authorities, the
functions of which they are discharging. It is better to do that by
secondary legislation, rather than in the Bill, for greater
flexibility, given that local authorities change and the situation is
dynamic. We shall consider what bodies should be included by means of
the power, and we shall look at the ones referred to by the hon. Lady
at that
time.</div><a name="09062410000091"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000407"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> This debate is about hypothetical
comparators. The amendments would allow people to make a claim for
equal pay when there is no real comparator. The argument is quite
well-trodden&#151;if one Googles &#147;hypothetical
comparator&#148; on the parliamentary website, one can see that the
discussion goes back through many forms of Committees over many years.
This time round, I hope that we will make a
change.</div><a name="09062410000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Traditionally,
women who suffer unequal pay are at a significant disadvantage to other
forms of discrimination, such as race and disability. It is the only
type of discrimination regarding pay differentials where there is a
particular requirement to propose a real comparator&#151;to point to
someone else to compare with, in the work that one is undertaking. That
has proven&#151;the TUC, the Fawcett Society and the Women&#146;s
National Commission agree&#151;to be a significant obstacle where
such a comparator does not exist. That happens when there is a majority
female work
force.</div><a name="09062410000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professions
dominated by females are often underpaid&#151;cleaners, hairdressers,
dinner ladies and many other female occupations. They often have a
lower ratio of pay. Because there are virtually no men doing comparable
jobs in comparable places, it becomes impossible to argue that the work
is undervalued, because we cannot point to a real comparator.</div>
<a name="09062410000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">For reasons
of history and female economic inequality through almost every strata,
women&#146;s work is always given a lower price tag, even when men
are doing equivalent tasks that require equivalent skills to those of a
female-orientated job. The requirement is not imposed on other types of
discrimination. For example, if someone is trying to prove race
discrimination, they are not barred from claiming discrimination if
they cannot find a real comparator. It is a discrimination within
discriminations.</div><a name="09062410000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Women&#146;s National Commission, in its evidence, said that it is
very much in favour of hypothetical comparators, and would like to see,
as we would on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;I suspect on many
other Benches as well&#151;the barrier removed from equal pay claims.
The Fawcett Society said that that would make a huge difference. Will
the Minister explain why there has been resistance to removing that
barrier to equal pay, which has set women back so profoundly? I do not
understand the rationale behind it, so I would welcome her
response.</div>
<a name="09062410000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062410000408"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): I would like to
echo the comments of the hon. Lady. Getting equal pay has been a
long-term problem. Many women are disadvantaged, especially those who
are low paid and whose work is undervalued in our society. I also
support the views of the TUC and the National Women&#146;s Commission
in relation to the matter. I would like an explanation from the
Minister as to why the provision cannot be brought in to complete the
Bill. I am sure that she has a good explanation, which I am looking
forward to hearing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div><a name="09062410000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000409"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I know that there are a number of views
on the matter. The Fawcett Society and the NWC are in favour of
hypothetical comparators, as the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green
said. I will turn specifically to that. If anybody finds it helpful, I
could set out the whole scheme of the chapter, but I think she put her
finger on the point that she is really interested in, as did my hon.
Friend the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock.</div>
<a name="09062410000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
it would be helpful if I set out some examples that are usually given
to support the need for hypothetical comparison in equal pay cases. The
first kind of example is about gender segregation, which the hon.
Member for Hornsey and Wood Green has already mentioned. The example is
that in some work environments, as a result of gender segregation, no
men are doing equivalent work to women. The suggestion is that if the
women believed that they were underpaid, they should be able to claim
on the basis that, were there a man doing that work, he would be paid
more. The amendment would allow
that.</div><a name="09062410000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
difficulty with that is what the evidence would be that a man in that
situation would be paid more. If there is clear evidence, such as a
statement by the employer to that effect, a claim would be a
possible&#151;we have made it so in clause 66&#151;as that would be
direct discrimination. There may not be many cases of that, but those
that exist will be caught by the Bill. Any remaining gap would be in
cases where the employer discriminates indirectly against a woman in
relation to contractual pay.</div>
<a name="09062410000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments demonstrate the difficulty of doing that. As I understand
them, the amendments would permit a claimant to argue that B, a
hypothetical employee doing the same or similar work, has a term in
their contract that the claimant does not, or one that is better than
the equivalent one that the claimant has. It is quite difficult to see
on what basis a tribunal could reasonably reach that conclusion. If it
were asked to do so by relying on evidence that people doing completely
different work had such a term, such a claim would not succeed. In
effect, we would be asking the tribunal to decide that the fact that
there is a difference in pay between two people of the opposite sex
doing completely different work somehow supports the argument that two
such people doing the same work would also be paid differently. That is
a significant thing to ask a tribunal to do, and considerable
uncertainty would
emerge.</div><a name="09062410000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may be asked what the difference is between that and a case of indirect
sex discrimination. In an indirect discrimination case advanced on that
basis, an employer would say that the difference in pay reflects a
difference in work. That would, in our view, be sufficient to establish
that there was a materially different set of circumstances under clause
22, which is the clause I spoke of earlier when we dealt with contract
workers, and hence, the claim would
fail.</div><a name="09062410000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
similar point can be made in respect of other examples commonly given.
For example, a woman being paid only 50 per cent. of the salary given
to a man, when she works at 75 per cent. of the value, should be able
to claim. Other examples commonly given arise from situations where
work has been privatised. They are difficult examples to agree with,
because they call for a comparison between the terms of people who are
employed by different employers. That is not how the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>Bill works, and cannot be right. Direct discrimination in pay can, and
should, in our view be properly examined through the equality clause
provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062410000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
alternative approach would have been to scrap the contractual approach,
but Members will know that we have retained the contractual approach
and the distinction between contractual and non-contractual pay
matters for work-related gender discrimination. While we
could have done the opposite&#151;scrap the contractual
approach&#151;or allow discrimination claims in parallel with it, in
our view, all the difficult issues that arise in equal pay cases would
arise with the discrimination approach too, only that they would be in
a different order.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000410"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I thank all members of the Committee
for their indulgence and for allowing me to take a most important
telephone call about the steelworks in my constituency, which I could
not put off until the end of our sitting. I want to explain, not least
to the public, what has been going on. I am most grateful to you,
Mr. Benton, and to
colleagues.</div><a name="09062410000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was saying that we could have taken an alternative approach, scrapping
the contractual approach and allowing discrimination claims in parallel
with it. They were the two options. However, all the difficult issues
that arise in equal pay matters would come from that approach, too,
even though they would come in a different order. It is clear that, if
we made a wholesale change, the potential would exist for issues that
have already been settled by the courts to be revisited. It is also
likely that, more often or not, after expensive litigation the result
would be the
same.</div><a name="09062410000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
would always be the possibility, too, of new difficulties arising such
as a claim advanced on the basis of a statistical analysis of the pay
given to groups of workers doing different work, differently valued,
perhaps showing that paying one group more disadvantages women who make
up a smaller proportion of that group. Perhaps I should repeat that. A
claim advanced on the basis of a statistical analysis of the pay given
to groups of workers doing very different work&#151;differently
valued&#151;could show that paying more to one group more
disadvantages women who make up a smaller proportion of that group. One
could see such a situation arising. Is that on its own to be the basis
for a
claim?</div><a name="09062410000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
the right response to that is not artificially to increase the pay of
one group, but to seek to ensure by other means that women are as well
represented in the higher paid group as in the lower. There might be
risks of such cases arising. It would not be right to take the
substantial risk that a large number of new cases, which would
ultimately fail, would arise in such a
way.</div><a name="09062410000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Doubtless
we will have this argument again in various guises throughout
consideration of the Bill, but that is a key point to raise at this
stage. Changing to a different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>model could lead to uncertainty with more litigation and unpredictable
outcomes for employers and employees alike. We are not convinced that
any real advantages for women would be achieved by that change to
offset the disadvantages. Right now there is a need for
stability.</div><a name="09062410000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the hon. Members for Hornsey and Wood Green and for Oxford, West and
Abingdon propose goes beyond the protection offered by indirect
discrimination, and I suggest it goes a very long way. What the issues
expose is in part related to the question of where the boundary lies
between individual disadvantage, which can be corrected by the Bill,
and the disadvantages that arise in society, which should be dealt with
by policies aimed at closing the pay gap rather than individual
remedy.</div>
<a name="09062410000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062410000411"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): I appreciate the point that
the Solicitor-General makes, but if the Bill is not the place to
address such issues, where is? There are some much wider issues out
there disadvantaging women in particular, but also other groups. My own
experience in a local authority showed that comparisons could be made
within the authority, because everyone was employed by the same
employer, but outside there are separate organisations that employ only
specific groups of workers, and they are disadvantaged because they
cannot be compared with anyone else. Is the Bill not the place to deal
with that?</div>
<a name="09062410000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000412"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No. The issue is about equal pay
between workers in the same employ. It is not about trying to ensure
that employer A pays the same rate as employer B, which is something
for trade union negotiations or policies connected more broadly with
trying to redress the disadvantage of women who are likely to be paid
less but who are not in a group that can be protected under the
provision.</div><a name="09062410000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062410000413"></a><b class="B">Ms
Diane Abbott</b> (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):
My hon. and learned Friend says that the issue is about ensuring that
groups of employees doing comparative work for the same employer are
paid the same, but she forgets the electorate. For them, the Bill is
designed to address inequality of pay across the board between men and
women, and they look to the Bill as a mechanism to achieve
that. Over a long period, many groups have raised issue in the
amendment that colleagues have tabled to achieve it. For the public,
this is about not particular employers, but the salaries that women, on
average, can expect to obtain for comparable work done by men, on
average.</div><a name="09062410000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000414"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> But this is not the clause in which the
public will look for that. If they did, they would be misguided. There
are many other matters in the Bill that we will debate presently, which
are about trying to get equal pay through transparency. There are
requirements on the private and public

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000415"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div>
<a name="09062410000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000416"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will finish my point first and sketch
out the issues so that the hon. Lady can join in our debate about
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div><a name="09062410000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal, which is accepted by the CBI and the TUC, is that the
commission will set up a group of the representatives of employers and
employees that will work out the right things to
measure&#151;metrics, as they are now called&#151;to achieve
disclosure of pay gaps firm by firm, industry by industry. That is a
better way to drive forward the broader agenda for equal pay than this
particular provision, which is essentially about protecting an
individual against an overpaid individual doing comparably equal work.
When we come to those provisions, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hackney, North and Stoke Newington will see, if I have not explained
them clearly enough, that they are designed to get rid of the pay gap
that exists in the public sector but more powerfully in the private
sector.</div><a name="09062410000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
what we hope is a short period, we shall use the transparency demands
to make businesses see that if they disclose unequal pay, they are not
likely to achieve investment. Smart women will go where there is not
unequal pay and consumers who buy ethically will not buy their goods.
There are other provisions that directly seek to attack the whole
question of systemic unequal
pay.</div><a name="09062410000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall come to a debate about representative actions, too, albeit they
are not in the Bill. However, they are under consideration. That,
again, can have broader reach into the whole area of systemic
inequality in employment not only for gender&#151;gender in
particular, as that is what we are talking about&#151;but for other
protected
characteristics.</div><a name="09062410000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09062410000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
in due course we intend to put out a document, side by side with the
Bill, looking at all the other sources of unequal pay and inequality
between men and women. The Women and Work Commission has
been reconvened to look at its earlier recommendations&#151;whether
it sticks with those recommendations, whether it has further
recommendations, whether the Government have done enough to meet the
original demands&#151;and, with our document, we ought to be able to
draw things together for ourselves. There will be consultation, so that
everyone can put in any strategy to get rid of unequal pay. Aspects
such as poor training and the low quality of available part-time work
cannot be reached by legislation. The broader issues of equal pay come
under some of those headings, rather than being dealt with effectively
here. There is plenty yet to come, and everything does not hinge on the
clause. My hon. Friend is right, but this is not where public
expectation should
lie.</div><a name="09062410000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000417"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I appreciate the amount of work that the
Government are doing to deal with such problems&#151;we are all
moving in the same direction. However, this particular case has been
something of an issue for women going to tribunal when in women-only
professions. In a sense, the ability to use a hypothetical comparator
will give them insurance against whatever may happen with the Equality
and Human Rights Commission matrix and all the other things. A number
of organisations have supported the idea. For example, the Equality and
Diversity Forum says that the directive does not permit the exclusion
of provisions outlawing direct and indirect discrimination in relation
to terms and conditions and, therefore, requires that hypothetical
comparisons must be possible in that regard, in the same way as they
would be in relation to race. That would bring the situation into line
with European law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div><a name="09062410000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, Unison
says that the EU equal treatment directive allows hypothetical
comparisons. The Bill, therefore, should allow the use of hypothetical
comparators when no actual comparator exists. Interestingly, Unison
says that such comparators ought to be permissible, while the EDF says
that they ought to be a requirement. I would like to probe the Minister
further on why she thinks that those organisations are still clamouring
for a hypothetical comparator to be admitted&#151;to be a requirement
or to be permissible. All the work that she said is going on does not
suffice to satisfy Unison or the EDF. I wish to test her further on
that
issue.</div><a name="09062410000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000418"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Organisations, as quoted, do press for
that. They are also engaged with us&#151;on the one hand they take up
a campaigning position, clinging to hypothetical comparators as the
magic elixir, but on the other hand they engage with us on all the
other things that we are doing and appreciate that there is a lot of
progress as well. There is nothing contradictory in that position, but
the hon. Lady needs the context for her assertion that all those people
consistently press for
that.</div><a name="09062410000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some case law under article 141 of the treaty of Rome, in which the
European Court of Justice has looked at the issue. It has consistently
required an actual comparator to be identified for the purposes of an
equal pay claim under the article. There is nothing in any pending
directive that is likely to change that position. We find that to be a
difficulty in accepting what the hon. Lady
said.</div><a name="09062410000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, though, a recipe for confusion&#151;I hope that I have expressed
myself using the appropriate technical language, but all sorts of
things can happen, which the hon. Lady is probably familiar with. Take
for example a person in job A&#151;a gardener&#151;who wants to
assert that he should have equal pay to the caretaker, and they are
both men. If a hypothetical comparator were available, one could assume
that one person was a woman and compare the pay of the man with the
theoretical woman to see whether they should have equal pay. That has
nothing to do with discrimination and pay; it concerns an argument that
is better taken on by a trade union. The hypothetical comparator has
real, practical drawbacks, as well as the ones that I have set out, and
as well as the partial bar from Europe on taking it
on.</div>
<a name="09062410000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062410000419"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): My hon.
Friend read out a note from the Equality and Diversity Forum, which is
a serious organisation. I should like some clarification on that point,
because the forum was referring to the directive of the European
Parliament and the Council of 5 July 2006 on</div>
<a name="09062410000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal
treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation
(recast)&#148;.</div><a name="09062410000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
says that the directive has been fully in effect from 15
August 2008 and that it requires that hypothetical comparisons must be
possible in that regard&#151;as mentioned by my hon. Friend&#151;in
the same way that they would be in relation to a race case. That is an
assertion of fact with which I presume the Minister disagrees. If she
could put on the record that she thinks that that is wrong, that would
be helpful for later discussions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="09062410000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000420"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I would have thought that that was an
assertion of law; it is one with which I disagree and so do the
Government. I acknowledge entirely that EDF is a fine organisation. It
is an organisation of organisations and we are happy and grateful to it
for helping us all the way through the Bill. The tentacles that it has
into equality and diversity are massively important to ensure that we
are always in touch with people on the front line.</div>
<a name="09062410000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
however, we do not believe that hypothetical comparators are either
workable or required. We fear that allowing their use would create
significant unintended consequences, some of which I have set out
technically, and others I have exemplified. We have therefore decided,
on balance, that ensuring pay equality is better served by maintaining
our current approach. Clause 66 contains a provision to allow claims
where there is evidence of direct discrimination in relation to
contractual pay. I hope that the Committee will welcome that&#151;it
closes a gap in the current law. This law is better than it has been
before, even in this specific way.</div>
<a name="09062410000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
reflect carefully on what has been said, but we are not able to offer
satisfaction today. I invite the hon. Lady not to press her amendment
to a Division. However, it is good that we have had the
discussion&#151;we are, as she put it, all driving in the same
direction. We are satisfied that we have a better state of affairs for
the drive towards equal pay than that which she offers, but none the
less, we appreciate that it is a tenable view that she is
right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just before the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green indicates her intention, I want to ensure that she is aware that
we are discussing clause stand part. If the Committee agrees to that,
it negates her amendments. I want to clarify that so that the Committee
is aware of the procedure. If it is her intention to pursue the
amendments and the new clause, the stand part element has to be
opposed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000437"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> As currently worded, the clause allows
employers defending equal pay claims to avoid the need to justify
discriminatory pay objectively. Subsection (l)(a) allows
employers to defend a claim by simply pointing to another reason for
the pay differential that is not sex&#151;not a protected
characteristic, that is, sex. An employer only needs to refer to
paragraph (a) because there is an &#147;or&#148; at the moment,
rather than an &#147;and&#148;. If the employer cannot find or
identify another reason, it is only then that the obligation kicks in
to justify the differential in pay
objectively.</div><a name="09062410000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is inconsistent with European law and the decisions of the European
Court of Justice in equal pay cases appealed from the UK. In practice,
it means that where there is a female-dominated group, such as cleaners
or home care workers, in local government, where it has been
established that they should be paid the same rates of pay and bonuses
as a comparable male-dominated group, such as road sweepers and refuse
collectors, all the employer has to do to get out of equalling the pay
is to identify a reason for the difference which is not sex. That
reason could be something like the need to improve productivity or a
need to recruit and retain staff in an environment where one particular
gender was difficult to recruit. Once the reason has been identified,
there will be no imperative for the employer to justify that reason
objectively, and no obligation for them to show
that there is a genuine need to improve productivity, that
recruitment of a particular gender is difficult, or that the need is a
proportionate or necessary reason to perpetuate the discrimination in
pay. All the employer needs to do is to cite the other reason without
any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>examination of the strength or veracity of that
reason&#151;carte-blanche really, so long as it is not covered by
subsection 1(a).</div>
<a name="09062410000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point is that the female and male worker groups do jobs of equal value,
and that equal value, by that stage, should have been evaluated as
being equivalent under a recognised job evaluation scheme. It is only
after that equality has been proved that the employer is able to raise
the defence of material factor. It is important that the defence is
fair and complies with European
law.</div><a name="09062410000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause replicates the worst aspects of the judgment made in law under
the Equal Pay Act 1970, a decision that has been roundly criticised and
is currently under appeal in two cases at the Employment Appeal
Tribunal and Court of Appeal. This is therefore a golden opportunity to
bring United Kingdom equal pay law back into line with European
law.</div><a name="09062410000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09062410000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have left out from our new clause subsection (3) on pay protection. I
understand that the Government&#146;s intention is not to scare the
horses. For example, when pay has to be equalled up, if the disparity
is huge and public sector organisations are faced with levelling pay,
clause 64(3) allows for the long-term objective of reducing inequality.
The Liberal Democrats want to test the Minister on that because it
seems very much like letting them off the hook. Subsection (3) attempts
to deal with the pay protection for groups of workers whose pay is
reduced as a result of removing discrimination in
pay.</div><a name="09062410000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the majority of negotiated equal pay outcomes that seek to bring the
pay of underpaid groups up to the level of the rates enjoyed by the
comparable higher-paid work groups that does not simply involve raising
the pay of the lower paid to that of the higher paid. It is important
to note that many women and men have their pay reduced as a result of
job evaluation in local government, and it is not always simple to
state that it is necessarily men who are highly paid and that only
women are underpaid. That said, there are often situations when large
male-dominated groups are the subject of dramatic pay reductions and
receive pay protection. As a result, what generally happens is that the
higher-paid groups have their pay reduced and underpaid groups have
their pay increased. In pay protection, the pay of groups rated as
equal in a job evaluation is set somewhere in the middle of those two
positions.</div><a name="09062410000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
have a system that requires employers to bring the pay of underpaid
workers up to the level previously enjoyed by the higher-paid groups
would be financially very difficult. I understand completely why, three
years in, the majority of employers would find it hard if such a
process had to be carried out immediately. I assume, therefore, that
subsection (3) is about transitional arrangements, but the use of the
phrase &#147;long-term&#148; would give far too much power and
timing to the employer and less consideration to the
employees.</div><a name="09062410000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pay
protection will be acceptable only if it is for a limited period, and
the clause as drafted makes pay protection that perpetuates
discrimination in pay unlawful. That is because such protection cannot
be seen to have the purpose of reducing the gender pay gap and would
therefore not be justifiable. It would make it difficult for all
parties who genuinely desire a negotiated resolution 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>of pay discrimination, and will create uncertainty. I should welcome the
Minister exploring that long-term measure so that I can understand
better if something in the clause will protect against an open-ended,
kick-into-the-long-grass outcome. I await her
response.</div><a name="09062410000175"></a>

without the case being identified. New clause 25 would replace clause
64, which restates and clarifies the existing position of the
definition of a general material factor. They are not a massively
different remit. First let me concentrate on three aspects of the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendments, and then deal directly with the pay

justified by a legitimate
aim&#148;.</div><a name="09062410000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim here is not to address simply a hypothetical comparator, but the
ability of an employer to point at any reason for a differential in pay
other than sex as the protected characteristic covered by paragraph
(a).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div><a name="09062410000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000446"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The summary of the way the defence
operates was not entirely accurately put by the hon. Lady&#151;where
a factor directly discriminates against women, the defence fails; where
it indirectly discriminates, it must be objectively justified. A factor
that is not gender discriminatory must be material and significant, but
where there is no discrimination, there is no need for a justification.
That is fairly
straightforward.</div><a name="09062410000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
64 reflects the position under European law, and if I have
misunderstood subsection(2)(a), I will just pass over it. The next
point is that the objective justification test for indirect
discrimination would, in the new clause, replace the concept of
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim with the preferred
usage &#147;appropriate&#148; and &#147;necessary&#148;. That
is a block that we have already run round a couple of times. We worry
that the term &#147;necessary&#148; can be, and has been given a
overly narrow interpretation domestically. For that reason, and among
others that I cited earlier, we do not want to make that
change.</div><a name="09062410000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
the new clause is directive because the word &#147;and&#148;
between subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) requires a responsible person to
show that the factor that he seeks to rely on is neither directly nor
indirectly discriminatory as set out in subsection (2). On the other
hand, clause 64(1)&#151;this is the point that I have just
made&#151;provides that a responsible person must show that the
factor is not the difference of sex or indirectly discriminatory within
the meaning of subsection (2). We do not think that there should be a
burden on the responsible person to disprove any indirectly
discriminatory effect of a material factor, unless the claimant puts
forward some evidence suggesting that there is such an effect. The
&#147;and&#148;, as opposed to the &#147;or&#148;, would be
unnecessarily onerous on the responsible person, unless there was
evidence to suggest that there was a discriminatory effect.</div>
<a name="09062410000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
there is a need for a material factor defence, and I do not think that
the hon. Lady is saying anything different from that. The explanatory
notes give one example, which is about a bonus payment. It would
largely benefit male employees in this example, and can be justified
because it is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of
encouraging employees to work unsociable hours. There are almost fine
shades of distinction between the hon. Lady&#146;s clause and our
clause, when we are driving at the same purpose, but the two aspects
that I have referred to make her clause unacceptable.</div>
<a name="09062410000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should draw
to the Committee&#146;s attention points about clause 64. It removes
the word &#147;genuine&#148;, which many of us are used to when
describing the material factor defence, but it does not change the
substance of the current law. I want to make that clear. Employers will
still have to show that the factor is not a sham or
pretence&#151;subsection (1) makes it clear that the difference must
be because of the material factors. It will have to be real. Secondly,
subsection (2) incorporates the effect of European Community law in
respect of objective justification of indirectly discriminatory
factors.</div>
<a name="09062410000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
subsection (3) contains a new provision, stating that the long-term
objective of reducing pay inequality is always to be considered a
legitimate aim for the purposes of subsection (2)&#151;the hon. Lady
characterised that as the long grass provision. It is intended to
acknowledge that strategies to reduce long-term pay 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>inequality may need a reasonable time to work before equality is
achieved. It is not intended to be a &#147;get out of jail
free&#148; card for discriminatory employers. Any action taken to
achieve that aim has got to be proportionate, but we intend to
encourage those on both sides of pay negotiations to move
forward.</div><a name="09062410000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady talked about pay protection. As she rightly said, where there
is unequal pay, the availability of consensual
arrangements&#151;negotiations&#151;is important in coming to a
situation in which the move, albeit direct, deliberate and steady,
towards equal pay is done at a rate that is realistic for the employer
in question. To drive that agenda, we put the provision in, making it
clear that there is, as it were, a statement about that being a
practical and acceptable way forward. The provision is certainly not
intended to let employers off the
hook.</div><a name="09062410000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the example referred to by the hon. Lady, unless the pay protection had
the effect of gradually bringing the parties closer within a
foreseeable time, all that would be done is to re-entrench the previous
discriminatory unequal pay. Theoretically, a further action could be
brought. Unequal pay will always have to be drawing nearer to equality;
the provision just acknowledges that there is sometimes a need for
delicacy, but we intend that process to happen as quickly as it
can.</div><a name="09062410000196"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000448"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b><b class="B"> </b>Forgive me, Mr. Benton,
but are we not on amendment 258?</div>
<a name="09062410000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000449"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Question is that clause 65 stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09062410000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000450"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. May I
apologise? The reason for the confusion is that we tabled an amendment
to leave out the clause, but that is not printed on the list. My hon.
Friend&#146;s intention is to speak briefly to clause stand part,
because there is an argument to leave it out, if that would be
acceptable&#151;despite the double attempt to move that
proposal.</div><a name="09062410000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000451"></a>The
Chairman:</b> One grows used to such things. To clarify,
amendment 258 was not selected and therefore cannot be moved. However,
I will allow a discussion on clause 65 stand
part.</div>
<a name="09062410000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000452"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton, you are
very kind. I thank the Committee for its patience.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div><a name="09062410000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The threshold
for bringing an equal pay case is higher than for direct
discrimination&#151;it is more difficult to bring a case. That is
because a person must find a real comparator against which they can
show that they are being discriminated against, which is not always
possible, and a person who discriminates can use the material factor
defence where one exists. Neither of those hurdles applies in direct
discrimination
cases.</div><a name="09062410000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being
paid differently because of gender is clearly a detriment. Rather than
impose a higher threshold to be able to take a case to end pay
discrimination, the Bill should make it easier to take action. The
scale of pay discrimination against women should make us favour
concrete measures that make ending such discrimination easier. Removing
the clause would enhance protection for people who face pay
discrimination because of their gender. Where they cannot find a real
comparator, or the discriminator finds a spurious material factor
defence, the door would still be open to take a direct discrimination
case. On that basis, I wanted to argue against the clause.</div>
<a name="09062410000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000453"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Lady
seeks to remove the clause on the basis that it would change the
existing law. The short answer is that it would not. That is our firm
conviction, and I am happy to explain why. I do not wish to put her in
a hot spot, but if she thought that the clause would change existing
law, I can explain why it would not outside the Committee if that is
quicker.</div><a name="09062410000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000454"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is not our suggestion that the clause would
change the existing law. We contend that the existing law has not
worked. The fact that one has to go through this route to make the
claim is one of the many reasons why it has not worked, and we know
that the Government share our concern.</div>
<a name="09062410000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000455"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Then I will set out how we think the
provisions work. The sex discrimination provisions of the Bill do not
apply where the equality clause or rule provisions operate. It is right
to ensure that a remedy for a particular wrong is a single specified
remedy rather than a matter of choice from a menu, and that is what the
clause achieves. We have already discussed our general approach to
equal pay in the Bill. Essentially, equal pay is contract-based,
achieved by modifying or reading in a term of an employee&#146;s
contract of employment to ensure equality with a colleague of the
opposite sex doing equal work. We have maintained that position in the
equality clause provisions of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09062410000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In &#147;A
Framework for Fairness&#148;, we consulted on whether to maintain
that contractual approach, and a significant majority of respondents
favoured it, although I recognise that some take a contrary view. We
have tried to adjust the relationship between equal pay and the
discrimination provisions to ensure that there is no gap by allowing
claims of direct discrimination in respect of contractual pay. I think
that I said that in a previous debate as well. As we have already
discussed, we believe that doing away with the separate contractual
approach could lead to considerable uncertainty and
confusion.</div><a name="09062410000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sex discrimination provisions listed in the table apply only to
non-contractual pay and benefits such as promotion, transfer and
training and to offers of employment or appointment to office, except
as provided 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>by clause 66 in respect of direct discrimination. For example, if a
company offers more training or promotion opportunities to men because
it believes they will stay longer than women, a claim of sex
discrimination by the women would come under the sex discrimination
provisions. If it is not clear&#151;this might be what is concerning
the hon. Lady&#151;whether a particular claim relates to benefits
that are contractual or non-contractual, it can be made, as is
currently the case, under both provisions, and the tribunal will, to
put it in technical language, sort it
out.</div>
<a name="09062410000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also maintains the distinction between the provisions for equality in
terms of occupational pension schemes and the provisions that prohibit
sex discrimination in giving access to such a scheme. It is worth
pointing out that where a woman cannot identify a comparator doing
equal work and wants to make a claim involving contract terms not
relating to pay, such as promotion, the sex discrimination provisions
will apply to such a claim. Again, the position is the same as before.
I understand the change that the hon. Lady seeks, but the Government
see the clause as an essential aspect of the functioning of the Bill. I
hope that the Committee will therefore agree that it should stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="09062410000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000456"></a>Lynne

protect people who discuss their pay with

to ensure that if any firm seeks to impose a pay secrecy clause, which
might be a mechanism for covering up gender pay inequality, it does not
work and cannot be applied. I state on the record my party&#146;s
thorough support for the clause. It will be particularly important when
we come to discuss the wider issue of gender pay audits in clause 73.
It is, in our view, a thoroughly sensible and proportionate way of
attacking part of the problems of the gender pay gap. It is entirely
reasonable and proportionate to the problem in hand. I just wanted to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000458"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I, too, welcome the clause. By introducing
it, the Government will have rolled back some of the disparities and
the secrecy that there has been around pay since time immemorial. That
is one of the great inhibitors to individuals being able to know
whether they have something to be aggrieved about. The clause is a
start but, when we come to the next clause, we shall expand on the

disclose their pay if they do not want to. It does not stop employers
preventing employees from discussing their pay with or disclosing it to
competitors or other people who are not colleagues of the employee, so
it should not have any unintended consequences. We think, as colleagues
do, that the clause is a useful tool to promote pay transparency and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000462"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The amendment is designed to probe the
Government on the decision that they have made on the number of
employees that an organisation must employ to be subject to the gender
pay gap clause requirements when they arise. The Government
refer to 250 employees in the private sector. I do not fully understand
why that number has been selected. In our evidence session, reference
was made to a reduced number. Women Like Us said that organisations
with 100-plus employees often have dedicated human resource departments
or facilities, so issues would not be too onerous as such departments
should be able to contribute their experience of auditing. It was also
said that the reference to 250 employees leaves out of the gender pay
audit requirement a huge proportion of businesses in the United
Kingdom. About half the people in the United Kingdom are employed in
businesses with fewer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>than 250 members of staff, so huge sectors of the population would not
be provided with protection under the Bill, when the regulations come
into force. Given that 80 per cent. of the population are not employed
in the public sector, will the Minister explain why the figure of 250
employees has been
chosen?</div><a name="09062410000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am saving some remarks to the end of the debate, but I now move to new
clause 23. It would extend the period for publishing information to
three years. That is a reasonable timetable. It would not be too
onerous, nor would it be so irregular as to be out of date.
Subsection (2) of the new clause deals with the information
that must be published and would distinguish the differentials between
male and female pay in an organisation. The information published under
paragraph (c) would highlight discrimination in the types of work
undertaken wholly or mainly by women so that we can see what is being
done and by whom, how that work is valued, whether it is of equal value
and whether the pay demonstrates an unjustified differential or a
legitimate aim subject to the defence of a material
factor.</div><a name="09062410000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our evidence session, we heard from the Fawcett Society that, if we are
to eradicate discrimination and unequal pay, we have to evaluate the
skills and experience that are required for jobs and check whether
individuals in equivalent jobs are being paid equivalent salaries. That
is why new clause 23 proposes publishing both the levels and types of
work. Women&#146;s work is often undervalued and major cases have
involved equal value in the public sector. That undervalue has
delivered low pay for women for decades. It has not been adequate
simply to have provisions that make that illegal, which is why pay
audits are necessary they make sure that checks are in place so that
people are not discriminated
against.</div><a name="09062410000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is only by seeing how people are treated compared with others at levels
and types of work that we will ever be able to bring a case to a
tribunal to right those wrongs. If we cannot find that out, the gagging
clauses that we referred to earlier, while they are extremely welcome
and helpful&#151;for which I say, &#147;Well done&#148; to the
Government&#151;will not give the overall picture to enable an
individual to make a judgment about a company&#146;s relative pay or
jobs.</div><a name="09062410000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative amendment of only imposing mandatory pay audits when there
is a finding against a company will not work. It seems to be logical to
punish when there is something judged to be punishable, but the reality
is that such a policy will not address unequal pay because the
individuals cannot get the evidence to bring the matter to a tribunal
to get the judgment. As I understand it, the company would be required
to publish mandatory pay audits thereafter. That will not address the
issue in the first place. It will not provide the
evidence.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000463"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I point it out to the hon. Lady that we have not
tabled, or had selected, an amendment that goes through Conservative
policy. She is right to say what Conservative policy is, although
obviously we would disagree about her analysis of its shortcomings, but
we cannot necessarily enter into a debate on what she is saying without
an awful lot of latitude from the Chair, because no such amendment is
selected for debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div><a name="09062410000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000464"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. My mind was going along that avenue. We
have been straying a little from amendment 248 and new clause 23.
Perhaps we can confine ourselves to them. I shall allow the widest
debate I can, but we are dealing with those
amendments.</div>
<a name="09062410000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000465"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. I
think that my hon. Friend is setting out a different approach to pay
audits and contrasting it, quite reasonably, with the
Government&#146;s approach. I must say I wondered to what extent she
might refer to alternative approaches, in proposing her new regime,
which is supported by the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="09062410000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have indicated that I am prepared to allow the
broadest possible debate, but I want to sound a cautionary note about
constant references to a Conservative amendment that is not going to
figure
anywhere.</div><a name="09062410000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000467"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I merely
wanted to say that any such idea would not provide the same rigour as
mandatory pay audits, which can be viewed by an individual to reveal
whether there is discrimination against them in pay level, work type or
conditions, or more
widely.</div><a name="09062410000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) of the new clause deals with packages in connection with pay. Those
are often left out of such debates. The subsection would introduce the
idea that the entire package, not just the pay itself, should be
considered. I looked at the issue with reference to Cambridge
university, and it was clear from its pay audit, which was published
voluntarily, I believe, that men were being offered much better
packages, including such things as accommodation and moving costs, to
bring them to the job, whereas women on the same pay grade, perhaps,
were not being offered such packages. That is
discrimination.</div><a name="09062410000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
one establishment, where most market supplements for higher grades were
for men, one administrator was getting 125 per cent. of salary as a
market supplement. That is back-door discrimination, and we want that
eradicated. It operates outside pay levels and work type, but is to do
with the package that goes with getting the job. I am using that only
as an example of the sort of discrimination that can happen outside the
pay level. Subsection (3) would require publication so that any such
bias inherent in a company would be made
transparent.</div><a name="09062410000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(7) of the new clause would provide teeth, so that action could be
taken if there was failure to publish. An employer who failed to
publish would lose the right to use or submit the material factor
defence for the period in which there was failure to comply with the
requirement.</div>
<a name="09062410000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
essential points of the new clause, apart from the fact that it would
define a designated employer as one with more than 100 employees,
referring back to amendment 248. I shall be pleased and interested to
hear what the Minister has to
say.</div><a name="09062410000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000468"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I applaud the hon. Lady&#146;s instinct in
tabling the two amendments, even though I suspect that we would
disagree strongly about the means and mechanisms. It is important to
put it on record that I hope and expect Committee members from all
parties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>to share the common goal&#151;I am sure that we do&#151;of reducing
and eliminating the gender pay gap by whatever means
necessary.</div><a name="09062410000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we disagree with the hon. Lady&#146;s proposed mechanisms. Although a
degree of employer-based discrimination is clearly part of the gender
pay gap, most analyses also make the valid point that a number of other
important factors are at work. It is important not to pursue or base
legislation on the notion that employers are the only cause. It is also
necessary to ensure that any means that we take to drive through
reduction of the gender pay gap are proportionate.</div>
<a name="09062410000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
permission, Mr. Benton, I will expand on our concerns during
clause stand part debate, but we contend&#151;I think that the
Government&#146;s own analysis supports this&#151;that the gender
pay gap has many other causes, which have to do with disadvantage in
society in everything from access to education and onwards. However,
within companies where differentials exist between men&#146;s and
women&#146;s pay, any direct discrimination must clearly be dealt
with vigorously and strongly. That is why, during our debate on clause
72, the hon. Lady and I both emphasised our support for measures
designed to ensure that it is illegal to have a contract term that
stops men and women in the same company communicating about their pay.
That is an important mechanism. However, there are many other reasons
why pay differentials might exist in the same company. For example,
women might not be well represented at senior levels. That would
inevitably lead to differentials.</div>
<a name="09062410000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000469"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I believe that the hon. Gentleman made the
same point to the panel during the evidence session. When the Fawcett
Society was asked how much of the pay gap could be laid at the door of
discrimination by businesses rather than other factors, it was
extremely robust, saying
that</div><a name="09062410000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when
people have decomposed the gender pay gap to look at the different
elements that contribute to it, discrimination is the largest factor of
all&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Equality Public
Bill Committee, </i>2 June 2009; c. 57,
Q114.]</div><a name="09062410000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000470"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I am glad that the hon. Lady brought that up.
Although the Fawcett Society witnesses did not mention which document
they were referring to, they might have been referring to a research
finding from the Equal Opportunities Commission on modelling gender pay
gaps, which says that the largest single underlying cause of gender pay
gaps, at 38 per cent.,
is</div><a name="09062410000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;due
to other factors associated with being female, including direct
discrimination and differences in the labour market motivations and
preferences of women as compared with men. Some of this will be
attributable to indirect discrimination or systematic
disadvantage&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062410000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Fawcett
Society was right to say that the largest single element includes
direct discrimination. However, it is not true to say, and I do not
think that the Fawcett Society was saying, that the largest single
element is direct discrimination. That 38 per cent. includes several
other crucial factors, which previous Governments have addressed, and
the current Government, and I hope future Governments, will continue to
address via different mechanisms. Frankly, those factors should not be
addressed via discrimination. It is not necessarily true to say that
direct discrimination is the largest factor. In fact, in all
probability it will be only a subset of 38 per
cent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="09062410000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000471"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Even if we accept that it is not the largest
factor, given that the hon. Gentleman said that like previous
Governments, this Government and future Governments want to tackle
everything else, there seems to be no good reason not to seize the
opportunity set out in my hon. Friend&#146;s new clause to tackle
that component. It is only justifiable not to do so, or to seek to do
so in a weaker way, if they do not think that it is a problem. To leave
out employers from the package of measures is in itself
disproportionate&#151;it is out of proportion because there is a
problem and no solution is being proposed, or not a strong enough one.
That is where the disproportionate consideration comes&#151;not that
this measure is disproportionate.</div>
<a name="09062410000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000472"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for, I think, making
my point. He is right to say that we cannot ignore direct
discrimination by employers and I am sure that everyone agrees with
that. That is why the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green and I both
rose to make the point on clause 72 about making sure that there is
better pay transparency by ensuring that it is illegal for employers to
make it a contract term that people cannot discuss their pay with their
colleagues at work.</div>
<a name="09062410000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
policy&#151;I will not try Mr. Benton&#146;s patience,
but the hon. Lady mentioned it, so I shall illustrate it&#151;is that
we believe it is sensible to have pay audits for companies that have
been found to be directly discriminating. That is clearly a sensible
step to take in such situations. However, our contention is that it is
a disproportionate approach to companies that have not been found to be
involved in direct discrimination in other cases, because of all the
other factors that are also at
work.</div><a name="09062410000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000473"></a>John
Mason:</b> The hon. Gentleman is setting an almost impossible
barrier by saying that, in the first place, discrimination has to be
proved, and then there has to be an audit or information has to be
provided. Surely one of the themes of the past few weeks has been that
providing information is inherently a good thing and if an employer has
particular reasons for differences, they could presumably then explain
them.</div><a name="09062410000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000474"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
I do not think that the barrier is impossible at all&#151;it is
perfectly reasonable. Again, it is important to assess the degree of
proportionality: what is the size and cost of the burden that we are
imposing to address the particular part of the gender pay gap that we
are seeking to sort out? The costs of the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal
would be on the wrong side of that line. Our contention is that ours is
a modest and reasonable way of balancing the
two.</div><a name="09062410000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that there is a balance to be
struck and that is what we are trying to do. That is why I was
clarifying our reason for agreeing with the end that the hon. Lady is
striving towards and our concerns about the proportionality of the
means rather than anything else.</div>
<a name="09062410000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000475"></a>John
Mason:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions costs. Surely, in this
day and age, with computer systems as they are&#151;I have worked in
a number of small organisations which have quite sophisticated computer
systems&#151;there is not a great cost in providing the
information.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div><a name="09062410000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000476"></a>John
Penrose:</b> The hon. Gentleman comes on to a point that I
plan to make in the clause stand part debate about the
Government&#146;s impact assessment. I shall confine my remarks for
the moment to quoting a comment which is attributed&#151;although
many are&#151;to Jack Welch, former, much celebrated chief executive
of General Electric in the States. When he was being presented with a
very long and involved set of financial projections by someone from
General Electric&#146;s finance department, which involved detailed
calculations that were expressed to many decimal points, he looked at
the chap making the presentation and said, &#147;Son, I don&#146;t
know about the accuracy of those last two digits in that number, but I
am pretty sure that the first one is wrong.&#148; I feel that the
calculation of the costs of this measure is woefully under-egged, which
goes directly to my contention about
proportionality.</div>
<a name="09062410000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000477"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman argued briefly that it is
legitimate to do the audit work where a case of direct discrimination
has been identified. However, if one knows&#151;one does know and we
can argue about the degree to which it is a factor&#151;that it is
endemic, that is like arguing that people should be advised to eat
healthily only after they have had a heart attack. That misses the
point of the whole range of people whose health would benefit from
that. Will he explain the rationale for such an after-the-fact
approach, even if it were to
work?</div><a name="09062410000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000478"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I would use a different analogy, which is that
people, and in this case companies, should be innocent until proven
guilty. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is a degree of
direct discrimination, but by describing it as endemic he is assuming
that all companies are guilty of it. That is a dangerous assumption,
which is not necessarily supported by any data. A large number of
companies have taken enormous steps, and the data that I will quote
later&#151;again provided by the Office for National
Statistics&#151;will show that there have been real steps in reducing
the gender pay gap since the equal pay legislation was first passed. We
have still further to go, but it is deeply unfair and inaccurate to
assume that all companies are guilty of gender pay discrimination and
direct discrimination. There is no evidence for
that.</div><a name="09062410000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
<a name="09062410000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000479"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Reluctant though I am to go to the dictionary,
given what the Minister said previously, medically
&#147;endemic&#148; does not mean that everyone has a condition,
but that it is widespread and ingrained. The allegation that I said
every company is guilty is wrong, and the hon. Gentleman understates
the issue by saying that only those found guilty have a problem. He
thinks that the problem of the pay gap and direct discrimination has
not been a big enough problem for enough people&#151;women&#151;for
long enough for more action to be imposed on employers. That is the nub
of the political disagreement between us. I suppose that is why we have
politics and
elections.</div><a name="09062410000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000480"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his dictionary
definition, which, I hope, makes it clear that he does not think that
all employers, or even a majority, are involved in direct
discrimination. I hope that he thinks that it is a minority of
employers, and a reducing minority. My point is that it is unfair to
assume that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="09062410000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would pick
up the hon. Gentleman on his attempt to put words into my mouth about
the description of Conservative policy. I believe it is important to

<a name="09062410000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000481"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. There is far too much background
noise.</div>
<a name="09062410000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000482"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I had just finished.</div>
<a name="09062410000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000483"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Obviously, we will have a clause stand
part debate, so let me not spread my remarks too widely. In relation to
the comments of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare about all
companies being innocent until proven guilty, without a provision such
as clause 73 companies would be able to hide their guilt by
not disclosing the figures. Surely that is the major policy difference
between us&#151;and probably the Liberal Democrats&#151;and the
Conservatives. He says that there should be a mandatory pay audit when
direct discrimination against someone is proven, but, as we all know,
such cases rarely get to court. It is a tour de force to get one, as it
requires a lot of courage for a person to be present.</div>
<a name="09062410000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
nature of the proposed pay audit after a finding of unequal pay in a
tribunal, it would be mandatory for the tribunal to impose the pay
audit on the business, even if the case itself had had the effect of
making a business put its business right. That would be absolutely
onerous on business and is a fatal flaw in the Conservative
proposals.</div>
<a name="09062410000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000484"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Will the Minister expand on her comments about
the difficulty of getting information about pay inequality? We have
just had a brief stand part debate on clause 72, which provides
important clarification and transparency. I hope she will
accept&#151;I am sure that she does, because it is a Government
clause&#151;that that is an important mechanism for improving and
introducing transparency in future of the kind that she has
described.</div>
<a name="09062410000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000485"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is a useful tool, as we all agree.
The provision is about one-to-one disclosure and is relatively modest.
Unequal pay is systemic and we have to find a way of getting it out of
the system. Much of the time the only way to do that is to make people
disclose that it might be there. If it is not, there is no problem. If
it is, they must disclose it so that we can get rid of it, or we simply
have no way of getting through. Although that is not the only
difficulty with the legislation that we have had since 1974, it is a
key one.</div>
<a name="09062410000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fine to
give someone the right to bring an action for equal pay, but if they do
not know that they are suffering from unequal pay, then it is hard to
exercise such a right. We have to go way beyond the previous clause,
which would allow me to ask the man sitting next to me whether he is
getting &#163;10 more an hour than I am. That is obviously a first
step, but there is a need for a great deal more transparency across the
piece before we can start to tackle continuing pay
discrimination.</div>
<a name="09062410000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the hon. Gentleman takes on board the nature of pay
discrimination. He argues that businesses are not all bad or even
endemically bad, but the Government do not begin from the position that

<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>there is something inherently bad about business. However, we must
appreciate that direct discrimination continues and that it is a
component. I do not know whether it is a very large or very small
component&#151;I suspect that it is significant&#151;but requiring
the disclosure of pay information is about not only direct
discrimination, but indirect discrimination. That fact is totally left
out whenever he argues that we are driving at a tiny bit of unequal pay
with our anti-discrimination measures. It is not tiny; it is a very
significant part of unequal
pay.</div><a name="09062410000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say that to be as fair to business as I can: I am pretty satisfied that
experience shows that the kind of disclosure that we will require
through the mechanisms in clause 73 often takes businesses
by surprise. Some businesses have not deliberately had indirectly
discriminatory provisions, although some probably have. Discriminatory
provisions might result from a business never having looked at them.
They might also result from historic mergers, separations and
reorganisations. It might be that nobody has evaluated whether
component A of the business in warehouse Z is being underpaid in
relation to warehouse Y in another part of the country. None the less,
the employer is the same and so it needs to have equal pay. The figures
are the way to get that out. That is another important element of
discrimination that the hon. Gentleman never takes on board: he only
ever talks about direct
discrimination.</div><a name="09062410000268"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000486"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I intend to address both kinds of discrimination
when we get the clause stand part debate.</div>
<a name="09062410000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that such measures take companies by surprise because they
discover things they did not know. How can she square that with the
calculation of the implementation costs in the Government&#146;s
impact
assessment:</div><a name="09062410000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have assumed that the salary/wage data needed to calculate and publish
the companies&#146; gender pay gaps are already collected and
available at least for businesses with 250 or more employees who are
companies under the Companies Act 2006. We have also assumed data
identifying each employee&#146;s gender will be
held&#148;?</div><a name="09062410000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have assumed that all the necessary data to create a gender
pay audit is already held in a readily accessible, easily identifiable
form in a company, but she has just implied that companies do not know
what is going on because data are not held in a convenient form and
that the companies have not been able to see them. Either they are held
in a convenient form or they are not. If they are not, the impact
assessment will have overestimated the number of businesses that have
the
data.</div><a name="09062410000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000487"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is miles away from
the point that I am trying to make. I said nothing whatever about such
discrimination being unknown to business because the data were not
available in an accessible form. Data might be available, but are they
being looked at in a way that discloses pay gaps? Very often, that is
not the case. If on the other hand he wants to argue that all indirect
discrimination is wilfully brought about by businesses who have the
data available and do not put right a problem they know about, that is
up to him, but I would have thought that that was quite a long way to
go. I was simply trying to be fair and to say that I am rather anxious
that we should not assume, as he did a minute ago, that all businesses
are deliberately getting it wrong.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div><a name="09062410000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessment has been properly done and carefully evaluated and it is
correct. None the less, the principle remains. One can take
examples from the numerous local authorities that got tied down in the
whole single status argument that has been going on for years. Many of
them did not know that they were discriminating against particular
groups of women, as opposed to particular groups of men, because they
have never had to look at the respective pay that was being given. The
only way anyone is able to do that is if they know about it. If they
also declare in a way that is compatible with the next local authority,
they can compare like with like and see why they are in a different
position. There is no clash between what I just said and the impact
assessment.</div>
<a name="09062410000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
information, and we need it to be disclosed by the public sector and by
the private sector in a way that makes it directly comparable, business
with business, sector by sector, so that we can see where the deficits
are. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that a number of businesses
already disclose information&#151;we accept that completely and are
pleased about it. On that bedrock of people who already do, we shall
build, engaging them in the group that the commission will manage in
order to come to the appropriate measurements, but also because they
will be undoubtedly the first ones to declare under the new metrics
what they have already been declaring under the old metrics. They will
form the platform from which we can all look at the people who are not
disclosing their metrics or who are disclosing them in some way that
makes them less
identifiable.</div><a name="09062410000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000488"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> If there are companies who are disclosing, they
are the good guys, but what about those people who currently do not
disclose? What makes the Minister think that they will do so
voluntarily? What is the justification for waiting for another four
years before making it compulsory, given that so many companies do not
bother?</div><a name="09062410000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000489"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The basis on which we think that it
will work is that once one has the metrics&#151;I shall come in a
minute to setting the system up, which should produce metrics that both
sides of industry can agree quickly&#151;the material will have to be
made available publicly. It will have to be made available in an
accessible form, and it will compare business A, business B and
business C. Disclosure now tends to be made&#151;I am not
criticising&#151;in a way that is not directly comparable. One might
have bank A disclosing all the material that one needs to know, but
bank B disclosing it in a different way. One would need to be enough of
an insider in bank A and bank B to be able to compare. The stuff has to
be the same, so that the employee or the trade union can see where the
problems are. If bank A is already disclosing the stuff, and bank C is
already disclosing the stuff, any sensible customer, any sensible
investor and, overwhelmingly, any woman in her right mind is not going
to go for a job with a business that is deliberately not disclosing the
fact that it must have a pay gap. If it does not have a pay gap, it
would disclose the information.</div>
<a name="09062410000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000490"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Could there not be a perverse incentive
there? One of the reasons for us all wanting exposure of all the
information around pay is that our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>suspicion is that those who do not disclose it are underpaying women.
Therefore, they might be able to offer goods more cheaply. Is that not
the argument that business is making&#151;&#147;This is a cost to
business. We won&#146;t do it and therefore, by discriminating,
we&#146;re able to keep our costs
down&#148;?</div><a name="09062410000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000491"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It will not be five minutes before some
bold trade union notices bank B in that non-disclosure position and has
a good look at what is going on in the interstices of the pay
structure. Transparency is the key, it really is. It is not something
that is soft and waffly that will take ages to implement, instead of
which we should be hitting business now with a big poleaxe. We are
suggesting a sensible way forward, and therefore we favour clause 73
over the proposals in new clause 23 and amendment
248.</div><a name="09062410000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would set out in the Bill details of the gender pay gap
information that employers should publish periodically. It would
enable&#151;specifically provide for&#151;such information to be
used as evidence of a breach of an equality rule or clause, where that
case can be made. The clause obviously also has penalties for a failure
to publish designated information. Further, it would effectively
require a gender pay audit as a precursor to publication, but does not
really provide any flexibility in how to go about
that.</div><a name="09062410000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Government agree with some of the rationale behind the new clause,
we are not calling for pay audits in the Bill. There are a number of
other significant problems with the new clause. First, it jumps the gun
on our proposal, which I am pleased is now accepted by all parties. The
Equality and Human Rights Commission and representatives from business
and unions are already engaged in the exercise of identifying what
measurements and what gender pay gap information employers with at
least 250 staff&#151;I will come to that in a minute&#151;will be
encouraged to report on, on a voluntary basis.</div>
<a name="09062410000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that following its evidence, the CBI&#151;the Committee will recall
its representative&#151;indicated that it would encourage the
reporting once the measurements have been fixed up. It is engaged in
the process now. They have all come together in this way. Later this
summer, we look forward to consulting on the options that they have
proposed&#151;in fact, they will consult&#151;before they make the
recommendations, which will be before the end of the year. Therefore,
it is a short-term exercise, and what we should get in the end is
material that everyone agrees should come out, and that we will not end
up forcing on unwilling
people.</div><a name="09062410000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000492"></a>John
Penrose:</b> To pick up on the point about the CBI&#146;s
comments in our evidence session a couple of weeks ago, I gained the
impression that when the Minister asked the question of the lady from
the CBI, she said that it was willing to engage with the Government if
the clause went through on the ground that, I suspect, it would rather
be inside the tent and participating, rather than having it done to
them. I did not take the lady from the CBI&#151;in fact, other
comments made outside the evidence session support this&#151;to be
saying that the CBI supports the principle of these gender pay audits
in quite the broad way that the Minister perhaps inferred.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div><a name="09062410000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
that clear, as the Minister rightly picked up other members of the
Committee on earlier clauses when they quoted external stakeholder
bodies and inferred their support for a particular point of view when
the stakeholder bodies might not have
agreed.</div><a name="09062410000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000493"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not sure that I follow the point.
The CBI representative said clearly that if the provisions are
introduced she will encourage her membership to abide by them. I was
immensely cheered by that, although I am not surprised by it: there are
a lot of ways in which the CBI is well ahead of the Tory party on this
matter. A number of really modern employers do not adhere, in the way
that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s abysmal Back-Benchers did on Second
Reading, to the anti-equality, &#147;Let&#146;s go so, so, so, so
softly&#148; approach because equality is the opposite of business
progress. That is simply not the
case.</div><a name="09062410000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
businesses in the CBI are perfectly capable of understanding that
business progress and equality go together&#151;they are not the
enemies of one another. We are trying to harness that understanding,
which modern businesses have, in setting them up with the unions and
the commission to put together absolutely agreeable metrics. I am sure
that they will have to argue the toss about what the metrics are. I am
sure that the two sides will exhibit their natural instincts to protect
their own interests, or that of their members. None the less, they are
all willing and ready to do it. Indeed, they are even waiting, as the
hon. Gentleman suggested, for the measure to pass. They are already
going about the business of doing it and I am very
pleased.</div><a name="09062410000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no question of waiting four years, although I know exactly what my
hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock meant about the
lack of compulsion for four years. However, we are not waiting four
years until we start along the road of getting that material out. The
commission will report, I think annually, about progress. It will be
saying what the metrics are, how many businesses in all the sectors
have produced the metrics and what the metrics are starting to
disclose. It will also map what progress the transparency is making
towards equal pay. It is a process that starts now, and if it has not
finished in four years, there will be more to say and
do.</div><a name="09062410000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000494"></a>John
Penrose:</b> To be clear, I share the Minister&#146;s view
that the CBI agrees that equality is good for business, and my party
would also share that view in many respects, but I want to be
absolutely clear that the CBI&#146;s participation in the
Government&#146;s consultation does not necessarily mean that it
likes the fundamental idea of clause 73. In fact, the brief that it
circulated states:</div>
<a name="09062410000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
CBI does not support clause 73 of the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="09062410000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be trying to mitigate the damage by participating should the clause
go through, but let us be clear about the principle: the CBI does not
like
it.</div><a name="09062410000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000495"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is puzzling to know why the CBI does
not like the clause, if that is its true position. I asked the
representative of the CBI in the evidence session:</div>
<a name="09062410000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Will
the CBI take responsibility once the metrics are worked out with the
rest of it for driving the requirement through its membership to comply
with disclosing those metrics?&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div><a name="09062410000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ms Hall
said:</div><a name="09062410000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would absolutely encourage our employers to use it if we come up with a
system that works... I have to be equally clear that we do not
support a legislative
solution&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Equality
Public Bill Committee, </i>9 June 2009; c. 94,
Q175.]</div><a name="09062410000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked her clearly, &#147;Will you help encourage?&#148; I used the
word &#147;encourage&#148;. She said that she would drive it
through her membership. What does the Tory party have against
that?</div><a name="09062410000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000496"></a>John
Penrose:</b> The Minister has just proved my point. The
question that she asked was, &#147;Will you be encouraging your
members to obey or disobey the law,&#148; and the CBI rightly said,
&#147;We will be encouraging them to obey it.&#148; It went on to
say, &#147;And we do not agree with a legislative solution.&#148; I
think that we are saying the same thing. I just want to ensure for the
record that everyone is clear about where the CBI
stands.</div><a name="09062410000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000497"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I think that we are saying absolutely
opposite things. I am saying that the CBI, unlike the Tory party, is
happy to support driving the metrics, once they are fixed&#151;that
is what the lady from the CBI said; it is very interesting and I am
most grateful to have been given that quote&#151;through its
membership. That is as strong as anyone could wish it and this is not a
question whether Ms Hall will encourage people not to break the
law.</div><a name="09062410000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock has just made it
clear that it is not the law that the information has to be disclosed
and it will not be for years. The CBI was saying that it will drive
voluntary compliance through its membership once the metrics are fixed.
Ms Hall is saying that she would prefer it to be voluntary from start
to finish and there not to be set out in clause 73 the ability for a
Minister to in due course require compliance. That is what she is
saying about the legislation. She is not saying that she does not agree
with all this, although it seems as though the CBI is well ahead of the
Tory party in that position, which is a shame, bearing in mind the
protestations that have been made latterly about how much the Tory
party is on board with equal pay&#151;not for very long, it
seems.</div><a name="09062410000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyway,
let me move on and say that the consultation process that we shall go
through is a major reason for the Government&#146;s decision to make
the clause as flexible as possible as to what information may be
required from 2013, as we need to see how the voluntary arrangements
work in practice and whether refinements for any 2013 legislative
regime may be
required.</div><a name="09062410000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 23, tabled by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, would
bypass the voluntary regime by requiring designated employers to comply
with the information publication requirements within 12 months. We
prefer our commitment to working with willing stakeholders to come up
with a system that is as workable as possible for them. It would be
wrong to prejudge our discussions, as the new clause would do. It talks
of consultation with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, but that
is on supplementary regulations, not the main reporting principles in
the
Bill.</div><a name="09062410000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Make
no mistake: I share the frustration at the lack of progress in closing
the pay gap, but bypassing what looks like a process to which all
parties are committed and having mandatory arrangements in force by
2011 would run the risk of riding roughshod over the legitimate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>voice of both sides of the business community. Progress can better be
made by bringing employers with us&#151;by including, encouraging and
cajoling, rather than compelling. We now have the commitment to drive
through, which I am very pleased
about.</div><a name="09062410000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that does not work, clause 73 is there. That is what the CBI does not
want and it is all the CBI does not want. I do not know why the Tories
are trying to pretend that somehow the CBI is opposed to equal pay,
because it is not, on the evidence that we saw. Anyway, that is where
the Tories are and that is where we are on this issue. Happily, the CBI
is standing right behind me on this occasion&#151;and we are not even
in a queue. If it does not
work&#151;</div><a name="09062410000298"></a>

Penrose:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09062410000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000499"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall finish my sentence, then I
will. In 2013, if this has not worked, make no mistake: we will use
clause
73.</div><a name="09062410000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000500"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I want to clarify the point by asking the
Minister to point to any part of my remarks in which I said that the
CBI is opposed to equal
pay.</div><a name="09062410000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000501"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that the CBI is
against the legislative provision on this. He suggested that it was
saying that it would drive this through its membership only in order
not to advise its members to break the law. He knows that that is
risible, because the provision does not say that employers must
disclose the information. It says that if they do not, in due course
they will be made to. However, at the moment it is not about driving
the membership to avoid breaking the law. It is about willingness to
help with trying to reach an amicable solution. We have a fundamental
distinction of principle between the Government stance and the Tory
stance, as disclosed in recent interventions. It was fairly clear on
Second Reading where the old Tory party was coming
from.</div><a name="09062410000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether it is intentional that the Liberal Democrat new
clause would also apply to the public sector. Technically, it would,
and in a similarly unhelpful way it would cut across the specific
public sector equality duty consultation that we have just launched.
One of the duties that we propose is a duty on public authorities with
150 or more employees to publish the gender pay gap in their
organisation.</div>
<a name="09062410000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another flaw
in new clause 23&#151;at this point, I want to wrap it up with
amendment 248, which would lower the boundary of 250 employees to
100&#151;is the fact that it would apply to employers with 101 or
more employees. We do not want to prejudice the work of the Equality
and Human Rights Commission in drawing up proposals for what gender pay
gap information could be published, but providing gender pay gap
information as required by the new clause would be a significant burden
on business. Subsection (4) seems to allow for yet further information,
besides what is specified in subsection (3), to be published.</div>
<a name="09062410000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing to prevent employers with fewer than 250 employees from
reporting on their gender pay gaps, and we hope that by starting there
we shall none the less encourage the same effect among smaller
businesses, but we do not want to impose that burden on them yet. We
think, as I shall explain, that 250 is the right
threshold.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div><a name="09062410000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000502"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I believe that the Minister has said
previously that the minute a figure is mentioned&#151;26 weeks or 250
employees&#151;people who are not brought within it think that the
legislation disregards them. It would be honourable for employers with
fewer than that number of employees to provide the information
voluntarily, but the likelihood is that bad employers will not do so
unless it is
compulsory.</div><a name="09062410000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000503"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not entirely share what the hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare might characterise as an approach
suggesting that business will get away with all it can unless it is
under compulsion to do something else. I see some large and small
businesses already disclosing information; that is happening at all
levels. We have tried, for reasons that I shall set out more
specifically in a minute or two, to pick the right level at which,
ultimately, if we have to, we will impose a burden by law. That is not
to say that we do not look to the good small businesses to give a lead
by example to the less transparent small businesses.</div>
<a name="09062410000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
that we do not expect the impact from big business to drive through
little business. Odd as it may be in the current hotbed of views about
banks to characterise a bank as benevolent, quite honestly, some banks
have very good employment policies. Procurement policies in some big
businesses are, to be honest, stronger than the Government&#146;s and
they drive equality through the small businesses that want to contract
with
them.</div><a name="09062410000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we can get the ideas of transparency, disclosure and more equal pay
into bigger businesses, we expect that in turn to be usable as leverage
on small businesses, because it is clearly another thing that employers
will look at when considering how responsible they are
being.</div><a name="09062410000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09062410000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
even with the threshold at 250, the power in clause 73 covers 40 per
cent. of the people working in the private sector. That is our
information. We picked that level because we believe that it is when
private sector employers are likely to have the necessary IT
infrastructure to collate and publish the categories of gender pay gap
information with minimal additional burden. It is also worth noting
that we do not plan to place requirements on even public sector
employers with such a low head count, as the duty in the public sector
bites at
150.</div><a name="09062410000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further concern with new clause 23 is that the information required to
be published could lead to individual employees&#146; pay details
being identified if there were only one or two men or women in each row
in the organisation. I imagine that hon. Members can see my point: the
smaller the business, the fewer there are in each category, so the
closer we get to disclosing Mrs. Smith&#146;s pay, which
is probably undesirable.</div>
<a name="09062410000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of the use to which information published under the proposed
new clause could be put, subsection (8) presumes that an equality
clause should apply in equal pay proceedings when there is a difference
in average pay between women and men doing relevant types of work,
which could be rebutted only by evidence that a material factor defence
applied. In other words, the new clause would enable the published
figures to be used as a key plank of any equal pay claim that might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>be brought against the employer. That would seem to be the case
irrespective of whether the difference was material or statistically
completely insignificant. The new clause would enable an individual
female claimant, for example, to use figures that showed that women in
similar jobs were in general paid more by her employer than men in
support of a claim that she is being paid less than a man.</div>
<a name="09062410000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point
demonstrates well how difficult it is to get the balance right between
the level of disclosure and the consequences of that disclosure for
employers and employees. That is why our approach of learning from the
voluntary regime and people on the front line will operate from 2010.
We want to create a situation in which employers look at their pay
arrangements and equalise them as far as possible without any recourse
to litigation. All that the new clause would do is invite proceedings.
One can be fairly sure&#151;I do not know why I am supposed to say
this&#151;that there will be lawyers looking at the published
figures, seeking to target employers who look
vulnerable.</div><a name="09062410000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000504"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister for that. We are all
moving in the same direction. The point is not to defeat the
Government; they have moved a long way on equality matters. My fear is
that this Government might not be in place for ever and that some of
their measures might never come into being. I hope that she is right in
her faith and belief that a voluntary regime will somehow lead the
way.</div>
<a name="09062410000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
difference between us is timing. I will be brief, as we can deal with
timing in the clause stand part debate. Our new clause is supported by
all the women&#146;s organisations and the unions. I take my lead
from them. They have been fighting the issues for years and years. The
Minister is supported by the CBI. I say no more than
that.</div><a name="09062410000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the metrics, I am concerned that we are leaving something up
in the air for the welcome discussion this summer. Maybe we can have a
discussion about metrics later, but my fear is that everyone will be
pleased to sign up to something that does not exist in the hope that
the force behind it will never come. There are also issues related to
the measurability of the metric. As I understand it, one of the
arguments against it involves the volume of information that would be
published were the pay audits mandatory. It would be easier for the
overseeing body, which may be the EHCR, to measure a single metric
around which one could look between company and between employer and
not have to go through all the information. My fear is that, like
targets, it will become the single focus around which people will put
in
effort.</div><a name="09062410000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000505"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We are not looking for a single figure.
It will need to be more complex than that. Surely the hon. Lady can see
that by phrasing clause 73 as we have we have left open a wide margin
for the parties. It is not only the CBI that is prepared to engage in
the task. Obviously, the TUC is with us as well on this endeavour. We
want to leave as wide a margin as possible, so that the parties can
agree the best metrics. Then, of course, the advantage we have over her
proposal is that they will all agree to it and get on with it, and we
do not have to start litigating, litigating, litigating. I say that
immensely to my own disadvantage since I am a
lawyer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000506"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I understand where the Minister is coming
from, and there is progress with encouragement from the Government.
However, when parties are left to their own devices and there are
voluntary arrangements, the pay gap takes so long to narrow that I am
compelled to think that we have to move to something
stronger.</div><a name="09062410000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000507"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> My hon. Friend makes the important point that hon.
Members from other parties would also feel frustrated&#151;as I think
the Minister would&#151;about the time taken. The Minister&#146;s
point that lawyers would be hovering around the arrangements proposed
by new clause 23 is the incentive that business and employers need to
engage in a meaningful attempt finally to take action to reduce that
part of the pay gap which is due to direct discrimination. It is
important to recognise that this is not a lone attempt to come up with
a new approach. It is something that we have been encouraged to table
by organisations that are in direct contact with women and specialists
in this area. That is why I encourage my hon. Friend in the approach
that she is

Featherstone:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that and
obviously I totally agree. It is that frustration that drives me to say
that I am not completely happy with the response. I do not feel that it
will make the necessary difference. At an appropriate moment, I would
seek the Committee&#146;s view on new clause 23. However, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062410000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000509"></a>John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000510"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this we may discuss the following:
amendment 13, in
clause 73, page 55, line 20, leave
out paragraph
(b).</div><a name="09062410000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000511"></a>John
Penrose:</b> In contrast to the rather grand issues of
principle that we have been discussing up until now and will probably
come back to in the clause stand part debate, these are fairly
technical amendments and I hope we will not need to trouble the
Committee with them for too
long.</div><a name="09062410000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
14 seeks to exclude armed forces, security services and so on from the
operation of the clause. I notice that the Minister has tabled
something similar in amendment 67, although not identical, and I am
sure she will explain why her amendment is superior. It sounds as
though we are on the same track and we await her comments on the
comparative merits of the two
amendments.</div><a name="09062410000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
13 is a probing one, seeking to assess the Minister&#146;s intentions
to apply the standards of the clause to the public sector. At the
moment, it is excluded. I presume that she intends to apply the same
standards through the public sector equality duty, but we want her
comments on the record. Will she point us to the part of the Bill that
contains that or comment on how she intends to apply them, via the
public sector equality duty, elsewhere in the Bill? That would be
tremendously helpful.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000512"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The combined effects of amendments 13
and 14 would be to apply clause 73 to all employers, including the
public sector&#151;250 or more employers&#151;other than the armed
forces and security and intelligence services. However, there are good
reasons why clause 73 does not apply to the public sector. The gender
pay gap is wider in the private sector, where 80 per cent.
of employees work. We have less detailed information on the private
sector than on the public sector. The public sector will be provided
for under clause 147, which contains a lower threshold than
clause 73. Our detailed proposals are in the consultation
documents, the closing date for which is September
2009.</div><a name="09062410000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
73(2)(b) would ensure that the clause does not apply to public
authorities that are not subject to the public sector equality duty,
but that schedule does not include the Security Service, the Secret
Intelligence Service, the Government Communications Headquarters or any
part of the armed forces assisting GCHQ. As drafted, subsection (2)(b)
would bring those agencies, and that part of the armed forces, within
the scope of clause 73, but that has never been our policy intention.
Amendment 67 will correct that drafting oversight by making the
position clear. On that basis, I think that the hon. Gentleman can
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09062410000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000513"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am a bit confused about the purpose of the
Government amendment. It would help if the Minister could clarify again
the overall purpose. That would get to the heart of this group of
amendments.</div><a name="09062410000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000514"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I confess that I, too, got a bit
confused in the middle of that response. I shall reiterate my point. We
do not intend clause 73 to apply to public sector employees, for the
reasons set out, and that would be the combined effect of amendments 13
and 14, even though that is not the issue&#151;I do not
think&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>they were intended to probe. Subsection (2)(b) would ensure that clause
73 does not apply to the public authorities in schedule 19 which are
subject to the public sector equality duty. The schedule does not
include the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ or
the armed forces helping GCHQ, which means that subsection (2)(b), as
drafted, would bring those agencies and that part of the armed forces
within the scope of the clause, but that is not our policy intention. I
am sorry that I was not clear enough before. Amendment 67 will remove
them from the scope of the clause.</div>
<a name="09062410000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000515"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister has made herself very clear. However,
we are concerned that clause 73(2)(b) exists at all. There is no harm
in having both the public sector equality duty and the tougher clause
73 requirements&#151;we do not think that those go far enough, as we
know from the debate on the previous group of amendments. Is she
certain that there are not public sector organisations where the gender
pay gap is just as wide and that an even tougher action than the public
sector equality duty, which is an important, but slow boat, would not
be best applied in those areas? It seems unfortunate to disapply the
public sector, given that, if it met it, everything would be fine
anyway.</div><a name="09062410000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062410000516"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hope that for the benefit of the
amendments the position is now reasonably clear.</div>
<a name="09062410000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
being soft on the public sector&#151;quite the reverse. Through
clause 147, to which we shall come presently, we will require public
authorities&#151;</div>
