Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Keith Vaz): I am pleased to guide this short Bill through the Committee Stage. It clarifies the law relating to the delegation to individual trustees of their trust responsibilities, and improves the protection of the beneficiaries. The Bill is a direct result of a report on and examination of this area by the Law Commission. I am delighted to serve under your Chairmanship, Mr. Malins, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) on his appointment to the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his welcome, and I should also like to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. The Bill went through the new accelerated procedure, which led to a Second Reading Committee. That will now be commonplace for Bills that arise from the excellent work of the Law Commission.
<P>
When I looked at the original Law Commission report, from which the Bill is derived, I realised that one of the Law Commissioners, Professor Jack Beatson, used to give law lectures when I was a student at Oxford. I now deeply regret that I was not as diligent in my attendance as I should have been, as I might now understand a great deal more about the law of trusts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) says, that is why I only got to this position.
<P>
Judging from Hansard, there was something of a competition among members of the Second Reading Committee as to who knew the least about trusts. There was no competition as to who knew the most&#151;the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) clearly did. I was impressed not only by his exposition of his knowledge of the law of trusts but his quoting of Belloc. I shall not try your patience by quoting poetry this morning, Mr. Malins.
<P>
This is a valuable piece of legislation, which has been subjected to scrutiny in another place. There was quite a lot of discussion about small ways in which it could be improved, and the Government tabled some welcome amendments to acknowledge the helpful suggestions of Lord Brightman.
<P>
The Bill will provide a helpful simplification of the law of trusts, and will correct one or two anomalies in decided cases. The Bill is uncontroversial, and the official Opposition welcome it. I thank the Law Commission for all its work on the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> I welcome you back to another episode of the riveting saga of this Bill, Mr. Malins. We all welcome the Bill, but I should also like to welcome the Minister and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I congratulate them on their appointments, and am delighted to see them on their respective Front Benches.
<P>
I congratulate the Law Commission on its work. We hope that the Bill has a speedy passage through the Committee and House.
