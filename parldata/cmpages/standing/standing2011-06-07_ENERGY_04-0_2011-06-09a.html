                  </span> May I say what a
pleasure and privilege it is to serve under your incredibly disciplined
and focused stewardship, Mr Leigh? As I was saying before we adjourned,
the danger of the amendment is that, rather than the intended purpose
of people being able to think outside the box and beyond the green
deal, we could end up with a situation that deters people from going
forward with any improvements that they may decide to make because we
try to overcomplicate and belt-and-brace the legislation. The law of
unintended consequences then kicks in. We already know, from the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, that it is already a big challenge for
14 million homes to be looked at by 2020. We also know that,
since 2004, fuel poverty has been going the wrong way. I am a novice at
this, but I would counsel the Minister to be
careful.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000029">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful my hon. Friend and am in accord
with his train of thought—he is right. It might be useful to
refresh our memories. I think that I was in the course of closing the
debate on the amendment. To briefly summarise, the amendment raised the
distinction between the green deal plans and the energy plans, and the
importance of assessors providing a comprehensive assessment. As I
said, the language is parliamentary counsel’s drafting, and is
designed to reflect the innovative aspect of the green deal mechanism,
which is repayment through energy bills, fixed to the meter. I hope
that I have made clear that our intention is, and always has been, for
the assessment to be robust, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 118<a class="bkMark" name="Column118">&#160;</a>
                  </div>impartial and comprehensive. The hon. Member for Wansbeck had
considerable concerns about cold calling in his constituency, which I
share. I confirm to the Committee that we will not permit cold calling
by assessors. That will be enshrined in the code of practice that
regulates
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000030">&#160;</a>

                  </span> The Minister used the
word “comprehensive”. It seems to me that that is exactly
what the amendment seeks. I would support the amendment because it
talks about a comprehensive energy plan and the different measures that
a householder could take irrespective of whether they meet the much
narrower criteria of the green deal finance. We are wasting a valuable
opportunity of assessors going through the doors of a property if they
do not do a comprehensive assessment of all the measures that could be
taken, and then a subset of those being eligible for green deal
finance.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000031">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will have to disagree with the hon. Lady. It is
important that we protect and preserve the integrity of the green deal
offer. We should remember that the green deal accreditation, for
various technologies, interventions and measures that are applicable,
will be a permissive list. As prices come down, I hope that more and
more innovative technologies will be added to it—it is by no
means a static list. The green deal list of measures will, in itself,
be comprehensive, and it will be up to the assessor to pick from that
list which measures are most appropriate to that home. The idea that
there are other sensible measures that could not be included in the
green deal is, I think, slightly spurious. If they are good measures,
they should be applicable for green deal
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000032">&#160;</a>

                  </span> This is a vital point that
we do not want to move off from for the moment. We are talking not
about a spurious list, but about a cross-governmental, cross-Whitehall
list of recognised and certified technologies relating to things such
as water efficiency. If the Bill were amended, such technologies could
be pulled off the shelf and put into secondary legislation, and the
Minister would be able to amend the list over time. I hope he
understands that we are talking about extending not the green deal, but
the range of additional technologies relating to things such as water
efficiency. For years, Whitehall—I understand its
situation—has struggled to find an opportunity to do that, but
the Minister now has that opportunity right in front of
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000033">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The coalition is very interested in finding new
ways to drive forward water efficiency measures, but we are simply not
in a position to add them to the green deal. It would be to
misunderstand the green deal if we tried to place such things firmly
within its structure. Work is going on in the Government to find a blue
deal—that is how it is becoming known—that would work.
However, energy efficiency in respect of water is in a totally
different place from energy efficiency in respect of electricity or
heating, because only 30% of the country is currently metered;
everybody else just pays a standard charge, and it would be difficult
at this stage to extrapolate any economic benefit for the household
from making savings. When the country is largely covered 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 119<a class="bkMark" name="Column119">&#160;</a>
                  </div>by meters, we will be in a different space. We could come back to the
issue in a few years, but we are not in a position to incorporate water
saving measures into the economic structure that is the current green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly, I
am worried that the amendment could be used to include measures that
people deem are energy saving, but which do not pass the accreditation
and testing regime that we will have for green deal  measures.
It could encourage unscrupulous salesmen—they need not be
unscrupulous; they could just be over-enthusiastic—to sell the
person having the green deal assessment measures that will not pay for
themselves, which will push up the household’s energy bills,
which will involve up-front costs or which will lock people into
expensive consumer purchase agreements that attract a higher rate of
interest than is available through the green deal. If a measure is
sensible, offers a payback within 20 years and incorporates a reliable
technology, it will sit in the green deal and have robust guarantees
and warranties and a higher level of consumer protection. Trying to
blur the edges between what is in the green deal and what sits outside
it, will undermine confidence in what is offered by
assessors.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is within
the remit of a green deal assessor to advise on the potential for
renewable energy, for example; that will be part of the assessment,
and, as part of the green deal assessment, they will—we have
future-proofed the Bill to allow for this—advise on the
potential for feed-in tariffs or renewable heat incentive-supported
technologies. There is therefore that more holistic approach. If
members of the Committee think that they will, in the same breath, be
able to push technologies that do not involve the same element of
consumer protection or rigorous testing, that could be dangerous, and I
do not think that that is really what is intended by the amendment.
That is why we are cautious and why we do not propose to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000036">&#160;</a>

talking about the physical, structural and technological
recommendations that an assessor could make, but does the Minister

result of going through the process?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000037">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Absolutely. I am sure that the training of an
assessor will include recommendations for not only how the individual
customer should use the specific equipment, but how they should expect
to live in their home. They will explain to them carefully that, as
part of the golden rule, they need to use heating in particular, as
well as lighting, responsibly and in a certain way in order to capture
the savings implicit in the measures being installed. Behaviour will be
key to ensure that they capture those
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000038">&#160;</a>

                  </span> At the start of the
debate, the Minister drew an analogy with an MOT test. He suggested
that people are told that their clutch needs replacing, but the clutch
is not part of the MOT test. A good, qualified mechanic would say to
someone whose car was being serviced in their garage, “Look, you
need to be aware that your clutch may need to be replaced.
Here’s your MOT certificate, but you also 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 120<a class="bkMark" name="Column120">&#160;</a>
                  </div>need to think about that.” That is exactly what we are saying.
Within the parameters of the green deal, an expert might say,
“While I am here, as an expert—perhaps the only one you
ever ask to come into your house—you might want to think about
doing these other things.” We understand that some people
mis-sell and put on the hard sell, but somebody who has the technical
ability and the brand as a real expert could give that advice. That is
all we are saying should be put into the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000039">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Of course, they will not be prohibited from doing
that. They will have a commercial incentive to sell as much as they can
to that individual, but we must make absolutely clear to consumers what
is included in the green deal and what is not. If we blur that on the
assessment and it is not really clear, people will end up paying for
things that do not offer a proper return on their outlay. They will end
up with more expensive things and people will be encouraged to add on.
I do not know how we could have such a comprehensive
assessment—a juggernaut of an assessment, covering every product
and topic under the sun—without boundaries. The boundaries for
the green-deal-approved interventions will be clear and robustly
tested. The amendment could end up as a giant mis-selling proposition,
rather like the Australian experience, which we are all keen to
avoid.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000040">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Do not misunderstand me—there will be
opportunities to sell additional services and to offer other products,
but we do not want the consumer to be under any illusion in relation to
additional services. If Marks and Spencer, or any other retailer, went
into someone’s home to offer them a green deal, I am sure that
it would also take the opportunity to market wallpaper, carpets and, if
the walls are being lined, curtains and perhaps a sofa. This is a huge
opportunity for home improvement, which will not be lost on responsible
retailers. They will offer not just additional energy measures, but a
whole package of other home improvement measures in a commercial
atmosphere. What we must be clear about is what sits in the green
deal—what offers the promise of no up-front cost and golden rule
savings, and what sits outside. A wider assessment that is blurry could
get us into dangerous
territory.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000042">&#160;</a>

                  </span> To return to the MOT analogy, some
things get one through the legal necessities, while others might be
attached to energy saving. For example, somebody using a condensing
dryer might appreciate the advice to get something that, instead of
being D-efficiency rated, is A-efficiency rated. Marks and Spencer
might want to sell them a more efficient condensing dryer. Surely the
most important thing is for the consumer to be completely aware of what
the legal necessities are and what the add-on bits are. In the same way
as I suggested earlier, a 14-day cooling-off period might make that
clear. People might be given two documents—letters or
offers—that clarify what is green-deal necessity stuff and what
are the other ways in which they might improve their energy
consumption.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000043">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is exactly what would happen as the Bill is
arranged. There will be a clear delineation for the
green deal and further suggestions that could relate to energy savings.
However, if they related to good energy-saving propositions, they would
by definition be included in the green deal. The only reason why
something could not be in the green deal would be because either it did
not meet consumer standards or warranties, or it did not offer money
savings over a 20-year period. We are not giving a very narrow
definition of what can or cannot be green-deal approved. We want it to
be a real stimulus for innovation. We would receive a clear paper from
our assessor, which would list what was recommended for the green deal.
That would attract a cooling-off period, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Wells suggested but, in addition, a range of other extras could be
offered at the same time, which would be regarded as useful
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000044">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That will be
covered by a code of conduct or practice, but I am reluctant to see
such a process formalised as part of an assessment, as that could mean
that some people think that other things that are part of their
assessment are part of the green deal. Unless there is clear
delineation between what is part of a useful and helpful retail offer
and what is part of the green deal, I can see matters ending in
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000045">&#160;</a>

carefully to the Minister. Before lunch, he compared the green deal
assessment with an MOT, which was interesting. I was looking at the
internet at lunch time and read about some worries that consumers have
about MOTs. There were some startling figures from Which? that millions
of drivers were ripped off by dodgy garages. Likewise, the result of
another inquiry was that 14 million victims believe that they have been
ripped off by dodgy mechanics. To draw a comparison with an MOT ignites
worry, given that that is a relatively small cost compared with a
charge of up to £10,000 on a home. The hon. Gentleman referred
earlier to an assessor as a salesman, which is a concern. The amendment
is as much about the cheapest solutions as it is about expensive
solutions. I drew attention earlier to thermostats. I do not expect to
take a green deal package out on a thermostat that might cost me
£70.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000047">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to delay the Committee for too long, but there are some
important points that need to be clarified before we head on to later
stages of the Bill. It is appropriate to do so in the debate on clause
4 rather 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 124<a class="bkMark" name="Column124">&#160;</a>
                  </div>than that on clause 5. We have been through a great discussion on the
finance and the cost of the entire package. I want to thank outside
organisations for helping me with some of the comments that we have not
yet covered. We have talked about how the entire cost of the financial
package should be within what the customer sees. There should not be
any hidden costs or subsequent additional costs loaded on to them,
including administration charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am seeking
the Minister’s clarification, or at least his thoughts, on
whether there will be a clear differentiation in the Bill—this
comes back to the points made on the amendment earlier—between
the interest charges and the substantive part of the green deal, so
that the consumer knows precisely what they are paying. I know that
there are issues regarding people’s ability to understand
complex bills. I am sure that the Minister is working through that with
his team. It is vital for transparency that the customer knows
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
go beyond that—we did not deal with this earlier—if all
the costs at the point of declaration, with nothing hidden or bolted on
later, are rightly included in the package, what does that do to the
viability of the green deal? I wish to test the Minister’s
assumptions on whether the green deal works, if all the cost elements
are included within it. We want it to work, but what are his
calculations?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have asked
whether the Minister can confirm that estimates and charges under the
green deal will include the interest element. Research by the Great
British Refurb campaign suggested that some 11% of those surveyed would
consider taking out a green deal package if the interest rate was 4% or
below—not if the interest rate was 5%, 6%, 7% or 8%. What are
his calculations telling him?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
examples all have slightly different modelling, which is why we need to
know where the Minister is on this. Analysis by E3G suggested that a
25-year green deal package of £11,000, which would achieve 50%
energy savings, is only able to meet the golden rule over the lifespan
of that investment if the interest rate is 2% or less. If the interest
rate is higher, it will not meet the golden rule. Friends of the Earth
has suggested that a package with total measures of £8,223 only
just meets the golden rule at a 4% interest rate over a 30-year period.
Are those calculations completely wrong? Can the Minister reassure us
about what modelling he has done?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have not
yet seen detailed modelling in Committee, even if we take into account
what the Minister said during an earlier sitting about variable
interest rates. If variable interest rates are included as a
possibility, it is difficult to see how the integrity of the golden
rule can be maintained over a sustained period unless additional head
room is built in to ensure that it works with variable rates. However,
I might be missing something. How is it possible to communicate the
total cost and likely instalments on variable rates at the outset of a
green deal that might last 15, 20 or 25 years or more? How will
homeowners know what they are taking up and what the lifetime interest
payments will be if they are not clear where the interest rate is
set?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All those
questions are still outstanding. How does the Minister think it
possible to ensure that the total cost is presented at the outset to
establish the golden rule, along with the instalments for each year, if
the interest rate is not known? We have only just started to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 125<a class="bkMark" name="Column125">&#160;</a>
                  </div>scratch the surface of the clause. The issue was not debated in so much
detail in the other place. They had a good debate,
but not in such detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We must know
the Minister’s thinking. Has he done any modelling? Can he share
it with the Committee so that we know before we come on to later stages
of the Bill? If we assume, based on what I said, that a successful
green deal will depend on relatively low interest rates to make it
work, if 2% or 3% rates are not necessarily provided by open
competition, some other support will be needed, possibly from the green
investment bank. The Deputy Prime Minister hinted as much when he said
on 23
May:<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
are also looking at the potential for using the Bank to help deliver
the first stages of the Green
Deal.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000420">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Is
that true? It might be a way forward. If so, wonderful; let us hear it.
At the moment, as I understand it, the green investment bank will be a
reasonably well-funded but independent bank, run by independent
financiers rather than civil servants, that will invest in proven
technologies in energy generation—it will be an investment bank,
not a grant-giving mechanism. At the same time, it will help new
technologies that are not proven get off the ground. If it will also
support the green deal, that is a heck of a task. Will the green
investment bank underwrite interest rates on the green deal? That
would, in fact, make it work.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It would be
similar to the German approach. The KfW bank has been making energy
efficiency loans at less than 3% to German householders for full house
refits. Is there clarification on that? The green investment bank is
triple A-rated and can guarantee low-interest loans. Neither utility
companies nor any other private company can do that. If we get it
right, the Minister’s aspirations for the green deal can be
delivered. If not, the golden rule and the possibility of including all
the cost elements within the package look
precarious.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000080">&#160;</a>

independence of the assessors and their advice and assessments. What
safeguards will be in place to prevent mis-selling and improve trust so

the word “independent” does not appear in the Bill. There

not
transpire.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
will have knock-on consequences; it is not just about words in a Bill.
<em>Which?</em> research recently found that only 23% of customers trust
their energy supplier to sell them the right tariff and that 77% do
not, which is extremely concerning. Four of the big six energy
suppliers are under investigation by Ofgem to determine whether they
are complying with the new obligations to prevent mis-selling, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are other real concerns, and my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree touched on the issue of what is and is not sold. One subject
that has not come up in the debate is reverse cross-selling of what is
not in the green deal. If salesmen have the opportunity to gain entry
to a property, they can advise that they are also green deal assessors
or part of a green deal provider package. If, for example, they sell
smart meter installations, that gives them access to a property, and
leads to their making contact with a customer and providing the green
deal. It is therefore important to look at what is not in the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has said that, through statutory instruments, the list will be
revised to include all devices providing energy improvements. We
should, however, look at technologies outside the green deal that may
be used in reverse to gain access to properties, which is a key point.
That might happen with the energy company obligation. We will encourage
people to enter properties under the green deal and under ECO targets,
although the Minister has said that with the green deal the two might
go together. If ECO providers are the first in, as statutory providers
through the energy companies, that gives them a preferential position
as green deal providers, because they are already providing the ECO. We
need to be mindful of reverse cross-selling, and I have real concerns
about the link between assessors and
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the last few minutes, the Minister announced that there will be
protections against cold calling: he said that it will not be allowed.
However, there is the further problem of tied assessors. I am concerned
that, when there are tied assessors and providers, commissions will be
involved, which might lead to the mis-selling of green deal products.
It is well known that a huge amount of doorstep salesmen’s pay
is in commissions—<em>Which?</em> estimated that 40% to 50%
commissions—which is a cause for
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000090">&#160;</a>

must be careful how property assessment is carried out. If people make
contact with customers to assess a property, we must have a clear
framework that protects customers and provides a basis for trust. We

               <p class="tabbed">I
shall touch on a couple of points that I could not make during our
debate on the previous amendment. The Minister said that the list would
be prescriptive and that there would be no flexibility. I am concerned
that the Government might lag behind in innovation and that green deal
providers will be selling old technology because the list will not be
up to date with new technology. I am sure that the Government will
respect that matter, but I am concerned about how fast we can react to
the innovation and technology which the green deal itself will create.
Ideas will flow even faster as the scheme increases supply and
demand—I hope that old technology will not be sold.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, will
the Minister comment on the fact that the clause makes no mention of
guarantees on products? If windows are installed that last only 10
years, how will they be part of a green deal assessment that may be for
25 years? Some products will have a limited lifespan. Will that matter
be reflected in further
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000095">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Some interesting points have been made in this
short debate. The hon. Member for Ogmore referred to the analysis by
E3G and to its calculations of what may or may not be financed through
the golden rule. The trouble with that analysis is that it took no
account of the energy company obligation. We fully accept that some
home owners—particularly the fuel-poor and those who live in
hard-to-treat properties—will be unable to install all the
measures that would be required to bring their homes up to a good
standard simply through a commercially based, paid-through-savings
model, however robust and innovative such a model may be. That is
precisely the reason why we have the ECO, which will deliver, over a
decade at least, year on year, billions of pounds of support for
exactly those measures. The E3G model completely ignored that
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The golden
rule, which is the principle that the charge attached to the energy
bill should not exceed the expected savings at the time of the
assessment, will take account of the total cost of the green deal
package. Interests rates are an integral part of that calculation,
which is why we will insist on taking a conservative view on likely
interest rate costs and on the paybacks of any particular intervention
or technology. In addition, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test,
said so eloquently, a sensible view must be taken on any given
tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The tariff
will include the expected costs of finance, including interest rates,
as well as labour and products. At the outset of a green deal package,
it would need to be made clear, not so much to the consumer but to the
lender, that even if there was a flexible interest rate—we will
have to thrash out in secondary legislation whether 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 128<a class="bkMark" name="Column128">&#160;</a>
                  </div>such a rate can be incorporated—there would be a finite amount
that the variable interest rate could capture from the finance plan,
because it would be possible to calculate the available returns at the
beginning. However, there is more work to be done and we need to talk
in more detail with, and properly consult, the finance industry about
the exact mechanism for ensuring that we capture as much of the market,
and offer as much consumer choice, as we can, so that consumers get the
best
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000098">&#160;</a>

the interest rates likely to be offered, the honest answer is that no

be across a spread of the products. There are divergent views in the
industry. Some reports have mentioned an 8% interest rate, but I have
spoken to other major financiers who have predicated a much lower rate.
Given the regulated nature of the payment stream and the much lower
default risk, there is ample reason to believe that when the scheme
comes into existence, and particularly when it builds up to scale and
is able to access the capital markets when the debt is securitised,
there will be access to rates that are far closer to mortgage rates
than to conventional, personal loan interest rates. That is certainly
our expectation, but I cannot say, hand on heart, exactly where that
will
lie.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is why the Deputy Prime Minister rightly said in a speech to Climate
Change Capital some days ago that we would stand by to see,
particularly in the teething stages of the Bill, if there was a role
for the green investment bank. However, I do not think that he or
anyone else in Government anticipates that we would use the green
investment bank in the same way as KfW uses, on a large scale,
subsidised loans direct to the consumer. What we might envisage is some
assistance in securitising a number of the initial players together and
introducing some liquidity into that market to try to put a bit of
va-va-voom into access to the lower interest rates that we have in the
capital
markets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000100">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
important thing to get across to the Committee is that the interest
rate is just one variable factor in the total cost of the green deal
package. It is easy to focus too much on the interest rate; that is the
sort of thing that some unscrupulous salesmen do. They offer a 0%
finance deal on something they charge a high price for, compared with a
reasonable interest rate but a much better deal on the commodity price.
The important thing for the customer, ultimately, is the total value of
the package: the total repayment cost of the intervention—the
installation of the products—versus the savings made. The
interest rate is an important variable factor 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in that overall equation, but by no means the only one. If some groups
offer the package at a slightly higher cost but with a much better
value product or lower labour costs, the different sides of the
equation can cancel each other
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
beauty of the green deal is that it allows genuine competition and
allows the market to come to bear. It is not like the old
one-size-fits-all Government programmes. We will see innovation, with
firms large and small competing to serve consumers in new ways. There
is more work to be thrashed out, and ahead of that secondary
legislation I hope that all members of the Committee will take the
opportunity to contribute to the thinking on it as part of the
consultation over the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hyndburn made a number of points. He particularly
focused on the provider-assessor split. I must tell him that when I
first conceived of this policy, my initial thoughts were that there
would be a complete separation between the person coming in to do the
assessment and the provider/salesman who came afterwards, for exactly
the reasons that he suggested. However, when we looked in more detail
and spoke to market participants, it became apparent that if we wanted
to see as many new entrants into the market as possible—to drive
customer choice, to drive down the cost of these products and services
to consumers and to have real competition—we had to make it
attractive for them. We have not yet pinned down the cost of a green
deal assessment, but there will be a cost to having it done. Given that
cost, the ability to get back some of that cost will be
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is why
we concluded that it would be acceptable for an assessor to act on
behalf of an accredited green deal supplier, provided there were robust
consumer protections such as a cooling-off period, as mentioned by my
hon. Friend the Member for Wells; such as a clear declaration of who
they are acting for; and such as total transparency, in terms of the
commission paid and the ability of the consumer easily to take that
assessment, which must be done to a uniform standard, to two, three or
perhaps even more providers and easily obtain a compatible,
complementary quote, which we would expect and encourage all consumers
to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000106">&#160;</a>

Those consumer protections will include declarations on commissions and

Committee. In respect of guarantees, as I said this morning, we plan to
require green deal providers to provide a single guarantee to their
customers. <em>Hansard</em> contains the full statement on that. That
requirement for a single guarantee will make it so much easier for
consumers, particularly when there is a range of different products on
offer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000108">&#160;</a>

32 aims to provide a mechanism that encourages both individuals and

incentives. They have been referred to a number of times by the
Government. The Chancellor, in his Budget speech,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000117">&#160;</a>

debate that we have just had on the previous amendment about the
interest rate. We know that when the interest rate in Germany was at
2.65%—it is subsidised by the German

			Column number: 131<a class="bkMark" name="Column131">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Government—the take-up in Germany was only 100,000 homes a year.
That is still 100,000 homes, but it is nowhere near the
Government’s ambition for the green deal. No detail of the
incentives or levers to drive demand has been announced. We would like
to flush out the Government’s plans for incentives, if any, and
highlight our party’s continuing commitment to both individual
and community incentives.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Back in
November, there was an article in <em>The Times</em> that suggested that
householders are being encouraged to take up the green deal through
incentives paid for by energy suppliers, as part of the new energy
company obligation. The article speculated that for green deal
customers, that could include the chance to win a holiday, a discount
on council tax, and a cash voucher or a rebate on energy bills. <em>The
Times</em> also stated that the Secretary of State may consider making
changes to the stamp duty system if those incentives do not encourage
enough people to take out a green deal. He said that if those
incentives proved insufficient to attract many home owners, the
Government would consider introducing a tilt in stamp duty. Stamp duty
could be reduced by 1%, or approximately £2,000 for the average
home, for those who insulated to a high standard within a set period
after purchasing a home.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many other
organisations have highlighted the need for incentives. In January, the
Chartered Institute of Environmental Health expressed concern about the
decision to phase out Warm Front grants and replace them with the green
deal. It said that
it<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000121">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>that the green deal
would have a sufficiently wide-scale effect to reach the most needy in
society, rather than just those people with difficulties with heating
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The CBI also
expressed concern that the policy could become a lame duck if people
are not encouraged to take it up. I know from my conversations with the
CBI yesterday, and from its sixth climate change policy tracker, which
was released yesterday, that UK investor confidence in the green sector
remains low, and that ensuring effective incentives to stimulate the
scale of green deal demand that the Government expect is absolutely
crucial. The Federation of Master Builders also set out its
disappointment at the lack of additional incentives announced in the
Budget to create more demand in the market. I could go on. There is a
very long list of organisations that have added their voice to the
concerns. It includes the UK Green Building Council, Consumer Focus,
Sustain, Friends of the Earth and the think-tank
E3G.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000123">&#160;</a>

organisations wrote to the Chancellor on 15 February to ask
him to announce what measures there would be in the March Budget to
incentivise people to take up the green deal. They included the WWF,

               <p class="tabbed">We
heard the announcement in the Budget that there would be incentives,
but yet again there was no further detail on what they might be. We
know what trade bodies and businesses think about the possibility of
incentives, but what do the public think? They like the

			Column number: 132<a class="bkMark" name="Column132">&#160;</a>
                  </div>idea of the Government’s new green deal but, according to
research carried out by the Great British Refurb campaign, they only
expect to take it up if the Government are willing to offer significant
financial incentives, such as a stamp duty rebates, council tax refunds
and low interest
rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
56% of the public liked the pay-as-you-save scheme, that number could
increase with financial incentives. A one-off council tax rebate is a
real motivator; 49% of people are likely to take up the green deal if
the Government offered a £500 council tax rebate. Changes to
stamp duty are also popular, with the public considering it to be a
fantastic incentive. British Gas has brought forward its own version of
the green deal, and has carried out research into how effective it has
been. It suggests that the scheme has had full appeal, but that
additional nudges will be needed to drive the market. It put
£30 million on to its balance sheet to test how the
green deal would work, and that is happening throughout the country. It
is pushing carrots such as council tax and stamp duty rebates and is
supporting sticks, including proposals to regulate minimal rental
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
April 2009, the Department of Energy and Climate Change conducted
research, together with the Energy Saving Trust and Quadrangle
Research. It was extremely powerful in showing which incentives work,
in terms of energy efficiency uptake through schemes such as the green
deal, and which do not. The report noted that one-off, up-front
incentives are generally preferred to incentives provided over a period
of time. By giving the incentive up-front, it is possible to give up to
30% less and receive the same uptake results. The research also found
that council tax rebates were one of the most powerful means of
incentivising energy efficiency. Both the council rebate of £250
over three years and a one-off, up-front council rebate of £500
have an uplift of
15%.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
can learn a little more from the experience of British Gas. Since 2004,
it has been working with more than 68 local councils to offer
householders returns of up to £125, administered via council tax
bills, after they have had subsidised cavity wall insulation installed
in their homes. According to the research carried out by the Department
of Energy and Climate Change, that council tax rebate has proven
extremely popular, and demand for it is increasing, and it could lead
to an increase in demand of 15%. In Braintree, Essex, 75% of
respondents said that the British Gas council tax rebate was at least
among the factors that led to their choosing to insulate at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Several
voices have been raised about incentives. The energy company E.ON said
that for the take-up of the green deal to be sufficient to meet its
objectives,<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“we
believe that there will need to be both market-led and government-led
nudges to encourage customers to take up the Green Deal. It will be for
individual companies to decide what position they wish to take in this
market place and so what additional incentives they might offer to
customers to support their own Green Deal proposition. However, we
believe that additional government-led incentives will also be required
to increase confidence in the Green
Deal.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000428">&#160;</a>

evidence submitted to the Committee from Age UK made some important
points about community initiatives under the green deal, which is why
we referred in the amendment not only to individual incentives, but
community-based incentives. It said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000130">&#160;</a>

are circumstances where it may be more appropriate for a group of
householders to work together—for example to develop a combined
heat and power or district heating scheme, or where a group of
hard-to-treat homes want to install ground source heat pumps (a task
much more efficiently done if a neighbourhood is working together). In
addition, people working as a community will tend to help each other,
and reinforce each other’s determination to make energy savings.
It will be important for the Green Deal to be able to deal with
collective initiatives—perhaps where people come together as a
co-operative or social enterprise—and that Green Deal finance or
funding drawn from the ECO can be accessed by these
schemes.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000429">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I have some
questions that I am keen for the Minister to address. How exactly does
he believe that households, tenants, landlords and owners of commercial
properties will be incentivised to take part in the green deal? Does he
think that a stamp duty incentive will be needed to mitigate any
potential effect on house prices, as E.ON has suggested?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am keen to
know what assessments the Minister has made of the merits of a council
tax incentive. Will a carrot or stick method be used, or a combination
of both? We heard during a previous sitting that there would be rewards
for taking up the green deal, as well as a penalty for not doing so. I
am keen to know what that might mean in practice. What will be the
rewards and penalties? Can he assure us that any incentive offered will
be carbon-neutral? I refer back to <em>The</em> 
                  <em>Times </em>article
suggesting that home owners might get a free flight for their home
improvements. I seek reassurance that that will not be allowed, as it
would be contrary to the ideals espoused in the green deal. Finally,
will the Minister commit to examining possible community-based
incentives, as well as individual tax incentives, that will boost
community
cohesion?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000133">&#160;</a>

importance of incentives. As I keep reminding the Committee, the green
deal will be a lot more than simply what is in the Bill. I have no
doubt that such an ambitious programme—the most ambitious
roll-out of home improvements since the second world war—will
require additional incentives. Later in Committee, we will introduce
measures on penalties as well as incentives to ensure widespread
take-up.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000134">&#160;</a>

be demand, and that it will be worth while for them to make the
large-scale, long-term investment that we want by entering this new and
exciting market. Incentives will play a role, both for the consumer and

that through amendment 32, hon. Members seek clarification on clause 5.
The clause sets out what must and must not be included in the terms of
the green deal plan—the contract between the customer and the
green deal provider. The powers are intended to ensure that the
customer is adequately protected and provided with sufficient
information to make a reasoned choice about whether to enter into the
contract. However, green deal providers may wish to incentivise
improvers to take up a green deal plan. Indeed, as it is a market-based

incentives, which could include community or individual approaches to
encourage customers to take out a green deal and improve their

year’s Budget confirmed the Government’s commitment to
act to incentivise and encourage take-up of the green deal. The
Department of Energy and Climate Change will work with the Treasury and
other Departments to consider possible options. It is worth remembering
that in this year’s Budget speech, the Chancellor
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000137">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“I

Chancellor’s Budget, not in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000138">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that the Budget before next October will by no means be the last word
on the matter. As the market develops, and with the benefit of
experience of take-up, rather than simply through forecasts, we can
identify parts of the market that are not responding so well. We can
try to assist those parts of the community—those families and
tenants—that are struggling or are resistant to taking up the
green deal. We will need to design the correct instruments to reach out
to them with the benefit of real, hard evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, mentioned some such instruments, and I
entirely share her analysis. From experience of a number of trial
projects that British Gas has run, I am convinced that incentives
relating to council tax are very powerful, because people seem to have
a disproportionate hatred of paying it, compared with all other taxes;
it moves them in ways in which they would not otherwise move. We need
to harness that to positive ends.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, said, we should also consider other
incentives that galvanise community action and that are in tune with
our localism and big society agendas. From schemes sponsored by British
Gas, community schemes and the work that B&amp;Q has done, we know that
the biggest incentive always comes from collaborative community action.
Real partnership at a local level, more than any individual financial
incentive that I have seen, acts as a strong, powerful motivator to get
people involved. Often, people are not reluctant, or resistant to such
schemes; they simply lack the final motivation to commit and to get
round to having the work done. If their neighbours are doing it and if
it is going on in their street, village or community, that is often the
most powerful tool of all. We must do more work to think of innovative
ways to galvanise community action. The process is one of co-creation,
and we are genuinely open to new ideas about how it will work on a
cost-effective basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000141">&#160;</a>

out only when many householders or tenants come together to do it. I

contribution from the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, because I
suspect that through her amendment 106, she is trying to get at a
similar point to the one that we are making through amendment 34. I
hope that the Minister will be sympathetic. The aim of amendment 34 is
to promote greater consumer protection through increased transparency
in the assessment process, and to give consumers a much better
knowledge of the anticipated expenses of the entire green deal process
before they arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Green deal
assessment should fall within the golden rule standards, as the
Minister has already told us, but consumers will still need to be aware
of all the costs, when they will incur them, and the timetable for when
they will break even. In the green deal, that information is not
guaranteed to be disclosed up-front in a comprehensive and
comprehensible manner. In our previous discussions that touched on
this, we all agreed that there will be full disclosure of all the
costs, and that they will appear on the bills, so the amendments are
greatly in sympathy with what the Minister has been saying. The hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion, and I may, between us, have provided the
letter of the legislation that he needs to make his commitments
tangible.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me say why we moved amendment 34. Over the years, we have been bitten
when schemes have been passed by Parliament and we have not foreseen
the consequences. Take the car insurance industry. The hidden costs of
that industry have often been discussed. Some commentators estimate
that up to £200 million a year is made through car insurance
companies making unannounced changes to inclusions in the basic
coverage. I am sure there are Members here who, like me, have suffered
from that. Tucked away in the small print, it suddenly turns out that
there is an extra cost for things that were taken to be included in the
standard package. There is not a direct analogy between that and what
we are offering in the green deal, but that is what we are trying to
avoid.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is hard to
find a bank that has not been engrossed in scandal over exorbitant
overdraft fees and charging customers excessive rates for withdrawing
an amount in excess of their account balance. I hesitate even to
mention airline providers’ hidden charges, and the fuss that
there has been over that, or the airlines’ robust defence that
travellers should know better. We moved the amendment in the spirit of
what the Minister has already said. We want to make tangible and real
in the Bill an overview that says that all charges will be disclosed,
so that the customer—whether they are an individual householder
or a small business, for whom the issue is as important—will
know in advance exactly what they are signing up
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000154">&#160;</a>

like clarification on it. I am concerned about assessors being linked

the front of the assessment.

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point, which I
am sure the Minister has listened to and will address. I will make two
other arguments for the amendment. It would allow green deal providers,
in certain circumstances, to receive compensation from bill payers if
the green deal is paid back earlier than expected. Concerns were raised
in the other place that, without such a provision, green deal providers
might build extra charges into the scheme and pass them on to consumers
to cover that eventuality. In fact, Baroness Smith of Basildon has said
that although the Opposition may have concerns about the proposals, we
want to look more closely at the detail of how it would work. Will the
Minister confirm that the early payback charges will be made clear to
consumers early on? Will those set charges be identified in the green
deal contract? We are working on the assumption that the charges might
be different for each provider that offers competitive finance
deals.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
September 2009, Ofgem introduced new conditions to the licences of
energy suppliers in the UK to tackle what was seen as the unjustified
price differences between various tariffs. Those measures directly
addressed the widespread overcharging of certain groups of
customers—including the vulnerable ones whom we have talked
about—identified by Ofgem during its energy supply probe in
2008. In the light of Ofgem’s experience of the overcharging of
vulnerable customers, has the Minister analysed whether there are any
lessons to be learned for the green deal? As an example of points that
have already been raised, will prepayment customers be charged higher
interest rates than those with direct debits? That is a live issue for
tackling poverty generally and, in the wider context, we do not want to
exacerbate an existing
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will
green deal interest rates differ in the way I have suggested, as energy
prices do? What does the green deal mean for single-fuel customers, and
will that be clearly identified up front? Many in our communities who
are not only socially but financially excluded do not have bank
accounts; at most, they might have a Post Office card account or a very
basic account. They might be in hock to lending shops, more and more of
which are springing up, or to people who knock on their doors. Will
those without bank accounts be able to access the green deal? Issues
relating to the ability to access credit already affect not only those
without bank accounts, but those on prepayment
meters.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000158">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman, because my amendment
seeks to go in the same direction as his. It is about trying to enhance
the visibility and transparency of measures, and bills in particular,
so that people can see that all charges are properly
disclosed.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000160">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My amendment
goes in a slightly different direction, however, in that one of my
concerns is about green deal arrears, the visibility of those arrears
on consumers’ bills, and how consumers pay for them. In the
previous sitting, the Minister helpfully made clear that the intention
is to disaggregate the different components of the bill so that they
are visible, albeit that the final amount is one composite sum that the
consumer cannot pick from. I understand his argument, and I also
clearly understand that there is a balance to be struck when it comes
to ensuring that the green deal financing organisations have confidence
in the whole process.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, I
remain concerned that under the Bill, a householder who is in
legitimate dispute about elements of their green deal package and
wishes to withhold funding from that package would not be able to do
so. The only way that they could do so, essentially, would be by not
paying the bill, but they would then have their energy sources cut off.
There is a very real concern about that. It goes against basic
principles of consumer protection, in which disconnection is possible
as a result of non-payment of the energy costs, not the associated
costs. I worry that we are taking a step backwards with the Bill,
because we are looking at weaker protection for the consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000162">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, I recognise that a balance must be struck between that issue and
giving confidence to the finance providers. At the moment, however, the
balance is not sufficiently in favour of the consumer who has a
legitimate reason to want to withhold the green deal element of their
bill, perhaps because the measures were poorly installed or the
assessment was incorrect. At the moment, I see no measure for redress
for such consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister can tell us more of his thoughts on this amendment and the
one that we discussed before it, because there are two important
principles to consider. One is the overarching principle of
disclosure—of ensuring that the charges are very clear. The
second is the importance of having some understanding about those
consumers who are in arrears and who have legitimate reasons for
wishing to withhold at least part of the payment of their
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000164">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to hon. Members for raising these
important issues. The amendment seeks to ensure that any fees are
clearly and transparently communicated to the consumer. Let me reassure
members of the Committee that the Government are absolutely committed
to ensuring that the green deal customer is given every necessary piece
of information on the green deal charge made by their energy company,
including any information about outstanding arrears.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 19
already enables energy supplier licences to be modified so as to
require suppliers to provide bill payers with information about their
green deal plans. We expect that the green deal charge will be
presented as a line item on routine electricity bills, as the hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion, said so succinctly. We anticipate that
green deal arrears will be presented by the electricity supplier in the
same manner as electricity supply arrears.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consumers
will also be provided, under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, with an
annual statement of credit, detailing all payments made in the
preceding year and any arrears. That Act applies to domestic green deal

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 139<a class="bkMark" name="Column139">&#160;</a>
                  </div>plans in full, bar a few essential amendments. That ensures that there
will be robust consumer protection. The Act already
regulates the provision of information to consumers entering into
credit arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
clause 5 gives the Secretary of State the power, through regulation, to
put additional protections into the green deal regime as part of the
terms of a green deal plan, if necessary. Through that power, we will
seek to ensure that all fees are clearly and transparently communicated
to the bill payer and, if appropriate, the landlord.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Through the
terms of the green deal plan, clause 5 also ensures that key
protections are in place around financing, advice, measures and
installation, so the concern that amendment 34 seeks to address is
already being addressed. Clause 5 sets out that the improver must agree
to the amount and timing of the payments that are to be made, and it
ensures that they obtain all the necessary consents required to make
green deal improvements. It is important to retain flexibility and
consumer choice, which is why subsection (2) prevents the green deal
plan from placing restrictions on the ability of the bill payer to
change the intervals at which their energy bills are to be
paid.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000169">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Subsections
(2) and (3) ensure that no charge over a person’s property may
be taken by way of security and that early repayment cannot be required
of the bill payer, except in circumstances to be set out under
regulations. Moreover, a bill payer’s liability for maintaining
green deal repayments cannot be extended beyond the period for which
they are the bill payer at the property. That is absolutely fundamental
to the green deal payment mechanism and is part of the new element that
makes it so different from similar pay-as-you-save schemes. It really
gets to the crux of our new payment mechanism, and ensures that it is
not a conventional loan process or a credit-scored advance. That
ensures that the bill payer will not be liable to repay all the finance
that remains as a charge on the energy bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
regulations can require terms to be included that would protect bill
payers’ interests by providing guarantees in respect of the
improvements, as well as by specifying how problems with the
improvements are to be dealt with. The clause sets out important
protections for consumers and others entering into green deal plans, as
well as for green deal
participants.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
respect of protecting vulnerable consumers, the green deal is entirely
compatible with prepayments. We are extending the full Ofgem framework
over the collection of the green deal charge, so I can assure the hon.
Member for Ogmore that the bill will be treated as a whole. The
protections that apply to vulnerable customers or those with prepayment
meters who run into difficulties with their electricity bill will be
extended to the green deal. Arrears will be treated in exactly the same
way. The bill is completely indivisible in that respect. I trust that I
have reassured members of the Committee that we have really made it
clear that we need important protections for consumers, as well as for
others entering into green deal plans, so I hope that the amendment
will be
withdrawn.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000172">&#160;</a>

want to press the Minister a little further on arrears. Consumers in
financial difficulty might face the situation when they cannot afford
to pay back green deal arrears as well as their ongoing green deal
charges, fuel arrears and ongoing energy consumption bills. It is an
important element of consumer protection that customers cannot be cut
off from energy supplies for non-payment of non-energy related charges.
Although the hon. Gentleman has helpfully explained that the figure is
separated out when it comes to the bill, if consumers are in
difficulties in paying it back, it should be possible for them not to
be cut off for not paying back the green deal element. I do not think

That is a slightly different point, nevertheless it is equally

up with the official body their complaints about installations, which

               <p class="tabbed">I want to
come back to the issue of pre-payment metres, which keeps being
mentioned. It is a huge issue. The statistics about pre-payment meters
and the associated difficulties show that these will not only be hard
to treat homes—more than likely, they will be hard to
treat—but the customers in those homes will be hard to reach
too. I am concerned about how the mechanism will work and I do not
think that the Minister has provided as much detail about it as he
could. I am sure that he has thought it through and I would like him to
provide more detail about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of those
people with pre-payment meters, only 19% are owner-occupiers, 35% are
in the private rented sector and 46% are with registered social
landlords. I want to give the Committee some other statistics about
pre-payment meters, to put their use in context. At the moment, 51% of
people on pre-payment meters have an income of less than
£13,500. In addition, 62% of people with pre-payment meters are
on means-tested benefits, including disability benefits. So we are
talking about the most vulnerable people and if the green deal is to be
a success we must reach
them—<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000195">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The use of pre-payment meters is an important issue
that needs to be discussed, because so many people are affected by
pre-payment meters. I do not want to go back over the points that I
have just made. However, I want to refer to subsection (2)(a)(i), which
deals with<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the payments in
instalments and the interval at which, and period for which, they are
payable”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000431">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>On
pre-payment meters, arranging payments in instalments will be
exceedingly difficult. National Energy Action has highlighted its deep
concerns about how financially disadvantaged households might have to
limit their energy consumption artificially and prioritise green deal
payments before credit is applied to the meter. That is an important
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000202">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 143<a class="bkMark" name="Column143">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The problem is
that the green deal is set up for instalments, whereas pre-payment
meters operate on an “as and when” basis.
So we have two systems and the Bill does not seem
to accommodate the fact that people on pre-payment meters cannot meet
the instalments. Subsection (2)(d) says:<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“a term
providing that the green deal plan does not prevent the bill payer from
changing the intervals at which energy bills are to be
paid.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000432">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Clearly,
with pre-payment meters consumers will break that, because those
consumers pay as and when they use energy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is not
only NEA that has expressed concerns about pre-payment meters. Consumer
Focus, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and Ofgem
have also expressed their concerns about the build-up of green deal
arrears on pre-payment cards. Those repayments cannot be calculated if
they are in arrears in accordance with an ability to pay, because there
are technological limitations on pre-payment meters, of course. They
can only be paid by a lump sum when credit is added to the card. That
will be deducted from the amount of energy that they will be able to
apply to the
meter.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are real issues about disconnections and credit. I hope that the
Minister will try to resolve this issue. There is an answer, but one of
the issues I am not satisfied with is that the primary legislation to
disconnect will be amended to allow people with pre-payment meters to
be cut off, simply for not paying their green deal
portion.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000206">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will have in front of him a note relating to this clause, as
he has for other clauses. It will be in his ring binder, and it will be
headed “Resist”. My powers of clairvoyance would not be
overly strained to say that there will be a note below that, which will
say, “This particular amendment is superfluous, because in
clause 43(2) it states that a landlord should not unreasonably refuse a
request mentioned in subsection (3) and so block the implementation of
a green deal programme.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will now
lose the thin sliver of an audience that I had for my previous remarks
by referring to the architecture of the Bill. Clause 43(2), while
preventing the unreasonable refusal by a landlord of a tenant’s
request for the green deal programme, does so in the context of
tenants’ energy efficiency improvements regulations, which
relate to the relationship between a landlord and a tenant and what
rights the tenant has to ensure that the landlord does not unreasonably
refuse that request. The fact of the matter is that the role of
landlords extends considerably beyond the relationship between a
landlord and a tenant,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 144<a class="bkMark" name="Column144">&#160;</a>
                  </div>as is related in clause 43(2). Another subsection of  that
clause defines the purpose of the tenant-landlord relationship within
those regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A landlord
can have a landlord. A landlord can be the landlord of a leasehold
block of flats, for example, which in turn has a landlord responsible
for the ground rent and to whom the landlord of the block of flats will
pay a ground rent. That landlord can, conceivably, unreasonably refuse
a green deal programme on the basis that that person is the freeholder
of the land on which the block of flats stands. There may be reasons
why that landlord could so refuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To have the
clause within the overall framework regulations, which we all agree
should be in place, requiring that a landlord’s consent to green
deal improvements should not be unreasonably withheld, would cover the
tenants’ landlord regulations and catch the whole question of
who is the landlord, rather than the more limited question of who is
the landlord that relates to an immediate tenant’s request. It
would be advisable to include that provision in the overall framework
rather than in the more particular tenant-landlord framework. The
amendment would not weaken the sub-framework, because it would
over-ride them both.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
the amendment relates to the bill payer’s consent to green deal
improvements being unreasonably withheld, which is important from the
other point of view. For example, registered social landlords have a
substantial role in leasing blocks of flats to tenants. Such landlords
might propose to undertake a programme of green deal improvements, or a
general agreement to do so might be made between them and the tenants.
Although the green deal programmes would be individual to tenants, the
permission to make those improvements would not be, because they would,
to some extent, be collective improvements. For example, insulation
might be recommended for the whole block and all the tenants would
benefit from it, but they would all have to agree to allow it to go
ahead. If a single tenant unreasonably said, “No, I don’t
agree,” it is likely that the entire programme would fall to the
ground—the tenant would, effectively, have held it to
ransom.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
may seem a far-fetched view of the likelihood of people attempting to
impede improvements that would benefit them and everyone else in their
blocks. However, I have experience—as, I am sure, have other
hon. Members—of attempting to provide benefits for people living
in blocks. In my own constituency, I tried to install security measures
for the tenants of a particular block and I failed to do so because of
one
tenant.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000215">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I have had experience of enfranchisement, when
groups of tenants gang together and buy out their
landlord—privately, in general. If that happens in a large block
of flats or on an estate, contact might be lost with tenants, because
the homes may be held by a trust, for example, and it might become
incredibly difficult to get hold of them. We should also be aware of
that situation, and perhaps the Minister can find some way to capture
it so that individual tenants cannot block improvements purely by their
absence.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000216">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Lady makes an important point. Indeed,
in many circumstances, leaseholders of a particular block have
collectively bought out the original 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 145<a class="bkMark" name="Column145">&#160;</a>
                  </div>landlord. They are the landlord collectively, and they are the
leaseholders and tenants of the block in relation to their own landlord
holding. In such situations, a person may sub-let, move or die, and it
may be difficult to obtain permission as a result. The hon. Lady is
right that the matter might be serious for those people who wish to
undertake self-help and “green deal” their blocks of
flats, of which they are the joint-landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was
attempting to illustrate my point by describing how I tried to install
a security system for a block of flats, when one tenant effectively
sabotaged the complete process, and did so, in my view, pretty
unreasonably. They stood against the benefit of all their neighbours
and themselves, not for financial benefit—they simply decided
that they did not want the system. We all want the green deal to be as
successful as it should be, but it might fail to take place in the
substantial area of where registered social landlords—as they
solidly think they should—attempt to undertake a process of
getting green deal benefits for the tenants in their blocks of flats,
either by leading or by acting with partners. Hence, a provision not
for a railroad permission to undertake changes, but simply to prevent
tenants unreasonably withholding permission would be an important part
of the architecture of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
I hope the Minister will flip over the page saying,
“Resist”. If he is not able to take on board the entire
amendment, will he at least assure me that he will at least look at it?
It would substantially strengthen the Bill and increase the likelihood
that the green deal works, which would reflect well on how the Bill
turns
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000219">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendment is enormously important for all
properties in multi-occupancy, such as blocks of flats. I understand
that many registered social landlords are pushing strongly for the
amendment. It would give them a greater opportunity to deliver the
green deal on a block-by-block basis, which might be extended to an
estate-by-estate basis. That would also give a sense of momentum. If
individuals in surrounding properties see improvements being made, they
will be encouraged to take up the green deal, and they would benefit
from lower costs through the increased economies of scale for the
provider. That would be an important step towards ensuring that the
green deal meets its potential by being delivered through an area-based
approach. The wording of the amendment is very wide. It is not a
blanket approach; it refers to tenants having unreasonable
objections.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000220">&#160;</a>

during the second world war, we did not let people say, “I would
rather not put up a black-out curtain, because it spoils my view of the
stars.” That is a comparable parallel to make at a time of

               <p class="tabbed">May
I raise the case of a constituent who is a leaseholder in a block of
flats in Brighton? She successfully persuaded many other tenants to go
ahead with a range of energy efficiency measures, including double
glazing, but they ran into the problem that the lease does not allow
them to use the service charge for energy improvements unless
specifically and explicitly stated as such. Apparently, most leases
state that service charges are for the replacement and not the
improvement of infrastructure. It would therefore be possible to use
the service charge to replace single-glazed, metal window frames, but
not to install double
glazing.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
parallel with our work today, that issue should be addressed by making
an amendment to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, for example, which
would ensure that there is a wider remit for the service charge. If the
service charge could be extended to the provision of reasonable
insulation measures to improve the energy efficiency of a flat or block
of flats, that would be a useful step towards enabling energy
efficiency measures to be spread out across not only detached homes,
but the many blocks of flats and estates in our constituencies. I
support the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will take seriously
the suggestion, which I will follow up with a letter to him, about
changing the terms of that piece of legislation on
tenants.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000225">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is an important amendment that came up in the
Lords. I will return to that in a moment to remind the Minister of the
discussions that took place on an amendment that we tabled in the other
place, and what the Minister in the other place said in
reply.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
goes to the heart of many issues, particularly those of consent and
situations where improver and bill payer are different people. We have
heard many different scenarios from my hon. Friend the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test and the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. We know
that improvements such as cavity or solid-wall insulation would need to
be carried out on a whole block, not an individual residence. We want
to avoid the situation where a single household blocks access to warmer
homes and reduced bills for all the other households in a block. We
also want, in the same breath, to prevent measures from being forced on
households, as they will pay for them, albeit through energy
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000227">&#160;</a>

debate in Committee in the other place, Lord Marland said that he
believed that there was<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000228">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“adequate
provision within this clause for the framework regulations to set out
more detail on the issue of consent where the improver and bill payer
are different people. It is important that such detail is contained
within the framework regulations, as the detailed arrangements may be
subject to change as the Green Deal develops. These regulations will be
subject to the affirmative procedure. In addition, it is not our
intention to force the Green Deal on to any party. It must be allowed
to work on a voluntary basis, even where the improver and the bill
payer are different people. We are proposing powers under the private
rented sector chapter that

with that specific issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000229">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am keen to
know what role the Government see for social housing, an issue that
arose in the other place. In Committee, Lord Marland rejected our
proposals to add a section specifically on social rented housing. He
said that the intention of chapters 2 and 3 of the Bill, which I know
we will discuss later, is to provide powers to improve the energy
efficiency of private rented properties should it be required, but that
it is not the Government’s intention to intervene in the same
way in the social housing market. Will the Minister address that? Lord
Marland also said that the review would consider take-up in the social
sector as well as the private rented and non-domestic sectors. If the
Minister could address that in his response, I would be most
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000230">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This has been a useful debate. I assure the hon.
Members for Southampton, Test and for Brighton, Pavilion that I am
extremely sympathetic to the points that they made. The bottom line is
that it is a tricky area, because it affects both EU competence and the
Human Rights Act, so it is a minefield of human rights and consumer
protections. The issue also overlaps with areas that fall under the
competency of the Department for Communities and Local Government and
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. We are treading
carefully through it, mindful of the unintended or perverse
consequences that might result if we blatantly legislated for it on the
face of the Bill, but we are endeavouring to seek a way
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
assure hon. Members that the sentiment behind amendment 114, which
seeks to ensure that regulations could provide for circumstances in
which a landlord or bill payer withholds consent to the green deal
unreasonably, is a nut that we are determined to crack, and sensible
arguments were made in the amendment’s favour. I am pleased to
report that there is already provision in the chapter of the Bill on
the private rented sector, to which we have yet to come, that will
enable us to deal with situations in which a domestic landlord
unreasonably refuses a tenant’s request for consent to the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Regarding the
rights of bill payers to say no to the green deal, we need to tread
particularly carefully here, because it impacts on consumer rights.
There is a key principle that no one should be forced to accept a green
deal charge on their energy bill against their wishes, but again we
have to reconcile that with a case where an individual might
unreasonably hold up the improvement of a large
block.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000233">&#160;</a>

someone is dealing with a lease, we can use the terminology
“landlord” or “landlords”. That would cover
everyone, right the way from the freehold head landlord through to the
various layers of landlord. Has the Minister had the opportunity to
consult some of the larger estates in London, which are different from
what we might think of as estates? Grosvenor, Howard de Walden and the
Church Commissioners own vast numbers of properties in London and other
cities. Has there been any consultation with those sorts of landlord
who, if one could get their buy in, could have a massive
impact?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000236">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Yes. I can reassure my hon. Friend that even in
opposition, we began comprehensive discussions with large landlords of
that nature and social housing landlords. We have created an informal
body within the Department that has been tasked to engage specifically
with those stakeholders. We are collaborating with them to try to pick
our way through the area to ensure that we get a robust solution that
is watertight and does exactly what we seek to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
agree that consent barriers are an important consideration. In the
early days of the green deal, we will be watching closely, once we have
got some real-time experience, to see if and how such barriers arise.
Ahead of that, my officials are investigating possible solutions that
will respect existing consumer
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000238">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion raised an important point about
service charges and asked whether they can incorporate reasonable
efficiency measures as well as like-for-like replacements. That is a
good point. Unfortunately, that becomes fundamentally a housing matter,
which comes under the competence of the DCLG. However, she has
undertaken to write to me. If she does so, I will certainly happily
take the matter up on her behalf, or in conjunction with her, with the
Minister for Housing and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), to see whether we can get
some forward movement there. Trying to update those practices would be
incredibly complementary to the good working of the green

large social landlords, certainly in economically challenging places
where the green deal is seen as not just for the repair of social
housing but as a tool of potential economic revitalisation. There is a
double benefit there, but there is a lot more that we can do to engage
social housing landlords, and I will bring them together to see what
more we can do to get not only real action among the usual suspects or
the flagship social housing landlords, but a uniform roll-out right

resolutions between landlord and tenant being explored in his

tenant is one issue, but the other issue that has been raised is
landlord to leaseholder. If a complete block of tenants has signed up,
but two recalcitrant leaseholders say, “No way will you touch my
property,” how will that be resolved? I cannot see a contractual
way of doing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000243">&#160;</a>

resolutions will be covered in the way he suggests. On his second
question, we are actively looking at that issue, to try to arrive at a
solution. These complex issues do not lend themselves particularly well
to simple drafting, but we are determined to crack it. I hope that that

Yes, as we scrutinise the rest of the Bill we will see that there are
ways of dealing with the measure, but we will need to address it
further in secondary legislation. I do not pretend that we will have
the complete answer in secondary legislation. I think that we will need
to carefully look at the experience of the green deal roll-out and be
prepared to come back and amend secondary legislation to ensure that we
have cracked it in reality, because there are these unintended
consequences. I will want to see it up and running and operating in
real life, so putting it in secondary legislation will make it much

to provide for sanctions to ensure that those with obligations to
disclose or secure an acknowledgement under clauses 12 and 14, and
under regulations made under clauses 13 and 15, meet those obligations.
It allows for the following specific provisions: sanctions for
non-compliance, including civil penalties; requiring the green deal
provider to cancel liability of a bill-payer to pay green deal plan
instalments; requiring a green deal provider to refund any payments
that have already been made; and requiring those at fault to pay
compensation to green deal providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000254">&#160;</a>

achieve these arrangements, and then we will consult before setting
them out in regulations. Our aim will be to use existing and
well-established systems of sanction and redress where possible, but we
need to be confident that the sanctions will be sufficient to deter
non-compliance. Further work will be necessary to determine what level
of civil penalty  will be effective, and the Government will
work with stakeholders to ensure that the sanctions are
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000255">&#160;</a>

criminal offences and penalties that may be relevant in extreme cases,
where someone deliberately attempted to hide a green deal for material
gain at somebody else’s expense. However, we anticipate that
civil penalties—by which I mean fines—will be most
appropriate in most cases, together with the ability to require those
who have not met their obligations to pay compensation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We will work
with stakeholders to determine the best approach. Our starting point is
that the penalties must be sufficient to deter non-compliance and we
will work with industry stakeholders, such as the Law Society and the

compliance.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000257">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Thank you for your guidance, Mr Leigh,
on an earlier clause. It did mention instalments but, given your
advice, it is perhaps better to raise the matter while discussing
clause 17. I do not wish to repeat what will already be on the record,
but pre-payment meters are a huge issue. They are mostly installed in
hard-to-treat homes and in the homes of people in fuel poverty, to whom
we must reach out. There are real worries about how the provision will
work, how people will pay the green deal, and what will happen when
pre-payment over the summer and winter months does not work out. How
will people pay back arrears? Will the charge be fixed? Will people be
disconnected? The Bill would change the gas and electricity
disconnection legislation, which will adversely affect people on
pre-payment. I am sure that the Minister is well aware of all the
issues involved, but I want him to discuss briefly, but in some detail,
the situation with pre-payment meters and explain what will happen if
people paying fixed charges end up in
arrears.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000266">&#160;</a>

Gentleman that it is certainly not our expectation that there will be
more disconnections. If anything, because we will be improving the
energy efficiency of people’s homes, their bills should fall
and, as a result, the number of disconnections should fall. The clause
allows an obligation to be placed on energy companies to facilitate the
collection of green deal payments. The supplier will collect the green
deal charge from the relevant customers and pass it on to the green
deal provider or finance provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000267">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Government
are minded to give the role to electricity companies, not gas
companies. That is consistent with arrangements
with the feed-in tariff scheme and the warm homes discount, and will
minimise the costs to energy companies that, in turn, can be passed on
to consumers. We are confident that consumers will recognise that their
total energy bills should be lower with a green deal, even if energy
efficiency measures reduce their gas bill rather than their electricity
bill. We will also continue to examine options for strengthening the
cognitive link between the two different
bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000268">&#160;</a>

part of my life. The Minister will be aware that should a person go
away for a period of two weeks, the meter takes a daily rate, which is
a proportion of the standing charge. If a person left £2 in
credit on their meter and then went away for two weeks, they would have
no power when they came back. If they chose to credit the sum of
perhaps £10 on their pre-payment card, the daily standing charge
would be removed before they got any power, so they could find
themselves putting £10 on the meter and still not having any of
the
energy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000272">&#160;</a>

I may assist, I suspect that what the hon. Member for Hyndburn was
asking was whether the green deal part of one’s bill
becomes—I imagine—a second charge to the standing charge,
so that, should someone charge up their card with £15, they then
find that the £10 and the standing charge are taken. That might
get them up to the current date, but they would then find that perhaps
£3 was taken for the green deal repayment and they had only
£2 of energy left. I hope that that
assists.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000273">&#160;</a>

also a degree of confusion around the word “charge”.
Obviously, it is not a charge in the conventional sense; it is not a
charge on a property. The expression “first charge” is
not particularly helpful, albeit that it conveys the meaning that the

our intention to amend licences to deal with the matter, so that the
green deal repayment can be collected in a way that is compatible with
the current processes, by which I mean that power can be supplied while
also paying off the charge in part, as with the current arrears
process. By attaching it to electricity rather than gas bills, it is
much less likely that arrears will accrue over the summer months. It is
also worth noting that clause 21 requires the Secretary of State to
consult a wider range of appropriate stakeholders, including the holder
of any licence being modified, Ofgem and other persons. This clause
delivers a key principle of the green deal, namely that energy
suppliers should collect the repayments. I hope that that explanation

                  </strong> We have already discussed some of the issues that I
want to raise, but I would still like to cover them briefly. Clause 18
covers the power of the Secretary of State to modify gas and
electricity supply licences. The amendment would remove subsection (2),
which, according to the explanatory notes, limits those powers so that
they may be used
only<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000287">&#160;</a>

the purpose of making provision for: the steps that must be taken by
the holder of the licence following a bill payer’s failure to

may disconnect the supply to a green deal property; and enabling, in
certain circumstances, a licence holder to use a security deposit paid
by the bill payer to pay green deal payments to the green deal

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
112 would replace that subsection  and deals with the interests
of individual consumers who are disabled, chronically sick, of
pensionable age, on low incomes, or with one or more resident children
aged 16 or under. It would also prevent the disconnection of
the supply to a green deal property where the bill payer is in
financial difficulties and complying with an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 155<a class="bkMark" name="Column155">&#160;</a>
                  </div>agreed reduced repayment plan, of which the green deal is part. I will
not go through the proposed new subsection in detail, but the purpose
of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot amend
the licensing conditions to allow energy companies to disconnect
vulnerable customers for failing to keep up their green deal
repayments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At
present, suppliers can only disconnect a household for failure to pay
the charges associated with the supply of energy and metering costs,
such as standing charges. It has been long established that debts for
which one might lose one’s home, liberty or supply of essential
goods and services, such as energy, should be prioritised over other
debts. To allow disconnection for the non-payment of green deal
repayments simply as a result of the mechanism through which the loan
is repaid would subvert that
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consumers
may face situations in which they cannot afford to pay the green deal
charge, but can afford to pay for their ongoing energy consumption, or
they may wish to dispute elements of the green deal package, which we
have already discussed. I am particularly concerned that, although
disconnection is rare, the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux has evidence that indicates that customers, including those
vulnerable customers whom I have already listed, may be threatened with
disconnection for fuel supply arrears. Where customers are in financial
difficulty, threats of disconnection can lead them to make repayments
at an unaffordable or unsustainable rate, or behave in a way that is
contrary to their best interests, for example by seeking loans through
less formal arrangements than usual. I am particularly concerned about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Energy
Retail Association, which is made up of the six largest energy
suppliers, offers a self-regulatory framework. ERA members state that
they will not knowingly disconnect vulnerable customers, including
older people, sick people and disabled people and their carers. They
also have arrangements for those with young children. However, the
energy supply licence conditions with which all energy suppliers must
comply prohibit suppliers from disconnecting households occupied solely
by people of pensionable age, or those people and children, only during
the winter months. They also require suppliers to avoid disconnecting
households that include any occupant who is disabled, has a chronic
illness or is of pensionable age, but only during the
winter.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
those conditions were strengthened recently to ensure that suppliers
take all reasonable steps to examine their customers’
circumstances before disconnection, if suppliers are permitted to
disconnect households for failing to pay green deal charges, those
mandatory protections must be strengthened further, for example by
extending them to families with young children. I am particularly keen
for the Minister to clarify that the secondary legislation will cater
for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000292">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Very briefly, I not only have a great deal
of sympathy for but agree strongly with the sentiments expressed by the
hon. Member for Wells. My question to the Minister, however, is
slightly differently phrased. Can he assure us that the safeguards for
vulnerable customers that currently apply elsewhere will also apply to
the green deal? I am doubtful about stipulating and listing. Although I
agree with the individual categories of vulnerable potential consumers
that the hon. Lady 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 156<a class="bkMark" name="Column156">&#160;</a>
                  </div>discussed, I have some difficulty with the idea of listing them on the
face of a Bill. As a Minister, I always resisted putting lists in a
Bill. However, I seek assurance from the Minister in a slightly
different way in that the current protections will apply to the green
deal in the same way that they apply in other spheres of the energy
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000293">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful for the opportunity to thrash out
these important points. The amendments concern the steps that can be
taken if a customer defaults in paying green deal charges. It is a key
component of the green deal model that green deal payments should be
treated in the same way as charges for the supply of energy. That
should mean that the risk of non-payment of the green deal charge will
be broadly the same as the risk of non-payment of energy supply
charges, keeping the expected default rate for the green deal
equivalent to the historically low default rate for energy supply. That
is crucial. In order to get the low-cost finance necessary to make the
green deal as competitive as possible, we must ensure a low default
rate and low-risk cost of capital. Amendment 111 would remove the
possibility of introducing equivalent collection methods via energy
supply licence modifications, and would therefore greatly increase the
cost of finance for the green deal. That is my concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 112
concerns vulnerable consumers and the prevention of disconnection of
energy supply in certain circumstances. Energy suppliers are already
obliged to offer particular services to domestic customers experiencing
difficulties in paying their energy bills. They must offer a means by
which payments can be deducted from a social security benefit such as
Fuel Direct, made through means other than a pre-payment meter or made
through a pre-payment meter where that is safe and reasonably
practicable. It is absolutely our intention that the green deal should
be entirely consistent with those existing practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The safety
net agreement between the big six energy suppliers ensures that
suppliers will never knowingly disconnect energy supply to vulnerable
consumers at any time of the year. That will apply across the board to
the green deal as well, as part of those energy bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where the
disclosure and acknowledgement obligations contained in the Bill have
not been complied with clause 16 provides for a customer to seek
redress. We will set out in the green deal regulations the detail of
how that will work in practice, having engaged in the type of
consultation and stakeholder engagement that I am sure my hon. Friend
the Member for Wells will be able to play a meaningful part in. Redress
could include cancelling the customer’s liability to pay green
deal instalments. Clearly, more detail will need to be fleshed out in
secondary legislation, but I hope that she has found my explanation
reassuring and on that basis will feel able to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000297">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not wish to repeat the arguments, because I
know that I have brought this issue up with the Minister before.
However, it concerns me—not a little—that if somebody
moves from an ordinary bill payment arrangement to a pre-payment meter
arrangement their energy charges increase. The basic unit of energy is
more costly if people use a pre-payment meter and it seems desperately
unfair that that should be the case. I 
<div class="columnNumber">

proceedings. In her discussions with the Minister, will the hon. Lady
explore what incentives there could be for people on pre-payment
meters, including the potential negation of the additional charges that
currently incur, which could be an incentive to inspire the take-up of
the green deal among those customers? Would she consider exploring that

has just said. I am very happy to talk further about this issue.
Perhaps I could do so outside the Committee; I am happy to talk outside
the Committee. But I want to know what the Minister’s thoughts
are on this situation. It is hugely disadvantageous to people who are
already vulnerable, because of their financial situation. That is
particularly true of people in my constituency who do seasonal work and
part-time work for long periods of the year, and for whom the average
salary is only £18,000. If someone is put on a pre-payment
meter, there is no way that they should ever have to pay more for their
energy just because of the misfortune of their circumstances, which
could go on for years and years. Indeed, it may be a lifetime situation
for people who live in rural areas and other areas of seasonal
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000300">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady makes a very good point. I do not
think that it detracts from anything that I said in my earlier remarks.
However, the point that she is making really relates more to tariffs
and the iniquity that they can impose on the most vulnerable rather
than to the green deal per se. There will be an opportunity, later in
our proceedings in the Committee, to talk specifically about tariffs
and then we can perhaps explore the concerns that she has expressed and
perhaps elucidate further on this important issue specifically in
relation to tariffs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000301">&#160;</a>

advice bureaux. We are not necessarily talking about households who
read all the stuff that comes through their letterboxes and realise

                  </strong> Amendments 46 to 49 seek to ensure that energy
suppliers must respond to requests from green deal providers for data
on the energy payment history of individuals seeking to enter into a
green deal plan. I should make it clear that evidence of customer
consent will be required prior to that transfer of data. I will explain
the reasons for introducing the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000311">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To make the
green deal work we need, a point that hon. Members have raised,
low-cost finance at scale at the lowest, most competitive interest
rates. The likely route to achieving that will be through the capital
markets, issuing bonds backed by the cash flow from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 159<a class="bkMark" name="Column159">&#160;</a>
                  </div>green deal customer repayments. Without a track record for green deal
bonds, investing institutions will want reassurance
about the customers providing the income flows. Since individual
customers’ green deal payment history will be short at the
likely point of bond issue, their energy payment history will be
required to substitute for that. We propose that energy suppliers pass
limited payment history details to green deal providers, on request, at
the point the customer is considering entering into the green deal
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000312">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is
another benefit to that arrangement. Green deal providers will have
access to credit information about potential customers; for example,
through credit reference agencies. However, that will be less accurate
as a predictor of ability to repay the green deal than an
individual’s energy payment history. It may lead the green deal
provider to exercise unnecessary caution, as energy bill default occurs
at lower rates than other credit arrangements, such as credit card
repayments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000313">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I explained
earlier that we do not intend to make energy suppliers liable for
defaults. Unfortunately, that weakens their incentive to share
information with green deal providers to minimise default risk. By
requiring the sharing of energy payment information, with consent, a
wider customer pool will be served. That should not be a great burden
on energy companies. We will not introduce new data collection
requirements. The legislation will apply only to information already
held. We intend to enable them to charge for access to data, with a cap
on the charge level. I urge hon. Members to support these important
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000314">&#160;</a>

me on a few concerns that I have about the amendments. I am concerned
that they could lead to the cherry-picking of green deal customers by
providers, or could result in some customers being asked to pay higher
interest rates because they are perceived to be a greater credit risk,
based on their record of paying energy bills. The Minister has
previously said that the green deal will be available whether people
own or rent, and as this is not like personal debt, personal credit
ratings are not a factor. That is what the Minister has said in the
past. Can he reassure me that the amendments are not a backdoor method
of assessing a householders ability to repay? I fear that the amendment
could bring that in, and that would be a
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000315">&#160;</a>

grateful to her for raising that point, as it allows me to assure her
and others who may take an interest in the issue. I understand why they
might think that, but that is absolutely not the point of the
amendment. The amendment is designed not to allow individual green deal
providers to cherry-pick, on a credit rating basis, who they supply. We
have been absolutely clear from the start that one of the great
benefits of the green deal is that it is not credit-scored and it is
not a conventional form of personal finance. It is not a loan in the
conventional way. This has allowed for the overall aggregate package of
credit information to be analysed and for the appropriate interest rate
to be attached to it, which accurately reflects the overall risk
profile of the total package of aggregated green deal customers. It
allows a sufficient level of detail to be provided for the bond market
analyst to correctly analyse and rate the overall amount of bonds being
placed in the market. It is a capital markets mechanism; not one for
the individual consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000316">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am a reasonable fellow, so I will. We are not
requiring any new data to be collected and will allow the energy
companies to make a reasonable charge for data. The reason for
collecting the data is to not allow individual properties or customers
to be cherry-picked from the totality of data collected. That means
that it is possible to offer credit, rather than to assume that all
poorer households are bad risk. Personal credit ratings are a key part
of this, because the charge is attached to a bill. It is unlikely,
however, to affect the rates. The credit analysis will only be used to
allow responsible lending.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000322">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This is not a
way of allowing energy companies to come in and differentiate or refuse

interest rate. I assume that different green deal providers will
attract different rates of interest, depending on the overall credit

opportunity to have the green deal, particularly if, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 161<a class="bkMark" name="Column161">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for one reason or another, they do not qualify for the energy company

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have some questions that I am keen for the Minister to answer. The
energy prepayment history is attached to an individual, but the green
deal is attached to the property. Will the Minister reconcile how that
will work in his amendments? Also, if groups wanting green deal
improvements need support, and there are individual properties within
those groups, how will that be assessed? Does that make
sense?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000329">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Not quite, but I will endeavour to answer the
first question. The hon. Lady is correct: the broad thrust or
underpinning of the whole mechanism is that repayment will be through
the energy bill; it is not based on conventional consumer credit. The
green deal will be available to all, regardless of status, provided
there is a history of paying an energy
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000330">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
use of credit profiling will help to prevent irresponsible lending. It
will be a further aid to the golden rule to ensure that there is no
irresponsible lending to households that could not support it. It may
also be another way to access the energy company obligation. Some
people on very low incomes might be prepared to max out on the green
deal, so it is sensible to consider the ability of the most vulnerable
to sustain high energy bills, rather than to look simply at the
property. That will ensure that the most vulnerable, in particular,
will not get unnecessarily into debt and run into the problems about
which we are all
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment will help to ensure that credit can be offered equitably, and
we need an energy pre-payment history so that the first bill payer is
protected. We do not want people taking on energy bill obligations that
they are simply unable to pay, because if they are new to a
home—if they have just arrived and do not have a history of
paying the bill for that property—that situation might arise.
That is where the provision is likely to be most helpful. If a tenant
or home owner has been in the property for some time, the credit
history is clearly irrelevant, as they have obviously been able to pay
the energy bill, but if they have just moved into a new home it is
sensible to ascertain their ability to
pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000332">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for that explanation, but it
has raised another question. He may have answered it, but perhaps he
might make the point clear again. If the interest rate can vary
depending on the credit-worthiness of the householder, what happens if
a responsible householder moves out and the person moving in has a less
robust credit history? Does that mean that, as they negotiate to move
into a property, they have to wait to have their credit-worthiness
properly assessed before taking on the green deal, because the green
deal is attached to the property and not the householder? If a new
householder has a very different profile from  that of the
householder who has just left, how will that vetting or assessment
process happen in practice as they buy or move into a new
property?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000333">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There are two stages, and I agree it is slightly
complex. Credit information is relevant only for the first bill payer,

			Column number: 162<a class="bkMark" name="Column162">&#160;</a>
                  </div>does not have a history of paying the energy bill at the property and a
determination has to be made about what will be captured by the green
deal and the golden rule. As the green deal is caught by the Consumer
Credit Act 1974, there is a responsibility not only to make savings
under the golden rule and with the ECO, but to have due regard to
responsible lending. After the first individual has taken on the green
deal, subsequent bill payers will not have to have their credit
checked, because the green deal is attached to the bill, not the
individual. People will be able to see the energy bill history before
moving into a property; it will be totally transparent. They will be
able to ascertain the monthly charges before moving in. If someone is
new to a property, there will be an onus on the first green deal
provider to ensure that the individual is taking on responsible
lending.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000334">&#160;</a>

From that point on, the green deal becomes an integral, indivisible
part of the ongoing energy bill, with any subsequent property occupant
enjoying all the benefits of the property’s reduced running

which the occupant will be responsible, will be included in the

                     </span>
                  </strong> My amendments follow on from the Minister’s
comment in Tuesday’s Committee sitting that any order made under
clause 1(9) would be subject to the affirmative procedure, while any
green deal code of practice would be subject to the negative procedure.
If I am right that there is that discrepancy, I call on the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 164<a class="bkMark" name="Column164">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Minister to explain it. I think that he said no fewer than 16 times
during the Committee’s first two sittings on Tuesday that more
detail would come in secondary legislation. Given the importance of
secondary legislation to the Bill, I call on him to assure the
Committee that every bit of it will be subject to the greater
parliamentary scrutiny that the affirmative procedure
provides.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000351">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Committee is being asked to approve a Bill the final result of which
will depend far more on what is detailed in secondary legislation than
on the words before us today. I know that the use of secondary
legislation has increased over a number of Parliaments, but this Bill
takes that practice to a new extreme. Indeed, assessments suggest that
50 or 60 clauses of the Bill—about half of it—depend on
secondary legislation. I do not mean to suggest that I do not trust the
Minister to write some excellent secondary legislation, but I do not
think that he is completely
infallible.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000352">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister himself has recognised that the Bill has already been improved
through the parliamentary process, first in the other place and then on
Second Reading and in Committee, and I simply ask him not to deprive
the Bill’s all-important secondary legislation of the same
quality of contribution. I recognise that the Bill was amended in
another place to accept the recommendations made by the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, but notwithstanding those
improvements, I believe that without the changes I suggest, too many
elements that are central to the green deal will not be sufficiently
scrutinised by Parliament, to their detriment. I therefore call on the
Minister to accept my amendments and commit to involving Parliament to
a much greater degree in the development of the Bill’s secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000353">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As the hon. Lady has set out, the amendments
relate to the parliamentary procedure that applies to the three powers
in the Bill. Amendment 107 would require changes to energy supply
licences to be introduced only through a statutory instrument and only
after a positive endorsement by each House. Amendment 108 would require
the draft code of practice to be laid before Parliament and approved by
each House under the affirmative procedure. Amendment 109
would require all orders and regulations in the Bill to be laid before
Parliament under the affirmative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government view the modifications as unnecessary. A large number of
them would involve technical provisions to establish the system for
collecting green deal payments. I understand the wider, important point
that the hon. Lady makes. We are committed to ensuring that the
substantive measures of the green deal that will come into force under
secondary legislation are not only debated and scrutinised, but are
publicised and receive a proper airing. It is in our interests to
ensure that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000355">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is worth
noting, however, that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee did not comment on the absence of parliamentary procedure in
the green deal licence modification powers, and the Government agree
with that. We are committed to consulting widely on any changes to
energy supply licences that are needed to ensure the smooth functioning
of the green deal, as is clearly set out under clause 21.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000356">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 35
already provides for parliamentary scrutiny of the code of practice. A
draft code will be laid before Parliament and will not be issued if
either House resolves 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 165<a class="bkMark" name="Column165">&#160;</a>
                  </div>not to approve it. We believe that that parliamentary procedure strikes
the right balance between the need for proper scrutiny, which is
absolutely right and proper, and the best use of parliamentary time.
The code will deal with the detailed practical issues regarding green
deal participants’ conduct in specific situations; it will cover
complaints-handling, qualifications and marketing. However, the Bill
already provides that a large proportion of secondary legislation on
the green deal will follow the affirmative procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000357">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
the important points that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, makes
about the need for full and thorough scrutiny of the detail in the
green deal, particularly given that so much of it is being left to
secondary legislation. However, I urge her to understand that a
significant amount of that is of a very technical nature. We risk
clogging up Parliament and almost offering a smokescreen to the
Government, who could, if they were so minded, push through matters
that were more controversial under a covering volley of technical
jargon. I assure her that matters of real importance, specified in the
Bill, will be subject to the proper affirmative procedure. However,
given the accompanying technical detail, reviewing those matters would
not be a practical use of Parliament’s and hon. Members’
time. Given those arguments, and in light of previous, similar
discussions, I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured and feels able to
withdraw her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000358">&#160;</a>

because it is precisely in the technical detail that the meat of the
debate lies, as we have discovered in our discussions today and in
previous sittings. The devil is in the detail, and the way in which the
technicalities pan out will make the difference in whether the measures
are a success. Can the Minister provide a list of measures that will be
brought back, so that we know exactly when affirmative action will be
an option for us in future?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000359">&#160;</a>

have, however, just sped through a series of clauses without a single
word of debate because they were largely uncontroversial and not
technical. That is not uncommon parliamentary practice, and it allows

the interests of brevity, I will keep my comments short. The amendment

announcement of the green deal advice line. I am keen to hear a few
more details from the Minister about how he anticipates the advice line
to operate and whether he envisages the Department or the private
sector running it. How does he anticipate funding the advice line? What
training will be given to those staff giving
advice?<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000369">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for bringing forward the
amendment. However, the Bill already provides for independent green
deal advice, which will cover both green deal finance and the energy
company obligation, as well as—I am pleased to
say—microgeneration. This will be capable of providing consumers
with information about the rights and protections that are available to
them, as well as the referral to the relevant ombudsman. Our aim is to
make the green deal arrangements align with redress routes for other
energy services in a coherent way that is accessible and transparent to
the customer. We also recognise the role that sharing of complaints
data can play in improving performance to benefit the consumer, and we
will explore the detail of how that

               <p class="tabbed">In
respect of the advice line, we will put that out to tender, and we are
currently taking advice on the correct shape of that function. We
certainly want to ensure that we learn from the previous services that
were given by the likes of the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust
on such schemes in the past, but we think that we can do better than
the advice lines that have been offered in the past. That is why we are
trying to put it out to tender to a wider group and take it to a higher
level of consumer protection and advice. I hope that the hon. Lady has
found that explanation reassuring and, on that basis, will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000372">&#160;</a>

a couple of points on the potential consequences of the amendments and
how the LCM process relates to some of the regulations that, as has
been said several times, will be significant to how the green deal
takes effect in Scotland. There may be good reasons why there are
differences between Scotland and England on some aspects of regulation,
but there are concerns about the potential for differences that may
confuse consumers, given that much of the green deal relies on
secondary legislation, an assessment and suppliers. I want to seek
reassurance that the Government and the devolved Administration in
Edinburgh have thought about those potential significant differences. A
lot of the people that they will rely on to make the green deal
effective to people are companies that operate across Great
Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000383">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want reassurance that the information provided to consumers is
correct for the appropriate part of Britain. There have been problems
in the past with a number of things across borders and jurisdictions,
when people were used to having a single market providing information
that was not technically correct for the people in Scotland. There is a
potential for divergence within the green deal, which reflects the
comments that the Minister made previously about the green deal being
of universal interest and available to all. We do not want there to be
less confidence in Scotland than there should
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11060965000384">&#160;</a>
