</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): First, Mr. O'Brien, Iwelcome you back to the Chair. I shall not detain the Committee,because my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) saidmany of the things that I would have said, but in a much morecompetent fashion&#151;and also in an incredibly precise time,which allowed us to break for lunch more or less on the dot at1 pm. 
<P>
When considering new schedule 1, tabled by the hon. andlearned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and others, whichlists those personal injury cases that may be funded by theCommunity Legal Service, it is critical also to consider thosecases that may be excluded from funding by the CLS. The statementthat all personal injury cases will be excluded is false. TheBill clearly states that exceptions will be made and gives ameans of dealing with them. The briefing notes that we havereceived show how those exceptions may be administered. 
<P>
First, I seek a much clearer explanation of that process.Exactly how will the consultation process proceed? Within whattimetable will the results be known? At what point could oneexpect the Government to pronounce on the categories that may befunded in personal injury cases? That information would beuseful. Secondly, by what process will the decisions be made? Howwill exceptions be communicated to the Community Legal Service?How final will that decision be? Is an appeal process envisaged?Can further consideration be given to the finer points of whethera case should receive state funding or be funded through aninsurance scheme? 
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, my business experience 
me that most cases are insurable. Once the insurance market isestablished&#151;the legal aid umbrella will no longer covermany cases&#151;it will flourish, providing a range of productsthat will meet most circumstances. I rather resent thecharacterisation that implied that a blanket set of restrictionswould apply, to which no exceptions would be made. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): What is the logicof excluding legal aid for personal injury work when, accordingto the hon. Gentleman, it is likely to be reinstated? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I touched on my view&#151;I speak as a non-lawyer,in partial ignorance at least&#151;on Second Reading. First, agenuine saving of public money can be made from that exclusion,although I would not claim it to be a substantial sum of money.Secondly, it will reduce the administrative cost of the existingarrangements for establishing legal aid. That, too, is a fairconsideration. However, the hon. Gentleman will get a betteranswer from my hon. Friend the Minister of State; he will haveheard the question and will, I am sure, be able to give a farmore authoritative and thoughtful response. 
<P>
I am concerned that in considering the Bill without a properframework to establish exactly how exceptions will be dealt with,the Government have laid themselves open in many cases tounjustified criticism in that they can respond only by sayingthat some cases may be supported as exceptions. I refer to thecases presented in The Lawyer about which there was disagreementas to whether they would be funded. The difficulty is thatalthough one can reasonably assert that they probably would befunded, the certainty that many people would like to have inpronouncing on a new legal framework is lacking. We should bechallenging Ministers about that. 
<P>
We owe it to those who rely on legal aid to explain morethoroughly how to deal with exceptions if disagreements arise onthe merits of a case compared with the criteria that have beenset down so far. I am thinking especially of disagreementsinvolving test cases or the wider public interest which will, bydefinition, involve matters of opinion. It will not be possibleto say that such a case obviously involves the wider publicinterest. An argument must be presented and a decision will betaken and delivered on behalf of the Government. 
<P>
How can such a judgment be challenged if someone disagreeswith it? Does he or she simply have to take the rough with thesmooth? Of course, the existing system also offers roughdecisions in the way in which legal aid is handed out&#151;itis by no means a universal provision for every case that may havemerit. Those are my concerns, and I look forward to hearing theMinister's answers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I want to deal with twomatters, the second of which is the generality of legal aid forpersonal injury claims. That has already been much commented on,so I hope that I can introduce a personal angle that contributesto the debate. Before I do so, I shall speak to Governmentamendment No. 7&#151;effectively the entire rewriting ofschedule 2. 
<P>
Like so much of the Bill, schedule 2 is not the easiestprovision to follow, but it is clear that whoever drafted itdecided to distinguish between different activities that mightbe carried out under a legal aid certificate, some of which arelitigious and some are not. Thus, under paragraph 1 of 
2, the Government propose to exclude from the Community LegalService the following: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Services consisting of the provision of help in relationto . . . conveyancing, or . . . the making of a will.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Paragraph 2 refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Services consisting of the provision of help in bringingor defending any proceedings in the course of carrying on abusiness.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Therefore, a distinction is creeping in because paragraph 2deals with proceedings, as does paragraph 3. 
<P>
I am not the parliamentary draftsman, nor did I draftGovernment amendment No. 7, but it is clear to me that under theamendment many activities that are restricted to legal aid inrelation to proceedings will be restricted in relation to allforms of advice. The Minister frowns, which was my firstreaction. 
<P>
Paragraph 3 refers to: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Services consisting of the provision of help in bringingor defending . . . proceedings relating to a company orpartnership''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Under the amendment, that will be replaced with giving advice 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in relation to . . . matters of company or partnershiplaw''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That draws a distinction between contentious andnon-contentious matters. I was not able to do much research onthe matter while we suspended for lunch, but I know that underthe Legal Advice and Assistance (Scope) Regulations 1989, forexample, conveyancing services and wills were excluded from partIII of the Legal Aid Act 1988. However, a caveat in respect ofwills provides that legal aid may be available for the making ofwills for those who are blind, partially sighted, dumb, sufferfrom a mental disorder of any description or who aresubstantially or permanently handicapped by illness, injury orcongenital deformity. 
<P>
I would therefore like to know what the scope of schedule 2,in its new form, involves. Why has it apparently been widenedfrom dealing with an activity concerned merely with the bringingof proceedings to the exclusion of legal aid from non-litigiousareas? That is an important point and I would be happy for theMinister to reassure me on it or tell me that I have missed outan important aspect of legal aid regulations. As a barrister, myknowledge of such regulations is fairly limited, apart from whatI have to ask for in court at the conclusion of a case. I claimno expertise on the way in which legal aid is granted. 
<P>
I had the recent case in my constituency of a young man whosuffers from a severe form of multiple sclerosis and is confinedto a wheelchair; he is on benefits. He had had a good engineeringtraining and had designed a means of producing flowers made ofmetal and then enamelled; he gave me one to present to MadamSpeaker. He made the point that, not having a bean and being onbenefits, he had been helped by having the patent and thedrafting of the contract with which he came to an agreement withthe manufacturer drawn up under legal aid. How would such aperson be affected by the provision? 
<P>
From that point on the detail of amendment No. 7 I agree withmy hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough that itreads more clearly than the phrases it seeks to replace&#151;Iturn to the issue of what categories, if any, of litigation should still allow for legal aid. We are involved in a circularargument in that regard. The point has been made that of all theactivities carried out by the Legal Aid Board, personal injurycosts it the least and has the highest success rate&#151;morethan 90 per cent. It could equally be argued, however, that ifit is so successful, that makes it all the more suitable forconditional fee agreements because those who put up the money tofund them should consequently have a similar 90 per cent. successrate. 
<P>
As one of those who jump up and down saying that legal aidhas served personal injury litigation well, I accept that I haveto bear that point in mind. However, I remain concerned about theway in which the provision will operate in practice and about theareas in which legal aid will still be necessary. Those mattershave been discussed at considerable length, and most of theamendments that we have tabled to the existing schedule 2 aredesigned to reflect our concern. As a barrister who deals withmany personal injury cases, I am concerned that conditional feearrangements will be difficult for solicitors to come by anddifficult to finance. 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
We have identified the problem areas. They include cases ofcriminal negligence; cases of people, including children, who areunder disability; and cases with high overallcosts&#151;especially those with high investigative costs. 
<P>
I am not reassured by the Minister. If we are to make aneffort to ensure that legal aid remains available, it would dowell for us as a Committee to at least focus on this area and todraft something, rather than leave it to discretion, or a matterto be dealt with later. It needs to be addressed now. 
<P>
I am concerned about what will happen with the arrival ofconditional fee arrangements. To introduce a personal note,before coming to the Committee this afternoon, I spoke to thesenior clerk in my chambers because a point had been raised inanecdotal evidence about the take-up of CFAs. It is interestingto see what has been happening at the Bar. I do not believe thatmy set of chambers is unique in this respect. Less than 10 percent. of the work done in my chambers at present is CFA work, sotake-up has been very small. However, the other featurecharacterising the recent past is the gradual diminution in theamount of legal aid and personal injury work that we have beendoing. 
<P>
My set of chambers was set up by Sir John Thompson in theearly 1960s to do virtually nothing but personal injury work. Itwas churned out week in and week out by about a dozen barristers,so the evidence that specialisation has diversified isoverwhelming. The chambers that I am in now does far more workfor the Government&#151;there are a number of treasuryjuniors&#151;and it has branched out into a number of otherareas of which personal injury forms only a small proportion ofthe work that I do. 
<P>
There is a telling point in this case. I return to the issueof providing a quality of service to those who cannot afford it.If CFAs are not attractive within the setting of advocacy, whenspecialist advocates are available, I am concerned that thequality of service will suffer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The hon. Gentleman has describedhow his chambers seems to have developed into dealing with more general matters. I am sure that he is aware of the work that isbeing done by the Personal Injury Bar Association, withspecialists in personal injury, to develop a model-formconditional fee arrangement. That has been taken up by specialistchambers undertaking personal injury work in negotiation with theAssociation of Personal Injury Lawyers. 
<P>
Part of the problem that the hon. Gentleman identifies isabout barristers expecting to be rather better paid and notliking the sort of money that comes through on legal aid andpersonal injury work in private practice. CFAs will probably endup with lawyers receiving more, rather than less money. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That is a perfectly valid point and one that Ihave tried to grapple with. I have said that we cannot getstatistics from the Government, but getting statistics from one'sclerk in chambers is next to impossible. 
<P>
It was worth mentioning my chambers because if we do notbring our own experiences to bear, we often miss the point. Thehon. Gentleman has picked up the point that legal aid may nothave provided sufficient remuneration to make it attractive,although I promise him that my chambers employs the cab-rankrule. There are many members of my chambers, of whom there arethree silks, who do nothing other than personal injury work andwho regard themselves as personal injury specialists in a veryrestricted area. My chambers would regard itself as being apersonal injury chambers. 
<P>
I am concerned about CFAs and the restricted category. Ifcases involve high costs, I do not understand how the insurancewill be available or how solicitors will be willing to take onthe risk. The principle of CFAs is that lawyers are supposed toshare the risk of the client. The ethical reasons for that havebeen underestimated to a certain extent but, leaving them aside,we would be wise to ensure that provision is made in the Bill forthose categories of cases where CFAs are insufficient. For thatreason, I commend our amendments to the Committee and ask theMinister to consider how the matter can be dealt with properlyon Report. 
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr.</B><P>
Geoffrey Hoon): I welcome you to our proceedings, Mr. O'Brien.I admire your forbearance at having to deal with the torrent oflegal jargon that must, at any rate, confuse those members of thepublic who innocently stray into our proceedings. I think thatit was George Bernard Shaw who said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All professions are conspiracies against the laity'',
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and lawyers conspire more than most to obfuscate what theyreally mean. 
<P>
We have had a thoughtful debate about the amendments toschedule 2, each of which would allow funding for advocacy invarious procedures that are not currently included in theschedule. Amendments Nos. 43 and 73 would extend advocacyservices for coroners' inquests and for public and judicialinquiries. Such proceedings, unlike most court proceedings, areinquisitorial. Legal representation should be unnecessary, whichis why in principle civil legal aid is not available. 
<P>
The new scheme will operate under a controlled budget. Therewill be many competing claims on that budget and resources willbe targeted towards priority areas. Any extension of scope wouldhave to be at the expense of other parts of legal aidexpenditure. I do not agree, therefore, that providing 
comprehensive publicly funded representation at inquests andinquiries should be a priority for taxpayers' money. 
<P>
Help may still be available, however, for someone who has toattend a coroner's inquest or a public or judicial inquiry. Undercurrent arrangements, legal advice and assistance from asolicitor are available under the green form scheme to those whoare financially eligible. The new scheme will contain similarprovisions. Although now might not be the appropriate time to doso, I shall deal with the observation of the hon. Member forBeaconsfield (Mr Grieve). When speaking to amendment No. 7 thismorning, I made it clear that the current expectations under thegreen form scheme in respect of will making and conveyancing willbe preserved and introduced into the new scheme throughdirections. 
<P>
When truly exceptional circumstances warrant it, the LegalServices Commission will be able to fund representation atinquests. That would provide for circumstances similar to thoseconcerning the inquiry into the Marchioness, when a secondinquiry was necessary because of failures in running the first.I do not accept that, other than in those exceptionalcircumstances, it would be appropriate to extend advocacy. 
<P>
Amendment No. 49 would make public funds available forrepresentation for complaints under the Environmental ProtectionAct 1990. They are summary criminal proceedings that allow forany person to issue a complaint to a magistrates court whenaggrieved by the existence of a statutory nuisance or thedefacement by litter or refuse of public land, or other landwithin a litter control area of a local authority as specifiedin parts III asnd IV of that Act. 
<P>
I cannot accept amendment No. 49. In such cases the court hasto order a defendant to pay the reasonable expenses incurred bythe complainant when there were reasonable grounds for bringingthe complaint. In the majority of complaints, the defendant willbe a public body or company and the risk of costs not being paidis very slight. For that reason, I believe that other methods offunding such as no-win, no-fee agreements of the type that weconstantly discuss can be used and the non-availability of legalaid does not prevent a complainant from taking a reasonable caseto court. 
<P>
Furthermore, one of the key objectives of the reforms of thelegal aid system is to ensure that publicly funded help, undera controlled budget, is directed to areas where the need ofpeople is greatest. Those proceedings do not have sufficientpriority to warrant any public funding other than for theprovision of basic information and advice on the law, for whichthe law already allows. 
<P>
Amendment Nos. 53, 55, 71 and 72 would make representationavailable in hearings before adjudicators, special adjudicators,immigration appeals tribunals, employment tribunals, appealsconstituted under the Social Security Act 1998 and the socialsecurity commissioners. I make it clear to all members of theCommittee that the Government are conducting a review of alltribunals to assess the extent to which current procedures andother arrangements, including representation, comply with ourEuropean convention on human rights and European Unionobligations, and to identify the options to ensure compliance inthe future. The Government believe that it would be premature tomake any decisions on extending publicly funded  in tribunal proceedings until that review has been completed. 
<P>
The social security commissioners hear appeals on points oflaw from social security appeal tribunals. The vast majority ofhearings are paper hearings, with approximately only 300 casesa year out of a total of 4,000 settled by an oral hearing. Thehelp that we propose to make available includes everything shortof advocacy and is therefore sufficient to prepare a case for apaper hearing. 
<P>
Subject to any findings of the review that I have set out,the Government do not believe at present that we would bejustified in extending the scope of legal aid to providerepresentation in oral hearings. As has been stressed on numerousoccasion, we have to face up to the fact that we will beoperating under a controlled budget. Any extension of scope inone area would have to be at the expense of another.Representation is already provided by a number ofnon-profit-making organisations such as the Child Poverty ActionGroup, and we believe that the help that the commission will fundunder the Community Legal Service will be sufficient for anapplicant to present his or her case thoroughly. It thereforecannot at present be a priority to extend scope in this area,although I should make it clear again that the system ofcontracting that we propose contains sufficient flexibility toallow consideration of the matter in the future, should thatbecome a priority. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor's views on whether the commission shouldfund representation in proceedings before employment tribunalsare well known. In Committee in another place, he said that thereare certainly some cases before employment tribunals for whichlegal representation is desirable because often factual and legalissues arise that are resolved indistinguishably from litigationin the ordinary courts. 
<P>
That is not to say that representation should necessarily beprovided through legal aid or its successor. Severalorganisations already provide some representation in thoseproceedings, including trade unions and various non-profit-makingorganisations such as law centres, the Equal OpportunitiesCommission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the FreeRepresentation Unit. I recognise that they do not cover the wholeground. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor is also considering how to makeconditional fee arrangements more attractive for cases beforeemployment tribunals. They are in principle currently availablefor people to use, but as the Lord Chancellor explained inCommittee, under the employment tribunals' current cost rules,if costs do not follow the event, a successful applicant undera conditional fee arrangement would have to pay his lawyer'ssuccess fee and the insurance premium from the damages awardedbecause he could not recover those from the respondent. TheGovernment believe that if the private sector can provide aneffective service under conditional fee arrangements, publicmoney need not be spent. With a change to the employmenttribunals' cost rules, conditional fee arrangements could be aviable and attractive option for many cases before the employmenttribunal.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On the question of the tribunal cost rules, willthe chairmen of tribunals be precluded from ordering costsagainst the unsuccessful party except in very specific circumstances, or is it, as a matter of practice, rare for anunsuccessful, poor applicant to be made to pay his costs to thebetter-off employer? [
Interruption.] The hon. Member forHendon is chuntering yet again. I am not an employment lawyerand, unlike him, I am certainly not a jack of all trades. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I used to be an employment lawyer and my knowledgeis likely to be anecdotal and historical, but I recollect thatthe rules provide for the payment of costs only in certainspecified circumstances when the applicant has brought what Irecollect was described as a frivolous and vexatious application.I also recollect that the previous Government made it easier forcosts to be recovered against an applicant, therefore weakeningthe test, but the two factors that the hon. Gentleman suggestedare in my view combined: it is a strict test in law, but rarelyapplied in practice. If there is a change from that, I will writeto him to give him a more up-to-date account of those rules. 
<P>
I have clarified throughout that the Government's proposalsto reform the legal aid scheme will give us control overexpenditure and the ability to target resources to priorityareas. Savings generated in one area can be spent in another. TheLord Chancellor has made it clear that he is willing to considerwhether the commission should, in time, fund representation incertain cases before employment tribunals. However, theGovernment cannot consider that until we have appropriate controlover expenditure. By that time, the Government would have alsocompleted the review of the extent to which current proceduresand other arrangements, including representation, comply with ourEuropean obligations. Similar arguments apply to tribunals underthe Social Security Act 1998 and, once again, I cannot properlypre-empt the results of the review. 
<P>

<P>
As for the bodies dealing with immigration matters, the HomeSecretary already makes grants under section 23 of theImmigration Act 1971 to the Immigration Advisory Service and theRefugee Legal Centre: two voluntary organisations that providefree advice, assistance and representation at appeals. At therequest of the Lord Chancellor, the Legal Aid Board will shortlybe publishing its proposals for contracting legally aidedimmigration work, and the whole system for immigration and asylumappeals is receiving the Government's attention in theImmigration and Asylum Bill that is currently before Parliament. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): In the review, will the LordChancellor be considering certain organisations and firms oflawyers that purport to offer services to immigrants, but whichdo not? It is an abuse and a scandal. If immigrants know thatthey can contact organisations to receive proper legal advice,the ones that are ripping them off will wither on the vine. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a helpful interventionand, had he read the Labour party's manifesto at the time of thegeneral election two years ago, he would know that one of ourcommitments is to eliminate the scandal of advisers givinginappropriate and often inaccurate advice. We are consideringways in which to integrate the present arrangements that arefunded through the Home Office with the contracting proposalsthat will concentrate funds in the hands of those who are expertin giving proper advice. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman'ssupport&#151;if only in that area for the moment, although wemay win him over later in the Bill. He outlined the problems that are typical of those faced by most people when contacting lawyerswho may or may not have the appropriate expertise, but who,because of legal aid funding, can provide advice. 
<P>
Amendment No. 56 would introduce public funding for advocacyin limited defamation proceedings. I have not checked who tabledthat amendment, but legal aid is not currently available fordefamation. Under our proposals, the only help that would beavailable for that would be the provision of general informationabout the law, the legal system and the availability of legalservices. It is the Government's view that defamation, no matterin what context it arises, would not have sufficient priority towarrant additional funding within the foreseeable future. 
<P>
It is possible that such an action could be pursued througha CFA. I am aware of at least one firm of solicitors that offersthose arrangements for such purposes and, if it is successful,no doubt other firms will follow. The improvements to theoperation of conditional fees made under the Bill will make suchan option more attractive to individuals in the future. 
<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 42 and the matter ofscope in relation to individuals who allege negligent damage tothe property or the person. The Government's underlying reasonfor the change in this area is to provide greater access tojustice where it is needed most. The Lord Chancellor stated that,pending any findings in the review that is being undertaken, hewould certainly consider extending the help available in sometribunals, but such help can be provided only if the money forit can be found. One way in which to find such money is to ensurethat areas that can be funded adequately other than through thetaxpayer are not, in fact, funded by the taxpayer. 
<P>
We have made it clear that the vast majority of personalinjury cases are suitable for funding through CFAs. The figuresrelating to the average cost of cases that were outlined in myletter to all membes of the Committee bear some repetition. In1996-97, 83,852 personal injury cases were funded by legalaid. Of those cases, 11,868 were clinical negligence cases thatwill remain within the scope of the Bill, which leaves 71,984cases. 
<P>
Of those cases, 89 per cent. cost &#163;6,000 or less; 84per cent. cost &#163;5,000 or less and 81 per cent. cost&#163;4,000 or less. The figures represent the total costs forthe case and include all disbursements, and cover counsel's fees.With all costs included, the majority of cases cost less than&#163;4,000. The average amount of disbursements, which I knowhas troubled some members of the Committee, paid out bysolicitors in cases costing &#163;4,000 or less was only&#163;304. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We have kindly been provided with the figuresthat the Minister is outlining. His arguments would be moreattractive if each firm of solicitors had only one case on itsbooks. However, most competent firms of solicitors will have aseries of cases, so a multiplicand of that &#163;304, or thatsum of less than &#163;4,000, will be involved. Does he acceptthat those small costs show that the Government are alreadygetting good value for money? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> They show that solicitors provide very good valuefor money in the vast majority of cases. No one can argue aboutthat. However, I accept that solicitors face different costs invarious cases, but the reality is that a different amount of time is taken to reach a conclusion in each case. Not all cases starton the same day, and certainly not all of them wil be concludedon the same day. Some cases will be settled early in the processand a success fee will be payable. Other cases may be settledlater and a success fee may be payable much later. 
<P>
In reality, as money is paid out by firms of solicitors,money will be paid in. Not only will they receive their ordinarycosts, which are supposed to cover the cost of doing business andallow a reasonable profit, but they will receive a success feeover and above their ordinary costs. 
<P>
Perhaps this is indicative of the recent change that hastaken place in political philosophy, but here am I, a LabourMinister, explaining to a Conservative Member the benefits of thebusiness-like approach that we believe is possible. That is howbusinesses are funded; it is how all businesses operate. Not allthe money comes in on the same day, not all the money is paid outon the same day&#151;a process is involved. There is no reasonwhy firms of solicitors should not participate in that processin exactly the same way as other businesses. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Has the Minister any idea of how much cash wouldbe required to fund the disbursements, insurance premiums and soon of an average personal injury lawyer? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not know the answer, and I shall notspeculate, but I have made it clear that in cases costing&#163;4,000 or less, the average disbursement was&#163;304&#151;not an enormous sum. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): My hon. Friendwill be interested to know that if an average practice had 50 or60 cases at &#163;300 each, it would cost the firm less than&#163;1,500 to borrow the necessary &#163;30,000, and thesuccess fee on one case would repay it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for hisprofessional assistance in Committee. Although the Oppositioncriticised the research that was conducted, KPMG&#151;arespected firm of accountants&#151;was hardly likely to produceresearch that simply agreed with the Government's contention.KPMG looked carefully at the different firms involved. I accpetthat it concluded that the smallest firms in its survey wouldtake longer than a large firm to ensure that it recovered all theexpenses after a reasonable period. 
<P>
An interesting aspect of the research that was detrimentalto the Government's case was that KPMG assumed a standing start;it assumed that each firm would start with a blank piece of paperand build up its portfolio, rather like the unrealistic examplethat Opposition Members have used. 
<P>
Again, because not all cases will start on the same day, notall cases will begin for any firm, large or small, on the firstday that the changes come into effect. Perhaps for many years tocome, given the time that some cases can take, they will stillreceive funding through legal aid. Therefore, the way in whichfirms work will be subject not to a sudden change but to aprocess. Firms will face a gradual change from personal injurycases being funded through legal aid to their being fundedthrough conditional fees. Again, that will make life a loteasier&#151;easier, in fact, than the basis on which theresearch was conducted by KPMG. We are using research that worksto the detriment of the Government's case, rather than supportingit. Nevertheless, on the basis of that research, KPMG concluded  
that all the firms examined would be able fairly quickly to makeprofit from funding cases in that way. 
<P>
The anxieties that Opposition Members have expressed are notborne out in reality. It is not unreasonable to expect solicitorsto judge&#151;as they already do, if hon. Members arehonest&#151;whether the people who come to their offices canfund some disbursements. It is well known and has been wellestablished over many years that solicitors are willing to funddisbursements in appropriate cases if necessary. 
<P>
Notwithstanding that, we have made it consistently clear thatadequate safeguards will be provided. Not all personal injurywork will be excluded. Cases in which a cause of injury otherthan negligence is alleged will continue to receive help.Therefore, cases in which police brutality or abuse is allegedwill still receive public funding. The victim of domesticviolence will be able to receive help, not only to protecthimself of herself from further violence, but to seekcompensation for injury. Clinical negligence will remain withinthe scope of public funding. 
<P>
Furthermore, the Lord Chancellor will make directions so thatcases with high overall or initial investigative costs willremain eligible for help, as will cases involving the widerpublic interest. I emphasise that including cases of publicinterest will mean that public assistance will be available forsome cases even though there may not be sufficient benefit to anyone individual. That might mean that such a case would notreceive legal aid funding today. The public interest category maytherefore extend the availability of legal aid. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) wasworried about the process for establishing the funding code.Consultation on the funding code ended on 30 April. Inevitably,the Government received many responses, which are now beingconsidered by the Legal Aid Board and the Lord Chancellor'sDepartment. We shall continue to receive representations on theissue until the summer, at which stage we shall present proposalsabout precisely how the funding code will operate. Thoseproposals will in due course be laid before Parliament, so hon.Members will have a further opportunity to make suchrepresentations as they think fit. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire also asked howdecisions can be challenged. We propose to establish a fundingreview body so that an appeal against a decision on its meritscan be made. It will be similar to, although not exactly the sameas, existing area committee appeals. There is a well-establishedsystem for challenging decisions of the regional Legal Aid Board.There will be a similar appeal to a funding review body whoseresponsibility will be to judge whether an appropriate decisionhas been taken in a particular case.

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The Minister has comprehensively explained theexceptions. When the Bill receives Royal Assent, as it will, willhis Department or the Legal Aid Board produce booklets fordistribution to citizens advice bureaux and others to explain it?At the moment, people go to lawyers who have legal aid signs intheir windows. Those will disappear. The Bill is complicated.Where can one get a signpost? Will the booklets include relevantaddresses and telephone numbers, so that people will know whomto approach? Otherwise, there will be a lot of confused people. 
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm,</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Once again, I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman'sintervention. It is a complicated matter, but the purpose of thefunding code is to give lawyers a process&#151;I almost calledit a checklist&#151;by which they can determine whether a caseshould be eligible for funding. An explanatory leaflet or bookletwill be widely distributed, but I have some reservations aboutwhether ordinary members of the public will be able to understandit. I have seen attempts to simplify the code for the benefit ofMinisters, and they are not always as clear as they might be. Iassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are committed tosimplifying the procedures, as shown by our proposals to reformthe process. I live in hope that a document can be produced thateven Ministers can understand. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I urge my hon. Friend to havea go, and ensure it is in plain English, in languages other thanEnglish&#151;but plainly&#151;and in other media. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall undertake to do all those things. 
<P>
Amendment No. 129 would allow some additional help for thosewith personal injury claims. The commission would be allowed tolend to complainants the money needed to cover disbursements orinsurance premiums. I have already explained that I believe thatthose costs should be borne by the solicitor as part of thenormal overheads of running a business. In any event, theamendment is unnecessary; clause 7(3)(e) gives the commission thepower to make 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``grants or loans to individuals to enable them to obtainservices''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That power has the advantage over the amendment in that itapplies to any services that the commission may fund. The LordChancellor could, if necessary, direct that personal injury casesbe considered under clause 7 to cover the funding of suchdisbursements as insurance premiums. 
<P>
Amendment No. 130 and the new schedule seek to include in theBill the circumstances in which funding would be considered forpersonal injury cases. I have some sympathy with some of thecategories listed; some are largely the same as those on whichwe could make directions, but some are not suitable. Indeed,primary legislation is not the place to make such exceptions. Theamendment and the new schedule would make exemptions for casesin which the total cost exceeded &#163;25,000 or in which thecosts of an investigation were likely to exceed &#163;3,000. 
<P>
I have already said that directions will be made to enablecases with a high overall cost or initial investigative cost toreceive funding. The figures in the amendment are within therange suggested in the Legal Aid Board's consultation paper onthe funding code, but they should not be set out in primarylegislation, not least because of the effect ofinflation&#151;not that there is much inflation under thisGovernment. If those figures were included in the Bill, newprimary legislation would be necessary every time the rulesneeded to be changed. I cannot conceive of the previousGovernment ever putting such a limitation in primary legislation,so I am slightly surprised to see amendments to that effect. 
<P>
Amendment No. 130 and the new schedule include multi-partyactions. The schedule also lists a number of specific types ofaction for special consideration, such as industrial disease andproduct liability claims. In such actions, as in multi-partyactions, it will often be in the public interest to fund cases, although they will often have high associated costs. Not everycase will have those special problems, however, and no list bytype of case could be expected to be comprehensive. Personalinjury is generally excluded because it is suitable foralternative forms of funding. 
<P>
Nothing about multi-party actions makes them unsuitable forconditional fee agreements. Often the costs will be exceptionallyhigh; if so, the directions will allow for help. If no high costsare involved, or if the case does not raise a public interestpoint, there will be no particular reason to single out suchactions for special treatment. 
<P>
The amendment and the new schedule also make specialarrangements if the damages are likely to be high. I am puzzledby that proposal. The eventual amount of damages does not affectthe complexity of a case. It is obviously possible to have asimple, open-and-shut case, in which a person who had sufferedappalling injuries would receive substantial damages. That doesnot of itself make it unsuitable for a conditional feearrangement. Indeed, the reverse might prove to be the case. 
<P>
Amendment No. 130 would make special provision for vulnerableclients. It is clear that the new schedule is intended to dealonly with those who lack the capacity to take legal proceedingsin their own right. I assume that proposed subparagraph (ii) ofamendment No. 130, which refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``people suffering from a mental disability''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
also intended to include only those who lack the legalcapacity to start proceedings. 
<P>
In these cases, it is essential that the person acting as alitigation friend for the patient or child understands what aconditional fee arrangement would involve, and that the friendis capable of agreeing to the uplift on the claimant's behalf.There is no reason why a case should not be funded under a CFAin the same way as any other case. CFAs are a method of fundinga case. A solicitor should not be taking weak cases, whatever themethod of funding. Patients or children will always be animportant consideration, whether or not they are capable ofgiving evidence that the court will accept. That considerationshould be made, however the case is funded. It would beirresponsible for a lawyer to proceed with a case that he or shefelt had very little chance of success, whether under a CFA oranother method. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> It is a brief point. Additional protection isafforded to children and people with a disability because anyfinal settlement must be approved by the court. That protectionexists at present, and will no doubt continue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his knowledgeand expertise. I am sure that judges and supervisors will haveparticular regard to the circumstances if there is concern aboutthe basis of the conditional fee arrangement. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 are linked. I would have somesympathy with amendment No. 131 if it stood alone. By itself, itwould be no more than a signal that not all personal injury workshould be left unfunded, which is the Government's position. Ifit did no more than place an expectation on the Lord Chancellorto make directions, I would have little quarrel with it.Unfortunately, it is linked to amendment No. 132, which definesthe compelling reasons and would involve the commission in adetailed consideration of the funding arrangements available for each personal injury case that came before it. The majority ofpersonal injury cases can be conducted on a CFA basis. That iswhat we expect to happen in the future. We are making exceptionsfor exceptional cases only, but beyond that, we are not preparedto make public funds generally available for cases that shouldbe taken on a CFA basis. I therefore cannot accept amendmentsNos. 131 and 132. 
<P>
A number of technical matters were raised during ourdiscussion that I shall endeavour to deal with now. The hon.Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) asked whetherthe success fee and the premium would be secured on an indemnitybasis. It is certainly our intention to consult on the preciseterms of the rules, and I shall take into account the hon.Gentleman's comments. It is not clear that the indemnity basiswill always be appropriate. Nevertheless, there will be strongarguments and the matter will have to be resolved followingconsultation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> May I return to a point that I made aboutGovernment amendment No. 7, which the Minister helpfully triedto deal with earlier? He dealt with the question of wills andconveyances. I am grateful for his explanation, even if he wasrepeating what he had said earlier, and I apologise if I missedit. 
<P>
My point also covered the inclusion of other categories,which in the schedule, as it stands, relate solely to litigiousmatters and places them in a category in which legal aid isapparently not available at all for any purposes. I do not expectthe Minister to give me an answer now, but I should be gratefulif he will say whether there are implications for the grant oflegal aid to someone who is disabled and who is seeking advicerelating to a business or partnership. That was the point thatI was making when I cited the example of my constituent who saidthat he had received legal aid in those circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The amendmentwas drafted to simplify and shorten a complex area of primarylegislation&#151;although I am not sure that it altogethersucceeds in that. It was not designed to remove legal aidentitlement from anyone who enjoyed it under the originalwording. If as a result of a drafting error, in the aim ofachieving greater simplicity, that impression has involuntarilybeen given, I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman on thematter and it will be corrected in due course. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We have had a most interesting debate&#151;notleast because it was genuinely a debate. I am grateful to thehon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for Hastings and Rye (Mr.Foster), for Hendon and for Battersea (Mr. Linton) for joiningissue with us, even though they have not convinced us of themerits of their arguments against our amendments or in favour ofthe Government amendments, particularly amendment No. 7. TheMinister and his hon. Friends did not deal adequately with thearguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield, forBanbury (Mr. Baldry) and for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and thehon. Member for Torridge and West Devon&#151;with somedeference, I also include my own arguments in that complaint. 
<P>
Although the principles that we have been debating areimportant, I am not sure that the Government realise what theyare doing by introducing amendment No. 7 and by rejecting ouramendments. The wording of that amendment is an improvement the original wording, but it will still leave a range of needsunmet. I am surprised that the Minister is proud to introduce themeasure and that he proclaims his Tory credentials byamassing&#151;

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not recall portraying myself in any way as aTory. I expressed some surprise that I was having to explainbasic principles of business to someone who is a member of aparty that&#151;once upon a time, at any rate&#151;proclaimeditself the party of business. I am simply trying to assist thehon. Gentleman's party's kitchen-table debates and to help itcome to terms with the new realities. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was going to remind the hon. Gentleman of thestory of Mark Twain who, when tweaked by a lawyer on theafter-dinner speaking circuit at the end of the last century, wasable to retort that he was interested to hear Joe HinkenlubberIII addressing the audience with his hands in his pockets becausethat was the first time that he had seen a lawyer with his handsin his own pockets. Unfortunately, the Minister took his handsout of his pockets while he was addressing me on Torybusiness-like philosophy. The point about being a Tory and aboutunderpinning right conduct in business is that we endeavour tohave a service with which to be business-like. The Minister andhis friends will remove from the public access to legal serviceproviders. I am not sure that that is a sensible course ofaction, even for a Labour Member, let alone a ConservativeMember. It is unusual to acclaim a service that one does notintend to provide. 
<P>
The only way in which we can register our concern is to voteagainst amendment No. 7, and the only way in which we can getLabour Members to put their names on the record for publicscrutiny is to have them vote in support of the amendment andagainst our amendments that protect the vulnerable. Although Ilistened with care to the Minister's arguments and those of hishon. Friends in support of him, I am wholly unconvinced that theymeet the real needs of the public and I urge hon. Members to voteagainst Government amendment No. 7.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 6,leave out lines 31 to 34. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take thefollowing amendments: No. 50, in page 7, line 3, at endinsert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) In considering factors under subsection (2)(f) aboveno individual shall be disadvantaged by reason of conductoccasioned by physical or mental illness of impairment, temporaryincapacitation, or trauma or language skills.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> These are probing amendments and I shall speakto them quite briefly. 
<P>
Amendment No. 127, tabled in my name and those of my hon.Friends, seeks to leave out lines 31 to 34 of page 6 of the Bill.Currently, those lines are within subsection (2)(b). I shall readthe relevant words from subsection (2) so that the Committee canbetter understand: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In settling the criteria to be set out in the code theCommission shall consider the extent to which they ought toreflect the following factors . . . the availability of sums inthe Community Legal Service Fund for funding the services and(having regard to present and likely future demands on thatFund), the appropriateness of applying them to fund theservices''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The short point is that the amendment would remove from thefunding code the requirement to take into account the sums thatthe Lord Chancellor has made available for the Community LegalService. It would preserve the availability of advice, assistanceand representation as an entitlement subject to the other factorsof cost benefit, importance and other matters set out in clause9. 
<P>
Amendment No. 50 seeks to add a new subsection at line 3 ofpage 7, which would read: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In considering factors under subsection (2)(f) above noindividual shall be disadvantaged by reason of conduct occasionedby physical or mental illness of impairment, temporaryincapacitation, or trauma or language skills.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The short point about that amendment is simply to ensure thatthe commission does not discriminate by reason of physical ormental disability or social exclusion. In many respects, thatreflects the concerns that we addressed when debating clause 1last week. 
<P>
Amendment No. 126, the third Opposition amendment to theclause, comes at line 5 of page 7. It would introduce this newset of words: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``provided that the Code shall not require applicants toattempt mediation rather than receiving legal assistance, savein circumstances where a privately paying client would be advisedto attempt mediation.''

<P>
The amendment's purpose is to ensure that mediation is notforced on those requiring recourse to public funds, save incircumstances where those who can afford to pay privately wouldthemselves be advised to attempt mediation. It would ensure thatmediation is available where it is suitable but would not forcethose who could not afford the costs of legal services to usemediation where it would not be suitable for a paying client. 
<P>
During the past few sittings, I have apprehended that theGovernment are keen&#151;I understand why&#151;to keep peopleout of court for financial reasons. On some occasions, it issensible to keep people out of court for legal reasons. However,some cases need a sharp dose of adversarial activity to deal withthe real issues and to ensure that justice is done. I am notsaying that that is so in every case, but if the Government donot make themselves clear, mediation will be forced on litigantswhen it may not be to their advantage and it would not be theroute chosen by those with the private means to choose how bestto progress their dispute. Thank you, Mr. O'Brien, for allowingme to deal with all three amendments in one go, and I lookforward to the Minister's response. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall say a few words on amendment No. 126.I am sure that every member of the Committee is in favour ofmediation, but it is important to make it available to all andto ensure that legally aided clients are treated no differentlyfrom private clients. Mediation should not be compulsory,especially in such matters as domestic violence and in manymatrimonial cases. However, I hope that the benefits and theprocesses of mediation will be explained to all clients. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I, too, want to address myremarks to amendment No. 126, because I agree with my hon. andlearned Friend the Member for Harborough and the hon. Member forTorridge and West Devon. As I mentioned during this morning'ssitting, I spent several years practising, especially in familylaw. In my experience, often the only way to get any commonsense, especially for the sake of the children of a failedmarriage, was for a judge to sort out the acrimony between ahusband and wife. 
<P>
I am the first to recognise that mediation is to be welcomedwhen it can achieve anything. As both my hon. and learned Friendand the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, theacrimony arising from many broken marriages is unfortunately suchthat only the banging of heads together by a judicial decisionfollowing an adversarial hearing achieves a common-sense approachthat benefits the children. Frequently, the parties feel thatthey had not had their day in court if a case is not fully heard. 
<P>
Mediation can present another danger. All of us who do suchwork come across cases in which marriages have broken downbecause of the bullying nature of one party. Whichever party hasthat personality often succeeds in achieving an advantage throughmediation, whereas judges are aware of the importance of ensuringthat bullying personalities do not necessarily succeed in gettingtheir own way. 
<P>
I hope that even if they cannot do so today, the Governmentwill take very seriously what we have said and recognise that anamendment, such as amendment No. 126, should be added to theBill, perhaps on Report. It is in no one's interests for peopleto be forced into mediation when it is not appropriate. Althoughmediation is greatly welcomed when it can achieve something, some cases it is not appropriate. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General </B>(Mr. Ross Cranston): We must resistamendment No. 127. The Community Legal Service fund will have afinite budget. It is essential that the commission has adequatemechanisms to control its spending and ensure that it liveswithin its budget. The two principal control mechanisms will becontracts and the funding code. Contracts will define theservices that can be provided under the scheme, while the fundingcode will contain the criteria for assessing whether individualcases should be funded. 
<P>
In many cases, resources will not be taken into account. Thefunding code will set out the criteria and if people meet them,assistance will be available. Some types of cases, such aswhether a child should be taken into local authority care, willhave top priority and no reference will be made to resources inany sense. However, in other cases&#151;we focused in the draftfunding code published by the Legal Aid Board on very expensivecases&#151;resources will be taken into account when assessingindividual applications for funding and also during the processof the case. It has been acknowledged by many Opposition Membersthat a few very expensive cases have taken up a disproportionateshare of the legal aid budget. It is only appropriate thereforethat resources are taken into account at both the applicationstage and during the case itself. 
<P>
Other matters may possibly be the subject of consultation infuture to take into account trends in demand and spending whenconsidering applications in certain categories that border onother criteria. Such criteria could help the commission torespond quickly and flexibly to any unforeseen demand, withouthaving to change the main criteria. 
<P>
I have some sympathy with the intention behind amendment No.50, although the way in which it is expressed is not especiallyapt. For example, persons with a mental illness may behave in away that makes it impossible for a solicitor to continueassisting them, and that is not catered for by the amendment.Mention is made of language skills and I am not sure that thatis appropriate to be covered by the word ``conduct''. I am notmaking any promises because the Bill is not mine, but if the hon.and learned Member for Harborough does not press the amendment,I undertake to return on Report to see whether it is possible tomeet his concern. 
<P>
Amendment No. 126 deals with mediation. Opposition Membersacknowledge that that is important. Figures published today inThe Lawyer show that the Centre for Dispute Resolution, whichdeals with commercial mediation, has dealt with significantlymore cases in the past year than before. The hon. Member forSurrey Heath mentioned family cases. Pilot studies have shownthat mediation can be very successful in that area. I acknowledgethat, in some circumstances, there may have to be a court order.The hon. Gentleman mentioned cases involving violence, but inmany family cases, especially when mutual co-operation betweenthe parents in the interests of children is concerned, mediationis appropriate. 
<P>
The Government's policy is that some particular types ofservice may be more appropriately dealt with by mediation, as aresult of which the commission would decide to fund mediationrather than another sort of service. In that respect, applicantswould have to go along the mediation track. There is compulsion, no attempt to prevent those who have the resourcesfrom having their day in court. That is their choice. However,we believe that mediation is sometimes more appropriate, and thatthe commission could decide to fund that service rather thananother. We therefore cannot accept the amendment.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was heartened to hear the Solicitor-Generalsay that he had some sympathy for amendment No. 50. I wish thathe could translate his sympathy into action, by doing somethingnow. For instance, he could propose an amendment that cured thedefects of our amendment. However, I am grateful to him forsaying that he will return to the matter on Report. Indeed, weshall wish to return to a good deal on Report. In the light ofwhat the Solicitor-General said, I beg to ask leave to withdrawthe amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page7, line 14, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`requiring the furnishing of information or imposingother'
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and insert `imposing'. 
<P>
This is a minor drafting amendment. It proposes that theprovision requiring the furnishing of information be deleted fromsubsection (5)(b). That condition could still be required underthe remaining wording. Those words could give false informationabout the nature of other, more substantive conditions that wouldbe imposed. The Government intend to replicate in the fundingcode the requirement currently set out in section 15(3F) of theLegal Aid Act 1988, which requires persons to attend a meetingwith a mediator before seeking legal representation in privatelaw family proceedings. It comes back to matters that we havediscussed previously.

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The amendments provide for exceptions to be made,under clause 11, to allow for certain funding and for freediagnostic interviews. I understand that clause 11 restates theway in which the regulations will operate. The purpose ofamendment No. 51 is to air a new subsection, proposed inamendment No. 52, which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nothing in the regulations shall prevent the provisionof an initial free interview of a diagnostic nature of not morethan one hour's duration or such longer period as the regulationsmay prescribe.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That provision is designed to encourage the take-up ofsolicitors' services by those seeking advice. A substantial number of solicitors' firms already offer such a free interviewand find it beneficial to do so. The amendment is designed toprevent the practice from ceasing. It is also likely to assistwith administration and to reduce costs, as it ought also tofacilitate initial telephone inquiries. I commend the amendmentto the Committee. Nothing further need be said of it. I hope thatit will meet with some measure of approval from the Government. 
<P>
Amendment No. 51 would insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to subsection (3A) below'',
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and is consequential on amendment No. 52. I hope that theGovernment will respond to this minor amendment. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor General:</B> The Government believe that theamendment is unnecessary. First, as the hon. Gentlemanacknowledged, many solicitors currently provide such assistance.Secondly, clause 8(2) will allow the Lord Chancellor to prescribecircumstances in which services can be provided regardless ofmeans. That might allow such a provision, although I hasten toadd that the intention is that nothing more than the most basicinformation about the availability of legal help is envisaged asbeing likely to be covered by that provision. As a matter ofbasic principle, the Government take the view that people who canafford to contribute should do so if they receive more than basichelp. 
<P>
Thirdly, we intend that contracts let by the Legal ServicesCommission will cover the provision of basic advice andinformation. The initial stage will not require a means test. Itmay be possible to advise a client at the initial stage that hehas no case to pursue or, if it appears that a client might havea case, to inform him whether public funding is available forthat category of case, and if it is not, about alternativemethods of funding such as conditional fee arrangements.

<P>
On resuming&#151; 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I identified two ways in whichassistance could be provided. I said that solicitors at thepresent time provide diagnostic assistance and, secondly, Ireferred to the possibility of provisions being made under clause8(2). 
<P>
I now wish to assure members of the Committee that basicinformation and advice under the new scheme will be availablefrom any solicitor or advice agency with a contract to provideadvice and assistance. There will be no means test for thatinitial stage. It is intended to help the client to be aware ofthe options that are open to him or her. It might be possible toadvise a client that there was no case to pursue. If it seemedthat the client might have a case, the agency or solicitor couldinform him whether public funding was available for that categoryof case or, if not, could provide advice about alternativemethods of funding, such as conditional fee arrangements. 
<P>
Such a proposal is similar to the approach already beingtested in the Legal Aid Board's pilot scheme for advice andassistance contracts, which make special provision for level onework consisting of information, diagnosis and short pieces ofadvice that usually last no more than 15 to 20 minutes. Contracts require the client's eligibility for legal aid to be testedbefore proceeding to the more detailed level two advice. Thereis no need to make specific provision in the Bill for diagnosticinterviews. 
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page8, line 37, leave out from `both,' to end of line 38.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I had already addressed the Committee onamendments Nos. 51 and 52, and I wanted to invite my hon. Friendthe Member for Beaconsfield to deal with amendments Nos. 125 and124, if he was able to catch your eye, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Like my hon. and learned Friend the Member forHarborough, I was deluded into believing that there would be twoDivisions in the Chamber, but for some reason that did nothappen. As a result, I was not as prompt in returning to theCommittee Room as I should have been, for which I apologise, Mr.O'Brien.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 deals with a simple but important matter.Clause 11(6) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regulations may . . . include provision requiring thefurnishing of information, and . . . make provision for thedetermination of the cost of services for the purposes of theregulations.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
However, the clause does not include a provision that isincorporated into current legislation, under which regulationsmay not provide for the payment of any capital sum from thosewhose capital would qualify them for income support. Under thatprovision, house capital is disregarded in assessing theresources of applicants for legal aid. 
<P>
The Government have not said that they intend to end thatdisregard. Is it all right that it should be expressly providedfor in the regulations? I await what the Solicitor-General hasto say about that. Would it not be desirable to include such aprovision in the Bill? I cannot believe that the Governmentintend to end the disregard. Clearly, serious hardship would becaused if the disregard were removed. 
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be to ensure that legal aidremained available for those who had purchased their own homesand were living in them, but were otherwise dependent on statebenefits. The logic of granting that exemption is obvious. Ifpeople's homes have to be put into the kitty, they would faceproblems because homes are not readily realisable assets. Amechanism of support exists through the benefits system to enablethem to remain in their homes.

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Both amendments deal with thetreatment of the assisted person's home as capital. Similaramendments to these were moved in the other place, but they werenot pressed to a Division once my right hon. Friend and learnedFriend the Lord Chancellor undertook to consult extensively onthe details before any proposal to change the existing financialconditions were implemented. 
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the proposal in annexeA to the explanatory notes. The Government's proposal to changethe financial conditions for legal aid relating to any equitythat an applicant owns in his or her home. We intend the first&#163;100,000 of equity in a home to continue to be disregardedfor calculating eligibility, but to be counted in assessingcontributions. 
<P>
No contribution from capital tied up in a home will bepayable until after the end of the case, when costs liabilitiesare determined. My right hon. and learned Friend the LordChancellor made it clear that the Legal Services Commission willpostpone the payment of a contribution from such a source untilthe house is next sold, and not even then if doing so would causehardship to the assisted person. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Solicitor-General said that the money wouldnot be recovered until the house was sold. Will the money attractinterest, and, if so, at what rate? 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I should like to discuss the generalprinciple of our proposal before discussing that directly. Wetake the view that it is reasonable to ask people with assets inwhatever form to pay what they can afford, especially consideringthe possible effects on other people of taking legal action.Including the value of the assisted person's home in the calculation of contributions is important to ensure fairnessbetween people with capital in different forms. It will producesavings that can be used to pay for other things, such as ourproposals to increase eligibility for advice and assistance tothe same level as for representation. 
<P>
If the assisted person's house can be taken into account indeciding what contribution he or she should pay towards the helpthat he or she receives, it is only right that it should also betaken into account in deciding, if he or she loses, how much heor she should pay towards the other side's costs. As I said, theLord Chancellor will consult on how hardship should be definedfor the purpose of consultation. How interest will be definedwill also be subject to consultation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Given that the consultation process iscontinuing, I shall not press the amendment to a vote. However,I am slightly troubled by what I have heard. I was interested tohear the Solicitor-General describe a rather complex system forassessing hardship. All my experience suggests that complexsystems tend not to work very well and that administering themturns out to be rather costly. An entire bureaucratic nexus mustbe negotiated, whereas the principle involved in a system thatsimply exempts the home&#151;I accept that the argument that alevel might have to be imposed has some force&#151;seemssensible in the context of litigation. I hope that the Governmentwill consider that. With that caveat, I beg to ask leave towithdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Garnier to beg to ask leave towithdraw the amendment, as he moved it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I truly am a mover and a shaker, and beg to askleave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to takeGovernment amendments Nos. 12 to 14 and 16. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> These amendments are intended to define moreclearly the protection that a person assisted by the CommunityLegal Service is given from having to meet the costs of the otherside should the action that he or she brings with the help ofpublic funds be unsuccessful. 
<P>
Clause 12(1) will ensure that those receiving publicly fundedsupport are not deterred from proceeding with a legitimate claimby fear of possibly having to pay the costs of their opponentsif they are unsuccessful in proving their claim. I recall thaton Second Reading several hon. Members expressed concern at theextent to which those assisted by legal aid are protected fromhaving to pay the costs of their opponents should they beunsuccessful. There is necessarily a difficult balance to strikebetween limiting the right of the successful person to recoverthe legal costs incurred in prosecuting or defending a claim andthe real fear of the poorest that in bringing a valid claim theymight find themselves saddled with a debt that they will never be able to repay. 
<P>
Similarly, there is an equally difficult balance to strikein deciding when the Legal Services Commission, through theCommunity Legal Service fund, should meet any costs order onbehalf of those whom they fund. I fully understand that those whoare supported by the fund, with its considerable financialresources, and have to respond to an action brought against themlegitimately expect to have their costs paid. However, it wouldbe wrong to make the commission liable in every case to meetcosts orders when the assisted person is unable to pay costs. 
<P>
There will be a finite sum of public money available to thefund, whose first priority must be to bring help to people whowould otherwise be denied access to justice. Meeting costs orderswould necessarily deflect money away from that task. We thereforehave a judgement to make about whether it is better to meet costorders in every case, no matter what the financial status of theunassisted party, or whether we should limit the right to recovercosts from the fund in order to maximise the money available. 
<P>
I believe that the present test of severe financial hardshipis too strong, and I should like to see what I can do to ease thetest as part of a package of changes to financial conditions thatwe are considering. Clearly, there are people of limitedfinancial means who are still ineligible for legal aid but wouldsuffer disproportionately by having to meet their own legalcosts. We need to consider what the test should be to enableunassisted people to recover their legal costs. We have taken thefirst step towards that in the Bill by providing that the powerto grant protection will be contained in regulations rather thanset in stone in the form of primary legislation. That will allowus to match the protection with the understandable desires ofthose who successfully take or defend proceedings againstassisted people. 
<P>
The amendments to clause 12 seek to do two things. First,they provide a means by which the general protection afforded byclause 12(1) can be removed in prescribed circumstances. That isnecessary because, unlike the present legal aid scheme, the newcommission will fund cases in a range of different ways. Forexample, clause 7(3)(e) empowers the commission to provide helpby making a grant or a loan to individuals to enable them topurchase legal services for themselves as private litigants.Another option, proposed by the Legal Aid Board in paragraph6.20-21 of its draft funding code published in January, is toprovide limited litigation support funding for cases that areprincipally funded privately, probably under conditional feearrangements. It would be wrong if that created a situation inwhich the people helped in those ways were entitled to specialprotection from having to meet their opponents' costs. Clause12(1) as presently drafted would have that effect. 
<P>
Secondly, the amendments make it clear that when costsprotection applies, it does so for only so long as the commissiongives support. There are circumstances in which support from thecommission may not be provided until after litigation hascommenced, such as when someone's means change so that theybecome financially eligible for assistance. Similarly, supportmay be withdrawn because an individual is no longer eligiblefinancially, or the case no longer passes the requirements of thefunding code, but the assisted person nevertheless proceeds withthe case through some other means of funding. We want to be sure that the terms of the legislation make it clear that theprotection afforded to individuals receiving help is limited toonly those parts of proceedings for which they received help fromthe scheme. 
<P>
The final amendment ensures that regulations limiting theprotection available under clause 12(1) are made subject to theaffirmative resolution procedure. 
<P>
The amendments will provide us with the means to strike theright balance between ensuring that poor people are not deterredfrom bringing valid claims by fear of debt, and allowing thosewho have to respond to such claims some prospect of recovingtheir costs. What is more, the mechanisms are specificallydesigned to be flexible so that we can respond to changingcircumstances over time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> I welcome the Government'samendment to the clause. In the past, there has clearly beenenormous hardship. Such hardship was defined in the legislationand it was initially repeated in the Bill. I am not suggestingthat the Government should take out contingency insurance tocover a sponsored case being lost but, as the Minister hasindicated, there are cases of hardship. 
<P>
Many of us have a great deal of sympathy with insurancecompanies that are in the business of defending cases of personalinjury. They will have already gained some benefit by thelegislation, because personal injury claims have been taken outof legally aided work. People who are faced with a legal aidlitigant against them will find it much more amenable if theGovernment provide, within the regulations, rather less strictprocedures.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I shall be reasonably brief, because I want todiscuss the principle of the Criminal Defence Service under thestand part debate. 
<P>
Under amendment No. 79, we are trying to avoid anyunnecessary duplication in provision. The amendment states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission shall have a duty to ensure, afterconsultations with the Bar Council and The Law Society, that theCriminal Defence Service does not operate in any geographicalarea in which there already exists an adequate choice ofindependent legal practitioners qualified to represent theinterests of individuals involved in criminal investigations orcriminal proceedings and prepare to do so on legal aid.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If, in a given area, there are sufficient numbers of lawyersprepared to act for criminal defendants and they are ofsufficient quality, surely it is unnecessary to impose on thema Criminal Defence Service bureaucracy with all that thatimplies. 
<P>
The Government may not intend to do anything other than whatwe seek. I have done my best to understand what the Minister saidon Second Reading. It may be that he is in broad agreement withthe thrust of amendment No. 79, albeit that he may say that itis not necessary to have that expressly stated in the Bill. Ishall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say aboutthe dangers of duplication that we are highlighting in amendmentNo. 79. 
<P>
Given the way in which the Criminal Defence Service is beingintroduced, we believe that it would be sensible to have a12-month cooling-off period while the wisdom and good sense ofthat service is assessed. Amendment No. 82 would introduce pilotschemes for the Criminal Defence Service, covering fivegeographical areas of England and Wales. Had I thought about ita little further, it might have been more sensible for the pilotschemes to run across six geographical areas, which replicateexactly the circuits of the Bar of England and Wales. That wouldbe the Wales and Chester circuit, the Oxford and Midlandscircuit, the Northern circuit, the North-Eastern circuit, theSouth-Eastern circuit and the Western circuit. Those are readilyidentifiable areas that could comfortably serve as geographicalareas for the pilot scheme. 
<P>
Plenty could be said about the Criminal Defence Service, butI shall confine my remarks to those that I have already made. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have a few points to make about amendment No.82. I realise that the principal debate will take place on clausestand part, but I want to make it clear that we are against astate defender system. The state is rightly the prosecutor, butit should not be the defender as well. The defendant has the vastapparatus of the state arraigned against him or her. 
<P>
Clauses 15(7) and 15(9), to which the Minister referred 
earlier, are huge changes on which we are embarking at our peril.I support amendment No. 82 and believe that a pilot scheme shouldbe provided for, so that the consequences of setting up such ascheme can be gauged. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee longeither, Mr. O'Brien, but I want to reinforce the concerns thatI expressed on Second Reading. I am concerned about having apublic defender system, as were many Labour Members in anotherplace, led by Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws, whose speech Iquoted at length on Second Reading. I am surprised that theGovernment are making such a major amendment without firsttesting the water. 
<P>
Our amendment is valuable because it would be helpful to havea pilot scheme for a public defender system. I draw theMinister's attention to something that has been sent not only tome but to other members of the Committee about the experience ofthe public defender system in the United States of America. Itis an extract from a report about the system in New York by thedistinguished criminologist, Professor Mike McConville, whosename will be familiar to many of us. I remember his work guidingme when I studied criminology and penology back in the 1970s. Hehas produced a report with Professor Chester Mirsky, whichstates: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Indigent criminal defendants in state criminal cases inNew York City receive ineffective assistance from lawyers who,for largely systemic reasons, fail to provide competentadversarial representation. Those lawyers cannot fulfil theirresponsibility to their clients because those in control ofindigent defense want low-cost, efficient processing of criminaldefendants through guilty pleas and other non-trial dispositions.To achieve efficient processing of defendants (and tolegitimate''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I think that we would say ``legitimise''&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a system that fails constitutional and statutory mandatesto provide effective assistance of counsel), defense providersally themselves with courts, prosecutors, local government, andthe organized bar rather than with indigent defendants.'' 
<P>
</UL></FONT>I fear that the Government are opening a Pandora's box andthat, a few years down the road, Labour Members will be askingthemselves, ``Why on earth did we do this?'' I predicted onSecond Reading that the proposal would create far worse problemsthan those which were created initially by the Child SupportAgency. When they became apparent under the previous Government,I remember how concerned Labour Members, and, indeed, all Membersof Parliament, were about the problems resulting from that theCSA. The public defender system will be just as bad asthat&#151;if not worse&#151;and the Labour Government will liveto regret its introduction without any piloting or common sensebeing used, or having first tested the water. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 13 defines the broad scope of the CriminalDefence Service, which will replace criminal legal aid. AmendmentNo. 79 purports to deal with the use of salaried defenders andamendment No. 82 deals with pilots for salaried defenders. I wishto emphasise that the term ``Criminal Defence Service'' is notsynonymous with salaried defenders; each Conservative Member whohas spoken referred to it as if it were. It is not. It is alittle disappointing at this stage of the Bill's passage throughParliament that some of our opponents seem to be oblivious that fact, either through their failure to understand or in adeliberate attempt to mislead the public. 
<P>
Our intentions were set out clearly in the White Paper``Modernising Justice'', paragraph 6.11 of which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The new CDS scheme will cover all the main servicescurrently provided by criminal legal aid, includingrepresentation in court when this is in the interests of justice,and advice and assistance for suspects being questioned by thepolice. Change will focus on securing better quality and valuefor money, by developing more efficient ways of procuringservices&#151;contracting and directly employedlawyers&#151;and by streamlining the arrangements for grantingrepresentation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment clearly confuses the Criminal Defence Servicewith salaried defenders. For that reason alone, it must berejected. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> The Minister knows that Iasked questions about duty solicitor schemes in earlierproceedings. Will he level with the Committee and say whether thelast passage in his brief that he read out to us represents thedeath knell for duty solicitor schemes? Can he mark the day, thetime and the place when duty solicitor schemes will be doomed? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> We shall come to some of the provisions that willaffect duty solicitor schemes, but let me now make it clear thatI would be the first to agree with the hon. Member for Solihull(Mr. Taylor) that such schemes have been a considerable success.We anticipate that they will have a future, perhaps with therules somewhat tightened up compared with the presentarrangements. Nevertheless they have been a success and I am surethat they will continue to be so. However, I shall say more aboutthat in due course. 
<P>
Let me assume that the amendments were intended to deal withsalaried defenders rather than the Criminal Defence Service asa whole. When salaried defenders are made available, it is theGovernment's intention that members of the public will usuallyhave a choice between using a salaried defender or one of severalcontracted lawyers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I was interested to hear that members of thepublic will ``usually'' have a choice. On Second Reading, theSolicitor-General said that, yet when we picked up that point inthe Committee the Minister said, ``No, there will be a choice.You have misunderstood me''. Now we are back to the phrase``usually have a choice''. Which is it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There are lots of angels on the pinhead, but thismatter relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Solihull.Slots on a duty solicitor scheme will be filled; there is noreason why a salaried defender should not take a slot on a dutysolicitor scheme and enjoy the same rights and responsibilitiesas a private sector lawyer. The word ``usually'' was used becauseit affects in particular the successful operation of dutysolicitor schemes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I take the Minister's point that there will beprovision to fund private lawyers who will act for the CriminalDefence Service, but how many CDS employees, either back-up orfront-line lawyers, does he envisage? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I anticipate that there will more than at present.[
Interruption.] The hon. and learned Gentleman scoffs, butthat is not a glib answer. I have asked him several times&#151;he has consistently ducked the question&#151;whetherhe agrees in principle with the power to employ salarieddefenders directly, as we are providing. I again give him theopportunity of stating his opinion on that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I dare say that the Minister was so exhaustedby reading his speech on Second Reading that he did not stayawake long enough to listen to my speech. If he had, he wouldknow the answer. I refer him back to the Hansard report of thatdebate&#151;I shall again make my position clear in the standpart debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I look forward to that. The hon. Gentleman shouldalso explain why he is uncomfortable about giving me a directanswer to a fairly direct question. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Could we concentrate on the amendment? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Yes, Mr. O'Brien, but our discussion was much moreentertaining. 
<P>
Charitably, I shall assume that the Opposition intended todeal with salaried defenders rather than with the entirety of theCDS. There will be consultation on how salaried defenders shouldbe introduced, and various discussions on how we introducegeographical and subject areas in which salaried defenders mightbe particularly effective and on how appropriate pilots might beconstructed. The Legal Services Commission will establish pilotprojects to test and evaluate the provision of a salarieddefenders service in several ways. 
<P>
To that extent, I am sympathetic to the intention behindamendment No. 82; we intend to pilot the provision of serviceson several different models. There are also several options forfunding and administering salaried services within a mixedsystem; we could hire staff lawyers directly employed by thecommission or ensure that lawyers employed by a non-profit makingorganisation, perhaps run as a law centre, are paid a governmentgrant in respect of their salaries. 
<P>
I accept that such projects need to be piloted and testedover a sustained period. Second and subsequent pilot projectscould be established, building on earlier experience or testingfurther options. Such an approach will provide a sound basis fora strategic expansion that will have been properly tested; bestpractice methods will have been adopted. A measured introductionof a mixed system with salaried and private services operatingalongside each other would allow salaried defenders to becomepart of the Criminal Defence Service culture. The pilots willestablish which methods of operation are most beneficial, andidentify best practice. Pilots in different geographical areasare likely to be part of that arrangement, but the pilots willbe far wider. I cannot therefore accept amendment No. 82, as itwould set down a duty to conduct pilots that would be far morelimited than those we intend to conduct. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Little by little we extract information from theGovernment and begin to make sense of the Minister's views, ifnot his policies. In the light of the glimpse he has given us ofhis views on amendments Nos. 79 and 82, I beg to ask leave towithdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 10, line14, at end insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) The Commission shall have a duty to ensure that thoseemployed in the Criminal Defence Service shall 
professionally independent and that that independence in theconduct of criminal investigations or criminal proceedings shallnot be impaired in any way.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We seek to ensure that the provisions of clause 16,subsection (2) of which allows for the construction of a code,will contain the duties set out in amendment No. 80. We hope thatadvocates instructed by the Criminal Defence Service and thosedirectly employed by it will behave themselves in a proper andprofessional way. However, we are concerned that the service'sdirect employees will not have the same professional duties asthose imposed on professional solicitor and barrister advocates. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have a little anxiety, which I wish toshare with the Committee. The independent practitioner has along-standing code of ethics, which means that his duty isultimately to the court and to justice. We all know that the mostimprobable defences often turn out to be sound. The contraryposition, however, worries me. The employed defence lawyer maybe set performance targets by his employer. They may be quitestraightforward, such as having to reply to all letters within18 days of receipt; or they may be slightly more insidious andmay be to do with what, in other places, would be calledproductivity. 
<P>
How can one mention productivity to an employed lawyer who,by the chance of events, has had a series of complicated,difficult cases, in the early stages of which the defendants wereall entitled to the benefit of the doubt? Perhaps I am thinkingaloud to the Committee, and I shall not press the Minister toreply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Will my hon. Friend make a prediction that,within two or three years, a number of people will come forwardand say, ``I pleaded guilty only because pressure was put on meby the state-run system to do so for reasons of efficiency''?[
Interruption.] Indeed, people will be urged to plead guiltywho would not now do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Yes, I think so. My hearing acuity is such thatI heard certain sedentary interventions from Labour Members, whosaid that that happens now. I do not take exception to thoseinterventions, and I am glad that I heard them. Yes, it canhappen now, but the situation of the state-employed defenderintroduces a new dimension. In my practising days, I would urgea defendant to change a plea to guilty only if, on reflection andafter a long discussion with him, he had no defence at all.[
Interruption.] Labour Members may be chuckling at me or atsome self-generated source of amusement, but I invite theCommittee to consider the position of the employed lawyer who isset performance and productivity targets by his employer. Thatputs pressure on that lawyer to which there is no identifiablecontemporary equivalent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman expect us to believethat lawyers who are employed by law firms in private practiceare not set similar targets for profitability, whether theypractice in the civil or the criminal courts? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> For 22 years, I was an employed lawyer or anemploying lawyer in the private sector. I never encountered sucha situation. I neither would have accepted it myself, nor did Iimpose it on my employees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in private practice the target that employed lawyers face isfinancial? Sometimes such targets can be achieved only bypleading not guilty, and changing the plea to guilty at the lastmoment. Under the present scheme, those are the most profitablecases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I think that that is an abuse of process in manyways, and I have never condoned it. I always speak very stronglyagainst it. Pleading not guilty before the magistrates, runningthe case along, taking depositions, interviewing witnesses,requesting a few adjournments, taking the case to the Crown courtand then changing the plea is a very serious abuse. I criticiseit as strongly I possibly can. 
<P>
That practice is an abuse of jurors' time, the legal aidsystem and court time, and it plays hell with listing, which isnot an administrative function but a judicial one. It isabsolutely abominable. Part of me thinks that those who are shownto have cynically manipulated the system in that way should bestruck off. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye began his interventionby asking me about financial targets. Even when I wasself-employed, I used to set myself financial targets, but I didnot achieve them by economising; I frequently did so by workingon Saturdays and Sundays, but that was my own free will. I choseto do so to meet my targets. 
<P>
[Mr. Peter Atkinson in the Chair.] 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This group of amendments deals with thereintroduction of salaried defenders to the Bill. I shall beginwith amendment No. 80, which relates to ethics and independencefrom state control. This unnecessary amendment adds nothing tothe substantial safeguards that are already in place. Thosesafeguards will, if anything, exceed those which apply tobarristers or solicitors seeking to make a living in privatepractice. 
<P>
Salaried defenders will have a tailored code of practiceunder clause 16. They will have statutory duties to the court andto comply with professional rules of conduct under clause 37.Those duties will take precedence over any other civil lawobligation that advocates or litigators may have, including anyobligation to their employers. They will have a secure salary anda pension. They will not face the need to turn a profit case bycase, and they will enjoy protection from unfair dismissal. Thatmakes amendment No. 80 unnecessary. Any salaried defenderemployed by the Legal Services Commission will be responsible toa legally qualified supervisor. 
<P>
The Opposition have advanced the argument that career andpromotional needs and office politics will somehow preventsalaried defenders from fearlessly representing their clients.That argument simply does not stand up to scrutiny. Crownprosecutors and salaried defenders will work for differentorganisations. The charge of collusion is hardly ever heard whentwo barristers from the same chambers appear on opposite sidesin the same case. That charge is made from time to time, but inmy experience it is never made out. In one sense, nearly alllawyers defending under the present scheme are funded bygovernment, through the exising legal aid arrangements. 
<P>
The assumption that lawyers in private practice are entirelyfree from any pressures that might conceivably threaten theirprofessional ethics is not well founded. I shall give the 
Committee a few examples. A solicitor-partner has the pressureof the balance sheet. Salaried solicitors in private firms havethe pressure of the time sheet and the need to impress thepartners and retain valued clients. Barristers in privatepractice need to ensure that they are briefed to appear insubsequent cases&#151;their livelihood depends on it. 
<P>
Anyone who has appeared on behalf of the prosecution, as Ihave done, knows that the judgment made by those instructeddepends on the performance that a junior member of the Bar giveson behalf of the prosecution. All lawyers face such pressures,and it is ridiculous to assume that we apply different standardsto public defenders from those that we apply to those operatingunder the existing system. 
<P>
Many lawyers&#151;solicitors and barristers&#151;arelargely dependent on state funding, through legal aid orprosecution work, for their financial survival. It is the ethicsof the profession, backed up by vigilant judges, that ensuresthat the highest standards are maintained. 
<P>
I shall now deal with Government amendments Nos. 22 to 25,with which we shall reintroduce salaried defenders to the Bill.Such matters have been debated extensively in another place. Letme state clearly that consultation will take place on howsalaried defenders should be introduced. Following thatconsultation, the Legal Services Commission will establish pilotprojects to test and evaluate providing salaried defenderservices in a variety of ways. 
<P>
It is clear from the academic literature that salariedservices operating in mixed systems, in which services aresupplied by both salaried and private lawyers, appear to be themost successful. There are many different methods of providingmixed systems, with some especially good examples in Canada,which has more than 20 years' experience of them. In Scotland,a Public Defence Solicitor's Office was established as a pilotproject from 1 October 1998. It is based at a single office inEdinburgh, and employs a maximum of six solicitors. Initialreports about the Scottish pilot have been favourable. Althoughit allocates defendants to the Public Defence Solicitor's Office,a significant proportion&#151;about 20 per cent.&#151;ofclients choose to use it. 
<P>
Different good and not-so-good points emerge from differentschemes, and no one country's scheme could be held to be thebest. We shall utilise the best practice from different modelsto meet the particular needs of England and Wales.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am interested in what the Minister hasto say about the Scottish experience, because I must say, in thename of fair play, that it is at least consistent with some movestowards piloting. Any other country's experience must bevaluable, unless we are so arrogant as to think that no othercountry's experience counts. Could the office in Edinburgh billclients who had come to its door voluntarily, independent ofallocation? Did it send them bills to charge for the work thatit had done? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There are very few cases in the entire UnitedKingdom in which people are charged personally for therepresentation that they enjoy in criminal cases. As the hon.Gentleman knows, when operating under legal aid, it is unusualfor someone's means to be such that they are not eligible forcriminal legal aid under the existing scheme. It is therefore unlikely that there would be a need to charge anyone who choseto be represented by the public defender in the Scottish pilot. 
<P>
Hon. Members given various examples from other jurisdictions.The hon. Member for Surrey Heath&#151;who I keep thinkingrepresents Blackpool, although I realise that Surrey Heath is along way from Blackpool&#151;referred to New York. In New York,people who are arrested and brought before a court want to berepresented by a public defender rather than the private sector,because it is recognised that the public defender has a muchbetter range of services available than those operating inprivate practice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister has touched on a point that causesme particular anxiety. The device of using the Criminal DefenceService salaried defenders scheme will give advantages in termsof the service that will be provided over and above that offeredby a private provider. It will introduce a bias that willencourage people to use the system, which, as a matter of ethics,I consider to be wrong. I merely want to make the position clear.I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is no reasonwhy there should be an advantage in terms of quality of servicein going to the public defender's scheme and the salariedemployee over using a solicitor. However, it is suggested thatin New York such an advantage exists. I am sure that the Ministerwould deplore that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I would not deplore it, because I do not have anyresponsibility for the public defender scheme in New York. I usedit merely as an illustration to demonstrate that there is noparticular virtue in any one method of funding. In somejurisdictions, the public defender may be less attractive to andeffective for a potential defendant than using the privatesector. Equally, in some jurisdictions, the reverse is true. Allthat we are doing through the provisions is trying to give anopportunity for choice and diversity. I therefore do notunderstand Opposition Members' insistence that the problem hasonly one solution. Experience from several jurisdictions,including some in the Commonwealth, suggests that such a mixedapproach is much more sensible. 
<P>
The defining characteristic is adequate funding. Academicresearch into the operation of public defender schemes shows thatthey depend on appropriate funding. However, that is also trueof schemes that purchase services from the private sector. Mostof the schemes that have been criticised are not underpinned bythe sort of statutory framework proposed in the Bill. Thatunderpinning, which includes an obligation for the LordChancellor to fund the Criminal Defence Service in its privateand directly employed elements, will ensure the provision ofquality services that suspects and defendants require. 
<P>
The Government are determined that salaried defenders shouldset the highest ethical and professional standards. They willgive the public a wider choice of representative, provide theGovernment with the means to assess value for money provided bycriminal defence services generally, increase the commission'sflexibility in the provision of criminal defence services andprovide a competitive stimulus to lawyers in private practice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I trust that Labour Members enjoyed a shortbreak before the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) beganensuring that their voice-boxes were well primed to defend theGovernment's draconian measures. I shall not spend much timeresponding to the Minister's remarks on Government amendmentsNos. 22 to 25, other than to say that they were deeplyunconvincing. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 10, line15, leave out subsection (2). 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to takeGovernment amendments Nos. 20 and 21. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments are intended to clarify whatservices are to be funded under the Criminal Defence Servicescheme, which will replace the existing criminal legal aidscheme. The new scheme will cover all the main services currentlyprovided by criminal legal aid, including representation in courtif it is in the interests of justice and advice and assistancefor suspects being questioned by the police. In future, salarieddefenders and lawyers in private practice who are under contractwill provide most publicly funded criminal defence services ina mixed system. 
<P>
It will take time to introduce and develop the new system.Meanwhile, if contracts have not yet been introduced or ifsalaried defenders' offices are not yet established,representation will continue to be provided in much the same wayas under the current arrangements. In other words, lawyers willbe paid case by case at standard fees or at rates set by the LordChancellor. There will be no big bang approach once the Bill isenacted. The Legal Aid Board has begun piloting contractingarrangements in the youth court, and it has a timetable togradually extend contracting over the next few years, as theCriminal Defence Service is established. 
<P>
Proposals, which will be subject to consultation with theprofessions and leading academic commentators, are beingdeveloped, and a number of models of providing services toemployed lawyers will be piloted and evaluated. Clauses 14 and15 define the services, and the Criminal Defence Service will beunder a duty to fund them. However, as presently drafted, theBill would lead one to conclude that a distinction could be drawnbetween services that must be funded under clauses 14 and 15 andother criminal defence services that might be funded. TheGovernment's intentions are clarified in amendment No. 20.Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 are consequential drafting amendmentsrelating to the definition of criminal investigations.

In essence, the group of amendments requires the Governmentto respond in a way that shows that they have got their headsround the economic questions involved with setting up a newquangocracy. The Minister was unable to tell me, before our shortadjournment, the number of people that the CDS would employ otherthan that it would be more than nought. That was notilluminating; indeed, the Minister must admit that it was a glib 
answer&#151;although he said that he did not intend it to be. 
<P>
I want to require the Government to detail, before the Billis enacted, the sums that have and will be spent and to set outin comparative terms the quality of service, value for money andother financial factors of the new system, to help the publicdecide whether the Government's intentions will be well served.There is considerable doubt about that and nothing that theGovernment have said, in Committee, on Second Reading or in theother place, about the costs of the CDS have alleviated thatdoubt. At the very least, the Government should give us anoutline of the costs.

<P>

<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): Will the hon. andlearned Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yes, I am delighted to welcome the hon.Gentleman to the debate. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give anestimate of the cost of the Audit Commission's quality audit ofthe whole service, which will compare it with the quality ofservice provided by legal aided criminal practitioners? I am surethat he knows that the Audit Commission is undertaking what manypeople consider a very expensive attempt to develop quality auditmeasures in local government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> No, of course I cannot say how much that AuditCommission exercise will cost. It will depend on how much timeit needs to work through the treacle that the Government propose.I take it that the hon. Gentleman is addressing amendment No. 84;candidly, I cannot answer the question. However, the Governmentshould be able to answer the questions that lie behind amendmentsNos. 83, 84 and 85 and I look forward to the Minister's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There is nothing much wrong with the amendments,except that they fail to appreciate the systems already placedin the Bill which will provide information about the cost andprovision of the Criminal Defence Service, and that they fail tounderstand the role of the Audit Commission, the structure of theBill or what is meant by the CDS. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 83 and 85 refer to the CDS operating withcriminal legal aid, which will not happen. The CDS will provideall criminal legal services; there will not be a separate systemto compare it with. 
<P>
The cost of providing criminal legal aid is currentlypublished each year in the departmental report, and the cost ofaspects of the scheme administered by the Legal Aid Board arepublished in its annual report. Under the provisions of schedule1, as drafted, the Legal Services Commission will set out in itsannual plan how it intends to fund criminal defence services overeach forthcoming year. The commission will report annually on howit has funded those services over the previous year. The annualplan and annual report will provide information about spendingon all criminal defence services. All that information willtherefore be found in one place for the first time. In addition,the Government will, as now, publish our spending plans threeyearly in advance. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 would introduce requirements forreports to be produced by the Audit Commission. As I have alreadysuggested, the information that would be contained in thosereports is published now and will continue to be published underthe provisions of the Bill. In any event, the Audit Commissionwould not be the approprite body to produce such reports.
Paragraph 16 of schedule 1 provides that the accounts of thecommission will be audited by the National Audit Office, whichis the appropriate body to audit central Government expenditure.The Audit Commission will have no role in auditing or reportingon the funds administered by the Legal Services Commission. 
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 83 and 84 seem to be intended toapply to only the Criminal Defence Service. However, they bothrefer to ``sections 13 to 23'', but clauses 19 to 23 cover boththe CDS and the Community Legal Service. 
<P>
Given those observations, it is clear that the changes wouldbe unnecessary and misplaced. I therefore invite the hon. andlearned Member for Harborough to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I shall withdraw it; I said at the outset thatthe amendments were probing amendments, as the Minister no doubtheard. I would take his criticisms a little more easily if Ithought that he had considered what he read out before he did soand that it was not simply the work of his industrious civilservants. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> A bit like the hon. and learned Gentleman'spressure group briefings. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is making whatare called sedentary interventions, and the Chair may find themless than illuminating. However, I beg to ask leave to withdrawthe amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand partof the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As our deliberations on clause 13 and theamendments relating to it began, I made it clear that it was theclause stand part debate that was important. It deals with thewhole principle of whether there should be a Criminal DefenceService at all. The proposal in the Bill for a so-called publicdefender service has come&#151;this is our criticism, and it iswidely shared&#151;out of the blue, with no public demand, nocall from the legal professions, no recommendation or otherconsideration by a royal commission, and certainly no priordiscussion with the Bar Council, the Law Society or other bodiessuch as Liberty and Justice. I urge the Committee to considerwhether such a service is necessary or even desirable. 
<P>
We have heard again today that there will be a salarieddefence service under the proposals but that the Minister has noidea how many people will be employed by it or what it will cost.In due course, I dare say that the Government will condescend toprovide us with such information. Meanwhile, it is entirelylegitimate for those of us in opposition to attempt to persuadethem to be a little more candid about their policies or views. 
<P>
There were four arguments broadly made in favour of theCriminal Defence Service or public defender service. The firstwas made by the Lord Chancellor on Second Reading on 14 December1998. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman may haveunconsciously strayed into error again. I repeat the fact thatthe Criminal Defence Service is intended to replace the totalityof defence services funded by Government. It is therefore not asubstitute for the phrases ``public defender'' or ``salarieddefender''. A salaried defender system will be part of thetotality of the CDS. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I fully accept what the Minister said; he has said it on several occasions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman has not beenlistening. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is boredbeing a Minister, bored with the Bill and bored with discussingsomething that is of considerable importance to the people ofthis country. He can sit in Committee giggling his backoff&#151;for all I care&#151;but I want to put forward onbehalf of the people of this country some views that he may finddisagreeable, but which have a perfect right to be heard. 
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that he will be introducing a publicdefender service, some of whose members will be employed and someof whom will be drawn from the ranks of the private profession.That is fair enough, but the fact remains that there will be anemployed public defender system, and the Government must explainthemselves. [
Interruption.] Mr. Atkinson, I do not oftenappeal for protection from the Chair, but if the hon. Member forHendon has something useful to say, I shall be delighted toaccept an intervention. However, if he has not, perhaps he willgo home to Hendon and tell his constituents that he voted againstclause 1 and against the humane provisions that we have soughtto introduce into the Bill. Other than that, he might like to sitquietly and perhaps he might learn something. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I doubt it&#151;not from the hon. and learnedGentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On Second Reading in the other place, the LordChancellor said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The state, in the public interest, takes accused peopleto the criminal courts, where they may be deprived of theirliberty. So it is right that the state should provide highquality defence services to those who cannot afford to purchasedefence services for themselves.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is right that the state should provide resources forrepresentation through the provision of legal aid. But why is itright for the state to choose the representative, as is proposedunder the Bill? What person charged with a crime will trust thestate if it chooses the prosecutor and the defender, as well asthe judge? On Second Reading and earlier today, my hon. Friendthe Member for Beaconsfield drew the attention of both theMinister and the Solicitor-General to the use of language, whichmakes that question all the more pertinent. 
<P>
Let us consider a problem that will arise: under the CriminalProcedure and Investigations Act 1996, the state says thatsensitive material should be withheld if it does not underminethe prosecution or assist the defence. In her Bar conferencespeech on 3 October 1998, Miss Heather Hallett, as she then was,said that there were several examples of how the CrownProsecution Service treated the matter. First, the names andaddresses of independent eye witnesses were withheld because suchdetails 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would not assist the defence''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
She then gave an example of the first description of anassailant not being revealed when it was inconsistent with laterdescriptions because it would undermine the prosecution case.Another example was of a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer whoendorsed police disclosure with the words: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have neither seen nor inspected these items but have
no reason to believe that they undermine the Crown's case.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Heather Hallett's fourth example was that of 17 writtenstatements being disclosed one week before the trial, one ofwhich was of an independent witness of good character whosupported the defence and became a defence witness at the trial.Her fifth example was of covert surveillance tapes when thedefendant's cohabitee said things that were totally inconsistentwith an earlier written statement, and which were not disclosedto the defence until the independent prosecutor found out aboutthem. 
<P>
The sixth example was the case of a mother charged withcausing grievous bodily harm to her young child and whose defencewas accident. ``Sensitive material'' contained an audio tape ofher 999 call to the ambulance service; it was not released to thedefence because 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the words and demeanour of the defendant support her claimto accidental injury . . . and might undermine the Prosecutioncase.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If the state's lawyers can behave so wrongly when prosecutingand the rules are clear, what confidence can we have that therights of the citizen accused of a crime will be properlyprotected by defence lawyers provided by the state? If any memberof the Committee is fussed about what I am saying, may I make itclear that I heard what the Minister said about not all lawyerswho are employed by the CDS being state employees. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor also said on Second Reading in the otherplace that the CDS 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will ensure that those who appear before our courts andrisk imprisonment receive high quality legal defence services .. . there has not previously been a general asssurance for thoseusing criminal legal aid that services provided will be of goodquality.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He went on to say that salaried defenders will 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``enable the criminal defence service to fill in gaps inprovision and to provide a cost and quality benchmark againstwhich the private sector can be compared.''&#151;[OfficialReport, House of Lords, 14 December 1998; Vol. 595, c. 1112.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Criminal practitioners may ask what gaps in the provison theLord Chancellor has in mind, or what reason he has for believingthat the Criminal Defence Service will achieve those ends. Ouronly experience of a state legal service is the Crown ProsecutionService, which has been operating since 1985&#151;long enoughto have overcome any teething troubles. Sadly, that institution,which we were promised would achieve higher quality in theconduct of prosecutions, has too often been criticised forunderstaffing, over-heavy work loads, absence from court,inadequate instructions to counsel, inexperience andincompetence.

<P>

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> As I have a responsibility for theCPS, I should reply to some of the points being made. When wecame to power, we immediately set up a review of the CPS. Weappointed Lord Justice Glidewell. We are now in the process ofimplementing recommendations that were made in the Glidewellreport. Under the previous Government, some of the criticismsthat the hon. and learned Gentleman makes might have a certaintruth to them, but since we came to power we have made strongefforts to get the CPS right. 
<P>
As Lord Justice Glidewell said, the CPS is a professional service and its officials are on the whole competent,professionally motivated and doing a very good job. I ask thehon. and learned Gentleman to consider carefully the criticismthat he is making of the professionalism of members of the CPS. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I have considered carefully what I am saying.I say it from my experience not only as someone who has observedthe CPS politically but someone who sits as an assistantrecorder, before whom people instructed by the CPS appear. 
<P>
Given that CPS lawyers will have rights of audience in thehigher courts under the Bill and given the need to recruit evenmore lawyers to do that work, from what pool will CriminalDefence Service lawyers be selected? Will the CDS attract mainlythe young and inexperienced to cut their teeth on the unfortunatedefendants allocated to them? How many of them will have left theindependent Bar less for the challenge and more for the steadywork and regular hours, with paid statutory holidays, pensionsand other salaried benefits? Can all that guarantee defendantshigher quality than is available now? If so, where is theevidence? So far we have heard none of it. 
<P>
The third reason put forward in support of the CriminalDefence Service is that a public defender service operatessuccessfully in other jurisdictions. We heard little about thatfrom either the Minister or the Solicitor-General earlier. Noevidence is ever provided that such services are successful, butmuch anecdotal evidence to the contrary exists. In the UnitedStates, there are widespread reports of inexperienced lawyers andplea bargaining on a massive scale, with cosy arrangementsbetween state employees in the prosecution and the defence todispose of cases quickly for the system's sake. I drew attentionto that on Second Reading. I also drew attention to the remarksof Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws, who said in the House of Lordson 14 December 1998 that the idea of introducing a criminalpublic defender system into Britain filled her with great alarm.She had direct experience of the public defender system in theUnited States and had seen it in action. She had a friend workingwithin that system&#151;a young black lawyer, working inWashington, who was handling cases which no lawyer of his age andexperience should handle. She had seen the pressure that that puthim under. That talented, brilliant young laywer had spoken ofhis desire to have a legal aid system like ours operating there. 
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, the thrust of what BaronessKennedy said was echoed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Courtof the United States, who has said that we would be mad tointroduce the public defender system that they have in the UnitedStates. 
<P>
The fourth reason advanced in support of the Criminal DefenceService is that it will be cheaper for the taxpayer to have apublic defender service because the lawyers' being salaried andthe turnover of work being high will lower the cost of each case.Again, in case the Minister becomes over-excited, I fully acceptthat not all those that the CDS instructs will be salariedlawyers, but an increasing number will be&#151;albeit that theMinister has no idea how many. No Minister has said that thepublic defender system would be cheaper, because it would beunacceptable to say that one of the main reasons for the proposalwas to provide cut-price justice. However, those involved ingovernment will know that many of the radical changes made to thetraditional way of doing things were Treasury driven. We should, not be surprised that the Bill is such a change. 
<P>
It is obvious that no significant savings will accrue to thepublic purse and that Ministers are shy of the cheap justiceslur, so discussion on the matter will be limited. That doubtlessexplains why no Green Paper was published; why the White Paper,for more restricted discussion, was published only one day beforethe Bill was published; and why the Bill was introduced in theother place only 12 days after that. 
<P>
The bodies most immediately involved, the Bar Council and theLaw Society, were not consulted, as Miss Heather Hallett pointedout in a letter to The Times on 5 December 1998. Furthermore,although there is a pilot scheme in Scotland, where legal aid issufficiently different to make the pilot scheme of limited value,England and Wales will have no pilot scheme. We cannot get togrips with it now, while we are debating the Bill. 
<P>
Not so long ago, the Minister said that he was enthused bya pilot scheme, but we have yet to hear the details of it.Certainly, before this afternoon, we have heard nothing from theMinister or the Solicitor-General about a pilot scheme. Thisfundamental change to our system is being rushed into operationas quickly as possible. 
<P>
I submit that those four arguments are weak. Four inherentlystrong arguments can be made against a public defender. First,for the state to control the defence of those charged with crimeby the state is contrary to the principle of unbiased justice,upon which our criminal justice system is founded. Injustice islikely to follow. In his speech on Second Reading in the otherplace, Lord Hutchinson said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As the independence of the prosecutor is swept away,there emerges . . . what I would call the sinister figure of thesalaried state defender, paid, selected and controlled by thestate. That fine warrior is to be sent out to do battle on thefield of liberty and human rights, with his opposite member, hislocal colleague in arms, the salaried state prosecutor&#151;anall-state contest. As many others have long predicted, introducea state prosecutor and the state defender follows as nightfollows day&#151;the dark night of dependence andcontrol''.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 December1998; Vol. 595, c. 1149.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those were the words of a distinguished jurist, and they werenot adequately answered by the Lord Chancellor. I look forwardto hearing the Minister's response to that attack. 
<P>
The second argument against the setting up of the criminaldefence service is to be taken from Miss Hallett's speech as Barchairman, given on 3 October 1998. She said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whatever the financial pressures upon a self-employedpractitioner hungry for the next brief, there can be nocomparison with the pressures which can be exerted upon a lawyerby their employer or by the circumstances of theiremployment.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
A young lawyer employed by a local authority might be fearfulof upsetting his employer and losing his job, with all itssecurity for his family. Could a state employee therefore betrusted always to try hard to win against the state, which is hisemployer? His efforts might go against him if he seeks promotion. 
<P>
Those who work for large organisations are encourage to thinkof themselves as part of a team. Bonding activities have becomepart of the new ethos&#151;I am sure that that happens in little , gymnasiums in such places as Millbank. The temptation would befor cosy relationships to develop between the various prosecutingagencies, and for a culture of negotiated justice with pleabargaining behind closed doors to spring up. Baroness Kennedydrew attention to that on Second Reading, and it is preciselywhat I am drawing to the Committee's attention this evening. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> It puzzles me that the hon. andlearned Gentleman should suggest that junior members of the Baror solicitors would be embarrassed to challenge those to whomthey owed their jobs. He is a part-time recorder, yet he feelsinhibited in criticising the Lord Chancellor. If he is notinhibited, why should others be? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My role as an assistant recorder requires me topay attention to the interests of justice. It does not requireme to pay any attention whatever to the Lord Chancellor, eventhough he is the political head of the Department in charge ofthe Bill. I was speaking about employed, salaried lawyers in theCriminal Defence Service. If the hon. Gentleman believes thatthey will not be affected by promotional and other needs, he ismore naive than I gave him credit for earlier. 
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> It occurs to me that the hon. Member for Hendon,who is yet again whispering and giggling, has obviously dined notwisely but too well. If he has anything serious to say, we shalldoubtless hear it. Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that theconcerns expressed by Heather Hallett and Baroness Kennedy arematters of great seriousness? If Labour Members could be seen bytheir constituents, their after-dinner behaviour would beregarded as a disgrace. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I could not agree more. Although Labour Membersmay find the subject amusing or tedious, the Opposition are veryconcerned about the principle behind the setting up of theCriminal Defence Service. I hope that the Minister is nowsatisfied with my answer to his question. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for SouthDerbyshire, who is a little sceptical of the Government'spolicies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman. I want toknow exactly what the problem is. Is he saying, per se, thatpeople who receive payment from the state would lose theirobjectivity on receipt of the cash? The judiciary's salaries areset by the state, and judges receive money from the state fortheir services. Many other bodies on which we rely receive statefunding; they are expected to exercise a critical role. The hon.and learned Gentleman recommended that the Audit Commissionshould do a variety of tasks on his behalf&#151;again, fundedentirely by the state. I am not clear about the coherence of theargument.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In saying that the judiciary are employees ofthe state, the hon. Gentleman makes a false point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I did not say that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I rather think that the hon. Gentleman did. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I said that they received money from the state. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman rely on that todemonstrate that judges are incapable of acting dispassionatelyand in line with their judicial oath? If so, he should study thework of Her Majesty's judges. More particularly, I advise him to , study Hansard, and read the Second Reading and Committee debatesin the other place, of which a number of judges and retiredjudges are Members. He will see that when the Lord Chancellor putthat point to them he was cut off at the knees. 
<P>
I shall not insult the hon. Member for South Derbyshire, forwhom I have increasing regard. Unlike many other Labour Members,he is not prepared to be spoon fed. I am delighted to see thathe is engaging in our debates. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he waskeen to set on record his position of principle. He inadvertentlyreferred once again to the Criminal Defence Service; I take itthat he is not opposed in principle to the establishment of thatservice. If he is not opposed to it in principle, is he opposedin principle to the proposition that such a service should beable to employ lawyers directly? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The legal aid system already employs lawyers inprivate practice. I freely admit that they are technically paidby the state. However, I object to the fact that legal servicesfor defence purposes should be provided by a salariedbody&#151;a body that is the mirror image of the CrownProsecution Service. That is the wrong to which I address myremarks. 
<P>
I fully accept that the legal aid system presently pays outfrom the state's purse&#151;from the taxpayers&#151;the moneyto pay independent lawyers to represent defendants. We object tothe creation of a salaried defence service. Although he does notknow the cost, the Minister cannot deny that the intention of theclause is to establish a body called the Criminal DefenceService, part of which will comprise lawyers employed, inessence, by his Department. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I reiterate what I understand to be the hon. andlearned Gentleman's position. He is in principle opposed to theidea that public money be used to employ people who would defendalleged criminals in court. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> No, that is not my vision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Well, is the hon. and learned Gentleman opposed tothe idea that public money be used to employ on salaries thosewho would represent people alleged to have committed criminaloffences? If so, as he speaks on behalf of the Conservativeparty, is he prepared to say whether that is and always has beenthe position of the party that he represents and for which hespeaks? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am discussing clause 13. I am quite preparedto repeat what I have said on several occasions. I accept thatthe state has a duty to assist people who cannot afford to payfor their own lawyer by employing lawyers as it now does throughthe legal aid system. However, I object to and am arguing againstthe creation of a service equivalent to the Crown ProsecutionService&#151;a salaried civil service designed increasingly totake over the role of the independent lawyer, which will have allthe defects and deficiencies to which I have referred. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I have a query founded in genuine puzzlement.I can accept that the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying thatlawyers as a species are so weak that were they to receive asalary from the state they would inevitably be subordinated, butis he making a general statement of principle about publicservants? Public servants such as housing aid workers, socialworkers, volunteer co-ordinators and environmental health officers in effect receive a salary from the state&#151;in thiscase, local authorities&#151;but, generally speaking, actindependently. Are lawyers a species apart, or is he making ageneral statement that no one in public service should be in aposition such as that which he suggests is not appropriate forthose working for a public defence service? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> After a much-welcomed silence following hisconduct last week, I rather fear that the hon. Gentleman hasentirely missed the point. If he does not know the differencebetween someone who acts on behalf of a defendant who risks hisliberty or his reputation, and a housing worker, we are in arather parlous state. If the Government want to support theclause with such arguments, we are in an even worse position thanI originally thought. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Is the hon. and learned Gentleman setting out hisparty's views or its policy? If he is setting out its policy,when since July 1996 did it change? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am setting out my arguments against theclause. If the Minister thinks that I shall be in government nextweek, I am grateful to him. However, as I understand it, we areunlikely to be back in government much before the Bill receivesRoyal Assent. Therefore, although his questions would perhaps beuseful in a fourth-form debate, they are not terribly helpful ina proper discussion of the clause. He made a witty point, but nota terribly useful one. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As long as the hon. Gentleman can assure me thathe does not need the handouts that the Minister and his team arenow distributing. I am not sure that the Committee'sdeliberations are much enhanced by the Government's raft of civilservants passing out little crib sheets, especially to the hon.Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), a noted independentthinker. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I always write my ownwords rather than read out other people's. I refer to theargument of my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr.Whitehead). A law centre is often funded primarily by the localauthority and frequently finds itself in conflict with the localauthority on cases covering such matters as judicial review andhousing, often in deeply confrontational political circumstances.Does the hon. and learned Member for Harborough expect us tobelieve that the lawyers who are employed in such law centres arenot doing an efficient, proper, objective and highly professionaljob? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman may write his own words. Icongratulate him on that&#151;he is a very clever chap. However,he does not seem to understand the distinction between anindependent lawyer working in a law centre or a citizens' advicebureau and the creature who is employed by the same organisationthat will be prosecuting the defendant. [
Interruption]. Thehon. Member for Hendon and the Minister may not agree with myremarks. Perhaps they think it is of no consequence that peopleshould be prosecuted and defended by the same Government-fundedorganisations. That is a perfectly legitimate point. That policyexisted in the Soviet Union, where those who prosecuted anddefended were paid by the Government. That was perfectly proper;they were employees and salaried workers of the same Government. 
<P>
I accept that there may be a distinction in principle that the Government wish to explore, but on behalf of the Opposition,I am setting out my objections about the way in which theCriminal Defence Service is being set up and about how the matterhas been introduced in the Bill. I am happy to do that for a goodwhile yet. 
<P>
My third point refers to the principle that anyone who ischarged with a criminal offence is free to choose any practisingbarrister or solicitor of the highest quality and reputation torepresent him. That right to choose is accorded to a defendantby article 6 of the European convention on human rights, whichis already part of our law. If the Criminal Defence Serviceexpands, as the Crown Prosecution Service has done, both inlawyer numbers and in the area of its operation, there might comea time when practising barristers in crime at the independent Barwill be so few in number that a defendant will be obliged to havea state employee representing him against another state employee.As the CDS consumes an ever-growing proportion of the statecriminal defence budget, fees available to solicitors will falland more independent solicitors will give up the work of thecriminal advocate, which is already rendered less appealing bythe Government's legislation proposals, and the field will beleft increasingly to a monopolistic Criminal Defence Service. 
<P>
My fourth point concerns the Government's argument that adefendant will have an increased choice between a state defenderand an independent defender. That argument is naive andmanifestly flawed. A public defender is less likely than anindependent advocate to manifest another virtue of our presentsystem, which is the quality of professionally regulatedcommitment to the client's cause. I say that even though clause16 provides for a code of conduct, the terms of which we have yetto see. That would arise not merely from the state employeestatus, but from the nature of the advocate himself. 
<P>
The strongest motivation for joining the public service issurely a desire for security in a nine-to-five job, with thepension, the holidays, and the other benefits and protectionsthat come with it. The independent professional lawyer cannotwork in that way. The hours may be long and very anti-social. Heis his own master, beholden only to his client and the rules oflaw and professional etiquette. His motivation is to see justicedone, and to enjoy professional success and the respect of hispeers and the court for a job well done. That serves to achievea quality in the criminal justice process that we would beill-advised to see diminished or lost. If that fundamentaldifference between the state servant and the independentpractitioner is not understood and the latter's role isdiminished, justice will suffer and the Lord Chancellor's claimsof improvement will be a hollow boast. 
<P>
My fifth argument against the setting up of the CDS is thatpublic confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice systemwill decline. With a system of state employee against stateemployee, will ordinary law-abiding citizens not begin to thinkthat bargains are being made privately to stop trials beginningor continuing? That point was made by Baroness Kennedy of theShaws. Will people think that defendants are not being prosecutedor, at the other end of the scale, that too many innocent peopleare being convicted because of feeble defending and that thethrough-put and minimisation of costs are all-important? 
<P>
The consequences of the loss of public confidence could be considerable. Victims might be less likely to report crimes,witnesses could become more reluctant to give evidence and juriesmore prone to acquit the guilty. Public perception is a vitalelement in the reduction of crime. 
<P>
My sixth point is that the confidence of those accused of acrime as well as the integrity of the system will diminish. Itis a little understood fact that our system works because it istrusted, by and large, by those who are charged with offences.That is another reason why juries are so valuable. With suchtrust, a defendant has less need to be kept in custody or to beshackled and controlled in court, and he is less likely to feelhard done by or wrongly convicted while he is serving hissentence. If we remove that element of trust, the weave ofprisoner co-operation will begin to unravel. Innocent defendantswill complain about being found guilty, but guilty defendantswill complain about the unfairness of the trial system. There isa danger that guilty defendants will feel all the more aggrieved,if they are defended by a state defender who is a salariedemployee. 
<P>
<H5>9 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
My seventh point is that a public defender is unlikely toachieve significant savings for the public purse. This, at least,might appeal to the Treasury-driven Minister sitting opposite me.It is not easy to discover the cost of a criminal prosecution ineither magistrates or Crown courts today, or how it compares withprosecution costs before the creation of the Crown ProsecutionService. No projection can be accurately made about the likelycosts of the CDS compared with defence costs on legal aid today. 
<P>
The Minister candidly said that he had no idea what the CDSwould cost. 
<P>
We know that the remuneration of a large majority of criminaldefence practitioners is low&#151;between about &#163;50 and&#163;150 per day, which is subject to outgoings for rent,clerks' fees, secretarial costs and often travel expenses aswell. A salaried employee doing the same job would expect toreceive at least &#163;100 per day, which is the averageindustrial wage and, in addition, entitlement to a secretary, apension, paid holidays and free travel, if not a car with whichto get to court from his office. The costs of constructing abureaucratic empire with premises, equipment and services mustbe added to that. 
<P>
Is it seriously suggested that there will be such a rapidimprovement in the speed of the through-put of cases that allthose increased costs will disappear and substantial savings willbe made? If that were to happen, what would become of justice?In reality, nothing like that will happen and the costs of thestate salaried public defender service will be no less, andprobably considerably more, than the existing defencecosts&#151;all for no good reason. 
<P>
It is difficult to see any justification for inflicting apublic defender on the criminal justice system, or the taxpayer,whose interests the Government claim to have at heart. Thearguments for such a new institution are weak, whereas thearguments against it are strong. To impose so fundamental achange without any public demand, administrative considerationor even consultation, and in the full knowledge that it is likelyto diminish the beneficial role of the independent lawyer and tosubstitute an expensive bureaucracy that will extend the power 
of the state over the individual, is an incredible act ofgovernmental misjudgment. Surprisingly, and against allprinciple&#151;I make this point against my own formerConservative Government&#151;we started to nationalise the legalsystem with the Crown Prosecution Service. It is to be hoped thatwe have learnt the lesson of that institution's performance; weshould have no truck with the imposition of a public defendersystem. 
<P>
I finish by saying what I have already said many times. Iaccept that the Government have no intention at present tointroduce a wholly salaried CDS. The CDS will be able to instructindependent private lawyers, but the beginnings are there. Unlessthe Government take on board our warnings, they will be walkingup an alley from which there is no sensible return. I invite allmembers of the Committee to bear my remarks in mind, irrespectiveof whether they appeal to the Government, so that at least thepublic will know where the parties lie on matters of theprotection of the public interest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have already said that we are opposed tosetting up a state or public defender system. The conflict ofinterest is, to most people, glaring and obvious. However, theGovernment are intent on steamrolling through clauses that willmake such provision and I have questions for the Minister, towhich I and many others would welcome the answers. 
<P>
The Minister told us that defendants would be able to choosebetween a state defender and an independent defender&#151;aspartly provided for under clause 15(9)&#151;except in veryrestricted cases. The Minister gave two examples of suchexceptions: a salaried defender who fulfils the role of a dutysolicitor and an individual in the not-for-profit sector that isor has been in receipt of a grant from the CDS. Will there beother exceptions to the rule? In other words, will there be otherexceptions to the rule that defendants invariably have theopportunity to choose between an independent and state defender? 
<P>
A second point to which I and others would like a reply ison what steps will be taken to inform defendants of that choice.When and how will they be told that they have a choice? Will theybe directed to a state defender or will the fact that they havea choice be open, clear and obvious to them? Will the Ministerconfirm the important point that the state defenders' office willnot be in the same geographical location as that of the CPS? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman draw the samedistinction when two barristers who share chambers appear onopposite sides of a case? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for thatpoint. As he said, two barristers from the same chambers can workfor opposite sides but are independent, self-employed individualswho do not work for an organisation. They are therefore not underthe aegis of any Department of State. I am happy to give way tothe hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who often appearsagainst members of his chambers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Was not the intervention of the hon. Member forHendon instructive in demonstrating a complete lack ofunderstanding or of willingness to understand the difference inprinciple between an independent contractor or the member of anindependent profession, whether a solicitor or a member of theBar, and a salaried employee? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> That is a good point. I happen to believe that it is not in the interests of justice for what is effectively thesame organisation to work on both sides of a transaction or inlitigation, and we have had rules for centuries that preventconflicts of interest. However, members of the Bar areindependent and self-employed, not salaried employees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but in myexperience many clients feel aggrieved, even when thatdistinction is explained to them, when they find out that thebarristers on both sides are from the samechambers&#151;sometimes even sharing the same desk, because ofthe hot desking that goes on in counsel chambers. The hon.Gentleman may protest that the position of employed lawyers isdifferent from that of those in private practice, but in thepublic's mind the distinction that he draws is false. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I could not disagree more with the hon.Gentleman. In my experience, the Bar is a deeply competitiveprofession. It is as competitive within chambers as it is betweenchambers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Member for Hendon is in a sense arguingagainst himself. I agree with the hon. Member for Torridge andWest Devon that the Bar is independent. The fact that members ofthe same chambers are in competition with one another during acase is irrelevant, but the fact that the public mind about thatis one of the most compelling arguments against the CriminalDefence Service that could be advanced. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> That is a very good point. 
<P>
I shall finish my short speech on this important matter byasking the Minister to confirm that the Government will table anamendment to ensure that the Criminal Defence Service will nevercome under the aegis and control of the same Department as thatof the Crown Prosecution Service. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am pleased to have an opportunity toparticipate in this debate because the clause deals with theaspect of the Bill about which I have the gravest reservations.I shall start my speech from a slightly different angle thanother hon. Members have done. I hope that the Minister willappreciate the thrust of my objection. 
<P>
During the debate, the Minister has made some play about theextent to which the Opposition have been muddled about thedifference between the Criminal Defence Service and the salarieddefender. I accept that that has crept in to the way in whichsome of the amendments have been framed. As the Minister hassaid, the CDS will replace criminal legal aid. However, in asense, the Minister is getting himself into his own difficulty,given that the self-same CDS will be the direct employer of thesalaried defenders. We are not in the business of creating theCDS to fund criminal defence and a separate salaried defenderservice to represent defenders. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I said in my description of the various pilots thatcould be developed that one possible model would be to providea completely free-standing, not-for-profit organisation with themoney to employ people. I did not rule out the possibility thatthose people would at least be at one remove from the CriminalDefence Service. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments.I do not think that they remove all my fears about the clause,but if I were offered that as Hobson's choice, I would havelittle doubt in preferring the latter formula to the former. I object to the notion that the funding organisation should be theemployer of the people who will represent the defendants. Thoseof us who have practised criminal law&#151;some of us stilldo&#151;know that there is an inevitable and inherent tensionbetween the rights of the person being represented and the dutyto those who provide the funding for that representation. 
<P>
I shall give the Minister an example. About five years ago,I was involved in a long case about allegations of fraud againsta solicitor. Eighteen counts were on the indictment. The case wastried in East Anglia and went on for many weeks. It involvedallegations of international fraud, so it was extremely costlyfor the defendant to represent himself, to contact witnesses, tospend money going abroad to get hold of those witnesses and tocollect evidence, much of which was documentary. He was at adisadvantage compared with the Crown Prosecution Service, whichcould dip into its pocket to collect the evidence that it wantedto bring the prosecution. 
<P>
As it happened, the man was acquitted. The trial proceedingswere divided into three, and he was acquitted on two occasionsat half time on the direction of the judge. The whole centrepieceof the prosecution case collapsed because of the extent of theferreting that had taken place through his solicitor, throughleading counsel and myself&#151;as his junior&#151;backing upthe whole process to get hold of the information. It cost a lotof money. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The solicitor representing the person was his agent. He washis champion; he had to be, because he was the only person whocould represent the man, who was forced on to legal aid andbankrupted long before the proceedings, and get what the manwanted. Many arguments took place with the Legal Aid Board aboutwhether it was justified to carry out certain items ofexpenditure on the man's behalf. At the end of the process wasa further battle royal over what costs were allowable. It lastedfor months with the court service assessing what was and what wasnot justified in the man's representation. Finally, everythingwas deemed to be justified. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sure that, with his characteristic fairness,the hon. Gentleman will accept what I am about to say. The UnitedStates of America has a comprehensive public defender service.Does he agree that most people would prefer to be represented bypublic defenders precisely because they have available to themthe range of resources to which the hon. Gentleman has alludedin the case that he outlined? Permission would not have to besought from the court to employ various different experts,because such experts are often employed already by the publicdefender service. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> In a sense, the Minister is almost making my casefor me. I accept what he says but, although I am not veryfamiliar with such systems, I am not reassured. The point atissue is that, when the Criminal Defence Service is set up, itwill be in an unrivalled position with its own salariedemployees. It can say, ``We can offer an advantageous service.Apart from anything else, you persuade our salaried employee thatyou need something and we are more likely to give it than anindependent solicitor.'' The Government may not intend that tohappen but, human nature and bureaucratic systems being what theyare, I am convinced that that is one of the consequences that will flow from such a system. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead rose&#151; </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull referredto the duty solicitor system. One reason why it has worked welland is attractive to solicitors is that duty solicitors pick upclients whom they subsequently represent. If we are to have asystem whereby, at first instance, the salaried employee of theCDS will be representing, without option, the defendant on hisfirst appearance in the magistrates court, he will be in anunrivalled position to keep hold of that person and represent himin later hearings. Let us face it, many defendants do not knowtheir rights or how to shop around for the best service. Althoughthe person in East Anglia whom I described earlier was not inthat category, many defendants do not know how to assert theirrights. The process is insidious. 
<P>
The Minister said that there could be a separate salarieddefender scheme. That would be an improvement because the merefact of having it separated from the hand that is providing thefunds will give a completely different ethos than if it wereintegrated with the hand that is providing the funds. I am surethat the perception will be that we will end up with a system inwhich the state brings the prosecutions and provides the defencesystem. 
<P>
I am afraid that, in the higher echelons where the budget isconsidered, people will be tempted to cut some of the servicesprovided to keep within the budget. Yet people confronted by thestate bringing the prosecution are in a position of markedinferiority. In many cases they deserve to be there, but inothers they do not. Such people are entitled to have someonechampioning their cause, and I simply do not see how a salariedrepresentative will be in a position to do that. 
<P>
The issue goes further. As we progress through the Bill, wewill come to clauses referring to the extension of rights ofaudience. I am not necessarily against that policy, but when onedoes not even have a barrister, the situation gets worse.

<P>

<B>Dr. Whitehead rose&#151; </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> One of the few arguments for separaterepresentation by a barrister is that it takes one remove awayfrom the process and gives a defendant a better chance ofindependent thought and representation. 
<P>
I give way to the hon. Gentleman and I apologise for keepinghim waiting. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Perhaps I will have more success with the hon.Gentleman now. Is he saying that lawyers are a breed apart andthat any relationship between a lawyer and the state in which asalary is paid is unconscionable whereas in the rest of publiclife, such relationships should be allowed to continue? 
<P>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is saying that he wants to recastthe whole of public life in Britain. A few examples spring tomind. An environmental health officer, salaried by the localauthority, may have to initiate a prosecution against anotherpart of that local authority. A housing aid worker may have tobe trusted to champion the cause of someone taking action againsta housing authority. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that isnot conceivable in public life in general, or that lawyers area special case? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The criminal justice system is a special case.The state decides to try to prove something against people and 
may then do something unpleasant to them. In those circumstances,I do not see how it is easy to justify a defence system in whichthe self-same state not only provides the funds, as I accepthappens now, but directly employs a salaried defender torepresent someone. The matter is made even worse when thesalaried defender and the funding service are not only linked butone and the same. 
<P>
Subject to the duties that lawyers owe to the court&#151;Ihave always tried to take them seriously, as I hope that mycolleagues have&#151;including not squandering public moneyunnecessarily, an ethos has to be developed in which lawyers, bethey solicitors or barristers, are the representatives, and inthe case of solicitors the agents, of those brought to trial.Their job is to represent such people, and act on theirinstructions as much as they can. They should lobby for funds ontheir behalf or fly off to Liechtenstein to bring back a directorto give evidence in court in England if that is what theyconsider, from the evidence available, needs to be done. 
<P>
If someone further up the funding channel says, ``I'msorry&#151;no funds available,'' that is a clear distinction anda barrier comes down, but it seems that one of the consequencesof this proposal will be to impose on the lawyer himself the dutyto make such a decision. That will create a massive conflict ofinterest between a lawyer's duty to his client and his duty tohis employers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there seemsto be a flaw in his argument? The argument seems to be based onthe notion that lawyers are independent contractors and neverbeholden to the person who pays their fees, whereas salariedemployees are somehow cravenly subject to the whims of theiremployers. However, the independent contractor would feelpressure from the person paying much sooner than the salariedemployee because independent contractors are much more quicklysensitive to whether they will be paid. The salaried employeehas, at the very least, the protection enjoyed by employees. 
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough and I have workedfor the same employer&#151;he as an independent contractor andI as an employee&#151;and frankly, no one would have said thatthere was any difference in our conditions of employment.However, if such a difference exists it is that the independentor free-lance worker feels the dangers more quickly than asalaried employee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am afraid that I disagree with the hon.Gentleman. I accept that everyone in the legal profession issubject to various pressures. There is the pressure that thejudge often puts on one to get on with the case, saying, ``Mr.Grieve, can we move on?'' [hon. Members: ``Hear, hear''.] In thefinest tradition of my profession, I shall stick to my guns.There is also the pressure not to fall out with the authorities.The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews),who is not a member of our Committee, seems to have a remarkabletrack record of saying ``Yah, boo'' to the Lord Chancellor andall sorts of other people, but he also defends criminal cases andis dependent on a large amount of legal aid work. The independentcontractor also owes duties and obligations&#151;which are, inmy experience, much stronger&#151;to his professional body. Hisreputation, and his consequent ability to earn more money, standsand falls on how he is viewed by those in his professional group.
That provides powerful grounds for lawyers not to kowtow to thosein the establishment, the judiciary, the Legal Aid Board orwhatever, by giving way on something that they believe is in theinterests of the client, while not behaving like a maverick ordisregarding the other restraints or obligations, such asfunding, that lie on him. Barristers who abuse court time, forexample, get bad reputations pretty quickly. However, an employeewho is salaried by the organisation that is doing the funding onbehalf of the defendant has no anxieties, as long as he satisfiesthe requirements of his funding masters and the organisation thatemploys him, about where his next bit of work is coming from. Hewill be uniquely susceptible to the pressures that we arediscussing and while I am sure that such employees will try toensure high standards of conduct, human nature being what it is,they will be far more susceptible to pressure than independentcontractors. I therefore disagree entirely with the hon. Memberfor Battersea. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I merely ask whether lawyers have their ownprofessional pride, organisations and standards that encourgethem to do a good job. If they are asked to do a job, in whatevercircumstances, they may get promotion and better prospects bydoing the job well. To use the example that I gave earlier, anenvironmental health officer who systematically fails toprosecute or initiate prosecutions because he believes that heis doing a craven job for the local authority will not be anenvironmental health officer for very long; it is as simple asthat. One has to accept that professional standards will applygenerally and that people will wish to do a good job and therebyadvance. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and haveno doubt that such salaried lawyers may wish to establishprofessional reputations; after all, if salaried lawyers are verybad and do not produce results in terms of getting clients off,their reputations may sink. If they are sufficiently anonymouswithin a service, they may not even succeed in establishing areputation at all.

 On resuming&#151; 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I hope to conclude briefly, but I want first toreturn to the joining of the solicitor or the person representingthe defendant with the Criminal Defence Service's salariedemployee. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify howthe system will work. 
<P>
As I said earlier, if a defendant client takes the view thatan expensive item is needed so that he can be properlyrepresented&#151;for instance, a new forensic examination, witha new consultant to help establish his case&#151;who will decidewhether it should be funded? Would the salaried employeesolicitor make an evaluation and decide that the case did notmeet value for money considerations, saying that he could notrecommend the case being funded? If he said, ``Yes, I see thepoint. It could help you. I shall therefore argue for it on yourbehalf,'' would the person who denied funds to the defendant besomeone else in the same organisation? 
<P>
It is critical to maintain confidence in the system ofjustice. I would not like to hear it said in a future Court of 
Appeal hearing, as we have heard on previous occasions, that asolicitor had tried to obtain some evidence but that he was notallowed the necessary funding. However, I would not like to hearthat a solicitor, whose job is to act as the agent andrepresentative of the accused in getting the services that he orshe requires, subject only to the duty that he owes to the court,was the person who had denied the client those facilities. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As members of the Committee will have gathered,I have done no legal aid work as a commercial lawyer. Is it notslightly more involved than the hon. Gentleman suggested? Is itnot also the knowledge and perception of the client, who knowsthat the lawyer is acting independently for him and for no oneelse? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is a seriousmatter. 
<P>
I always try to understand the Government's point of view,but without wishing to make too many concessions. I was certainlynot going to say that the Minister or the Solicitor-General wishto see the quality of justice undermined, but there must be somerationale behind their arguments. That is why I have focused onthat major flaw. It does not disregard the other arguments thatalso exist. When it comes to the quality of justice, it seemsthat the proposed system could be rapidly discredited in the eyesof the user. The question will then arise of whether the publicare prepared to use it. The Minister said that people will bedelighted to use it because it will confer certain advantages onthem. That causes me equal anxiety, because it suggests that theexisting system may disadvantage people by withdrawing fundingthat they would otherwise receive. 
<P>
These are important issues. Until I am satisfied about them,I cannot support clause 13. I echo what was said by my hon. andlearned Friend the Member for Harborough. The proposals cameabout without a royal commission and without the sort ofdiscussion and forethought that I would have considered necessaryfor such a radical departure from existing practice. That, too,fills me with considerable foreboding.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Member for Harboroughconcluded his passionate attack on the idea of salaried defendersby saying that the public should know where the parties stand onthe matter of the public interest, somehow implying that theConservative party was the guardian of principle. Indeed, Irepeatedly challenged the hon. and learned Gentleman to say whatwas the underlying principle of his position. I congratulated himon finally setting out his principled position, but to suggestthat he can help the public make up their mind about the positionof the political parties on the matter is far from the case. 
<P>
The hon. and learned Gentleman dutifully supported theprevious Government for five long years. I do not recall him everbeing tempted to rebel against their proposals. Towards the endof those five years the Government, who reflected the views ofthe Conservative party and whom he supported, proposed in a WhitePaper that they would contemplate the employment of salariedlawyers precisely as I have set out today. The idea that the hon.and learned Gentleman's principles are ones that the public canrely upon is far from the truth. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Did the Minister support the White Paperproposals advanced during the previous Parliament, or did he 
speak&#151;privately or publicly&#151;against them? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I make it clear that the argument that I advancetoday is based entirely on the pragmatic benefit to the publicof having private sector lawyers and those on salaries workingfor the Criminal Defence Service&#151;something for which theConservative Government, whom the hon. and learned Gentlemansupported for five years, also argued. That is why I repeatedlypressed the hon. and learned Gentleman about the principleunderlying his position. It may be strongly held, but it does notappear to be strongly held by the party that he supported whenin government. Less than a year passed between the publicationof the White Paper and the general election and only two yearshave passed since then. The Conservative party appears to haveradically changed its position during that time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As the Minister is so keen on strict adherenceto principles, would he support the shadow Lord Chancellor insaying that the legal aid system is of value, that it should besupported and that it should not, under any circumstances, beundermined&#151;the shadow Lord Chancellor in question being thepresent Lord Chancellor speaking to Bar conference in 1996, lessthan year before he became the Minister's boss. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Of course I support those words; nothing in theproposals will undermine the legal aid system. I am delighted toendorse what was said. 
<P>
I turn to another matter that the hon and learned Gentlemanraised about the proposal to employ salaried defenders. He saidthat it came somehow out of the blue. I risk giving evidence tothe Committee, but I am aware that a vigorous debate has beentaking place in this country for some 30 years about the prospectof salaried defenders. The proposal has hardly come out of theblue. As I said, a Conservative White Paper canvassed the ideaas recently as July 1996. In October 1997, in a speech to the LawSociety conference, my right hon. and learned Friend the LordChancellor suggested that the Government intended to introducea salaried element to criminal legal aid and it has been a liveissue ever since. 
<P>
The hon. and learned Gentleman can hardly claim that theproposal has come out of the blue. I wonder whether he is so busyin the Temple, working on some obscure area of the law, that heis preparing himself to become one of those lawyers who, whenchallenged, cannot say who Noel Gallagher is, or has not a cluewho Damon Albarn is, because they are so anxious to avoid anycontact with ordinary members of the public who might be inclinedto take an interest in issues that are less remote than theaverage Temple lawyer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier rose&#151; </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is now going to tellme who they are. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> For fear that the Minister might run on withthat list, I am about to tell him that much amusement was had,at the expense of Mr. Justice Popplewell who, during the caseinvolving Linford Christie, asked what Linford Christie's lunchbox was. That caused considerable mirth. At Mr. JusticePopplewell's valedictory&#151;a small ceremony at the Lord ChiefJustice's court not long ago&#151;Mr. Justice Popplewell madeit clear that at all stages, both during the case and earlier,he had known precisely what Mr. Linford Christie's lunch box was. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for that information and am delighted to hear that Mr. Justice Popplewell was completely in touch withcurrent language and expressions. I only hope that the hon. andlearned Gentleman is similarly acquainted. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not acquainted with Linford Christie'slunch box. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman showed suchknowledge about such matters that I assumed that he knew moreabout it than I did. I hope that that is true. 
<P>
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked why anyone would choosea salaried defender rather than one who is privately employed.That will be a matter for the person who is accused of a criminaloffence. The point of pilots on this aspect is to test thereaction of people who are accused. I mentioned earlier that inthe Scottish pilot some 20 per cent. of people who have theopportunity to do so appear to be choosing to go to the publicdefender's office. That was not necessarily anticipated. Likemany schemes in north America, the Scottish pilot allocatesdefendants, but many are so satisfied with the service providedthat they choose to use it. Under clause 59, defendants will begiven a choice between private and salaried defenders, exceptwhen it is not practicable, as in the example that I gave thehon. Member for Solihull, in which a salaried defender occupiesone of the relevant places on the duty solicitor scheme andshould not be treated less favourably as a result. 
<P>
Clause 13 will replace the existing criminal legal aid schemewith a new Criminal Defence Service, administered by the LegalService Commission. The CDS will not, therefore, be a corporateentity; it is the advice, assistance and representation that thecommission will provide to protect the interests of peopleinvolved in criminal matters. The commission will, however, usea greater range of methods to secure such services than theexisting system. It will have greater flexibility and a widerrange of choices, and will therefore be able to focus on securingbetter value for money and procuring quality-assured services. 
<P>
The Legal Services Commission will establish and maintain theCriminal Defence Service. Separating the CDS from the CommunityLegal Service within the commission reflects the fact that theywill cover different types of service and case. The commissionwill secure advice and assistance as provided for under clause14, and representations as provided for under clause 15. Weexpect most services to be provided through contracts withquality-assured, private sector suppliers. The commission willalso have powers to employ lawyers so as to be able to providesome services itself. It will be able to establish bodies or makegrants or loans to others to provide legal services. Thosealternative methods of procurement are essential for theflexibility that we envisage for the commission. 
<P>
I shall respond to the final point made by the hon. Memberfor Beaconsfield, Given the commitment that the Government havegiven to piloting the different models for the way in which theCriminal Defence Service will operate, it is not possibletoday&#151;nor is it appropriate&#151;to answer his questionwith any precision. No doubt, the hon. and learned Member forHarborough will say that I have no idea. However, as we arecommitted to ensuring appropriate and proper piloting of thearrangements, it is only right that we should learn fromexperience and assess how the service is to be funded and to bedeveloped 
<P>
I challenged the hon. and learned Member for Harborough tostate his position on the principle of allowing directly employedpublic defenders. We have heard what he said. He is against theidea in principle and for all time. He does not see any benefitin allowing salaried lawyers to be employed to represent people.He takes a perfectly proper position that is relatively new forthe Conservative party. 
<P>
That does not mean that, in the wholesale changes upon whichthe Conservative party is embarked around the kitchen table, itwill not eventually hit on an idea that appeals to the public.I have experience of opposition, and I suspect that its view onthis proposal is not likely to be one of them. However, I acceptthat I might be wrong. Time will tell. 
<P>
The commission will be able to accredit, or authorise othersto accredit, suppliers of services provided as part of theCriminal Defence Service. Accreditation will include monitoringarrangements to ensure quality. That is essential if suppliersin the private and public sectors are to meet the quality thatwe are determined should be required of all providers ofservices. 
<P>
The creation of the Criminal Defence Service is an essentialstep in providing for publicly funded legal services at anaffordable cost for those who are vulnerable. It will go some waytowards meeting the Government's objectives of a fair society anda fair, efficient and modern criminal justice system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I should like the Minister to provide me withhelpful information. Clause 14(1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission shall fund such advice and assistance asit considers appropriate''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It then sets out to whom it may give that help. Subsection(2) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission may comply with the duty imposed bysubsection (1) by . . .
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(f) doing anything else which it considers appropriate forfunding advice and assistance, except itself providing advice orassistance.'' 
<P>
</UL></FONT>What factors will persuade the commission that any particularaspect of funding is appropriate? That is another example of theBill's loose drafting. It is important that the Government shouldtell us what they consider to be appropriate in thosecircumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman forintroducing the debate in that way. Under the clause, thecommission will be required to fund such advice and assistanceas it considers appropriate for individuals held in custody andin such other circumstances as the Lord Chancellor prescribes. 
<P>
The clause will enable the commission to do that by enteringinto contracts with lawyers or, when appropriate, with otherpersons or bodies. It will enable the commission to provide thoseservices through lawyers in its own employment, or byestablishing and maintaining certain bodies. For example, it maywant to create a not-for-profit organisation to provide adviceand assistance. The commission will be able to make grants andloans to persons or bodies for the provision of advice andassistance. 
<P>
I suspect that the hon. and learned Gentleman is driving atthe overriding subsection&#151;clause 13(1), under which 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission will establish . . . and develop a service. . . for the purpose of securing that individuals involved incriminal investigations . . . have access to such advice,assistance and representation as the interests of justicerequire.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is contemplated that the same standards of advice andassistance and the way in which those accused of criminaloffences are given access to legal services will bemaintained&#151;albeit that the delivery may be slightlydifferent, because of the more flexible services that arecontemplated in clause 14. 
<P>
<H5>10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not entirely sure that the Minister hasanswered my question. I can read clause 14 in its entiretyperfectly well. I can also read clause 13(1), but neither it norclause 14 tells the reader what the commission will consider tobe appropriate in the circumstances set out in clause 14. Will the Minister have another go? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I answered the hon. and learned Gentleman'squestion. I did so in the context of the Bill, by referring tothe interests of justice under clause 13(1). He will be familiarwith the range of legal services available to defendants. Theyrange from straightforward advice and assistance, which fallsshort of full representation, to representation in the highestcourt in the land if an appeal case needs to go that far. Thatis what is appropriate according to the judgment in a particularcase. 
<P>
The Government have extended the obligations of the UnitedKingdom under the European convention. We are bound by theprovisions of that convention. I have made it clear that the Billsatisfies the terms of the convention. In the interest ofjustice, it is appropriate to provide to defendants before ourcriminal courts the level of representation that they currentlyenjoy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Let me&#151; 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am not sure that I gave way. However, I will doso now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If the Minister had not given way, I would havetried to catch the Chairman's attention so that I might haveaddressed the Committee myself. 
<P>
I accept what the Minister said&#151;it will be in therecord to look back on&#151;but who will do the job? Obviously,it will not be the commission, because it is not a human being.What sort of human being does he envisage will represent thecommission in deciding what is appropriate in the circumstances? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The commission will be a non-departmentalbody&#151;a sort of quasi-governmental organisation. It will beestablished under the rules that are familiar to hon. Members.It will take decisions, for example, such as those already takenby the Legal Aid Board and other organisations responsible fordistributing public money for the provisions of legal aid. Itsoverriding requirement will be to do so in the interests ofjustice and to ensure that those charged with offences receiveaccess to the sort of legal advice and representation that theycurrently enjoy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am so sorry, I must be being very obtuse. Thecommission will decide on the basis of what it considers to beappropriate how funding for advice and assistance should be givento individuals. The commission, as a quasi-governmentalbody&#151;call it what one likes&#151;will not itself makedecisions, because they can be made only by human beings. Willthe commission be represented by an individual who will make adecision in respect of cases in general or will it delegate toan individual employed by the CDS the responsibility to decidewhat funding is appropriate for advice and assistance underclause 14? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is confusing theprinciple that he seeks to establish with the means of delivery.The clause is concerned essentially with the flexible means ofdelivery that the Government emphasise is a much more attractiveway in which to provide appropriate legal services to thoseaccused of criminal offences. Ultimately, the decision will bein the hands of individuals who will be employees of the LegalServices Commission, as well as being the commission itself inits corporate sense. I do not follow the hon. and learned 
Gentleman's line of reasoning. If he could give me some clueabout what he is driving at, I might be able to answer more tohis satisfaction. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My point is that clause 14 is unclear. I shallnot trouble the Minister further, as he is either unable toanswer my question or is insufficiently prepared to deal with itthis evening. We might return to the matter on another occasion.

Government amendment No. 37. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The clause establishes the duty of the commissionto fund representation, sets out the means by which it may do soand provides powers to limit the extent to which the defendantcan choose his or her representative. All the amendments dealwith choice. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 27a divides this rather lengthyclause into two. The first clause will deal with representationand the second clause will deal with the choice ofrepresentative. 
<P>
I shall first explain clause 15 in a wider context.Paragraphs 6.12 to 6.24 and 6.28 to 6.30 of the White Paper,``Modernising Justice'', set out the Government's plan fordeveloping and implementing contracts for criminal defenceservices, how we expect those contracts to be structured and therelationship between contracts and the defendant's choice ofrepresentative. Our firm view is that contracting, plus asalaried element, offers the best means of providing high-qualityservices for those accused of criminal offences, while securingthe best possible value for money. 
<P>
It is highly desirable that defendants choose theirrepresentatives, not least to promote their confidence in the criminal justice system. Clause 15(7) enshrines that principle.A completely unrestricted choice would undermine our plans toachieve value for money, so subsection (8) contains powers tolimit that choice. Subsection (8)(c) is the key provision. Itwill allow the defendant's choice to be limited to any lawyerwith a current contract with the Legal Services Commission, ora salaried defender. 
<P>
The scope of regulations under the clause will be extendedgradually as contracts for various types of work are piloted androlled out generally. The first contracts will cover advice andassistance at the police station, including a share of the dutysolicitor work at local police stations and magistrates courts.They will be extended to cover first representation inmagistrates court cases and most Crown court work. Once thecontracts provide adequate coverage at each level, regulationsunder clause 15(8)(c) will provide that the defendant may nolonger choose a non-contracted representative. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The Minister mentioned representation atCrown court. Perhaps I was not following his remarks closelyenough, but was he implying that representation at Crown courtmight be available from a public service defender? If so, has healready crossed the barrier, to anticipate rights of audience forthe CDS in the Crown court?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There are many ways in which it would be possibleto provide representation in the Crown court through a salarieddefender, who could be a member of the Bar or a solicitor. If theHouse accepts the Government's proposals for rights of audience,an employed solicitor will be able to provide representation inthe Crown court. An employed barrister cannot do that at presentbecause the rules of the Bar prevent it. The Government aretrying to eliminate such unnecessary and unfair restrictivepractice. Someone who has been a barrister in private practicefor many years and takes employment, for example, with the CPS,may suddenly discover that he can no longer appear before theCrown court. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, like theGovernment, would no support such restrictive practice. 
<P>
We intend to ensure that those who are accused of criminaloffences have a choice between several contracted firms as wellas being offered the possibility of a salaried defender. In thefirst round of contracting, we intend to guarantee a contract toall firms that fulfil quality standards. I would expect most ofthem to continue to win contracts if they maintain the qualitystandards and are prepared to participate in the duty solicitorscheme. That is important both to sustain the quality of theservice by ensuring that it does not become the preserve of firmsthat cannot win more lucrative contracts, and as part of ourplans for providing continuity of representation from the policestation through the courts. 
<P>
Fragmentation is a fundamental weakness in our system. It canlead to provision of help under five different parts of thescheme. That can mean duplication, delay and unnecessary cost.Amendment No. 26 deals with that point. If an individual haschosen an adviser and given instructions to that lawyer, whyshould the taxpayer pay for another lawyer to undertake exactlythe same work and consider the same instructions? People arelikely to have more confidence in the justice system if they donot have to repeat themselves and when they know that the personwho represents them in court is aware of all the relevant issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Will the Minister clarify the point at which thedefendant is deemed to have shot his bolt and selected hisrepresentative? Does that happen at the duty solicitor stage,when the defendant is offered no choice between an employed andsalaried lawyer, or at a later stage? The answer will beinteresting in view of the Minister's claims that choice exists. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, whoanticipates both the next point and the subsequent point. I shalldeal with them shortly. 
<P>
The reference to ``person'' in amendment No. 26 includes theability to use a different lawyer in the partnership on the dayof the hearing, if that is the arrangement between the firm withthe contract and the defendant. A sole practitioner may use anagent in similar circumstances. In those cases, the qualityassurance arrangements under the contract will ensure that thereare appropriate procedures in place for recording instructionsthat are taken at the police station, and passing information tothe subsequent representative. 
<P>
In some circumstances, there will be good reasons for lackof continuity&#151;for example, a conflict of interest betweenclients. Regulations under subsection (8)(e) will define thosecircumstances. 
<P>
Under amendment No. 26, an individual at a police station canselect a representative from any firm that has an appropriatecontract. If that representative is not available, the individualcould use the duty solicitor, who will not be considered to havebeen selected because a clear preference for someone else hadbeen expressed. Amendment No. 26 will mean that the individualwill be expected to continue with the lawyer who gave advice andassistance at the police station unless another lawyer hadclearly been chosen. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That sounds even more extraordinary. Accordingto the Minister, a defendant at a police station who is given theusual choice between a duty solicitor and a phone book to lookup a lawyer and chooses the duty solicitor is saddled with thatchoice for the rest of the proceedings. Will that be made clearto the defendant when he is offered the choice? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> When I consider all the marvellous work done onbehalf of the duty solicitor scheme, I resent the suggestion thata defendant is being saddled with someone, when he is providedwith such advice and assistance. That does not fit happily withthe fine words used by the hon. Member for Solihull in supportof duty solicitor schemes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I thought that the Minister would drawme into it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Solihull is the embodiment ofthe fine work done through duty solicitor schemes. It isunfortunate that a member of the Bar should cast aspersions onthe people who do that work. If someone is happy to berepresented by the duty solicitor on the day, there is no reasonwhy he should change to another lawyer, who will not be asfamiliar with the facts of his case as the person who representshim at first. 
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is the Minister seriously advancing thatargument? Let us assume that someone has been brought to a policestation late at night, or in the small hours of the morning, andis presented with a choice between the duty solicitor or someone 
else. He may have suffered injury in an affray or some othercriminal incident and may not be in a position to exercisechoice. I have no doubt that in Whitehall, or wherever theMinister has his office, everything must seem fine and dandy, butwhat if he were to attend a local police station at the dead ofnight as a beaten-up defendant or suspect? How would he feelabout being required to make a choice that would bind him forweeks, if not months before the Crown court trial took place? Isthe Minister seriously saying that such a defendant should bepinned&#151;although I come from Leicestershire, I shall not usethe word ``saddled''&#151;to that choice for the duration of theproceedings? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> In certain circumstances, the person may exercisehis right to have different representation and he will indicatehis desire for that at the time. The hon. and learned Member forHarborough is missing the point. He is comparing the presentarrangements. I understand that members of duty solicitor schemesare largely self-selecting, so there is no external quality checkon the people who participate. The scheme that I am describingwill operate in the context of arrangements, whereby everyone whoforms part of it will be expert in criminal law and will havebeen approved by the CDS as wholly suitable for the provision ofrepresentation. 
<P>
In those circumstances, the excellent work already being donethrough duty solicitor schemes will be further refined. There isno reason why the person should decide later on to instruct adifferent solicitor, thereby duplicating the instructions thathe gives and increasing the already considerable cost to thetaxpayer by providing two sets of instructions to two separatesolicitors. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Is the Minister saying that the duty solicitorwho is allocated to an individual at 3 o'clock in the morning,or whenever, becomes the lawyer acting for that person and thereis no opportunity to choose another lawyer after that firstconsultation? Is that allocation irrevocable? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Again, Opposition Members are using highly chargedwords such as ``allocation'', as if some force were involved. Thehon. and learned Member for Harborough referred to someone beingarrested in the early hours of the morning. Surely that personwill be grateful that someone is there to provide advice andassistance when he needs it most. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Come on. This is not good enough. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is sneering. I havebeen reluctant to challenge him, but the reality is that someonecharged with an offence in the early hours of the morning willbe relieved to discover that an adviser is available. 
<P>
I hope that I have the full attention of the hon. Member forTorridge and West Devon, whose question I am tryng to answer.Those who have considerable experience of the criminal system mayhave had representation from another firm, which is not on dutyon that particular night. Such people usually indicate theirpreference for a different lawyer, but it is fair to say thatthey tend to be the only ones who do. Few people who are chargedwith an offence for the first time are likely to express a desirefor any particular lawyer. They appreciate the assistance thatthey are given, albeit in the small hours of the morning. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> To move on from that issue, to which I shallreturn, another issue may arise&#151;the famous case of the 
returned brief and the double-booked barrister. Let us assumethat a barrister takes on a case, but finds, through no fault ofhis own, that the case goes on five weeks longer than anyoneexpected. As a result, another case for a defendant comes intothe lists&#151;a matter over which he has no control&#151;andhe cannot represent that person. Is he covered by the clause? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I rather think that I have already explained thatand I am sorry if I went through it too quickly. I made it clearthat there may well be an arrangement under the contract to allowanother member of a contracted firm to provide representationwhen the case arrives at court. That is not the issue that wehave been discussing. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister referred to a contracted firm. Ifa barrister has been contracted to do the work&#151;I assumethat the clause applies to that possibility&#151;he will not bea member of a firm. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is enjoying theentertainment of thinking up all the conceivable examples thatmight arise, but I am not familiar with many examples ofbarristers taking their turn to sit up in the small hours of themorning participating in duty solicitor schemes. We have made itclear that, in principle, we are sympathetic to the Bar enjoyingcontracts under our proposals. I do not in any way oppose thatin principle, but it is a matter for the Bar to decide whetherit wants to organise itself in a way that makes contractingpossible. What is not proposed is to have contracts for eachindividual member of the Bar.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He has partlyclarified one point, but I am still puzzled. He is saying thatthis applies only when one starts with a duty solicitor scheme.I confess that that is not how I read the clause. I thought thatit started at the point when representation, which must continueto the end, begins. Someone can have a duty solicitor, butbecause he was not his first choice, he can instruct someoneelse. When the barrister becomes involved, which does not usuallyhappen at the duty solicitor stage, does the clause apply to himwhen the funding starts coming from the commission? What willhappen if he cannot do the work through no fault of his own? Doesthe clause cover a replacement barrister who is not in the samefirm? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That is a matter that we shall get to in duecourse. At present, I am concentrating on the operation of theduty solicitor scheme. The hon. Gentleman looks exasperated, butmy comments were directed solely towards the operation of theduty solicitor scheme. While I accept that Opposition Members maywant to pursue these matters, they should do so in the contextof what is being discussed at the time. 
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear why the Government cannotaccept amendment No. 122. Duty solicitor work is an importantmeans by which firms attract new clients. A rule that a suspectwho expresses no other preference will stick with the dutysolicitor through the subsequent court case will help ensure thatcommitted, high quality firms continue to participate in thevital work done through such schemes. 
<P>
If an individual does not express a preference when publiclyfunded advice and assistance is provided, why should the taxpayerbear the additional cost of that individual subsequently wishingto select another representative? The Government are not in the 
business of wasting taxpayers' money by funding duplicatedinstructions, thereby delaying the progress of cases. 
<P>
Some categories of case are very specialised, when specialistpanels of lawyers may be set up to achieve value for money.Separate regulations under clause 15(8)(c) will provide for amore limited choice of contracted firms in such categories, suchas fraud trials, which are typically expensive and requirespecial skills, experience and perhaps technology. In thosecases, the defendant's choice might be restricted to members ofa specialist panel, but it will be a choice between qualityassured lawyers who have demonstrated both the necessarycompetence and administrative systems to deal with thesespecialised and weighty cases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> This is not an argumentative point, butas someone who has had much experience of duty solicitor schemes,I know that there is a middle kind of case whereby proceedingsare imminent and the solicitor instructed by the defendant asksthe duty solicitor to act as his or her agent for thoseproceedings, perhaps that very morning. I wish to place on recordthe fact that that has happened and, as far as I am aware becauseI am no longer a practising lawyer, still happens. We should beareventuality that in mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am again grateful to the hon. Gentleman; Ireferred to that situation and said that it could be covered bythe contract. It would be unreasonable to expect a solepractitioner who may already have commitments to other clientsin court somewhere else to be available on a given day, simplybecause of the vagaries of the listing arrangements. Providingthe agent were properly qualified and attested to be ofsufficient quality to carry out criminal representation services,there is no objection in principle to such a situation. 
<P>
I was dealing with specialist cases. The specialist natureof a case may not have been appreciated at the time of initialadvice and assistance. Amendment No. 27 deals with that byproviding for the individual to choose again from those lawyerscompetent to handle a case of that complexity. Amendment No. 37makes regulations under that subsection, subject to theaffirmative resolution procedure. 
<P>
Two further provisions in clause 15 require comment. Clause15(8)(a) provides for regulations, subject to the affirmativeapproval procedure, to remove the defendant's right of choicealtogether. The Government have made it clear that that will beused only in the most exceptional circumstances&#151;forexample, where an advocate is assigned to an alleged rapist whowas defending himself and therefore prevented fromcross-examining in person. Under clause 15(9), regulations underclause 15(8) may not provide that a defendant should be offeredonly a choice between salaried defenders. That does not quitemean that suspects and defendants will be offered a choicebetween private and salaried defenders in every conceivablecircumstance; for example, in the circumstances prescribed underclause 15(8)(a), the only advocate available in court torepresent the alleged rapist might, on a given day, be a salarieddefender. Similarly, when a suspect decides to use the dutysolicitor, that could on some days be a salaried defender. Itwould all, however, be subject to the particular duty solicitorlist. It will not be possible to force someone to choose asalaried defender. 
<P>
Furthermore, if a case proceeds to trial in the Crown Court,regulations will provide an opportunity to exercise a secondchoice to select a specialist advocate, even if the orginallychosen lawyer, private or salaried, had the necessary right ofaudience to continue to represent the defendant. The defendantmight choose a barrister in private practice, a salaried defenderor, if the solicitor-representative were qualified and willingto act in the Crown court, his or her existingsolicitor-advocate, who might also be a salaried defender. Asnow, it would be the solicitor's duty to advise the client aboutthe options and instruct the advocate. Initially, the choice ofadvocate would encompass any barrister willing to act in thecase; in due course, if contracts with barristers were developedsuccessfully, choice may be limited under clause 15(8)(c) to abarrister subject to such a contract. I hope that that satisfiesthe hon. Member for Beaconsfield. 
<P>
The provisions should provide sufficient comfort to those whoargue for the interests of the private profession, in particularthe Bar&#151;unless they fear the competition of freely-chosensalaried defenders. 
<P>
It should also be clear why amendment No. 123 is unnecessaryand, frankly, slightly absurd. There is no question, as theamendment assumes, that salaried defenders will shamefully hidetheir light under a bushel, in the hope of being mistaken for amember of the uniformly excellent private profession. On thecontrary, they will proclaim their status and will, I am sure,be willingly chosen by many suspects and defendants. Theamendment is another example of a conservatism that seems to beemerging in our debate and which I detect in Opposition Members'attitude to restrictive practices. I am sorry that they arereverting to their former view that restrictive practices are agood thing. I suppose that it depends which side they are on inthe current debate in the Conservative party. Do they hark backto the days of Mrs Thatcher who was pretty tough in sweeping wayrestrictive practices, or prefer a more Lilleyan approach,thereby forming part of the tiny minority of Conservative Memberswho actually support the Leader of the Opposition? Whichever sideConservative Members are on, it is a shame that we see littleconsistency from them in such matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It is a little late for Aunt Sally to be up andabout, but the Minister gave her a good run round the dormitory.He would be better employed if he addresses his concerns andarguments, such as they are, to the matters in hand. 
<P>
I have no quarrel with Government amendment No. 37, which asI understand it makes a small drafting change to clause 25. 
<P>
When I first read Government amendment No. 26, I wrote nextto it in the amendment paper the word ``Why?'' I have listenedto the Minister, but that question has not been sensiblyanswered. It is apparent that there is confusion in theMinister's mind as to what ``person'' means. He had to go intosome discussion about how when he said ``person'', he meant``firm'', and that someone's choosing solicitor A in the policestation does not mean that solicitor A's colleague cannot alsobe used as the selected adviser or representative. 
<P>
A criticism was made about the fact that any scheme thatallowed more than one person to be chosen would lead to anexpensive and unnecessary re-briefing of a second individual by 
the client. If that is correct, unless I do not know enough aboutthe mental capacity of solicitors, it must be equally correctthat if someone is faced with solicitor A at 2 am and is then forsome reason invited to rely on solicitor A's partner, that secondperson will need to be re-instructed or at least acquainted withthe facts of the case and the position of the defendant in regardto the allegations against him. It therefore seems that theMinister spent a long time saying nothing. I dare say that hishon. Friends who sit happily behind him were utterly persuadedby what he said and will ensure that amendment No. 26 makes itsway into statute. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield most eloquentlydealt with the double-booking point. It applies with perhaps moreforce to allocated solicitors being double-booked than tobarristers. With solicitors appearing as advocates in all courts,it is likely that they will be susceptible to that problemthrough no fault of their own. The solicitor will then be facedwith having defendants go undefended or having to instruct, withall that that implies, another lawyer either in the firm oroutside it. 
<P>
On Government amendment No. 27, the Minister gave us aclassic case of new Labourspeak, the sense of which was, ``WhenI say that you have a choice, you have the choice that I decreeyou should have. It's not a free choice between any number ofoptions&#151;it's take it or leave it.'' I was also puzzled byhis arguments, because no reading of amendment No. 27 suggeststhat specialist representatives could be chosen if they were notthe representatives originally chosen. I fear that Aunt Sally'sshawl was being draped over the Minister's eyes, ears orsomething, which led him off on a little frolic of his own. 
<P>
On amendments No. 122 and 123, the Minister is right to usethe word ``choice''&#151;a description that is not properlyapplicable to amendments Nos. 26 and 27. Amendment No. 122states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``save that an individual who has been provided with adviceor assistance at a police station by a representative whom he hasnot expressly selected shall have the right to select anotherrepresentative for representation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That encompasses a proper definition of the word ``choice''.In all fairness, criminal defendants&#151;whether they arearrested at 2 o'clock in the morning, or 2 o'clock in theafternoon&#151;should be entitled to have something more thanthat which the Government propose. 
<P>
The Minister pooh-poohed amendment No. 123. I know that itis getting late and he may be running out of rational arguments,but the amendment encompasses legitimate concerns about thecommission, which we debated under clause 14. Under thatamendment, regulations would ensure 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that where a person employed by the Commission providesassistance, advice and representation he shall first inform theindividual that he is an employee of the Commission and that theindividual shall then be entitled to select an alternativerepresentative who is not employed by the Commission.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Of course, we do not expect the Criminal Defence Service'ssalaried employees to wear uniforms or eqaulettes showing thatthey are members of the CDS. It is not altogether unbelievablethat the custody sergeant will tell the arrested personlanguishing in the cells, ``Mr. Bloggs'', or ``Miss Bloggs from 
the Criminal Defence Service is upstairs.'' That might or mightnot mean much to the defendant at 2 o'clock in the morning. 
<P>
Defendants may not hear adequately what is said through theslot in the cell door through which they have been conveyed. Theymay not understand the difference between a defence lawyer, abrief, a commission employee or a member of the CDS. Perhaps theywill understand what they have ended up with only later, whenthey wake up with a sore head in the early hours to enjoy a nicecup of police tea. Therefore, it is even more appropriate thatwe should deal with the concerns that we expressed in amendmentNo. 123. 
<P>
I have already dealt with Government amendment No. 37. I lookforward to hearing from the Government and perhaps my hon. andlearned Friend the Member for Harborough. The Minister remindsme of Mr. Henry Ford, who said that cars could be 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any colour&#151;so long as it's black.''
<P>

<P>
The Minister is saying that people can have any lawyer theylike so long as the Government have chosen that lawyer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> So long as he is black. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does notknow that there are laws against making that sort of remark. TheMinister is good with words, but his words do him no good at all. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall say a few words about amendment No. 123.When we debated clause 13, I asked the Minister one or twoquestions. I asked what steps would be taken to inform defendantsof their choice, and what and when would defendants be told. Ialso asked whether the Minister would confirm that the statedefenders' offices will not be in the same geographical locationas those of the Crown Prosecution Service. Furthermore, I askedhim to confirm that the Government would table an amendment toensure that state defenders will not come under the aegis andcontrol of the same Department as the Crown Prosecution Service.I hope that I shall receive answers to those questions duringthis debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall deal first with the points raised byGovernment amendment No. 26, which is difficult to comprehend.I prefer to use the word representative; we seem to be moving tothe stage when barristers and solicitors will all be consideredas representatives or advocates, and I do not disassociate myselffrom that change. Solicitors and barristers acting on behalf ofan accused perform similar functions, but from slightly differentprofessional backgrounds. 
<P>
There are powerful reasons for saying that an accused cannotchange his representative. Indeed, even under the present legalaid rules, an accused will not get the permission of the courtto change his representative at the last minute. He may apply tothe court, but the court will say no. He must show good reasonor cause for wanting to do it. 
<P>
One of the reasons most often allowed is a conflict ofinterest or a complete breakdown in the relationship, but thecourt will usually allow that to happen only once. If it happensagain, the court will start treating the application as frivolousand will often threaten the defendant with having to fend forhimself. 
<P>
Rules already exist to prevent that aspect of the systembeing abused. However, as my hon. and learned Friend the Memberfor Harborough said, it is manifestly unfair that an accused whoarrives at a police station at 2 am should be told that he is 
landed for keeps with the person who has been told to representhim. Various considerations will be uppermost in the accused'smind at 2 am. First, it is likely that the duty solicitor willbe more readily available than anyone else. Secondly, he may notknow who else might be available. 
<P>
We can all remember the wonderful films that predate thearrival of duty solicitors, the accused sitting in the interviewroom saying, ``I want to see a solicitor,'' and the policemanhanding over the telephone directory and telling him to chooseone. Generally speaking, that resulted in no representative beingproduced, which was one reason why the duty solicitor scheme wasintroduced. It is an abuse of the purpose of duty solicitors thento say that one cannot resile from a choice. If it is a questionof seeing the duty solicitor at 2 am and being represented by himon a plea of guilty at 10.30 the following morning in court, Ihave some sympathy with the Minister's position. However, thatwill frequently not be so; if the case is complex and goes to theCrown court, it will be unfair. 
<P>
The Minister says that things will be different in future.He says that all the solicitors in the duty solicitor scheme willbe part of a franchise operation. Each will be considered to haveall the expertise necessary to carry out such representation. Icannot accept that. There are many categories of offences,ranging from the commonplace to the extremely complicated. Itdefies belief that the franchise contract could be extended overa sufficiently wide group of solicitors. How can we be sure thatit includes expertise on fraud, rape or other serious offences?It is perfectly legitimate, and in the interests of value formoney, that the accused should be entitled to take advice fromthe representative best able to handle such a case. I find theamendment profoundly objectionable. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman has experienceof such matters. Does he agree that there may be times, such asat the proverbial 2 o'clock in the morning, when a defendantmight be so drunk that he is probably incapable of making adecision? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree. Such a defendant may not be only drunkbut in shock at having been arrested&#151;especially if thepolice have knocked his door down and carted him off to thepolice station. He may be in shock because it is 7.30 am; itseems to be customary for the police to arrest suspectedmalefactors at dawn. Consideration of such circumstances tendsto encourage the view that, although it is in the interests ofthe accused to secure representation as quickly as possible, thatdecision should not be a final one that he cannot varythereafter, even though it might be prefectly reasonable for himto do so. 
<P>
To return to the question that I asked the Minister aboutsubsequent double booking, I accept that clause 14 appearsprincipally to apply to people who are arrested and held incustody. I agree that, hitherto, the Bar has not featured much,if at all, in the operation of such schemes. However, the trendis towards services provided by barrister and solicitor-advocatesmerging and becoming similar. That raises a question. If theMinister is right, one-man solicitor firms, which in myexperience are good at providing duty solicitors, will be unableto do so, because they will fall foul of the amendment if they 
cannot be present in two places at once to represent thedefendant. I understand that.  
<P>
The Minister may say that franchises and contracts will beawarded only to large firms with large numbers of people.However, that is peculiarly discriminatory, and not necessarilyin the interests of justice. Furthermore, like my hon. andlearned Friend the Member for Harborough I cannot understand thedifference between being represented by two different barristersor two solicitors from different firms and two different partnersin the same firm. The problem of reinstruction would still arise.I do not recognise the force of that argument. 
<P>
Serious consequences could flow from the amendment, which hasnot been properly thought through. I have been prepared to listento the Minister carefully, and I hope that he will reconsider it.He seems to be trying to prevent someone making a swap whensubstantial costs have been incurred. If the existing system isopen to abuse, I am convinced that a better way of dealing withthat problem can be found than the sledgehammer approach ofsaying that once a person has chosen his representative at theearliest possible stage, he cannot resile from that decision. Theinterests of justice will not be served by that approach. 
<P>
Our amendments are designed merely to highlight that point,although I shall touch on amendment No. 123 only. Anxiety hasbeen expressed about the extent to which the clause is designedto further the Lord Chancellor's empire in acquiring most of thework. If the salaried solicitors employed by the Criminal DefenceService are going to do most of the work, work will be creamedoff. That is undesirable, because it will affect freedom ofchoice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I hope that it will not alarm Opposition Membersif I say that there is not much between us. The matter turns onthe use of the word ``choice''. The Government have made it clearthat defendants will be able to choose a representative fromamong those who have been able to demonstrate that they arecapable of providing a high-quality, expert service in legalrepresentation before the criminal courts. A range of people willbe available. 
<P>
If I understood Conservative Members properly, they believethat defendants before the criminal courts should be free tochoose any lawyer. As in the example that the hon. Member forBeaconsfield graphically and effectively outlined, they shouldbe able to choose anybody from the telephone directory, eventhough that person may be an expert conveyancer. I assume thatthe hon. Gentleman was suggesting that people should be able tochoose an expert conveyancer to represent them before thecriminal courts. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is completely distorting my argumentin an extraordinary fashion. Immediately after an arrest, someonemay choose a lawyer from the contract and franchises that theMinister has identified. That lawyer will be chosen for theimmediate task of being present while that person is interviewedand to advise him of his immediate rights. However, that lawyershould not thereafter be a fetter on the person's discretion toobtain different representation to conduct the legal proceedingsthat may follow. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I did not deliberately seek to distort the hon.Gentleman's argument. I had not understood clearly what he hasnow explained. His contribution was different from that made by 
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, but I shall pass overthat slight discrepancy. My distinct impression was that the hon.and learned Gentleman called for much wider choice to be madeavailable. I shall return to the duty solicitor scheme shortly. 
<P>
Clause 15 will bring schedule 3 into effect and will placea duty on the Legal Services Commission to provide representationwhen an individual has been granted a right to representation inaccordance with schedule 3. It will also provide forrepresentation to be given in other circumstances prescribed bythe Lord Chancellor. It will enable the commission to comply withits duty to provide representation by entering into contractswith lawyers or non-lawyers in a variety of different ways, andas we discussed on clause 14. 
<P>
Contracting will enable the Government to protect theinterests of individuals involved in investigations and criminalproceedings and will ensure that they have fair treatment whileproviding high-standard, quality-assured services. We alsoconsider that it is important that those services should bepurchased at an affordable cost. They will, therefore, providebest value for money. That is why the powers to restrict thechoice and numbers of representatives are necessary and, indeed,desirable. 
<P>
For example, someone who needs advice at a police stationwill be able to choose any solicitor who has a contract with theCriminal Defence Service or to call on a duty solicitor. Thesolicitors chosen at that stage will be expected to continue torepresent the client for the lifetime of the case, unless thereis a compelling reason to change. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield objects to that proposal.Perhaps, he can draw on his memory of the days when he practisedcriminal law. There are essentially two groups of defendants. Thefirst is those who have appeared before and are familiar withbeing charged and brought before the courts. They are likely tobe familiar with the names of solicitors. Solicitors namescirculate fairly freely among people in that position, so thatgroup will be able to ask for a particular one. The other groupis people who do not have much experience of being charged andappearing before the courts. They do not know the names ofsolicitors. 
<P>
The first category will be able to say that they would prefera different solicitor to represent them subsequently. They willprovide the names to those who are present, and they will be ableto use the other solicitor, provided that he has a contract underthe proposed arrangements. They will not be disadvantaged orconstrained and there will be none of the harm to the interestsof justice that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield suggested. Ifsomeone has failed to say that he would prefer to be representedby another solicitor, why should the public not contemplate hiscontinuing to benefit from the high-quality, assured service thatthe duty solicitor provides?

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Surely those people did not have the opportunityto make an informed choice. When they are arrested, they may behappy to rely on the services of the solicitor who is offered tothem. That is what happens under the duty solicitor system. Onbeing released on bail the following day, they will take adviceand speak to people who might say, ``Your particular problem isdealt with very well by another franchised and contractedsolicitor with an excellent track record.'' At that early point, 
the Minister intends to deny defendants the opportunity to makethat swap. He will come a cropper under article 6.1 of the HumanRights Act 1998. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have repeatedly made it clear to the Committeethat all the provisions of the Bill have been tested against theHuman Rights Act. 
<P>
Leaving that aside, I still do not believe that the hon.Gentleman is dealing with the reality of the cases that I amdescribing. It is likely that someone with a specialist case,such as fraud or one that involves technology and othersophisticated matters, will be referred to a specialist solicitorwho practises in that area and has the relevantexpertise&#151;to suggest that someone might say in respect ofrun-of-the-mill cases, ``I know someone who specialises instraightforward domestic burglaries or shoplifting from Marks andSpencer'' is nonsense. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman haspersisted with that line of argument for so long. 
<P>
I am talking about straightforward cases that are dealt within court each day. The presumption of continuity that I set outwill stop the delays that can occur when adefendant&#151;usually a sophisticated defendant, who knows theropes&#151;plays the system and deliberately changes his lawyerin mid-case to spin it out. The hon. Gentleman should know wellfrom his previous legal experience that that happens all thetime. 
<P>
Instead of that manipulation of the system, we are offeringquality assured representation, which limits choice to contractedor employed lawyers in almost all circumstances. This clause,together with clause 14, provides the flexibility to continue tomake payments to persons or bodies in respect of representationuntil a full range of contracts is developed. 
<P>
I have accepted that, for very expensive cases whenspecialist skills are required, the Criminal Defence Service willestablish and maintain a panel that has met pre-determinedcriteria and which has demonstrated its ability in such cases.It may be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon toknow that we anticipate that, in achieving value for money, thecircumstances in which Queen's counsel act alone or those inwhich more than one advocate might be instructed will besimilarly limited. 
<P>
In certain exceptional circumstances, it will be possible forthe court or the Criminal Defence Service to assign arepresentative to the defendant, but the provision ofrepresentation for exclusive contracts with quality assuredsuppliers and, where necessary or appropriate,commission-employed lawyers is an essential building block in thecreation of a fair, efficient and modern criminal defenceservice. Accordingly, our ability to limit the choice of thoseneeding representation to quality assured suppliers is alsoessential.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 60, leaveout lines 17 to 31. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to takeGovernment amendments Nos. 29 and 30. 
<P>
<H5>11 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 deal with matters ofdrafting and I shall not detain the Committee on them. AmendmentNo. 30 is intended to place the court under a duty to considerwithdrawing a right to representation in limited and prescribedcircumstances. The existing legal aid scheme provides for avariety of circumstances in which a legal aid order can bewithdrawn or revoked. The Bill as drafted gives the court ageneral power to withdraw a right to representation. Regulationswill prescribe many of the existing situations that merit powerto withdraw a right to withdrawal of legal aid under the presentscheme, and to give the court the duty to consider withdrawinga right to representation in certain new, prescribedcircumstances. 
<P>
It is intended specifically to place the court under a dutyto review the need to continue representation, where a change ofcharge no longer merits representation. A right to representationmay no longer be in the interests of justice because the basisupon which the charge is put has changed, or a substantiveoffence has been withdrawn, leaving offences that do not, inthemselves, merit representation. 
<P>
It is also intended to prescribe circumstances where theindividual has failed to co-operate with a means inquiry underclause 17. In the Crown court, a judge may wish to consider arecovery of defence costs order, where there is reason to believethat an individual could afford to pay for his or her owndefence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Will the Minister clarify the sort of offencesthat will be substituted and give examples of cases in which thewithdrawal of representation would be sanctioned? The measuresare disturbing, especially in the light of the Human Rights Act1998, which the Government wish to observe, on the need toprovide representation in criminal cases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There could well be circumstances in which a chargeof causing death by dangerous driving, for example, which wouldundoubtedly merit representation, might end up as a carelessdriving charge, which might not. The powers have been carriedover from existing legislation into the Bill and are essentiallygeneral. They contain nothing remarkable or revolutionary and aredesigned simply to ensure that the sorts of circumstances inwhich a legal aid order may at present be revoked could continueto be revoked.
<P>
I have already mentioned failure to co-operate. If anindividual fails to co-operate with a request to providefinancial details, the court would also be under a duty toconsider withdrawing the right to representation. I commend theamendments to the Committee.

The schedule is an illustration of one of the great problemsof the Bill: it is no more than a collection of coat-hangers ora Christmas tree, on which the Government or the Lord Chancellormay simply hang what they think appropriate. It may be said thatprevious legislation has also done that, but that does not makeit right. Far too many secondary powers are being given toMinisters to amend primary legislation and to make up the law andstatutes as they go along. It will happen, but I regret it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman repeats a point that he has made throughout our proceedings. He acknowledged that itis common practice in such legislation in existing legal aidrules and in other technical areas. The hon. and learnedGentleman is a skilful lawyer and he knows that the alternativeis to set out all the rules in great detail in primarylegislation, which would mean that our primary legislation wouldbe even greater than it is&#151;it is already far toovoluminous&#151;and would make the process of changing some ofthe technical provisions extraordinarily difficult. Theprotection afforded is the provision for affirmative resolutionwhere regulations are required so that they come before aCommittee of the House and are debated by hon. Members. That isthe appropriate protection for those technical regulations. Noprovisions of major policy are involved in the delegation of theregulations and, as I have said before, this is a practical wayof properly implementing technical rules.
