						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000293"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The amendments make technical changes to part 4
of the Mental Health Act 1983 and correct minor inconsistencies that
have crept into the legislation. They are intended to maintain the
independence and integrity of the second opinion appointed doctor who,
under part 4, has various roles in safeguarding the patient by
providing a second, independent opinion on certain issues.</div>
					<a name="07050818000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 42
will ensure the independence of the SOAD, who certifies treatment under
section 57 of the 1983 Act, among other things. The section covers
psycho-surgery and other treatments referred to in regulations and is
used only a few times a year. None the less, it is important to ensure
that the legislative framework is robust. At the moment, a person in
charge of a section 57 treatment who is not an approved clinician could
technically be appointed as the SOAD who certifies the treatment.
However neurosurgeons who perform psycho-surgery, for example, are
unlikely to be clinicians. In practice, it should not happen, but to
put it beyond doubt, the amendment makes it clear that the person in
charge of a section 57 treatment cannot also be the SOAD who certifies
the treatment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>
					<a name="07050818000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendments Nos. 67,
68, 69 and 70 deal with the SOAD&#146;s duty to consult two other
people who are professionally concerned with a patient&#146;s
treatment before deciding whether treatment under sections 57, 58 or
58A should be certified. We want a variety of views to inform the
SOAD&#146;s decision. At present, the 1983 Act requires the SOAD to
consult one person who is a nurse and one person who is neither a nurse
or a doctor. The amendments will ensure that neither of the people
consulted can be the patient&#146;s responsible clinician
or, where different, the person in charge of the treatment. Of course,
the SOAD will discuss the treatment with the person in charge, but by
placing a duty on the SOAD to consult other professionals, we will
ensure that a broad range of perspectives are taken into
account.</div>
					<a name="07050818000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 45 makes it clear that the person in charge of a section
57 treatment can carry out all the statutory functions pertaining to
that role, which includes providing a report to the Mental Health Act
Commission on the treatment of a patient&#146;s condition, whether or
not they are an approved clinician. There is an anomaly at the moment
in that such functions can be carried out only by an approved clinician
in charge of the treatment, but there is no requirement for the person
in charge of a section 57 treatment to be an approved clinician. Of
course, the Bill will require an approved clinician to be in charge of
any part 4 treatment under powers given by the 1983 Act without having
to consult. No professional may be in charge of a treatment that they
are not required to deliver.</div>
					<a name="07050818000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the amendments will
iron out inconsistencies in part 4 that would otherwise flow from the
introduction of the role of approved and responsible
clinicians.</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050818000294"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Good morning and welcome to
the Chair, Mr. Cook.</div>
					<a name="07050818000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the spirit of the
Minister&#146;s presentation of the amendments and her wish to have a
Bill that is technically well founded. I am not seeking to overturn the
substance of the amendments, but I have two questions that perhaps go a
little wider than they might seem. They are designed to get her
assurance about the equality of position and equality of influence of
the two people responsible for the process.</div>
					<a name="07050818000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a person is not a medical
practitioner, but is some other person responsible for treatment, will
the Minister assure us that their views will be treated in good faith
and on an equal basis, and that there will be no question of what may
be termed professional brow beating? I am sure that the various
professionals will say that neither they nor their representative
bodies ever wish to brow beat, but there must be an equality of
treatment regarding those two persons, wherever they come from, in
relation to the certification process.</div>
					<a name="07050818000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second question relates to
amendment No. 45 and the issue of reporting, and what happens if a
person is not a clinician but is in charge of the patient and their
reporting. Can the Minister explain how such a report will deal
adequately with matters of professional judgment relating to the
clinical process itself? Presumably, as I think she has sought to
explain to the Committee, a person with care of the patient will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>know them as well as anybody could, and they have a perfectly legitimate
judgment to form and to pass on about the nature and progress of the
treatment. Again, I do not think that we want a situation in which
there is any inequity in treatment. I am referring here to my first
comment about whether or not the person who is responsible for signing
is or is not qualified in a particular discipline and also to whether
they are producing a report that is not informed by the professional
stamp of a registered clinician in that field. Those are minor
comments, but it might be useful to have the Minister&#146;s
reassurances on them&#151;or reflections on them if that is
easier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000295"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I certainly hope that there would not be
professional brow beating in those circumstances. As I have said, the
amendments are largely technical and aim to preserve the independence
of the second opinion appointed doctor. Perhaps it will help if I
clarify the fact that the legislation has never required an approved
clinician to be in charge of section 57 treatments. To answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, those treatments can be given only with
the patient&#146;s consent. It is the patient&#146;s consent that
gives the authority to deliver the treatment, and not the powers of the
Mental Health Act 1983. Therefore, we think that it is unnecessary for
the treatment to be in the charge of a clinician approved to apply the
Act. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>

							<b class="B">Angela

given only with consent. Is the hon. Lady making a cross-reference to
the Human Tissue Act 2004 and some the capacity issues regarding
decisions that can be made on behalf on an individual? Section 57
treatments cannot be given to somebody without capacity. The issue of
removal of tissue for use in research would not apply in the way that
she is talking about. If an individual does not have
capacity,section 57 treatments cannot be applied.</div>

					<a name="07050818000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Cook, after the weekend
break. This is an important clause about children and young people, one
of the six main-ticket items that attracted significant amendments and
debate in the House of Lords. I notice that in response to Government
amendment No. 21, which would have omitted all of clause 24 but has not
been selected, you have allowed a clause stand part debate as part of
the second grouping. Therefore, I shall not speak generally about the
clause now, but reserve my comments until that
debate.</div>
					<a name="07050818000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
62 is a small technical amendment reflecting the Government&#146;s
concerns about the amendments tabled in the Lords. It is an attempt to
allay those concerns and improve the original Lords amendment. The
addition of clause 24 has placed three main considerations in the Bill
to ensure that age-appropriate treatment, decisions and care settings
are provided for children and young people, who I think all Committee
members will agree are particularly vulnerable among those suffering
from mental illness, and who have not been receiving mental health care
that is as good and appropriate as they need and are entitled to
receive.</div>
					<a name="07050818000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the whole Committee agrees that we need to improve the situation. The
argument between the Government and the Conservatives is whether that
should be done on a statutory basis or through service provision. We
think that the Government have had quite long enough to make those
improvements through service provision, and that that has not proved
effective. That is why we agree with the Lords amendments, which were
supported by Members from a number of different parties, including some
Labour Members of the other House. We need to legislate on
age-appropriate care in the Bill in order to give a fairer deal to
children and young people in mental health
services.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, as ever.
There is a serious human rights question mark over the absence of
age-appropriate treatment in the original Bill, and as he mentioned,
inappropriate detention is subject to legal challenge. We know from the
Minister&#146;s earlier deliberations that she is keen that the Bill
should not become a bean feast for lawyers,so the amendment is
partly an attempt to finesse the new sections to give clarity to
practitioners and avoid challenge in the
courts.</div>

					<a name="07050818000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section
142D to the 1983 Act, under the heading &#147;Clinical
supervisor&#148;, was originally added to the Bill to stress that if
a patient is a minor under 18, the responsible clinician should be a
child and adolescent mental health specialist. The point that we have
been making for a long time now is that there is a shortage of child
and adolescent mental health services within the mental health service
and that children and young people can have particular needs that are
distinct from those of adults. That is why we are concerned about the
number of children and young people being placed in adult mental health
acute wards.</div>
					<a name="07050818000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
retrospect we feel that the wording of newsection 142D could
be slightly restrictive. I know that the Government objected to our
insistence that a CAMHS registered medical officer should always be
used for a child. In circumstances in which a young person between the
ages of 16 and 18 is placed appropriately on an adult ward, it would be
more appropriate for them to have an adult RMO. The important thing is
that the young person gets treatment as soon as possible and that the
treatment is as appropriate as possible. Amendment No. 62 would
therefore give some flexibility to the clinician undertaking an
assessment of a minor&#146;s needs in accordance with new section
142B, which was added in the House of Lords, and leave it up to him to
consider whether the registered medical practitioner responsible for
the minor&#146;s care and treatment in hospital should be a child
specialist.</div>
					<a name="07050818000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
listened to some of the Government&#146;s objections, just as we hope
they will listen to ours. We know that the Government want to ditch the
whole clause in any case, so this issue will be something of a problem
if they get their way on that. Nevertheless, we believe that clause 24
is a useful addition to the Bill. It brings useful safeguards for young
people, and amending new section 142D would take away one of the
Government&#146;s objections as to constraining the clinician who
will be responsible for the young person on an adult mental word. That
is the purpose of this amendment. I hope that the Minister will take it
in the positive, constructive spirit in which it is intended and feel
able to accept it.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I generally support the
amendment, with one small caveat. I do not think that we want to move
towards an absolute apartheid in the delivery of services. I should
like to illustrate that point by referring to local services in my
constituency, where there are well developed early intervention teams
for adults. One thing my CAMHS specialist told me is that when early
intervention is required in the case of children, it is not provided
simply because it is called an early intervention scheme for adults, so
children get no service or intervention of any kind. With that caveat,
I think that everything that the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham has just said is entirely sensible and laudable, and can be
supported.</div>

					<a name="07050818000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						May I ask
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham a question about
emergency situations? In the clause as it stands, the phrase
&#147;except in an emergency&#148; appears in new sections 142C and
142D, which is reassuring, but it does not appear in new section 142B.
I should like the hon. Gentleman to explain why he feels that emergency
situations would be covered if the words did not appear in the
provision. In the amendment, which would replace new section 142D with
a new set of words, the words &#147;except in an emergency&#148;
disappear. It refers back to new section 142B, which, as I said, does
not contain a caveat about emergencies. Are we making the legislation
stricter rather than more flexible with regard to
emergencies?</div>
					<a name="07050818000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain why that point matters. In my preparations for dealing with the
Bill, I saw two sets of psychiatrists in two places in my constituency.
On both occasions, the experienced psychiatrists said that they were
sure that in their careers, they had saved the lives of youngsters by
admitting them to an adult ward because a children&#146;s or young
persons&#146; ward was not available. They were sure that those
youngsters would have committed suicide had they not admitted them. In
making well intentioned legislation, I should not like us accidentally
to overlook the opportunity to save some
lives.</div>

save somebody from committing suicide. One of the psychiatrists who
said to me that he was sure that he had saved lives by
admitting&#151;inappropriately, as it were&#151;patients to an
adult ward, also said, &#147;For goodness&#146; sake, do not
legislate for new duties and requirements for us without providing us
with the resources to comply.&#148; That is an important message for
us all to bear in mind as we legislate.</div>

						</b> Would you like me to answer the question for the
hon. Member for Stafford? I shall answer his question; I do not think
he was intervening on me, as I had finished. That is why I am slightly
confused. I completely concur with his concerns, which is why the
understanding that emergencies override everything was implicit in how
the new clause was added in the Lords. He is absolutely right to say
that, regarding the admission of a young person in an emergency because
of severe self-harm or because they may do harm to others and have a
severe psychotic incident, the key thing is get them into a safe,
secure environment where professionals can take care of them. If a
CAMHS specialist happens not to be available at that time, clearly that
should not be a hindrance to taking the young person to a place of
safety and dealing with them. In no way would the emergency scenario be
moved down the hierarchy because of the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07050818000310"></a>
								Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend not agree that the converse
also applies? Although emergency admissions may have taken place for
the well founded reasons that he has described, there is a concern that
if there is a shortage of resources in child mental health to
accommodate a person&#146;s rehabilitation or recovery from the
psychotic incident, the Government&#146;s proposal may not
sufficiently tie down the obligation to provide that
care.</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000311"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. Emergency provisions
should not be a substitute for appropriate and sufficient services for
the young person. I completely agree with the exhortation of the
professional who was cited by the hon. Member for Stafford: we should
not legislate without giving due resources to ensure that the services
are available. The services, not the legislation per se, will save such
a young person and, one hopes, put them on the road to recovery. The
services must obviously take
precedence.</div>
					<a name="07050818000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would refer to the opinion of the clinician the question
whether a CAMHS specialist is warranted in a particular case. It does
not propose that it must be a CAMHS specialist in an emergency or
non-emergency situation who orders the sectioning. It would give a
degree of flexibility to the clinician. The fears of the hon. Member
for Stafford should therefore be allayed. Certainly that point will
become clearer in the clause stand part debate, in terms of
establishing the emergency hierarchy. However, I can certainly assure
him that in no circumstances is it intended that there should be any
different treatment for
emergencies.</div>
					<a name="07050818000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
begin to debate later how long such an emergency lasts. For example, if
children and young people in an emergency are sectioned to an adult
ward, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>which is not appropriate, should that situation continue for longer than
48 hours? I think that, after such a delay, it is right that there
should be a statutory requirement that the young person should be
transferred, where appropriate, to age-appropriate
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="07050818000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
debate later what constitutes an emergency&#151;a subject raised by
my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East just now.
However, I would have thought that 48 hours was a reasonable period
before alternative and more appropriate accommodation could be found. I
hope that the hon. Member for Stafford will be happy to support our
amendment.</div>

also oppose amendment No. 62. However, I also want to make it
absolutely clear at this point&#151;I will elaborate a little
later&#151;that that does not mean that we do not agree that this is
an important issue. Although we do not agree with the clause, we agree
with the principle. I hope to explain later not only what we are doing
to improve services, but why there are some particular problems at the
moment with the clause. I take on board the fact that Opposition
Members have tried to tackle one fault in the clause, as the amendment
would introduce some flexibility into the
arrangements.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Doug Naysmith</b> (Bristol, North-West) (Lab/Co-op): Although
this debate has been short, I think that it has covered the main points
relating to the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford made
clear the reasons why the Minister is not going to recommend the
acceptance of the amendment and the clause. However, the Minister must
be aware, as we all are, that there is widespread anxiety about the use
of adult psychiatric wards for children. I know that a commitment has
recently been given to eliminate within two years the use of adult
psychiatric wards for children under 16. Will she undertake to examine
this matter again, and perhaps propose a new measure at a later stage?
Clearly, the use of such wards for children is a problem, and it is
something that we must get rid of.</div>

concern about these issues. Indeed, he has made that point not only in
the House, but in meetings that we have had. I hope that, when we have
the clause stand part debate, I will be able to give him some greater
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07050818000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, however, our difficulty with the amendment is that it would not
only amend a clause that we have some real concerns about, but
introduce another fault in that it includes an assumption that there
will be a registered medical practitioner in charge of the child or
young person&#146;s case. In fact, under the Government&#146;s
proposals, the child or young person could be in the charge of a
responsible clinician who is not a registered practitioner. That goes
back to our debate on the important role of psychologists, which I
discussed at a recent meeting with
YoungMinds.</div>

preferable on the ground that it allows more flexibility.
However,clause 24 contains the words &#147;except in an

included in amendment No. 62, so it is not obvious to me that the
original wording is worse than what is proposed in the amendment or
that it does not guarantee a degree of

amendment is to the clause that is there at the moment. I said that it
would introduce a degree of flexibility, which would address one of the
problems that we have with it. I shall come to that in the clause stand
part debate. However, I also said that, while the amendment tried to
tackle that matter, it would introduce another fault, in that it
included the assumption that there would be a registered medical
practitioner in charge of the child or young person&#146;s case
whereas in fact, under the Government&#146;s proposals&#151;which
the hon. Gentleman opposed&#151;the responsible clinician in charge
of the case might not be a registered medical practitioner. When it
comes to looking after young children, the role of a psychologist can
be extremely important. That is why we are so concerned about the
attempts of the Opposition to undermine that role, and it is why I ask
the Committee to support us in opposing the

it matters not which&#151;with responsibility? I know that I have
missed something because I had to miss one of the debates last week. In
an emergency, at what point does the responsibility devolve to the
responsible clinician? Say somebody harms himself&#151;he may be
comatose&#151;and is admitted to an institution and sectioned. At
what point does the process move from the emergency, life-saving
services of a physical nature to the assessment and treatment stages?

practitioners; we do not seek to change that. As to the responsible
clinician, we are talking about a psychologist who would take over the
role of looking after the patient, which the hon. Gentleman opposed by
trying to delete clause 11. The responsible clinician will also
consider the renewal of detention. However, in the initial stages of an

argue forcefully that they should remain. I do not want to detain the

clause remains, it is slightly fatuous to push to a vote an amendment
to a clause that may not exist if the Government get their way. On that
basis, I will seek the Committee&#146;s leave not to press the
amendment at this stage, but to come back to it later. If we win the

						</b> The Government are opposed to clause 24

that we feel that this is an extremely important area that we want to
consider further. I shall come on to the reasons why we think that the
clause has some problems, and why we feel that it is important to say
that we can take it away and have a look at it. I recently had a useful
meeting with Barbara Hertz and Kathryn Pugh from YoungMinds, at which
we discussed how we could best tackle the issue of children and young
people being placed on adult psychiatric wards. I think that hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee, and Members of the other place,
have an agreement that under-18s should be placed on adult psychiatric

particular
circumstances.</div>

						</b> Will the Minister give us an idea how many
children are currently treated on adult wards? I have heard two
contradictory stories: one that the figure is around 1,000, and the
other that there are no accurate figures because only occupied bed days
are counted, not absolute numbers of
individuals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000323"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I should
say that the figures show, for example, that in some parts of the
country, there have been no bed days recorded at all for under-16s,
particularly over the last year. I shall come on later to set out the
programme that we have put in place to ensure that that does not
happen. With regard to 16 and 17-year-olds, the hon. Gentleman is right
to say that the measurement tends to be in bed days. When I saw that, I
thought that we should be talking about people here, and I want to look
at how we can record that more effectively. I think that there is a way
we can do that. The number of in-patient bed days has fallen, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>nevertheless, as the hon. Gentleman says, it is difficult to get a clear
understanding of what that means in terms of young people, and whether
it is about re-admissions. I agree that we need to look at that, and I
am actively doing so.</div>
					<a name="07050818000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the meeting that I had with
YoungMinds, it was fair to say that it acknowledged the progress that
we have made so far by implementing the Government&#146;s CAMHS
policies. There is no doubt that the central investment that is being
made has led to a major change on the ground. It has meant a
significant increase, for example, in multidisciplinary and joint
working across professions and agencies and has meant looking closely
at how some of the key players can be engaged in the development of
services at local level. We began collecting the information in 2005.
We need to be clear that such information was not collected before. We
started collecting information about the use of adult psychiatric wards
for children and adolescents so that we could performance-manage more
closely that aspect of the service. I accept that it relates to bed
days, but that is how such data are normally
collected.</div>
					<a name="07050818000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In November
last year, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the
Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), made a clear commitment
that within two years no child under 16 would be placed on an adult
ward in England while being treated for a mental disorder. The
Department is working closely with strategic health authorities to
ensure that that commitment is fulfilled. We intend to do so by writing
to SHAs, making clear our expectations with regard to children on adult
psychiatric wards, emphasising the commitment that within two years no
child under 16 will be treated on an adult ward. If a child of 16 or
under is placed exceptionally on an adult psychiatric ward, we expect
that to be reported to the Department as a serious untoward incident.
Furthermore, we expect that the child should not stay on the ward for
more than 48 hours, that the ward should be specially equipped to deal
with the child and that the staff dealing with the child should be
appropriately
qualified.</div>

						There
is a desperate move in this country to build new wards for teenagers
who have cancer. Will partnerships and joint funding be part of the
Minister&#146;s discussions with SHAs, in case new wards need to be
developed? I am sure that there are parts of the country where there
are none, as was the case with teenage cancer, but the Teenage Cancer
Trust put millions in, alongside the Government, to provide
wards.</div>

						<b class="B">Ms
Winterton:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Advantage
should be taken of the extra capital investment that has gone into
CAMHS services. It is important, especially in children&#146;s
services, to ensure that there is a close relationship between health
authorities and local authorities, for example. A multi-agency approach
can be extremely effective in ensuring that facilities are of a high
standard and that the exchange of information, which is so important,
takes
place.</div>
					<a name="07050818000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
have made it clear in our communications with the strategic health
authorities that they should check that adult wards are used only when
appropriate, in line with the best practice set out in the national
health service framework. It is important that responsibility is taken
at local level to manage the situation. We want local decision-makers
to decide what are their current problems and to ensure that they
achieve what we set out.</div>

							<a name="07050818000329"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I am rather concerned about responsibility being
devolved. The Government devolved the issue of mixed-sex wards in
general hospitals when they first came to office, but what we wanted
has not been delivered. Why should we be any more confident that the
same process, which is now being applied to children&#146;s mental
health services, should be any more successful than it was in respect
of mixed-sex
wards?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000330"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> First, we have checked on the mixed-sex ward
scenario, which is a slightly different debate. We set out that 99 per
cent. of wards should not be mixed-sex, and that target has been met.
The problem occurs in a very few places where those involved are
working with an old-fashioned set-up, for example, if they are waiting
for the completion of a new hospital that is clearly planned in
relation to the issue of mixed wards. However, that is not to say that
greater improvements cannot be made in that respect. In the reporting
of a serious untoward incident, we allow for a much greater view from
the centre to ensure that we can work with SHAs and primary care trusts
on performance management.</div>

							<a name="07050818000331"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> The Minister is completely detached from reality
if she thinks that 99 per cent. of hospitals have no mixed-sex wards. I
have been to brand new hospitals that are now having to revert to
mixed-sex wards because of the current deficit crisis in the NHS,
particularly with regard to mental health patients. Vulnerable children
are being placed not only on adult wards, but on mixed-sex adult wards,
which is particularly inappropriate; there have been several cases of
young girls being subject to sexual abuse from older patients of the
opposite
sex.</div>

						</b> As I said, the clause is about young people and
children on adult wards. We have taken some action through the service
where we want to improve the current situation. From whichever side of
the Committee they come, no hon. Member wants to perpetuate a situation
in which under-16s might be on adult wards. That is why we have taken
the action that we have.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000333"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> If I may be uncharacteristically ruder than my
colleagues, does the Minister agree that the issue is not the welcome
statement about putting responsibility on SHAs and health care
providers, but the concern that in devolving that responsibility she
might seek to deny her own responsibility and that of the Department
for managing the overall resources to avoid this deplorable
situation?</div>

						</b> No, I do not think that that is the case. If I
am allowed to continue, I hope that I will be able to indicate that we
are certainly not unsympathetic to the principles in clause 24.
However, it is important to have a service that actually delivers what
we want. To some extent, we can legislate all we like, but unless we
ensure that legislation is matched by services on the ground, there can
be unintended
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07050818000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

going to meet the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, but I
hope that she will meet the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales as

right that there should be discussions with Welsh colleagues in
developing all policy matters on the subject&#151;including when
there is a decision to legislate, and particularly on service
delivery&#151;so that people are comfortable with legislative changes
that affect service delivery. Legislation on service delivery is more
problematic than legislation that sets frameworks such as the one in
the Bill, which is concerned with compulsion under the Mental Health
Act, andclause 24 goes far beyond establishing a
framework.</div>

						The Government
have form in this area, do they not? The subject has been raised in the
context of the national service framework for children, and
specifically standard 9 of that framework. The Government have not made
material progress in achieving the relevant standards, and the
Department of Health set a public service agreement target that by the
end of 2006, comprehensive CAMHS will be available to everyone in
England who needs them. The Government have failed to deliver that, so
what has changed such that they can now assure us that they will
deliver appropriate services for young people, given that all the
evidence suggests that things are going backwards, with deficits
hitting CAMHS in particular? Does that not mean that there should be a
statutory requirement on
delivery?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000338"></a>
								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It is unfair on CAMHS to say that there have
not been changes. For example, the figures that I gave earlier show
that there has been a fall in relation to the dreaded bed days for
under-16s, so that in some areas there are now no under-16s on adult
wards. To say that there has not been improvement is quite wrong; there
has been massive investment in CAMHS, and some real changes in the way
in which services are delivered, through a sound multidisciplinary
approach. Some &#163;72 million of capital expenditure has gone into
CAMHS investment since 2004, so the changes are real, and they have
improved services and in-patient care. We should not denigrate
that&#151;it is &#163;72 million of investment that the Opposition
probably voted
against.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000339"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> In their response to the scrutiny Committee, the
Government agreed that generally all under-18s should be accommodated
in age-appropriate facilities. The right hon. Lady has not mentioned
much about 17 and 18-year-olds, but if she agreed with the principle in
her response to the scrutiny Committee, about which we had much
discussion, why will she not accept the new
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000340"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I admit that I am taking a tortoise-like
approach in reaching my conclusion. I want to reassure the hon. Lady
that I am not rejecting the principles of the new clause, but I want to
make sure that such legislation does not give rise to unintended
consequences. Obviously members of the Committee want to hear about our
problems with the clause, but I am willing to consider further whether
there is scope for such legislative provision, although it would
certainly have to have the right degree of flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07050818000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inflexibility of the clause
means that it could result in children and young people being treated
hundreds of miles away from their homes and families if there are no
empty CAMHS beds in the locality. Such a problem might result from the
clause. Opposition Members know about treatability from our many
discussions, and if there were the slightest suggestion that treatment
may be unlawful if someone was put&#151;even in an
emergency&#151;on a bed outside of the terms of the Bill, for
example, psychiatrists might consider that they had to turn someone
away instead of giving treatment. Such a situation would give rise to a
problem in respect of what becomes lawful and what becomes unlawful. We
must be realistic and ensure that the clause would not give rise to
such difficulties.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000341"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> The Minister was right to rehearse some of the
potential dangers, but does she agree that although the clause relates
to assessment and the involvement of child and adolescent mental health
specialists, it is silent as to the nature of that provision provided
that it is appropriate for the young person in question? Nothing in the
Bill says that matters must relate to a child ward, only that it is
something that must be
considered.</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000342"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Yes, and that might be one of the problems. If
there is a possibility that matters could be interpreted differently,
for example by case law, we would have to be careful that the Bill was
not allowing a situation to develop whereby treatment in certain
circumstances might become unlawful. The worry is that, if CAMHS were
not yet developed to the level that we would want to see, the
possibility of children going untreated might be a real
one.</div>
					<a name="07050818000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also
places a duty on PCTs
to</div>

and accommodation as are sufficient for the particular needs of that
child or young
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Placing
that duty on the PCTs might not be the right way forward. I have been
given the legal advice that YoungMinds received when it drafted parts
of clause 24. As I said to the charity, I want to look at the issue
with an open mind. I certainly agree that the principles outlined are
the right ones, but I cannot accept the clause as it stands at the
moment because there are some problems that I would need to look at
further.</div>
					<a name="07050818000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that gives the Committee some reassurance that I will certainly take
this matter away and look closely at it. I will continue to hold
discussions with YoungMinds and others, not only about their legal
advice but about the legal advice that we shall seek. I hope that the
Committee will therefore agree that the clause should not stand part of
the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07050818000343"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> As I said earlier, this is a very important part
of the Bill. It is possibly the one issue that has concerned most
people who have taken a close interest in the Bill across all the
parties. I pay tribute to the very strong case that has been put to the
Committee by YoungMinds. It has not only provided written submissions,
but held events in this place at which very brave young people who have
been sectioned to adult acute wards have given harrowing testimonies of
their experiences. Such testimonies were included in the witness
session that we organised two weeks ago. I urge hon. Members to read
some of those contributions, which have now been written up; I hope
that the document will be distributed to everyone later
today.</div>
					<a name="07050818000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a very
frightening experience for a young person to be placed in mental health
services. It is particularly frightening to be surrounded by adults who
have quite severe problems and, worst of all, to be placed as a young
teenage girl in a mixed-sex adult ward for any length of time. It is a
practice that I am sure all of us here would agree should not continue.
It is entirely unacceptable. It is not helpful to the therapeutic
treatment and recovery of the young person. We need to do everything we
possibly can to ensure that such practices do not happen in future.
That is why Opposition Members believe that we have reached such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>an important part of this debate. The only way to give a clear signal
that this should stop is to make it a statutory requirement within the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050818000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that the Minister agrees with the principles set out in the new clause,
but she must go further. She must provide a means whereby the intention
underlying those principles can be achieved as quickly as possible.
Although she tries to give us assurances by saying that she agrees with
the principles and is happy to take this away, I must respectfully
point out that she has had a lot of time to think about it. The mental
health tsar wants to find a non-statutory solution to the problem of
inappropriate treatment for young people. But the Government have had
nine years to look at this legislation and deal with that problem, and
they have failed to deliver the public service agreement for CAMHS for
young people.</div>
					<a name="07050818000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the reassurances of the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon.
Member for Bury, South, many of us do not hold out much hope about this
practice coming to an end within the next two years. It is unclear to
what extent it will be terminated&#151;a point that I shall come to
in a minute. Also, I believe that the problem is far worse than the
Government admit. The Minister rightly admits that counting bed days is
not appropriate and that we should be looking at real people, real
patients and real young people&#146;s experiences. The suggestion
from the experts and from the young people to whom we have spoken is
that the problem is far wider than the Government appreciate. It is
also being exacerbated by the current financial problems in mental
health services, which yet again are hitting young people&#146;s
services disproportionately.</div>
					<a name="07050818000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be interested the know
the outcome of the Minister&#146;s meeting with the Children&#146;s
Commissioner for England, who is on record as strongly supporting the
clause. The commissioner&#146;s submission to the Committee
states:</div>
					<a name="07050818000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioner welcomes the inclusion of these provisions, in particular
the requirement that the services and accommodation must be appropriate
to the particular needs of the
child.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commissioner
quotes figures from &#147;Pushed into the Shadows&#148;, a
hard-hitting report on the extent of the problem facing us, and refers
to the requirements placed on the Government under the United Nations
convention on the rights of the child. Referring to article 37(c) of
the convention, the commissioner&#146;s submission states:</div>
					<a name="07050818000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;States must separate
children deprived of their liberty from adults &#145;unless it is
considered in the child&#146;s best interests not to do
so&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must make their case regarding the circumstances in which
they think that it is in the child&#146;s best interest to be in a
mixed-age ward, let alone mixed-sex, other than in the emergency
circumstances on which I think we are all agreed. The Minister set a
threshold of 48 hours as the period suitable in an emergency, which I
mentioned earlier. The burden of proof must be on the Government to
show the circumstances in which they think it is appropriate that the
practice should be allowed to happen.</div>

than the figure given by his hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and
Southend, East suggested; I refer to the figure of 1,000 cases, which I
understand came from the Government. If that is the case, and if we

that if we pass the legislation, the measures will be enacted on the

following months or years when certain requirements made by the Bill
will come into operation. Those dates will send a strong signal to
primary care trusts that they will be required to arrange their
services and commit their resources in order achieve the objectives of
the legislation, which will become requirements as of a certain day. It
will not be that all hell breaks loose all of a sudden on the day of
Royal Assent. Hopefully, by then, the situation will be sorted out and
we will not be dealing with 1,000 legal cases. That is how all
legislation works. I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman thinks

needs to be a date on which regulations to accompany the Bill can be
introduced. Such a date does not need to be, and is not normally,
included in a Bill. There needs to be a sufficient lead-in time. If the

is important to get services and legislation in line. At the moment,
the bar for what breaches article 3 is extremely high, and it is
unlikely that any treatment given in hospital would be likely to breach

people were denied treatment because the legislation made it unlawful

closely.</div>

							<a name="07050818000353"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I shall come to that. I have not started the
comments that I wanted to make; I was just responding to the Minister.
The argument that some perverse incentive is occurring sounds good but
is not the case in practice. She said that if treatment became unlawful
even in an emergency, the responsible clinician would refuse to admit a
young person to an adult ward, and that psychiatrists would somehow be
incentivised to say, &#147;Sorry, no can do. We don&#146;t have a
CAMHS bed at the moment, and it would be inappropriate to admit you to
an adult bed, so we&#146;re not going to treat you at
all.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
contend that such a rejection by a responsible clinician who
appreciated the severity of that young person&#146;s mental illness
would return to hit the health trust and the clinician who had put a no
entry sign on the door much harder than the consequences of admitting
the young person in the short term to inappropriate care. If the
Government are serious, however, about delivering the public service
agreement on CAMHS-appropriate treatment, they should be worried about
it. If they are serious about providing CAMHS-appropriate treatment up
and down the country that is fit for purpose for young people, no
psychiatrist should be put in that situation anyway. The Minister is
undermining her own argument and boosting my concern that the
Government will not deliver on services for young people. She herself
seems to lack confidence that they will, which is why it is so
important to have a statutory requirement sending out a clear signal
that that is a serious priority that PCTs must deliver
on.</div>

repeated another fallacy that I am getting rather tired of hearing. She
was not at the witness session two weeks ago, or the special meeting
organised by YoungMinds involving a number of young people. Those young
people were asked categorically, &#147;Imagine an age-appropriate
acute ward with a CAMHS specialist that was sensitive to your medical
and other social needs and offered you all sorts of additional care,
including education opportunities for those who were there for a long
time. If you had to choose between such a ward several hundred miles 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>away and a less appropriate adult mental health ward within bus distance
of your family, which would you prefer?&#148; Without exception, all
those young people said that they would like to have, without question,
the services more appropriate to them. That is absolutely
key.</div>

Government are confident that they are going to roll out a countrywide
CAMHS service under the public service agreement&#151;which they have

they worried about? Those facilities should be available, not hundreds
of miles away, but in most cases, in the locality. Trying to create
this ridiculous either/or situation&#151;either they have to travel
hundreds of miles away, and they never see their family, or at least
they can go somewhere local and keep seeing their family&#151;is not
realistic. It is certainly not realistic if the Government are genuine
about delivering what they say they are going to deliver without a
statutory requirement.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend will be aware that the Government
have only recently restructured regional health services yet again,
with PCTs now being county-wide, in order to provide these very
services&#151;in other words, specialisms within a county or a group
of counties. In the west country, we have already had a consultation on
whether children&#146;s services should be in Plymouth or Bridgwater.
If this is already under way, I do not buy the Minister&#146;s
argument that somehow this is not
do-able.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000355"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The
Government cannot have it both ways. Either services are being
reconfigured to produce an improvement, in which case young people will
not need to travel hundreds of miles, and psychiatrists will not have
to turn people away at the door simply because there are not CAMHS beds
available, or they are not, in which case the statutory duty in this
legislation is absolutely
essential.</div>
					<a name="07050818000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
Government are arguing against the reassurances that they are giving us
to convince us not to require that the clause remain in the Bill. When
the Minister responds, perhaps she can back whichever horse she thinks
she needs to reassure
us.</div>
					<a name="07050818000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back to the
scenario of the psychiatrist saying, &#147;No, we are not going to
admit you, even though you have a serious illness, because we
don&#146;t have appropriate beds&#148;, I had a most serious case
in my constituency a few years ago. A teenage girl had a long series of
mental illnesses, and was in a very desperate state. In the end, she
was turned away when she was in a state of crisis from an acute mental
hospital in Worthing in my constituency. Such was the desperation to
take her own life that her father assisted her in committing suicide,
and was accused of manslaughter and convicted, with mitigating
circumstances. It was a most tragic case. She had been turned away on
weak grounds from that hospital, and the comeback was not on the way in
which the legislation is framed. It was on the failure of the services
to pick up that girl and give her the treatment that she required and
deserved.</div>
					<a name="07050818000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the way
in which the legislation is framed creates no perverse incentive for
the system to turn people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>away. I fear that in the case in Worthing the problem was a weakness in
the services, and that the trust did not give sufficient priority to
providing services for children and young people. That was a serious
incentive for it to get its act together. I fear&#151;I am
glad&#151;that there are parts of the country where we have not had
such a drastic incentive for a mental health trust to improve its
age-appropriate services.</div>

							<a name="07050818000356"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> The Minister seeks to defend her position by
saying that there is a danger of action under the European convention
on human rights claiming inappropriate treatment. If clinicians opted
for denying treatment altogether, in the circumstances that my hon.
Friend has just described, would the public authorities not then be at
risk of action under article 2 of the convention, which is on the right
to
life?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000357"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is far more expert than I am on
all the various clauses of the convention. He reinforces his point
that, as the legislation stands, this measure could be a
lawyers&#146; field day, without the addition of the amendments made
in the Lords.</div>
					<a name="07050818000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
the Minister that clause 24 was added to the Bill in the Lords with
enormous cross-party backing, led by Cross Benchers; Lord Williamson
led on this amendment. The amendments were passed in the Lords by a
very substantial margin, by a vote of 201 to 126. This was not just
some political gamesmanship in the upper House; there was very solid
support for these amendments. Really, there is a much greater onus of
proof on the Government to say why all those Members of the House of
Lords, including mental health practitioners and people who were
previously high-ranking figures in the NHS&#151;people who know what
they are talking about&#151;were wrong and why the Minister is right,
not just in principle but in practice.</div>
					<a name="07050818000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Patel played an important
part in that debate in the other place. He is chair of the Mental
Health Act Commission. The commission&#146;s report produced some
stark figures, saying
that</div>
					<a name="07050818000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;between April 2003
and October 2006, 1308 under-18s were detained in adult psychiatric
units with no special safeguards in place; and 27 of these children
were under the age of 14 - one as young as ten. 322 out of 409 girls
were placed on mixed-sex wards, and staff understanding and knowledge
of child safeguarding issues was unclear. Adult units were unable to
provide for the child&#146;s
education.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Patel
said in the
Lords:</div>
					<a name="07050818000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
the Mental Health Act commissioners asked ward staff whether there were
any plans to transfer the young person or child to more appropriate
surroundings within the next seven days, there were no such plans for
nearly three-quarters of the children. That is 959 children with little
or no prospect of moving from adult psychiatric wards. Only one-third
of the children...had a responsible medical officer who
specialised in child and adolescent psychiatry...It is also
notable that half...were classed as emergency
admissions.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15
January 2007; Vol. 688, c.
550.]</div>
					<a name="07050818000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is not the case that
these children are just there in an emergency&#151;what we would
interpret as an emergency&#151;and that after, say, 48 hours at most
they are moved on, however far, to CAMHS. These are children and young
people, some as young as 10, who are there for the long run. That
cannot be in their best interests and the Minister is underestimating
the scale of the problem.</div>

if the hon. Gentleman examined the MHAC report, or spoke to Lord Patel,
he could get a more detailed analysis of the figures.</div>
					<a name="07050818000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the figures reveal is
that, in certain parts of the country, there are enormous pockets in
which there is a lack of provision. However, if the Government offered
to roll out a public service agreement level across the country, not
just in Devon, or in West Sussex, or in Norfolk&#151;the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s own area&#151;things would be different. This
process should be country-wide, because this is a problem up and down
the country. It is a particularly stark problem in some of the inner
cities, and we have heard cases from London. It is a particular problem
in black and other ethnic minority communities; I will come on to that
point in a minute.</div>
					<a name="07050818000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figure of 322 out of 409 girls on mixed-sex wards&#151;not just adult
wards, but mixed-sex wards&#151;is really alarming. Those girls are
not there for 48 hours; they are there for many days, in some cases
weeks and in other cases, as we have heard directly from witnesses,
months. According to the RCP, when admissions for voluntary treatment
are included, that figure rises to more than 1,000 young people being
admitted inappropriately every year. There is good evidence to suggest
that that figure is growing, certainly in particular parts of the
country.</div>
					<a name="07050818000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s own national service framework standard 9 research
in 2006 revealed that</div>
					<a name="07050818000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only 25 per cent of children with
a diagnosed psychiatric disorder were accessing mental health services
over a three-year
period&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
					<a name="07050818000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;43 per cent did not
have contact with any professional.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking only of the children and
young people whom we know about&#151;the ones who get picked up by
the service. What we do not know about is the scale of the problem of
those children and young people who need treatment but who, for
whatever reason, do not present. One reason for that could be their
fear of being dumped in the particularly intimidating environment of an
acute mental health ward with adults and people of the other sex. Given
the option between that and staying under the clinical radar, I fear
that too many young people choose the latter. That surely is the worst
scenario of all. We know that that is where people&#146;s
condition&#151;not only young people&#146;s&#151;can worsen and
get out of
control.</div>
					<a name="07050818000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the point about the number of young people who act as carers for
parents or other family members who have a mental health condition. It
is estimated that out of 175,000 young carers in this
country&#151;some of them are very young&#151;around a quarter of
them could be looking after a parent or a member of the family who has
a mental health problem. We need to do a lot more to provide support
for those young people. I am glad that Baroness Royall in the other
place took this point on board and offered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>to go away and look at it to ensure that there was some reference in the
code of practice. Can the Minister report on what progress has been
made on that? I think that that issue is particularly worrying. We need
to deal with the young people looking after family members with mental
illness as well as the young people themselves.</div>
					<a name="07050818000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the problem goes
far wider than the Government admit. Although the Government quote some
figures that suggest that the problem is, in certain circumstances,
diminishing in some parts of the country, I think that the underlying
problem is
worsening.</div>
					<a name="07050818000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should

which was that</div>
					<a name="07050818000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;children
should not have to make do with services designed for adults, which
are, quite simply, inappropriate for
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to conventions throughout
the Committee. The Government have drawn up national service framework
requirements. They have broken their promises for a time scale on
public service agreements. They have responded to the Bristol inquiry.
They claim that they are taking the situation seriously, that they want
to achieve what we want to achieve, but we need to see the beef. We
believe that the only way of producing that beef is by keeping clause
24 in the Bill. The Minister has been quoted as saying that the clause
would create a legal and clinical straitjacket for clinicians. I think
that the Minister&#146;s choice of the word
&#147;straitjacket&#148; is not helpful and can be construed as
stigmatising. Perhaps somebody has ticked her off because she has not
used it this morning.</div>
					<a name="07050818000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has also told us
about the Government&#146;s latest new arrangements for PCTs to
notify the Department if children and young people under 16 are
admitted to adult wards. How will that work? What will the Department
of Health do on being notified by a PCT that there is a 15-year-old in
such and such adult mental health unit? Do the notifications include
only those who are there under compulsion, or do they include voluntary
admissions?</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="07050818000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is not the
problem that limiting the provisions to the under-16s sends out a clear
message to all 16 and 17-year-olds that it is perfectly acceptable for
them to be admitted to adult acute units? The Minister is bringing down
the barrier at 15 years, 11 months and 30 days, or however one
qualifies it. We have said all along that children are counted as
children until the age of 18, and that there should be an assumption
that they be given treatment appropriate to children until they reach
that age. The Government need to make the case for the few 16 and
17-year-olds for whom it may be appropriate to provide treatment in
adult wards.</div>
					<a name="07050818000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Between 2002
and 2005, the case load involving such children rose by some 40 per
cent. Where is the problem with those young people accessing treatment?
Will the Minister also comment on what happens in Scotland? Contrary to
a letter that was sent out by the Secretary of State after I challenged
her on the issue, practitioners in Scotland are very much in favour of
this sort of clause, which was included in the Mental Health (Care and
Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. They think that it is working in favour
of young people. Any small, short-term 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>discrepancies in the figures are largely down to the way in which
numbers were collected, or not collected, before. Scottish
practitioners believe that the amendment is working to the benefit of
young people, not to their disbenefit or as some sort of perverse
incentive, as the Government claim.</div>
					<a name="07050818000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to know the
circumstances; I want to see real examples of scenarios in which the
provision is acting as a perverse incentive in jurisdictions that have
included it in their
legislation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000360"></a>Dr.

						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some so-called

conditions for
them?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000361"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I think that I have just made that case. The
provision of such treatment for children and young people with
capacity, who are assessed as suitable for treatment in adult wards
with the agreement of clinicians, would not be undermined by the
clause. The assumption, however, must be that children and young people
are most appropriately treated by children and adolescent specialist
mental health services. That is how we see the equation, not the other
way around. I do not buy the Minister&#146;s argument that the
inclusion of the clause in the Bill could act as a disincentive. It
sends out a clear message, with which I think all members of the
Committee agree and with which the Minister says she agrees in
principle.</div>
					<a name="07050818000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
speak briefly to new clause 23, which is part of the group, I should
like to quote the legal opinion on the Mental Health Act 1983 and this
part of the Bill from Paul Bowen of Doughty Street
chambers,which was obtained by YoungMinds and to
whichthe Minister referred. Mr. Bowen said that
newsection 142B is necessary because there is no specific duty
on primary care trusts under the delegated functions that they exercise
under sections 1 and
3</div>
					<a name="07050818000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of the National Health
Service Act 1977 (now 2006) (NHSA) to
provide...healthcare&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">whether to a child or any other patient.
He quotes the case of R. v. Haringey borough council and Haringey PCT
in 2006, which referred to the contrast with the specific duty imposed
on PCTs and local authorities by section 117 of the Mental Health Act
1983 to provide free after-care services to all detained patients after
their discharge from hospital. He says that he does not consider that
the provisions will have the effect that the Government are
predicting.</div>
					<a name="07050818000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">So expert
legal advice has been taken which could help the Minister and perhaps
save public funds being spent on the Government&#146;s own legal
advisers. The Opposition position has not just been cobbled together;
the measures in clause 24 are clearly thought out and have been debated
in detail in the House of Lords, and they would stand up in law. The
whole clause inserted by the Lords merits retention in the Bill, and I
hope that the Minister will have second thoughts about it after the
debate.</div>
					<a name="07050818000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 23
is being considered as part of the stand part debate on clause 24. It
would insert a new clause on hospital and guardianship orders as an
additional provision following section 38 of the 1983 Act. The Offender
Management Bill is currently before 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>the Lords, and includes age-appropriate provision for under-18s, so it
is ironic to have to debate whether to give protection to under-18s in
custody detained under the mental health legislation. The new clause
would ensure that young people in custody who needed to be sectioned
under the Mental Health Act would get the same protection as those in
the criminal justice system. That is an appropriate safeguard given the
concerns about prisons being depositories for people with a mental
illness.</div>
					<a name="07050818000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
young people who are sectioned from youth custody or from prison can be
transferred to an adult psychiatric ward for care. The same arguments
apply to the very vulnerable group of young people who are not in the
custody system. They are at equal risk of witnessing or experiencing
verbal, physical or sexual abuse in the relevant institutions, or of
receiving limited or no access to education services, which is a point
that has emerged from many of the discussions that we have had with
young people. Such young people need to be able to carry on their lives
and their education, as well as to receive appropriate treatment for
their mental health condition so that when, as one hopes, they
ultimately recover, they have not missed out on that education. So it
is just as important to provide age-appropriate facilities in areas
that do not relate exclusively to health, and it is no good if the
treatment comes from professionals who are not experienced in
children&#146;s mental health needs.</div>
					<a name="07050818000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Offender Management Bill
contains provisions for treating under-18s in an appropriate
environment. Children in youth custody have high-level mental health
needs. According to the Youth Justice Board survey by Bailey and
Harrington in 2005, 31 per cent. of young people have a mental health
need, 13 per cent. have depression, 10 per cent. suffer from anxiety, 9
per cent. report self-harm in the previous month, 9 per cent. have
post-traumatic stress disorder, 7 per cent. have problems with
hyperactivity, and, most critically perhaps, 5 per cent. report
psychotic symptoms, which is a figure much higher than in the general
population.</div>
					<a name="07050818000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely,
therefore, it is appropriate to give that especially vulnerable group
protection equal to that given to those outside the custody system.
That is what new clause 23 would do. The debate on clause 24 stand part
and new clause 23 relates to probably the most vulnerable people with
whom the mental health services have to deal. It is essential that
their needs are recognised expressly in the legislation and that the
Government, the Opposition and the legislation that we enact all send
out a clear signal to service providers that proper protection is
expected. I am afraid that we have waited for too long for
age-appropriate treatment to be available up and down the country. That
is why the amendments that were so carefully inserted into the Bill in
the House of Lords remain essential to its integrity and effectiveness.
I very much hope that the Minister will not seek to remove the
clause.</div>

						</b> May I indicate in advance, Mr. Cook, that
I have an Adjournment debate at 1 o&#146;clock, so if I leave a
little bit early it will be due to nothing that you have said, and no
discourtesy will be intended to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07050818000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Minister said
that she wanted legislation with &#147;sufficient
flexibility&#148;. That is an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>intriguing and important remark, but it does not affect what is before
us now, which seems to be an attempt to remove clause 24 as it stands.
Before speaking to the Lords amendment, I must praise YoungMinds. If it
has achieved no more than this debate today, it has achieved an
enormous amount in driving the subject up the political agenda. Even if
nothing changes in legislation, it can claim a considerable
achievement.</div>
					<a name="07050818000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
24 stands out because it concerns a matter that was not part of the
draft Bill or the main debate between the Mental Health Alliance and
the Government, which has tended to centre on fundamental issues of
liberty, autonomy and safety. It has enormous cross-party support, even
from those with different attitudes to other clauses and issues. To an
extent, it is a test of the Government. If they remove clause 24, that
would have nothing to do with their original objectives in framing the
legislation. It would look like control-freakery&#151;a kind of
not-invented-here syndrome&#151;or would seem mean-spirited, and I
would not want to accuse the Minister of that.</div>
					<a name="07050818000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">To summarise, nobody thinks
that it is either desirable or acceptable for adolescents or children
to be on adult wards and not specifically catered for. Granted, the
word &#147;children&#148; includes a gamut of people. Hon. Members
might be intrigued to know that a lumping 16-year-old cannot be seen at
my local accident and emergency, even though he is very similar,
biologically, to the other people there. He has to go to a special
accident and emergency department for children, which is outside the
constituency. Children and adolescents are, to some extent, different.
There has been a debate about provision for children, which is
different from a discussion about provision for adolescents. Many
horror stories can be related in both cases. Adolescents have very
particular needs that should be catered for. If being adolescent is not
bad enough, being an adolescent with a mental illness is pretty
terrible.</div>
					<a name="07050818000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
has not so far been made that one should not over-generalise from the
horror stories. One does, however; one stigmatises the already
stigmatised. Most seriously ill adults are not naturally predatory or
aggressive. They are alarmingly vulnerable people. I say that as
somebody who, what seems like hundreds of years ago, worked in a mental
hospital among adults. The modern adult ward is not a 20th century
Bedlam; it is considerably superior to the old-fashioned mental
hospital in which I worked. Any hospital that is like that is a problem
for vulnerable adults as well as for children and adolescents. None the
less, we would all agree that it is not good to have children in adult
facilities. The most sane comment on that was made during the Lords
debate by Baroness Meacher, who said:</div>
					<a name="07050818000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The reality of adult
in-patient wards today is that staff are managing in-patients with ever
more serious and complex psychiatric disorders. Anyone who can be
managed in the community is managed by one of the community teams, even
if that involves daily visits&#151;three or four visits a
day&#151;and hours of every day being spent in that person&#146;s
home. The result is that any in-patient is likely to be severely
disturbed. You do not have the sort of balance that you had 10 years
ago where you had a number of reasonably stable patients and others who
were a bit more disturbed.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of

24.</div>
					<a name="07050818000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The House of Lords
amendment, which is now clause 24, allows children, in extremis, to be
on adult wards&#151;there is no question about that&#151;but bans
it as a general practice, and sets a clear standard. The Government
believe that that objective, which they share, should be a precept of
good practice; it should be monitored, it should be a departmental or
PCT objective or target, but it should not be in legislation. They give
two reasons for that. First, they suggest that it might be
counter-productive and, secondly, they argue that legislation is not
about provisions but about drawing up rules, regulations and so on.
Both arguments are flaky, but the first&#151;that it might be
counter-productive&#151;takes two forms. One suggests that if no
provision is available, none will be given; the other, which has been
used by the Government but is not being used today, is that the
legislation itself will make no difference; the example of Scotland is
cited, erroneously, in that
respect.</div>

					<a name="07050818000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has to be
accepted, even on the Opposition side of the Committee, that PCTs have
in the past shown insufficient appetite for bespoke provision, the
reasons for which are fairly straightforward. Bespoke provision is
expensive; demand, fortunately, is relatively limited and provision is,
perforce, often remote, because not every PCT feels justified in
providing a bespoke facility on the
doorstep.</div>

Boswell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this is a
sub-set of the endemic problem of mental health services of all kinds
across the country? Although it is one of the three central Government
priorities for improvement in health services, when it comes down to
the PCT, constituency or user level, mental health provision is still
being cut because of a variety of pressures, when other areas are being
safeguarded.</div>

							<a name="07050818000364"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I accept that. I was going to refer to an
Adjournment debate in the House, secured by the hon. Member for Wantage
(Mr. Vaizey), in which he said that children&#146;s mental
health services were being reduced, a major contributory factor being
that every PCT had a limited need for them and were therefore simply
not providing the cash. National facilities were needed, which no one
PCT, or group of PCTs, could adequately
afford.</div>

Park hospital closed its services to children it would leave the most
enormous gap in central and southern England and parents and children
would not be able to access appropriate in-patient
services.</div>

of the debate was the case for nationally funded, as well as PCT,
provision. In other words, national Government can walk away from their
responsibilities as PCTs do not have the capacity to achieve what we
all want.</div>

						I am not
arguing for absolute apartheid between children&#146;s and
adults&#146; services in all circumstances. I quoted the example of
the CAMHS unit in my constituency, which complained to me that it could
not get early intervention because in the area that is labelled
&#147;adult&#148;. It would be perfectly happy to have some help
from adult departments in order to do its job.</div>
					<a name="07050818000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not saying that
change&#151;for example, the change that has taken place in
residential care provision&#151;cannot be driven by regulation,
inspection and the spreading of good practice. Many years ago, I went
round social services homes where people shared rooms. They do not so
now; it is very different. Inspection standards, and standards in
general, have changed, which is a very positive development. I do not
recall legislation that changed that, but it changed none the less.
However, it is indisputably the case that primary legislation,
appropriately crafted, has a role to play, and can do so, although not
invariably.</div>
					<a name="07050818000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second Government argument is that legislation does not prescribe
resources; generally it does not, because any prescribing of resources
is a potential reduction in a limited budget elsewhere and there will
be a loss of discretion within limited budgets. However, legislation
can set a standard. Lord Williamson, responding to the argument that it
is never done, said in a debate in the House of
Lords:</div>
					<a name="07050818000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a

							<a name="07050818000367"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way. I realise that he is setting out all the arguments for the
Government to accept the proposal, but he is indicating that we are
turning our face against it. I do not know whether he was present when
I was speaking, or whether he and other Opposition Members had already
written their speeches, but I said clearly that we would take away the
issues as well as the clause, and consider them. I am curious as to why
the hon. Gentleman did not take that on board, as the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham has
done.</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000368"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I thought that I had conceded that, as I said that I
was arguing about what confronts us now rather than the jam that we
will be offered tomorrow. However, if the Minister wants to introduce
some new clauses, I am sure that we shall consider
them.</div>
					<a name="07050818000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s point about resources is valid and it is fair to
address it. My first experience of Richmond house was as part of a
delegation from my borough of Sefton when we visited Mr.
Boateng, a former Minister with responsibility for social services, to
complain about the failure to fund residential care adequately. A legal
case had taken place. I remember the scenario. There were no biscuits
or coffee. He swept in imperiously and told us what we had to do. We
left immediately. The pre-arranged press release was out on the streets
and there was not a word about the law not dictating resources or about
devolving decision making. Mr. Boateng had simply called us
in and told us what we had to do. I am not suggesting that that is what
the Minister does with the PCTs, but it was a sign of how new Labour
can operate when it wants.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>
					<a name="07050818000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are arguing about how to
obtain a given effect. The Opposition favour legislation. The Minister
possibly favours legislation, but hitherto has seemed to prefer other
methods. It is a pragmatic argument. We are not arguing about what we
want to achieve. Given the Government&#146;s record, at the moment
preference must be for primary legislation because that will provide
greater reassurance to the mental health community in
general.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000369"></a>Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> I agree with two things that the hon. Member for
Southport said. First, our mental health services are providing
services to vulnerable people every day. We owe them a debt of thanks
for their dedication, diligence and sheer hard work. However, young
people are doubly vulnerable, because in addition to the mental
disorder for which they receive treatment, they have the added
disadvantages of inexperience and immaturity. In that sense, it is
important to address them separately, as indeed we are now
doing.</div>
					<a name="07050818000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point on which I agree with the hon. Gentleman is the sheer power of
the lobby that has made the Government face up to their responsibility
in respect of children and age-appropriate services under the Bill. He
mentioned YoungMinds. I agree that it has been a formidable lobbying
group in respect of the Bill. It has also been very skilful, as the
Minister acknowledged earlier. While praising YoungMinds, I do not want
to overlook another group of organisations that has been equally
significant, such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, Barnardo&#146;s
and the NCH, and certainly the Children&#146;s Legal Centre for its
legal advice about the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050818000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am unhappy
that we have been asked to vote against the wording without having in
front of us the Government&#146;s alternative wording. Fortunately, I
have seen the Minister in action in the Committee. She has been
skilful, competent and reassuring, so I am willing to invest a little
trust in her bringing appropriate wording to us on Report. However, I
shall want to vote then to include in the Bill a provision that
recognises the special position of children and young adults.</div>
					<a name="07050818000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1983 Act does not
distinguish between the mental health needs of children and those of
adults. That is why there is no lower age limit for admission to
hospital. In the 15 January House of Lords debate to which the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred, Lord Patel described a
child as young as 10 years old being admitted to an adult ward. Let us
remember that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the statistics that Lord
Patel quoted in the debate were for the period between April 2003 and
October 2006, when 1,308 under-18s were detained in adult psychiatric
wards with no special safeguards in place. That is virtually one a day.
It is a shockingly high statistic, and the dangers are all too
apparent.</div>
					<a name="07050818000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham heard evidence directly from
young people who bravely came forward to tell of the appalling abuse of
their minds and bodies that they had suffered as a result of
inappropriate admissions to mental hospitals. Indeed, some of them have
had the courage to contact me directly, albeit through e-mail, to give
those accounts. I do not know whether they have contacted other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>Committee members. I feel that we have a responsibility to address their
concerns and put something into the Bill that satisfies their desires
for an improved service for children in
future.</div>
					<a name="07050818000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we
discuss what we want to be included in the Bill, it is fair to say that
the Government have moved already. The Bill contains a new test of
appropriate treatment, and the draft code of practice, which we
mentioned several times last week, contains many reassuring comments
about what appropriate treatment means for children and young people.
On page 30 there is a reference to age-appropriate
accommodation and at page 152 there is a whole section on
children and young people that specifically addresses not only the
appropriateness of their treatment in terms of the medicine or therapy
that is to be given, but issues about their continuing education while
in hospital and the accommodation being appropriate for their age and
wishes. All those things, which have happened already, are desirable
and good, but there is more still to be
done.</div>
					<a name="07050818000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
an earlier debate, I mentioned the absence from the clause of a direct,
specific exclusion for emergencies. The Minister has been able to say
something, but she is worried that there are psychiatrists and hospital
managers who would be worried, faced with an apparently absolute duty,
to find that conservative treatment in the community might be more
appropriate for a young person, rather than an admission to a bed that
they do not have. They might not overtly say, &#147;I refuse to admit
this child because I have not got a bed&#148;, but there are ways and
means, are there not? That is what my right hon. Friend the Minister is
warning us about. If the final consequence might be that some young
life is lost through suicide, it is important for us to address that
matter. We need the clause to contain slightly different
wording.</div>
					<a name="07050818000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Minister mentioned the Children&#146;s Commissioner for
England, whose report, &#147;Pushed into the Shadows&#148;, is a
dramatic reminder of how bad things can get for young people in mental
health institutions. In fairness, the commissioner said in his report,
in 2007:</div>
					<a name="07050818000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;PCTs
and mental health trusts should ensure that adult wards are not used
for the care and treatment of under-16s and, wherever possible, adult
wards should be avoided for 16 and 17-year-olds unless they are of
sufficient maturity and express a strong preference for an adult
environment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050818000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
demonstrates that it would be wrong to pick an age&#151;whether it is
16, 17, 18 or another one&#151;and say that there is one kind of
service for everybody over that age and a different kind for everybody
under it. That would be too
inflexible.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000370"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments closely. Does he not agree that the norm should be that
children and young persons, who are defined as those up to the age of
18, should be treated by children and adolescent-appropriate mental
health services and that the exception could be those 17 and
16-year-olds who may be more appropriately dealt with as determined by
the responsible clinician for adult wards? That is flexibility, but the
norm should be treating children and adolescents under children and
adolescent specialist services.</div>

object to the present wording because it does not quite make that
distinction between the norm and what might happen in extremis, as the
hon. Member for Southport said, which is a separate
matter.</div>
					<a name="07050818000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Services are
developing now that are not so limited. Perhaps I can boast about a
service in South Staffordshire, where the mental health trust
established what it said at the time was the first example of a young
persons&#146; centre addressing the gap in mental health services for
people aged 14 to 25. It is not just for those near to 18, but for a
broader group. This is a multi-agency service focusing on developing
early, easily accessible mental health care for young people, reducing
stigma, increasing awareness and promoting well-being. That is a
delightful development and one that I commend everywhere, but it does
not quite fit into our
discussion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050818000375"></a>Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> No, it is man named Mike Cooke who is the head of
the trust; he is open-minded about these issues and drove those
services forward. To finish the story, it is not just that centre. The
trust also has a children&#146;s council to ensure that the service
hears the views of service users, partner organisations and community
groups in respect of children&#146;s services. It takes a change of
culture and a change of thinking as well as a change in the law to make
things happen. Certainly it is our obligation in Parliament, however,
to make sure that the law is right. It will not be right if we accept
clause 24 as it is, and it will not be right if we simply delete it. We
need something new by the time we get to
Report.</div>
					<a name="07050818000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
conclude on issues that are wider than simply age. We will soon have a
debate about advocacy, and I am keen to see that children and young
people have access to advocacy in every possible situation where it
might be helpful to them. I shall speak about that subject later. I
should also like to give some credit to the Government for a later
provision in this Bill to allow 16 and 17-year-olds who disagree with
their parents to have their wishes taken into account by their treating
practitioner and not those of their nearest
relatives.</div>
					<a name="07050818000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have already made a number of commitments, including the
response to Professor Kennedy&#146;s report on the deaths at the
Bristol royal infirmary, as the Government accepted that adult services
might not be suitable for children and young people. We then had the
national service framework for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>children and young people and maternity services, including standard 9,
in which the Government have again given a very positive response in
terms of making sure that young people have access to appropriate
services. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also mentioned
the public service commitment on CAMHS, and I have mentioned the draft
code of practice and the commitment to age-appropriate services. So
everything is pointing in the right direction, except the wording in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050818000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend the Minister has given a commitment. She accepts that that
is the way to go, so we want to see suitable wording on Report. As she
has had such a good and constructive dialogue with YoungMinds until
now, will she give a commitment to discuss further with that
organisation the wording of the amendment that she proposes to table on
Report? I hope that that is a helpful contribution to push her in the
right
direction.</div>

I was here throughout the whole of her speech and I listened very
carefully. Over the weekend I celebrated my second anniversary of being
in Parliament. On most days I get up thinking that this is the best job
in the world. Today is not one of those days. I believe that the House
and this Committee are failing children with mental health problems.
Individually as members of this Committee we are in the process of
failing people with mental health problems. Sadly, I believe that I am
failing
them.</div>

the same anniversary, may I just say that what is important for me
about this Committee and the role that we have taken on in the last two
years, as well as the roles that many hon. Members have played for many
years, is that we are constantly moving forward to improve services?
Mental health services for young people have not been bad just for the
past few years; they have been bad for many years. It is now that they
are being looked at. Improvements are being sought. The fact that we
are debating the matter today andthat hon. Members are pushing
for changes and improvement is something that we should be proud
of.</div>

Duddridge:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. I
have served on other Committees with her. Although we are making
progress, however, I feel that an opportunity is being missed during
our debate on this Bill. The Minister said that she agrees with the
principles behind clause 24. I question why, rather than just voting
against it, she did not introduce an alternative wording so it could be
debated in detail. Nine years of debate later, although things have
progressed and lobby groups have presented different arguments, it
would have been better to see those principles and the
Minister&#146;s wording early on so that they could be debated and
refined before the process
continued.</div>
					<a name="07050818000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
was particularly moved to hear the separate oral evidence&#151;it was
also received in writing by all Committee members&#151;that was given
in the session led by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham. I was moved by the evidence given by Antonia Wilkinson and
Lois Ward, both of whom spent large amounts of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>time in adult centres; indeed, one of them spent four years of her life
in one. They were concerned about the fact that adult wards had
inappropriate space for individual discussions and about the level of
communication&#151;both communicative ability and actual
communication&#151;among professional staff. Communication was either
adult to child or adult to adult, whereas they were sensitive teenagers
requiring much more appropriate communication than to be spoken down to
as children or on the same level as adults. They also raised concerns
about their right to education. Although a number of individuals with
mental health problems are unable to receive education, some do, but in
adult wards that is not possible.</div>
					<a name="07050818000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I got the strong message that
those people felt that they had been disadvantaged twice by the
system&#151;once in having their medical condition, a mental health
problem, and then by being treated in an adult ward. I heard other
people talk passionately about verbal, physical and sexual abuse in
adult wards. Not only was it quite horrific, but in some cases, such
abuse&#151;and, to a lesser degree, drug abuse&#151;was one of the
things that had brought on their mental health problems. In the ward
where they expected and deserved treatment, they had to relive the
experiences that contributed to their mental health
problem.</div>
					<a name="07050818000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an
intervention on the Minister, I raised the issue of numbers. I should
genuinely like her to clarify those numbers. I was confused that no
numbers had been produced for under-16s, about whom the Government made
a commitment. Although she did not offer any numbers, she said that
there had been a fall. I am a little confused. If she is not aware of
any national level of monitoring, how can she validate that claim about
a fall? I am impressed that hon. Members from all parties have pointed
out the obvious fact that children go up to the age of 17. A lot more
needs to be done for 16 and
17-year-olds.</div>
					<a name="07050818000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
November 2006, the Government made their two-year pledge. If it is
likely to be fulfilled, why cannot we say in the Bill that in three or
even four years&#146; time, some of the situations in which children
are treated in adult wards will be illegal, so that this Government or
a future Government cannot push back that promise to the primary care
trusts and say, &#147;It&#146;s your responsibility to balance
priorities&#148;?</div>
					<a name="07050818000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious of time, so I shall end my comments. I have great hopes
that the Minister will table amendments, but unfortunately I do not
have great
confidence.</div>

							<a name="07050818000379"></a>Chris
Bryant:
						</b> I am sorry about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last
comments, because they seem particularly gloomy. My own experience of
children&#146;s mental health services during the past 22 years is
one of significant improvement. I was curate at All Saints High Wycombe
in 1986. Four youngsters committed suicide in the parish. They were all
children. They did not all commit suicide together, but one child did
so in September, another in November, another in March, and the other
the following June. They were all close friends. None of them had any
experience of the local mental health services. They had no counselling
provided to them, even though they were known to be a small group of
friends. Once the first child had committed suicide, no support to the
family was provided by the local health trust, or, for that matter, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>by the local school to the children in the same class as the young boy
who had committed suicide first. I do not believe that that situation
would occur today. There has been a dramatic change in the way in which
we approach the support needed for those who may be, as it were, the
victims of somebody else&#146;s mental health problems. The support
to children in schools where there has been a suicide or a traumatic
death is different to what it was 20 years ago. The provision of mental
health services to youngsters has dramatically
changed.</div>
					<a name="07050818000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like all hon.
Members, I believe that there should be appropriate treatment for every
individual, and it is obviously true of a child that their very nature
should be respected as part of the appropriateness of their treatment.
However, it is not the sole condition of the appropriateness of their
treatment. The issue gets particularly difficult when we start to talk
about 16 or 17-year-olds, whose experience of life may seem to them
entirely adult. They may already have children or have served several
months as a recruit in the Army, or be married or have done many of the
things that we associate with adulthood, though they may not be fully
adult. That is why I am hesitant about including in the Bill a specific
expectation about what happens to everybody under
18.</div>
					<a name="07050818000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the
Member for Stafford made a important point about the needs of 14 to
25-year-olds. The state has tended to treat the 14 to 25-year-old age
group as an important extension in respect of the youth service, and
not finished all youth service provision at the age of 18 or 21. I am
particularly conscious of the psychiatric needs of those at university.
Many more youngsters move away from home in this country to go to
university at the age of 18, and have specific emotional, psychiatric
and mental health needs that universities and local mental health
trusts may find it difficult to accommodate. It is important that we
have a continuum between 14 and 25 in the provision of mental health
services.</div>

a difficulty with part of the argument of the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about how long an emergency is. If
it was right to place someone in accommodation because it was deemed in
an emergency situation that they might otherwise have taken their own
life, it may be deemed after 48 hours that it is more dangerous to move
that person to other accommodation because the process could be
destabilising, as it might involve changing the doctor and nurses
dealing with the person and their environment. A clinician in such a
situation might deem a move more dangerous than meeting the
requirements of a clause in a Bill. Again, that is why the issue of
emergencies and special cases is not met sufficiently by the present
wording.</div>

						It
is perfectly legitimate to excoriate the Government and to condemn the
Minister for not having done enough in this area. However, it is not
right to use legislation to create a crisis that will have to be met by
trusts around the country in advance of the legislation coming into
force. Let us not doubt that that is what would happen in practice.
There may be an enormous problem and many thousands of youngsters may
not be receiving appropriate treatment. If so, we shall deliberately
create a crisis if we say that appropriate treatment will have to be
provided on the day that the legislation comes into
force.</div>

						</b> The hon. Member for Rhondda will, like me, have
received representations from mental health providers in Wales, who
point out that Wales has the lowest number of adolescent in-patient
beds per head in the UK. We in Wales would have a particular problem if
a deadline date was set. I wish to ensure that people understand
that.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Many people
have pointed to the fact that mental health services in Wales are
probably some 10 or15 years behind provision in England. I
hope that the commitment shown by the Welsh Assembly in the past few
years to improving the funding and resources available to mental health
services will continue in the next few years.</div>
					<a name="07050818000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Placing a clause in a Bill is
an inappropriate way to attempt to transform provision. I would prefer

the recommendations have been rejected by the Government.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>
					<a name="07050818000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Minister
has given one or two hints that she might look seriously at whether her
doubts, reservations and concerns, which are about the potential
&#147;unintended consequences&#148; of clause 24, can be overcome.
If she did, the Government would be able to support the main principle
and body of the Bill on Report.</div>
					<a name="07050818000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I find it
hard to believe that the Government are going to drive the Bill through
without making any significant concessions. If there is one measure on
which the Minister could make a concession, it is clause 24. We are
almost all agreed that mental health services for children should be
different from adult services. Children&#146;s services require
appropriate settings, assessments by people who are clinically approved
and who have an appropriate qualification in treating children, and
clinical supervision in all cases. By definition, such services require
specialism.</div>
					<a name="07050818000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The big
question that seems to come up with regard to the Minister&#146;s
unintended consequences is the fact that the clause does not provide
the means to deliver the services; it has both resource consequences
and practical consequences for clinicians. No Government can pass
legislation that does not have resource consequences. The question for
a Government&#151;any Government&#151;to ask is, &#147;When we
decide to legislate, do we will the means to go with the legislation,
or do we legislate and then expect those who have to deliver it to do
so from their existing resources, which will clearly not be
adequate?&#148; Providing resources is not a responsibility of
clinicians or PCTs; it is a responsibility of Governments. In
introducing the Bill, and indeed the whole raft of legislation in the
Queen&#146;s Speech, the Government should have paid due regard to
the consequences. The resources need to be there when they
legislate.</div>

Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham to give the right hon.
Lady a more substantive answer to that. I can tell the Minister that we
are on record as having said that when we come to office we will spend
proportionately more on mental health services. Mental health is a
priority for the Conservative party. However, as a humble
Back-Bencher&#151;</div>

Browning:
						</b> Thank you. I see that I am getting friendly fire
from in front of me. The Minister should in no way underestimate the
commitment of the Conservative party to deal with the subject. The
question of children, in particular, cuts right across party issues.
All parties understand that in recent years, certainly since the 1983
Act came on to the statute book, our understanding of psychiatric
services for children has been much clearer. There is much more
recognition of their needs, but it is so long since we last 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>legislated that the 1983 Act does not typify our knowledge of the way in
which children&#146;s services should be provided.</div>
					<a name="07050818000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24 seeks to fill that
gap, and to bring the legislation up to date by referring to
appropriate services. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham talked about the legal opinion that was sought by YoungMinds
from Paul Bowen of Doughty Street chambers. The Minister has agreed to
discuss the clause with YoungMinds, because Paul Bowen&#146;s legal
opinion states that he does not believe that the provisions will have
the effect that the Government, who oppose the clause, say that they
will. However he qualifies that by saying that section 142B could be
more happily drafted, both generally and specifically, to meet the
objection raised by the
Government.</div>
					<a name="07050818000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there
is a resource for the Government and its officials, in consultation
with YoungMinds. The barrister has looked at the Government&#146;s
objections and is even offering practical advice on restructuring the
clause to satisfy some of the Minister&#146;s reservations about it.
Nothing could be more constructive than that. I hope that the Minister
will take the opportunity to discuss with YoungMinds not only its
concerns but the very detailed legal advice that it obtained, which I
am sure will be very helpful to the Minister.</div>
					<a name="07050818000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very conscious that we are
coming to 1 o&#146;clock. While there may be a few tummies rumbling,
I am afraid that I still have rather a lot to say on the clause.
Therefore, I would like to continue. Written submission MH57 was made
to the Committee by Penny Stafford, who has been a mental health
service user and has also served as a member of the Mental Health Act
Commission. I draw attention to something that caught my eye in her
submission that is relevant to the clause. She was asked to carry out
an assessment of children and adolescents detained in adult wards. She
said that a fifth of the children and young people she visited who were
subject to section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983, which requires
them to be taken to a place of safety, were not even taken to a mental
hospital; they were detained in police custody suites. I must say to
the Minister that we cannot ignore the fact that if, under the existing
legislation, children and adolescents are being detained in police
custody suites, which is the most inappropriate setting for very
vulnerable young people, then it is even more clear that we need to get
the right and appropriate settings and clinical support for
them.</div>
					<a name="07050818000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
rather rolled her eyes when I gave the example from God&#146;s
wonderful county of Devon about what is happening in the west
country.</div>
					
					<a name="07050818000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07050818000394"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Well, surprise was a factor. Are the
Minister&#146;s reservations about the clause that there will not be
sufficient and appropriate services ready out there? We have already
dealt with the fact that once an Act receives Royal Assent different
parts are implemented at different times. None the less, it is quite
clear, and quite clear from the Government&#146;s response to the
scrutiny Committee on the question of children&#146;s services, that
the Government are only too well aware 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>of what needs to be done. Clearly, some parts of the country have
started to provide specialist services, either on a regional basis or
by several counties clustering together.</div>
					<a name="07050818000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also practical issues
about access for visiting parents, which I raised with the PCT and the
strategic health authority in our consultation in the west country. If
children and adolescents have to travel further to access specialised
services, then we must ensure that we build into the facility a place
for parents and close relatives to stay overnight, rather like they do
on children&#146;s wards in general hospitals. If a child is admitted
to a general hospital for any period of time, there are facilities for
parents to stay. Mothers very often want to stay to help with the
nursing of the child. There is no reason why that system cannot be
replicated in our mental health hospitals. It is about treating
children appropriately. I do not see why that problem cannot be
overcome.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>
					<a name="07050818000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may need to look at the cost
of transport for some families. It is quite prohibitive when children
are hospitalised a long way from home. I have a mother in my
constituency whose child has been hospitalised in Bristol. He has been
there for three months. To travel from Exeter to Bristol every day as
she wants to, having other children at home, is quite expensive.
Perhaps we should be looking at the practicalities of helping families
with the cost of hospital transfer. Those are not insurmountable
problems. When I look around the Committee, I am sure that you will
agree with me, Mr. Cook, that the brains assembled here
could come up with a solution to very practical problems like that.
They are second-order issues compared with what is
proposed&#151;</div>
