<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> In moving amendment No. 215, I should like to push the cause of amendments Nos. 216, 217 and 219. Amendment No. 215 is a technical amendment for consistency in the language of subsections (1) and (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to the substance of his argument, will he tell the Committee whether the amendments are Home Office draft amendments or his own?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendments that the Home Office has presented to make the Bill workable have been used, but they have been tabled in my name. Therefore,[Mr. Foster]
they are classed as my amendments, not as Home Office-moved amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but will he clarify each time that he speaks to a particular amendment whether it has come from Home Office lawyers or is the result of his own industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the amendments are technical, it is fair for the hon. and learned Gentleman to assume that they come from the Home Office. However, the Government are strictly neutral on this issue. Therefore, if the amendments are a matter of policy change, the Home Office will not have had any involvement.
<P>
Amendment No. 215 is technical. Its aim is to make subsections (1) and (2) consistent in their use of language. The common phrase "reasonable cause" now applies to both subsections. It will ensure that the test that a constable must apply to exercise the power of arrest is the same as that required for stopping and searching.
<P>
Amendment No. 216 is a change in language rather than in meaning or in policy. The original phrase, in subsection 2(b), read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"search or examine any vehicle, animal or article which that person may have with him".</ul></font>
<P>
As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) will testify, it would become difficult for someone who is intending to hunt to have a vehicle with them while they were, for example, on horseback. That is clearly a nonsense in the use of the English language.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): That is not totally correct. Most hunts normally have a vehicle containing terrier men. That vehicle tends to be much closer to the hounds than the mounts following them. There is usually a vehicle with the hounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I was referring to riders on horseback rather than the support systems that hunts tend to have for terrier work. I also acknowledge that many hunt followers travel in vehicles.
<P>
To avoid the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that person may have with him",</ul></font>
<P>
which is an inappropriate phrase, especially in relation to vehicles, amendment No. 216 has also tightened up the language in relation to dogs. The reference to "control" in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be in his possession or under his control"</ul></font>
<P>
is to be placed in the context of dogs. It would therefore refer to the pack of hounds or even the terrier accompanying the hunt.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 also changes the language slightly by inserting two words. The original clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the offence is to be found on that vehicle, animal or article".</ul></font>
<P>
The amendment's insertion makes it "in or on" that vehicle, as otherwise the implication would be to look for things on a roof-rack or on the top of a particular vehicle. That would clearly be a nonsense, as the Bill's purpose is to look for things inside a vehicle such as dogs being transported in a lorry that might give grounds for suspicion that hunting was taking place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain why that simple point did not occur to him during the drafting of the original Bill by Mr. Anthony Scrivener QC on whom he has placed such reliance and why it has taken him until the second half of February to conclude that such an amendment was required?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As the hon. and learned Gentleman will know, the purpose of the Committee is to identify what changes are necessary to make the Bill a more workable piece of legislation. I do not think that the Committee should apologise for taking such action, which is the purpose of our sitting today.
<P>
Under the amendment, a constable might look for dogs in the back of a lorry, a terrier on the back seat of a car or maps, invitations and notices showing when and where a hunt is to take place. That is the purpose of amendment No. 217; I would hope that even hunters would not put their terrier on a roofrack while travelling 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): They might.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> There is no guarantee; I accept that. Bearing in mind the way that hunters treat their dogs, I must be careful about what I say.
<P>
Amendment No. 219 is a technical change to the Bill, which acknowledges that the Bill will apply to the whole of the UK. The amendment is intended to bring the Bill in line with Scottish jurisdiction. Part II of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 means that a forfeiture would take place under that particular Act, and the amendment would enable the Bill to apply in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, will the hon. Gentleman describe what consultation he had with the Scottish Office, Scottish Law Officers or any non-governmental legal sources in Scotland before amendment No. 219 was drafted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Bill was always designed to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. It was only through some direction from the Home Office that I became aware that this insertion was necessary for forfeiture to take place under an existing Act and not the Bill. That is the purpose of amendment No. 219.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman has answered the question. I ask him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster</b><i> rose</i><P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> <i>rose </i>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I asked a question of the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that the right hon. Member for Worcester has given way to the Minister, who now has the Floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am always grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who asks questions but sometimes does not want to hear the answers.
<P>
For the record, my hon. Friend has had no consultation with the Scottish Office, but in drawing up amendments which are mainly technical and to improve the Bill, those in the Home Office who are responsible for such matters have had consultations, not because the Government have abandoned neutrality on the Bill but because we want to ensure that it is in good order when it leaves the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I should have thought that most members of the Committee would have inferred that from the assistance that the Home Office has already provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Am I right in thinking that the hon. Member for Worcester gave way to the Minister a moment ago because he did not know whether the Scottish Office had been consulted? If that is so, why is he speaking in favour of amendments when he does not even know who drafted them?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for the Chair to speculate on what is inside the head of the hon. Member for Worcester. A question was asked of him and he rose to give an answer. The Minister sought leave to intervene, the hon. Gentleman gave way, the Minister made a response and the hon. Member for Worcester now has the Floor to continue his contribution to the debate on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. It is unfortunate that the tenor of the Committee has had to change this morning.
<P>
I have concluded my justification for amendments Nos. 215, 216, 217 and 219 and I seek the Committee's support to ensure that the changes go forward to improve the technical competence of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
 <P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I rise briefly to try to draw together some of the strands that the hon. Member for Worcester presented at this late stage in our deliberations. The public are aware that it has taken until 18 February 1998 to reach clause 2. We spent our previous five or six sittings fiddling around at the margins of clause 1 while the hon. Gentleman and his supporters attempted to bring their thoughts into order. They had to rely on the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and his advisers, who maintain a neutral stance but who assist the hon. Gentleman in the production of amendments. Today, we teased out of the hon. Member for Worcester that he is still in considerable difficulty about his Bill's shape and design, which he said on Second Reading was simple, easy and almost perfect.
<P>
Judging by our debate this morning, I suspect that the clause's final drafting will bear little resemblance to the original version that was drafted by that learned gentleman, Mr. Anthony Scrivener, who is one of Her Majesty's counsel learned in the law and on whom the hon. Gentleman placed much reliance on Second Reading and during our debate on the sittings motion.
<P>
Even if the clause is legally cogent I am sure that many people do not agree that it is it will extend the criminal law in a draconian fashion and the good people of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland must bear that in mind during the Bill's progress through the House. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A constable may arrest without warrant",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it permits him to "seize" property and "search or examine" without warrant. Clause 3, which we shall discuss in due course, deals with the associated penalties.
<P>
I finish with a warning. The hon. Gentleman no doubt introduced the Bill because of tremendous pressure from his friends in the League Against Cruel Sports and from the members of his constituency management committee. He is singlehandedly or almost singlehandedly in the process of outlawing the activities of huge numbers of people and he proposes to give powers to ordinary constables that they may find wholly unattractive and which, in view of the history of hunting in this country, no civilised society should give them. It is a matter of huge regret that the clause is part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): I rise to praise our debate on the clause. We are all minded to make progress. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark) has a long and distinguished record in animal welfare and he is implacably opposed to fox hunting, but the fact that he did not support the Bill because it was badly drafted has caused us some concern. He highlighted the problems associated with the extension of constables' powers. On Second Reading, he said in criticism of the Bill's drafting:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Most of the text is devoted to penalties and to increased police powers ... I do not understand how Labour Members if they have read the Bill; perhaps they have not can support a Bill that allows constables to make arrests without warrant and to stop and search ... The Bill would also allow forfeiture of vehicles. Moreover, it confers draconian powers and discretion on the police." [Official Report, Friday 28 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 1226.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is certainly not my intention, nor that of my colleagues, to confer draconian powers on the police, but one may question whether it serves the cause of animal welfare to enable constables to seize and incarcerate dogs or horses used in hunting. The comments of the hon. and learned Member for[Mr. Martin Salter]
Harborough (Mr. Garnier) about draconian powers are misplaced and can be dealt with during the debate on clause 3, which deals with penalties, forfeiture and disqualification. I am reasonably confident that we have done what we can with clause 2 and that the issues raised by Opposition Members can be best dealt with when we consider clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &Ouml;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I want to make several points. However, I first wish to say that this Committee has been an education for me in the ways of Parliament. The Committee has spent six weeks debating the first line of a clause that we eventually threw out. I was shocked that after investing so much time and money in considering the Bill something that the Bill's supporters often highlighted the Bill was so defective that we had to adjourn and wait for new proposals to make it workable.
<P>
The main thrust of my comments is threefold. First, I want to emphasise my deep dismay that we are discussing banning fox hunting in the context of criminal law. To me, that is fundamentally illiberal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin McNamara </B>(Hull, North): Are not bear baiting, bull baiting and cock fighting criminal offences?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe that the Bill has anything to do with those three activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and I congratulate him on his acumen, but my point was that those three activities have become criminal offences. Would he want them decriminalised?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is always illiberal to legislate to make cruelty to animals a criminal offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Once again, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) uses the word "always", and the examples of bear baiting, and so on, are by implication being linked with fox hunting. I wish to differentiate between the sport of torturing animals for personal enjoyment [Hon. Members: "The sport!"]
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &Ouml;pik) has been generous in giving way, but wishes to make a little progress before doing so again.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Can you ensure that the reporter includes the phrase "sport of torturing animals" in the Official Report?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. I have every confidence in the reporter.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. The reason why I often give way and I shall do so again in a moment is because of the edification that I inevitably obtain by giving way to Labour Members.
<P>
We are becoming rather pedantic, but I hope that the Committee will agree that bear baiting was a sport and had absolutely no basis whatsoever in pest control, whereas it can be debated I hope that hon. Members will be magnanimous and at least concede this point that many people involved in fox hunting do not do it primarily as a sport, but to control animals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> It is useful to have it on the record that torturing animals for enjoyment is classified as sport, which is why around 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. of the British public is implacably opposed to the barbaric sport of hunting with hounds. The hon. Gentleman's fundamental support for fox hunting arises from pest control, but there is empirical evidence that hunts breed foxes in artificial earths so that they can pursue their sport. That has nothing to do with pest control.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I think that hon. Members are hearing what they want to hear rather than what I am saying. Let me repeat for the record, because there must be no misunderstanding of my point, that what I said about the sport of torturing animals was a specific response to the points made by the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) about bear baiting and his two other examples.
<P>
Let me say unequivocally that I have never supported torture or inhumane activity towards animals simply for human enjoyment. I want to try to ensure a balance in the Bill. On one hand, many people in the countryside have a genuine requirement to control foxes. On the other, there is a liberal requirement in a philosophical rather than party political sense to ensure that we do not ban things simply because we do not like them and which it would be philosophically inconsistent to ban.
<P>
I shall give way again to ensure that every member of the Committee can add something to my comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is inspiring much debate, for which we are grateful. I am interested in his liberal definition. Plainly, several liberal definitions exist in the Committee. How does he define stag hunting?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I do not want to reopen that debate and will try to make some progress so that I cannot be accused of filibustering.
<P>
This is not a debate about black and white. The search for absolutes has been fatally debilitating to our previous discussions. It is not easy in life to find an example of something that is always wrong. Perhaps we will spend the next 10 minutes looking for examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> What about stag hunting?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the reply that I gave to the hon. Member for Worcester a few weeks ago when he asked whether I believed that we should ban stag hunting. I said that that does not constitute a necessary act. That would go beyond what I, as an individual, regard as the line of acceptability in late 20th century western society.
<P>
Let me repeat something else that I hoped that I had outlied sufficiently. Our challenge, as a responsible Committee, is to decide where to draw that line. We are not here simply to make emotional, rhetorical speeches about fox hunting being always barbaric or implying that everyone involved in fox hunting is a barbarian.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been generous with the hon. Gentleman because he has been extremely generous in giving way. I am anxious that he should have the opportunity to develop his case, but must point out that he is dealing with clause 1. Clause 2 is about powers of arrest. I ask him to bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Thank you for citing my generosity as a fault, Mr. O'Hara. I shall focus my final brief comments on the clause and return to other matters in debates on later clauses.
<P>
I reiterate my belief that we are not sufficiently clear on the distinctions between aspects of animal welfare to say that we should criminalise one approach to fox control. I remind the Committee that we are not a vegetarian society. We accept that the conduct of our culture, which allows us to kill animals for food 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is dealing with clause 1 instead of clause 2.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> My point is that it is arbitrary to criminalise that approach to fox control. The Bill gives wide-ranging powers to the police, but it does not address other philosophical arguments.
<P>
My final point is that we must be fairly certain about our ground before giving such wide powers to the police. I am not convinced that the construction of the arguments in favour of the Bill have been sufficiently robust to warrant giving the police the power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"seize and detain for the purpose of proceedings under this Act"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have debated that matter and I will not rehearse the arguments, but the clause will grant the police wide powers. Members of the forces who have a rather less objective assessment of country pursuits may take the opportunity to abuse those powers. I do not suggest that the police forces of the United Kingdom are corrupt, but there is a danger of abuse of powers, which is something that we have to consider when we debate Bills that deal with police powers. The clause provides wide powers to stop, search and detain and to seize property belonging to individuals who may have done nothing wrong.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard (Taunton):</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is opposed to stag hunting and believes that it should be banned. I also appreciate that there are different views on why it may be liberal to ban stag hunting but not liberal to ban fox hunting. Will he explain how stag hunting should be banned? Should it be a criminal offence? If he is opposed to fox hunting becoming a criminal offence once it is banned, what should be the punishment for people who carry on stag hunting when that is banned?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I am willing to enter that debate, Mr. O'Hara, but bearing in mind your guidance, I would be going beyond the brief to discuss clause 2. That debate will be more appropriate when we reach subsequent clauses, and I will make my points then. I am not worried about having that debate, but this is not the right time to do so.
<P>
I will not emphasise my concerns about a possible invasion of civil liberties, but I do believe that it is dangerous to underestimate the potential for abuse. I will be voting against clause 2 because it feels unreasonably harsh in the context of our debates. I am not keen on the Bill per se. However, I can step back from that view and ask hon. Members whether they really believe that so grave a threat is posed to the countryside that it is worth running the risk of undermining the civil liberties of many people who live there, because they could be adversely affected by provisions in the clause. I do not believe that fox hunting warrants such draconian measures, in the words of my hon. and learned and temporary Friend. More to the point, even if one believes that fox hunting should be curtailed, it is inappropriately extreme to include clause 2 in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &Ouml;pik) and his definition of what is right and proper in the Bill, but I shall start by referring to the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough who, like the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, launched a vicious and unacceptable attack on the integrity of the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman proceeds, let me say unequivocally that I do not question the integrity of the police. I simply raised an issue that anyone who is concerned with civil liberties might reasonably raise. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not imply something that is not so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's clarification, but both he and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that they were concerned about the clause criminalising fox hunting and possible abuses by the police. That seems to be an unwarranted attack on the integrity of the police, but I am willing to give way to the hunters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman expand on the purposes of the warrant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I shall come to that in due course. I want to make the point about the police because when scrutinising legislation it is necessary carefully to consider the punishment that that legislation allows. It is probably right and proper in this case to consider what has happened in the past. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire may agree that we could examine the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Very few members of the Committee were involved in the consideration of that legislation, but the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), who is not in his seat, was. Under that Act, which was introduced by the previous Government, hunt saboteurs and those who tried to defend animals that were being hunted were made criminals. That draconian piece of legislation reflected the attitude of the Conservatives when they were in power. Now that we are trying to stop the barbaric pastime of fox hunting, or the sport of torturing animals as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire put it, there should be criminal actions on the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that many hon. Members who supported legislation to[Angela Smith]
criminalise those who trespassed when protesting against hunting would not support an amendment to criminalise those who trespass in pursuit of hunting?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the debate, proceeds, I remind the Committee of the advice that I gave to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire who, to give him credit, took due note of it. Given the length of time that we have spent on clause 1, I am not minded to allow extensive reference to the content of that clause during our debates on other clauses. The debate on clause 2 concerns powers of arrest, search and seizure. I ask all members of the Committee to bear that in mind. The Chair will take action if they do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Thank you for your continuing guidance, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I want to stress the importance of the clause being in the Bill. If it is not included, the Bill would not be the important piece of legislation that the public expect it to be. I accept that there are different views, including the libertarian view I would describe myself as a libertarian on many issues but some actions should be criminal if they are important enough and I believe that hunting with hounds is important enough to be a criminal action. As my hon. Friend said 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The hon. Gentleman is doing his best to retain the Committee's attention, but is it in order for Committee members who support the Bill to read newspapers when we are supposed to be discussing an extension of the criminal law?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If any Committee member is reading a newspaper, I am sure that he or she will stop doing so forthwith.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Presumably, it would be okay if he or she were reading the racing section.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order in any situation for Committee members to read newspapers in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I did know that, Mr. O'Hara, but I thought that I might try to find some leeway for any Committee member who was considering not listening to me. I know who the offending party is [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I will, when my hon. Friend has finished the newspaper. It is interesting that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has not responded to any of the points that I have put to him.
<P>
The Bill's opponents had the opportunity to introduce an amendment to exclude criminalisation from the clause, but not one amendment tabled by Opposition Members seeks to do so. It ill behoves Conservative Members to complain about criminalisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes several unworthy remarks, which I shall ignore, but the stupidest thing that he said was that we have not tabled any amendments about decriminalisation. He may not remember, but we voted against the Bill on Second Reading. Can he get that into his head?

<P>

<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for confirming that there was a Whip on Conservative Members to vote against the Bill. That does not constitute much of a fresh start, does it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I have always classed myself as a reasonably tolerant person, but if the hon. Gentleman insists on behaving in a rather Jacobin fashion in response to my words he twists them Orwellianly we are in for rather a lot of trouble. If he is going to make pointed and personal remarks, he should at least base them on fact rather than on what is cluttering up his head.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) is responsible for his own comments. I shall be vigilant and ensure that he does not get away with unparliamentary remarks. I have not heard yet any remark that strays into that category but I am listening carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I have been guilty of using unparliamentary language recently about a colleague of yours, but I shall not repeat my remarks here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Not in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> No.
<P>
I was discussing the Opposition's amendments. The fact that Conservative Members voted against the Bill on Second Reading does not mean that they should not properly scrutinise the Bill in Committee. If they really believe that hunting with hounds should not involve criminalisation, they should have tabled appropriate amendments, but they failed to do so. They have an opportunity to vote against the clause, which they may or may not do, but they did not table appropriate amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> I now call Mr. Cawsey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I hear the weary tone with which you call my name. I shall try to be relatively brief.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is a pleasant change to call the hon. Gentleman so early in our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Perhaps I am rising up the batting order.
<P>
I want to discuss the powers that the clause may or may not give to the police. I seek your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. Am I right in thinking that because we have reached the stand part debate, we cannot further discuss the amendments that are grouped with amendment No. 215?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That is very helpful. There has been much comment this morning about how long it took the Committee to reach clause 2. There was some inevitability about that. Before discussing penalties and powers of arrest, we had to have a fundamental debate about what constituted an offence. To some extent, that is why we have had such long discussions. The Committee has now cleared those hurdles. Therefore, I do not see why we cannot progress on the remaining clauses. We have now come up with a wording that is not opposed, if not entirely agreed on.
<P>
Several hon. Members have made comments about advice given to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester in drafting the Bill. My recollection at our early sittings is of an endless debate on whether "intentional" should be added to various parts of the Bill. That included advice from the Home Office. It turned out that legal advisers to my hon. Friend were correct all the time. The argument that he has received poor legal advice does not bear out in reality, although the wording has been improved during the course of the debate.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Committee have argued that clause 2 gives draconian powers to the police. I do not agree. When I first saw the Bill, parts of clause 2 worried me, especially the power to allow a constable to act on the suspicion of a crime about to be committed, as opposed to one that is being committed, or has been committed. Those powers worried my liberal side.
<P>
I therefore took the wise precaution of speaking to my local chief constable. I was the chairman of his police authority for four years and we have a good relationship. He assured me that the wording was standard in English law and that there was nothing illiberal or draconian about it. It merely reflects a standard view that it is better for the police to try to stop a crime taking place than to wait for it to happen and pick up the pieces afterwards. When hon. Members who oppose the Bill criticise the power, they always omit some crucial words whether such a constable acts "with reasonable cause".
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recall that I have asked for the definition of the word warrant, but have failed to get one. Under criminal justice legislation introduced by the previous Government in the previous Parliament, a court order is necessary before the police may intervene to remove sabs from private land. The clause proposes that the police should act without a warrant. Will the hon. Gentleman therefore explain what is the purpose of a warrant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The purpose of a warrant is that it be used when Parliament decides that it is necessary. I should have thought that that was an obvious answer. I will not explain or apologise for the previous Government's legislation, regardless of whether it is appropriate.
<P>
It is not unusual for constables to have powers to act without warrants. It would be odd if constables had to go to court to obtain a warrant before they could perform their duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am sorry to delay the hon. Gentleman, I merely seek clarification. Police may not remove sabs from private land without warrant. However, according to the clause, the police would be able to arrest hunters without warrant. What is the difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> The previous Government did.
 <P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> As my hon. Friend says, that is what the previous Government decided.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> As my hon. Friend has not explained the reasons for the previous Government's legislation, does he agree that it would be nonsensical if a police officer who saw someone breaking and entering to burgle a house had to go to court to obtain a warrant to stop that crime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I realise that I did not give the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) an answer. The relevant part of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 is section 69, dealing with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Powers to remove persons committing or participating in aggravated trespass."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (1) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the senior police officer present at the scene reasonably believes 
(a) that a person is committing, has committed or intends to commit the offence of aggravated trespass on land in the open air".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful to all hon. Members for their interventions; it is helpful to put such matters on the record.
<P>
The powers are not new and draconian. Such powers are often given to the police when legislation is enacted by Parliament. Therefore, we can be reassured by that response. Reasonable grounds will have to be demonstrated by a constable, and if anyone can prove to the courts that the grounds were unreasonable they will not be convicted under this legislation if it is passed. It is not draconian; it is the way in which we legislate in this country. It allows the police the necessary powers to do the job that Parliament wishes them to do.
<P>
I want to place on record the anxieties of some members of the Committee about the Bill's reference to a constable. A number of amendments suggest that the Bill should refer to a chief inspector or a superintendent, which demonstrates a misunderstanding of how Bills are drafted. For the purposes of arrest, "constable" refers to all ranks of police officer, including the chief constable; in English law, the phrase is "constable". I hope that hon. Members who tabled those amendments understand that exception. There are occasions on which a higher rank of police officer has the power: authorising an armed response vehicle would be one. The Government intend to introduce anti-social behaviour orders, which will also have to be authorised by an officer of the rank of superintendent or higher. That would not apply, however, to the powers of arrest that a serving officer might have to exercise on the street. The phrase "constable" is just the standard wording in that respect.
<P>
Civil liberties in the countryside have been mentioned, which is why the provision that "reasonable[Mr. Cawsey]
grounds" must be shown before any action can be taken is important. It is important to examine the clause properly as civil liberties are at stake. I represent a rural constituency and most people in my area have demonstrated to me that they do not want hunting with dogs to continue. Some landowners in that area do not want hunts to go over their ground. One of the few occasions when there is a hunt is when the Brocklesby hunt enters the village of Alkborough, which I have mentioned three times now. I do not think that Alkborough has ever been mentioned as many times in Hansard as during the proceedings of this Bill. The staff of the Official Report even know how to spell it now; or perhaps they do not.
<P>
Farmers in my constituency take great offence at the way in which hunts roam over their land at will and I hope that the legislation will remedy that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear that hunts do not roam over land unless they have the owner's permission to cross it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That is complete nonsense the dogs follow whatever they are hunting. Is the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that when hounds recently went over electrified lines, the hunt had intended that they should do so? Of course they did not; the hounds went over those lines because they were following their quarry. It is a nonsense to say otherwise and farmers in my constituency are prepared to verify that. The clause is a good one; it is not draconian 
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> In fairness to the hon. Gentleman, it seems that he now recognises that that is a matter of personal judgment. I am not asking a trick question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman would try to trick me in any way, shape or form. I agree with him, and that is why it was important that the Bill was subject to a free vote on Second Reading. These are always questions of judgment and they always involve drawing lines in the sand. I am happy to support the direction of the Bill as is the hon. Gentleman, although not in its entirety. Clause 2 is a good clause. It is not draconian and it gives the police powers that they require in reality.
<P>
The tremendous pressure that has been placed on the Bill by Labour Members and by general committees has been mentioned. I agree that there is tremendous pressure, but it is not from the Labour party, it is from the British public. People from all corners of these islands from rural areas and urban areas say overwhelmingly that they want the Bill to succeed. I therefore agree that there is tremendous pressure. By agreeing to the clause making the Bill law, that pressure will have been successful and the British people will have got what they want.

<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> In moving clause 3 stand part 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chairman moves the question. The hon. Gentleman is, however, welcome to contribute to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> My apologies, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I want to rise above the snide remarks made by some hon. Members and correct a couple of falsehoods. It is nonsense to suggest that there was pressue from my general committee or the League Against Cruel Sports to sponsor the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) made it clear that the pressure came from the British people, and I made it plain on Second Reading that the pressure to support the Bill came from my constituents, the people of Worcester. There is nothing wrong in tackling constituency issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned the number of changes to the clause. What is more important is that we have taken responsibility to ensure that the end product is a better product. It would be wrong of us to force through a defective clause by sheer weight of numbers. It is more important to get it right. The powers of arrest, search and seizure are consistent with outlawing an activity that is, in the hon. Gentleman's words, a sport. It is not a form of pest control. We know from the evidence that fox hunting, hare coursing, hare hunting, stag hunting and mink hunting are not effective forms of pest control, but sports. That is why the powers of arrest are consistent. We are outlawing an activity that is a sport.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that every pack and person participating in what the Bill will outlaw is conducting the activity simply as a sport? Will he not accept my supposition that some do it in the genuine belief that is is a form of pest control?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is an interesting question. It is always argued that some people participate in hunting because they are convinced that they are conducting a form of pest control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that some people believe that the Earth is flat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I would have to take my hon. Friend's word for that. I have not come across too many of them, certainly not on the Government Benches.
<P>
Some people believe that they are conducting a form of pest control, but the scientific evidence suggests that they are not. Hunting kills only a limited number of foxes compared to alternative methods. Their argument can be knocked down. Tha vast majority of people who hunt assure me that they enjoy the equestrian pursuit and the pleasures of the countryside, but they do not necessarily like the kill at the end of the day. They do not participate in a form of pest control but in a form of sport.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Given that we are debating the criminalisation of the activity, does the hon. Gentleman accept that our debate on clause 5 will allow us to ensure that clause 2 will not make criminals of those who are pursuing what they believe is a form of pest control?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Worcester responds, I must remind the Committee that we are debating powers of arrest, search and seizure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman's amendment to clause 5 will give him the opportuntiy to raise that issue.
<P>
To ensure consistency when we outlaw an activity that is unacceptable in modern Britain, the powers of arrest and seizure need to be toned to the correct level, which is why I urge support for clause 2.

<P>
No. 139, in page 2, line 14, leave out "6 months" and insert "1 month".
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I will want to press the amendment to a vote. I want to build on the arguments made by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea on draconian powers. Clause 3 is about powers and penalties and we should consider in some detail the appropriateness of what is proposed. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and myself cover a range of penalties. They refer to clause 3(1), which covers the level of fines and terms of imprisonment.
<P>
A level 5 fine is significant in being the first level at which the magistrates have powers of imprisonment. We must tread carefully in that regard. A case can be made that the penalties in the Bill are too brutal. They equate with penalties for serious cruelty offences under the Protection of Animals Acts and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, including cruelty to domestic or captive animals and acts of brutality including kicking animals to death, nailing them to trees or setting them on fire. Clearly, those acts are barbaric and I would say that they are even more barbaric than the unacceptable sport of fox hunting. Our amendments, therefore, touch on the appropriateness of the penalties proposed.
<P>
The cruelty that I have just mentioned is clearly worse than that involved in the chase of a wild animal that may not be caught. Even if caught, the animal is not likely to suffer as much as it would with the sadistic, hands-on cruelty that is rightly outlawed by the 1996 Act. The Committee should bear in mind the severity of the proposed penalties and the need to reflect the difference between sustained sadistic cruelty and the cruel, but less cruel, distress suffered by stags and hounds, which my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) discussed in his Adjournment debate on sport hunting. I urge the Committee to consider seriously the appropriateness of the level of fines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Again, I want to make only a brief comment on the amendments. My hon. Friend is right to say that the Committee should make a judgment on what the penalties should be if the Bill becomes law. To do that, we should examine the precedents in previous legislation to ensure consistency. The penalty in the Bill will equate with the penalties for offences of cruelty under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Wild Mammals Protection Act 1996. It is entirely appropriate to have similar penalties in the Bill because that will ensure consistency across a range of animal welfare issues. People who choose to break the law and abuse animals will know where they stand, under whichever Act they are prosecuted.
<P>
I understand the point made by my hon. Friend, but the amendments should be rejected and the present drafting retained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey). The penalties in the clause were written in such a way that they were entirely consistent with other animal welfare legislation. That is why standard scales were used. Amendment No. 140 and those grouped with it would dilute the penalties for activities which, as the British people and Members of Parliament have made clear, we do not want to take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if we diluted the penalties they would be inconsistent with[Mr. Cawsey]
other animal welfare legislation and would raise questions on that legislation? It would be better to be consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I agree wholeheartedly that consistency is important. Not only will it affect the Bill when it is enacted, but legislation such as that protecting badgers might be called into question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> As there seems to be much agreement on the Labour Benches, why does not the hon. Member for Worcester suggest to his hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) that he withdraws his amendment so that we may proceed to the next part of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is up to me to put the case against the amendments that my hon. Friend tabled. If he wants to press his amendment to a vote, that is entirely up to him, but I hope that it is defeated because it is important to have consistent penalties for animal welfare legislation and that those penalties are sufficient to dissuade people from taking part in the activities that we seek to ban.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Member for Reading, West has no enthusiasm for his amendment and there is no enthusiasm for it on the hon. Gentleman's side of the Committee. I suggest that the amendment is withdrawn so that we may proceed with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Surely it is not for Members opposite to suggest to an hon. Member who has not moved the amendment that he should attempt to influence me on whether I press the amendment to a vote? As a member of the Committee, I have every right to table amendments and to request a Division.

<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has read my mind. I concur with his analysis of the situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has twice claimed to be able to read people's minds and I am becoming increasingly worried about him taking up that activity.
<P>
To sum up the reasons why I urge the Committee to vote against the amendments, the provisions will create consistency and act as a deterrent, so that people cannot say, "It will only cost me a fiver if I am caught hunting." The penalties are sufficiently powerful to stop people embarking on the quest of becoming a martyr to the cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I am disappointed by the contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Worcester and for Brigg and Goole, who completely failed to address the point that I thought I had made reasonably articulately when I moved the amendment about the appropriateness of the crime that would be committed, should the clause become law. There must be a difference between acts of brutality and sadism and the so-called sport of fox hunting. So I am unconvinced by the interventions of hon. Members who oppose the Bill and by the arguments against my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman put his hand on his heart and say that he agrees with his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Yes, I certainly can and I am more than happy to confirm that.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 142, in page 2, line 17, leave out from "be" to "in" in line 18 and insert "1,000".
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I want to argue in favour of amendment No. 16. It is interesting that the amendment also stands in the names of the hon. and learned Member of Harborough, and the hon. Members for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), for North Wiltshire and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). However, it is nice for us to agree on the issue and I look forward to them voting in favour of the amendment when I press it to a vote. That will be a pleasurable experience.
<P>
I tabled the amendment because it has been made clear to me that every case of hunting a wild mammal should constitute a separate offence and a separate prosecution should be brought for every wild mammal hunted. If a person is found guilty, he or she will be convicted for an individual act against one wild mammal. I understand that the measure could be construed as contrary to the European convention on human rights because, under the original wording, people would be treated as if they had been convicted when they had not. The original wording is at fault. The amendment will tighten up the Bill and bring it into line with the Human Rights Bill, which the House supported on Second Reading on Monday. I am sure that the amendment will receive the full support of Opposition Members.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am not wholly clear about the Committee's procedure, which is rather confusing and which some Opposition Members raised in the House with the Speaker. Are those Opposition Members supporting amendment No. 16 or are they abstaining on amendment No. 142?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There was no call for a Division, and I took an oral indication as support for the amendment. I am therefore unable to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. If he wanted to be clear about support for the amendment, he could have pressed for a Divison. He should bear my lesson in mind in future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> you will be pleased to hear, Mr. O'Hara, that I shall be exceptionally brief, unlike some of my hon. Friends. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] That was rather sharp, wasn't it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For clarification, it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would say which amendments he is speaking to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I am speaking to amendments Nos. 143 to 152.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> And not to amendment No. 220?
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> No, not to amendment No. 220. I am speaking to the amendments that appear in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish.
<P>
The purpose of those amendments is to clarify the meaning of the phrase "body corporate", which appears in clause 3(3). The intention is to make a body corporate responsible. The amendments would give that responsibility to people who are actively engaged in a hunt. We need to discuss whether it is appropriate for a body corporate for example, a private company to be prosecuted. I am interested to hear the comments of Committee members, and, depending on the debate, I reserve the right to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I wish to raise two issues. The first is that I am against the amendments, in particular those tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter). The second is that I want to move amendment No. 220.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That amendment is grouped with the amendments under discussion. The hon. Gentleman can only speak to it now, but it will be able to move it formally later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I certainly will want to move amendment No. 220. It is a strictly technical amendment to bring the Bill into line with Scottish legislation. As for other amendments in the group, many hunts are wealthy organisations. A considerable number of assets are tied up in them. The amendments would make it easy for individual hunt staff to be found guilty of an offence and fined, with no action taken against the hunt as a body corporate. Individual members of staff might have their fines paid for them by the hunt. That is why I insist that nothing is deleted from the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow, but will he identify a single pack of hounds or a hunt as a corporate identity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I would class the Worcestershire hunt as a body that represents an organisation involved in hunting, although I accept that it may not be an incorporated body in the sense of a limited or trading company. Incorporation would be the easy option for an organisation because that would exempt it from the Bill's provisions. It is important to second guess to what lengths people who enjoy hunting will go in order to continue hunting and how best we can stop their sport. That is why I disagree with my hon. Friend's amendments and believe that the clause should remain as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> A body corporate can carry out activities only through human beings. If the hon. Gentleman's Bill becomes law, individuals who commit offences will be liable. What is the purpose of making corporate bodies jointly and severally liable at criminal law for those activities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman raises an interesting point. I shall defer to his expertise in the law. As an accountant, I tend not to get too involved.
<P>
Provisions in the clause will be relevant to the ownership of land. If a body corporate allows a hunt over land that it owns, it could be found guilty of an offence. It is not inconceivable that a pack of hounds could be owned by a company. An organisation that used dogs for hunting would be covered by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Once again I rise, possibly to ruin a beautiful friendship with my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. I am afraid I remain unconvinced by his argument that a rich private company could pay the fines of an individual. Surely if a hunt numbered 50 or 60 people not a large organisation its fines could be paid by a sympathetic organisation. Individuals hunt. Individuals will have to face the courts and the consequences of their actions if the Bill becomes law. I see no reason to withdraw the amendment.

(2) the order shall deprive the person convicted of his rights, if any, in the article; and the article shall be taken into, or remain in, the possession of the police.
<P>
(3) If a person, other than the person convicted, applies to the court which made the order, or to a magistrates' court in the same petty sessional area, the court may order the article to be delivered to that person if he appears to the court to be its owner.

(4) The court shall not make an order under subsection (3) unless it is satisfied that the applicant

(a) had not consented to the person convicted having possession of the article, or
<P>
(b) did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the article was likely to be used for the purpose of hunting in contravention of section (Prohibition of hunting,  but that right shall cease on the expiry of that period.</ul></font>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester will tell me why the amendments cannot be included in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12 noon.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No. 221 and new clause 9, which are tabled in my name. I urge the Committee to accept those two changes to the Bill and to vote against amendment No. 154, tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 tightens up the language on forfeiture orders. I want to allay fears that any vehicle may be confiscated under the legislation. The original words were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any vehicle, animal or article which was used in connection ... or which was capable of being so used".</font></ul>
<P>
Some disquiet has been expressed over the interpretation of the phrase "capable of being so used". To interpret the phrase literally, a Mini may be put to several uses; it is capable of transporting dogs, although it is not necessarily designed to do so.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 includes not only an article or vehicle that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"was used in the commission of the offence",</font></ul>
<P>
but inserts one that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is designed to be used for the purpose of hunting".</font></ul>
<P>
Therefore, not only vehicles but articles may be forfeited under the amendment. Memberships lists, venues, and hunting horns, all of which are designed to be used for hunting, would be covered, along with lorries and transport vehicles that were designed specifically for transporting dogs to and from the "sporting event". The amendment covers not only the use of the particular offending article, but whether that article is designed to be so used.
<P>
New clause 9 is a technical change about forfeiture. Under subsection (2), the forfeiture deprives the convicted person of his right, if any, to the forfeited article. Subsection (3) to (6) also provide for persons other than the convicted person to claim a forfeited article on the grounds that the claimant is the owner of it. For example, a vehicle or an article may not be owned by, but was used by, a third party to go hunting. Rightly, we want the original owner to have a right to claim that forfeited vehicle. New clause 9 is a matter of common sense and technical competence and will accompany amendment No. 221, which, to repeat, is merely a tightening up of language to make the Bill more technically competent.
<P>
Amendment negatived.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall address amendments Nos. 222, 223 and 224 in this grouping.
<P>
Amendment No. 222 relates to the powers to make certain disqualification orders. It is important that the courts decide which dog the disqualification order applies to. I move the amendment to allay fears resulting from false accusations that pet dogs will be unfairly taken away from their owners. Clearly, that will not happen if the disqualification order is made by the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If the hon. Gentleman feels that it is necessary to move the amendment, it suggests that he recognises the legitimate fears of those who criticised the original Bill. Is he not admitting that his defence of the original Bill has been shot away by his own argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is a question of whether supporters of the Bill want in principle to take away pet dogs from their rightful owners, as opponents of the Bill argued. The amendment tightens the Bill to ensure that no one could accept that that was a valid argument. It was nothing to do with the technical competence of the original draft I remind the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that the purpose of the Committee is to go through the Bill with a fine-toothed comb and to get the details right, so that when the Bill progresses from the Committee it is a competent and workable piece of legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 223, for which I also seek support, is a somewhat lengthier change, as it suggests that we leave out a considerable amount all of subsection (2). The amendment identifies more precisely than the original draft when payments may be required for the care of dogs that have been delivered up or detained under clause 2. That constitutes the penalty aspect of the Bill. The funding of the dog that has been detained is quite rightly a matter of concern and amendment No. 223 suggests a more precise wording as to the implications in respect of that funding.
<P>
Amendment No. 224 is a simple and straightforward drafting amendment. It changes a couple of words on page 3, in subsection (4), line 4, and would remove "in relation to a dog" and substitute "in respect of a dog". It would not change the meaning of the subsection nor the policy or principle. It would merely change the technical language and I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 223, in page 2, line 39, leave out subsection (2) and insert

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 225, 226, 227 and 228. I look forward to the support of all members of the Committee, especially for amendment No. 225, which would give a dog owner a right of appeal against an order under clause 4 for confiscation of the dog. That should be welcomed by most members of the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 is a technical amendment to remove unnecessary words. The cost of looking after a dog would be the applicant's own cost and that person would have to pay the cost irrespective of the provision originally in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I want to be clear about the effect of amendment No. 226. Would it remove lines 21, 22 and 23 in subsection (6)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Amendment No. 226 refers to clause 4, page 3, line 18 and would remove from "application" to the end of line 20, so subsection (6)(b) would be deleted.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 is also a straightforward drafting amendment and would delete the word "order" and insert the word "disqualification" in its place. So, these are simple technical amendments to clause 4.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> With reference to amendments Nos. 167, 165 and 166, is my hon. Friend happy with the idea of taking a dog away and either giving it to someone else to look after, or disposing of it? Furthermore, is he confident that ownership of a dog can be established? I suspect that in many households that have a dog, who owns it is uncertain. It seems to me that that could cause problems. The first problem is one of establishing who owns the dog and the second is establishing who shall no longer be entitled to own the dog for 12 months. What will happen if it is simply a question of transferring ownership from husband to wife? Can my hon. Friend assure me that we are not creating legislation that will not work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall certainly deal with that matter. First, dogs, their disposal and rehoming were dealt with last week when I quoted a letter from Mr. Davies of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He said that the RSPCA would take the lead in rehoming hounds and dogs that had been used for hunting, so that should deal with some of the problems of disposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman be willing to take two or three hounds for a weekend to see how they perform in his home?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is a rather fatuous question. My one dog, two cats and three children might not like that. It would be irresponsible to take on ownership of two dogs that were not necessarily suitable to my circumstances and I am not in favour of irresponsible dog ownership. However, if the RSPCA is willing to take the lead in rehoming hounds, I will trust it to ensure that that is done correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that a well-known phrase used by welfare organisations is "A dog is for life, not just for Christmas"? We would all applaud that sentiment, so the suggestion of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is irresponsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the true nature of the rehousing programme that he proposes and the consequences of attempting to have as domestic animals hounds that have been bred to focus on a particular activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Bill does not mention any rehoming project and I shall certainly not be taking the lead [Laughter.] I apologise for that inadvertent pun. The RSPCA would be involved in that activity and I am sure that it would provide the hon. Gentleman with the information necessary to reassure him of the possibility of a dog being re-homed.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned ownership. Hounds in a pack have their ears tattooed to prove their ownership. Hunts go to great lengths to show their dogs and puppies and to have them named. They keep clear breeding records. It would not be difficult to prove ownership of a particular animal.
<P>
I made the point last week that dogs are currently bred unnecessarily. If dog breeding were to stop, the difficulties raised by my hon. Friend would be much reduced as fewer dogs would need to be re-homed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Will my hon. Friend clarify his comments? Disposal often means something other than destruction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Yes. It is perfectly possible even desirable that dogs that were formerly used to hunt can be re-homed and can have longer and more worthwhile lives than they would as part of a hunting pack. A dog that is put down at the age of six has not necessarily reached its full life expectancy. A dog that is re-homed and looked after will have a greater life expectancy than it would if it remained at the hunt and got a quick bullet to the head as soon as it slowed down.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I have a few words to say. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that there is a moral imperative that all animals should have as long a life as possible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall confine my remarks to the Bill which is concerned only with wild mammals and hunting with dogs. It does not encompass all animals. The amendments relate to dogs used in hunting and we should confine our argument to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> May I alert the Committee to the potential consequences of the amendment. About 15,500 fox hounds are in the 185 packs registered with the Masters of Foxhounds Association. Another 5,500 quarry hounds are registered to associations that deal with deer, hare and mink hunting. The Committee should have no doubt about the size of the problem. We may require the killing of something like 20,000 hounds.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester cannot shift the moral and practical burden of that on to the RSPCA. If the Bill is enacted, the 20,000 hounds, which, whether he likes it or not, are used for the hunting for which they were brought up, will be on his conscience. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman does not like hunting, but those hounds are likely to be wholly unsuitable for domestic use as pets. The term "rehousing" is a delicate expression that does not in any way convey the fate that the hounds will suffer if the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman's concern about the welfare of hounds is commendable. Does he accept that the hounds could be used for drag hunting, which would mean that there was no need to destroy them, and that fox hunts are not as commendable as is often suggested because they destroy about one third of their pack to make way for new hounds? We have seen crocodile tears from the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I understand where the hon. Lady is coming from. I do not expect her to share my view of the destruction of 20,000 hounds. With the greatest of respect, the hon. Lady's argument about drag hunting was wholly beside the point. I do not know whether she listened to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Sir R. Body) on Second Reading. He argued with clarity that it is impossible and impractical for hunts that have fox hounds to translate into drag hunts. The land may not be available and the consent of landowners and farmers might not be given to people who sought to cross private land for their own enjoyment. The hon. Lady should know but she may not care to believe that farmers in Leicestershire, which is my part of the world, and in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for North Wiltshire and for Montgomeryshire allow fox hunts on to their land because they perform a valuable environmental function and because they help to control pests. The hon. Lady may not like that, but it happens to be a fact of life.
<P>
I should be delighted if the hon. Lady would come to stay with me and my family in Leicestershire she could bring her husband and children. I extended the same invitation to the hon. Member for Worcester last June, but he refused it that is up to him, but the invitation still stands. Supporters of the Bill should see real life in rural England they should see what goes on in Leicestershire, Wiltshire, Pembrokeshire and Oxfordshire. There are 15,000 fox hounds throughout the country and 5,000 other quarry hounds, which will have to be disposed of. It does not matter what language one uses in essence, we are talking about the destruction of 20,000 animals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that his point is echoed by the Masters of Drag Hounds Association, which said that it sees no likelihood whatsoever of hounds being converted to drag hunting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. The facts are clear. It is a pity that supporters of the Bill will not move outside their prejudiced little world to meet the real people of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who live in the countryside. If the Bill is enacted, the hounds and other animals that those people have carefully looked after for many years will have to be destroyed.
<P>
I have made my point and a good point does not get any better through repetition. I invite the hon. Member for Worcester to consider my points during the many free hours that he will have between now and the next election.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I do not have much sympathy with the case that was made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and his hon. Friends. As was pointed out earlier, each year organised hunts get rid of a fair number of hounds that have ceased to be effective. If hunts were really concerned about extending or protecting hounds' lives, they would act differently.
<P>
However, we are dealing not only with hounds that are owned by hunts, but with dogs that are owned by individuals. I am especially worried about the much more difficult problem associated with hares. Often, those involved have one or two dogs in their household. It is in such cases that things are likely to be more difficult. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole said, a dog is for life. In such households, a dog may be presented to a child aged three or four as its Christmas present. The household looks after the dog, as if for life. On occasion, however, another member of the household, or someone else, may use the dog in a way that contravenes the legislation. It is to cover such cases that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole must be careful about the provisions for confiscation and to prevent someone from owning a dog. When the owner is a child in a household and one of the adults or an older sibling has committed the offence, it is still unclear whether the dog would have to leave the household. I ask hon. Friend to give us some clarification.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that a good point does not get any better through repetition; neither does a bad one. His point was a bad one; I shall not repeat his arguments, but shall try to make good points to help the Committee.
[Mr. Cawsey]
<P>
I find it staggering that people who condone the unnecessary killing of 10,000 dogs a year then have the audacity even to begin to pretend in Committee that they are interested in the welfare of dogs, let alone lecture us, who are interested in the welfare of dogs and who gratefully accept the offer of animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA to deal with those hounds should the Bill become law.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman's source for the figure of 10,000 dogs a year being put down by those who hunt foxes and other animals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The campaign for the protection of hunted animals. Hon. Members who oppose the Bill have not come up with a counter-figure, nor have they said that that figure is inaccurate, nor how many hounds a year it is acceptable to kill perhaps we are about to be enlightened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I doubt that I shall enlighten the hon. Gentleman; nothing that he has done or said in the past five or six weeks leads med to believe that I could be optimistic about that.
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman realise that each year, 3,000 new, young hounds are entered into the fox hunt kennel stud book? That includes entries from the registered packs in Ireland. If, as he says, 10,000 dogs a year are killed and only 3,000 new entrants come into hunting, does not the mathematics demonstrate to him that within a short space of time, perhaps three or four years, there would not be a living hound left in England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I take great interest in the hon. Gentleman's telling us how many are killed. He has still not denied that that takes place. He assumes that every birth is registered; I think that we all know that is not the case. In the complete absence of any argument from those who oppose the Bill about how many dogs are killed by hunts, we know that the practice occurs. Animal welfare groups have tried to come up with a figure. Those who oppose the Bill say that it is wrong, but they do not say what is right. Let us have some enlightenment, for goodness' sake.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman; I do not have the figures. However, does he accept that his figure of 10,000 is wrong? If he needs me to say so, I believe strongly that he is out by a considerable margin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The hon. Gentleman could almost have been a statistician for the previous Government, with such a vague reference to figures. Nothing would please me more than for that 10,000 figure to be wrong. I do not want the hounds to be shot. I do not want their lives to be terminated early. When an animal welfare group tries to quantify the figure and does research to help the Committee, it is bit much for those who oppose the Bill to do no more than say that that figure is wrong. We can all say that it is wrong, but let us have some evidence so that we can have an informed debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we are not talking about the number of working animals put down every year. Of course, police dogs in police forces and Army dogs in the Army are put down every year when they reach the end of their normal working lives. Our point is that the hon. Gentleman is trying to justify the politically correct annihilation of 20,000 hounds on the basis that some animals are destroyed when they reach the end of their working lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> There is still no answer. Remarkable!
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> It is not the number of animals registered, but the number of animals born in a litter that is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Of course and that is why we want facts and evidence from those who oppose the Bill. The point has been well made that no dogs will have to be destroyed because animal welfare groups have offered to intervene. At the moment, dogs that are no longer able to work are killed. They are almost treated like concentration camp inmates in the second world war. Hon. Members opposed to the Bill seek to defend that practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Let me check. If we provide figures to show that the hon. Gentleman's figures are vastly in error, will he make a commitment to reassess aspects of his argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I support the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, who has often said that if hunts stop their breeding programmes now, by the time the Bill becomes law 
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I asked the hon. Gentleman for a yes or no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I do not want any dogs to be shot unnecessarily. That is my basic belief. I welcome the intervention of the RSPCA and other groups. I will not take lectures from people who, in a blas\ae fashion, are happy for dogs to be taken out and shot in the back of the head when they are deemed to be useless to the hunt. I refuse to take moral lectures from that immoral standpoint.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that landowners will not allow drag hunting, but who allows the drag hunts that take place now? Are those hunts guilty of an illegal trespass that is not reported to the courts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman is in danger of demeaning himself by putting up Aunt Sallies. He should listen carefully to the points made in the debate and respond to them instead of to the points that he thinks have been made. He is, no doubt sincerely, mistaken.
<P>
The English countryside is at maximum capacity for drag hunting. If the hon. Gentleman reads the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness, he will find that his points are confounded by the facts and arguments. He will discover that in an increasingly urbanised Britain, no land is left to convert fox hunting into drag hunting; nor is there the willingness on the part of those farmers who allow fox hunting on their land to allow recreational drag hunting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful for that intervention or was it a speech? I have two responses. First, I was referring to what the hon. Gentleman said about landowners who will not allow drag hunting. I am sure that the record will show that. Drag hunts already exist.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that fox hounds could not be converted to drag hunting. Will my hon. Friend comment on the fact that the Oxford drag hunt uses hounds from the Bicester with Whaddon Chase fox hounds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and am greatly enjoying the sight of squirming on the Oppostion Benches. On Second Reading, if memory serves me right I am happy to check it in Hansard the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Sir R. Body) said not that drag hunting would not be allowed on land or that there was no room for expansion, but that there was limited room for expansion. Perhaps hon. Members might like to read Hansard to check that. The hon. Gentleman said that there was room for the expansion of drag hunting. If that is so, dogs can be converted, as my hon. Friends have pointed out. Animal welfare groups could help to look after the dogs left over. There is no justification for the scaremongering of Opposition Members. From the perspective of the fox hound, the Bill would mean a much better future than they will have if the Bill falls and those who shoot the dogs, with the support of Opposition Members, carry on doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> A couple points need to be addressed. First, I did not accept the invitation of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to go to a hunt in Leicestershire because I went to my local hunt in Worcestershire. I do not think that activities there are markedly different from those in Leicestershire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is that why the hon. Gentleman insisted on Second Reading on using a description of the fox hunt that was 200 years out of date and almost certainly incorrect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses the point. I was drawing to the House's attention the fact that hunt members have boasted recently about the length of the chase, not when it took place. Masses of fox hunts boast about the length of the chase, as if it were something to be proud of that the Worcestershire hunt had the longest chase recorded in history. I do not think that anyone should necessarily be proud of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that correspondence in Horse and Hound in 1980 nearly 20 years ago, but not quite 200 years ago referred to hare hunting. One letter said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is probably better to have a good hunt of over an hour or ninety minutes, rather than overmatch the hare and pull her down in twenty minutes".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does not that indicate the driving force behind those who hunt?

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I agree totally. It is the long pursuit that gives hunters so much pleasure from their day's hunt.
<P>
Let me return to dogs and the apparent lack of evidence that 10,000 dogs are killed each year. I mentioned dog breeding in the Worcestershire hunt last week and I have a list of the puppy breeding. Five pairs were bred in one season. The hunt kennel staff said that the average litter size was 12. Twelve fives are 60. The pack size of the Worcestershire hunt is about 100. It is perfectly conceivable that the 10,000 figure is right. If 60 dogs are bred in Worcestershire and the pack size is maintained at 100, some 60 dogs have to go elsewhere or else the pack will continually expand. It is perfectly conceivable that the 10,000 figure is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman discover how many whelps a bitch could feed? He said 10 or 12 puppies were born, but how many can feed off a mother?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Clearly, fewer than 12 and usually eight, which, the hon. and learned Gentleman may wish to know, is the number of teats on the underside of a bitch. The hon. and learned Gentleman raised the interesting point that the ability to pick and choose which pups survive encourages breeders to produce large litters. Bitches that produce large litters are selected for breeding: the boast of the Worcestershire hunt was that a bitch once had 21 pups. The hunt was pleased about that despite the fact that 21 pups could not survive because it provided the opportunity to pick and choose which pups survived and which were killed.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am becoming more and more disappointed. We are going backwards rather than progressing from last week's debate, and I have still not had an answer about my lurchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I entirely agree that we are going over a debate that we had last week, but some hon. Members opposing the Bill were clearly not paying attention or were not briefed. They have come to the Committee this week to raise the same issues again.
<P>
With regard to lurchers and hare coursing, presumably lurchers are kept as family pets anyway and are just taken along for a day's sport by the owner or another person. In such a case, the dog would remain a family pet. It is the activity of hunting or chasing the hare that we want to make illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> As my hon. Friend is talking about hounds and how they will be affected should the Bill become law, may I draw the Committee's attention to the points made on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Sir R. Body), which were raised in an earlier debate. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness had said that landowners would not allow any drag hunting and I said that my recollection was that he had said there could be limited expansion. If I may quote from Hansard, the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have been authorised to say on their behalf that the scope for increasing drag hunting is very limited. We could introduce probably only about 10 more packs of drag hounds into the countryside." [Official Report, 28 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 1255.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That proves that my recollection was somewhat better than that of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for resting his case. If it is correct that there is room for 10 more packs of drag hounds, what is to be done with the 175 remaining packs of fox hounds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> It does not surprise me that those who seek to do the Bill down say that it is impossible to make the switch. The point I am making is that even firm opponents of the Bill acknowledge that there is room for the expansion of drag hunting. We may disagree about the size of that expansion I believe that it could expand much further but even those who are completely opposed to the Bill acknowledge that drag hunting could be increased and more hounds could be used. The more hounds that switch to drag hunting, the fewer the RSPCA will have to deal with or will have to be shot.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 226, in clause 4, page 3, line 18, leave out from "application;" to end of line 20.
<P>
No. 227, in clause 4, page 3, line 21, leave out "order" and insert "a disqualification".
<P>
No. 228, in clause 4, page 3, line 22, leave out "an order" and insert "disqualification". [Mr. Michael J. Foster.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 229,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That Clause 4 be divided into two Clauses, one consisting of subsection (1) (forfeiture and disqualification orders) and the other consisting of subsections (2) to (6) (disqualification orders: supplementary).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment will divide clause 4, so that the first part will set out the courts' power to make forfeiture and disqualification orders and the second part will contain the supplementary provisions about disqualification orders. New clause 9, which I have already moved, will set out those provisions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. New clause 9 has not been moved. It has been debated and will be called formally at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. I am sometimes carried away by my urge to make progress.
<P>
New clause 9, which has been debated, will form the second part of clause 4. So the amendment is straightforward; it divides clause 4 into two new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am unsure whether this is a question for the Bill's promoter or for you, Mr. O'Hara, but the Bill is being re-written as we progress, and it is not easy to look at the Bill as it emerges and compare it with the original document. Would it be possible for Committee members to have a print-out of the Bill as those who support it would like it to read? It is somewhat complicated to refer to clause 4 that has been split up and to see how it relates to other parts of the Bill, as well as to amendments that have not been moved. It would be convenient if, when we return at 4.30 pm we could have a document that sets out the Bill that we are moving towards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I advise the hon. Gentleman that the service he requests cannot be delivered by the Public Bill office. If the hon. Member for Worcester wishes to draft such an assisting document, it is up to him to do so. Of course the Clerks are always prepared to advise hon. Members who wish to seek advice on the development of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4a, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 4b, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the few minutes left to us before we adjourn, I wish to point out to the Committee and, indeed, to other Members of the House of Commons, who will wonder what we have been doing for the past six weeks, that, as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said, we are now considering a Bill that is clauses 1 to 4b that is completely different to that discussed on Second Reading. The wider membership of the House of Commons will have discussed a Bill that bears little resemblance to the one before the Committee. For example, they will have considered a clause 4 that bears little relation to new clauses 4a and 4b. Clause 4(2) has completely disappeared and, if the Committee so desires, new clause 9 will become part of new clause 4a or 4b. Any hon. Member who voted on the Bill on Second Reading in November could be forgiven for thinking, when presented with the redrafted Bill and clauses 4a and 4b, that that was not what was discussed on Second Reading. That must leave grounds for hoping that we shall be able to comfort hon. Members who are not members of the Committee that they will have an opportunity fully to discuss the redrafted Bill.
<P>
I make no complaint of the use of parliamentary tactics by the hon. Member for Worcester and his hon. Friends that is, all those who support the Bill that was discussed in the House on Second Reading in November and who have supported its progress through the six long but now wasted days in Committee prior to today. They tabled more than 200 amendments and I applaud the industry of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish who is implacably opposed to the continuance of hunting in any form and is on the record as so saying for many years. I congratulate him and his hon. Friends, but one does not know whose is the directing mind behind the ingenious but wholly artificial amendments. All were designed 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for the Chair to determine whether amendments are artificial. I have listened with care to the hon. and learned Gentleman and take it that he was speaking to the unusual situation of clauses 4a and 4b, as amended, stand part of the Bill. I draw the hon. and learned Gentleman's attention to the fact that if the Bill leaves the Committee in a radically different form from that in which it came to the Committee, it will not be the first Bill to have done so. That happens regularly in Committee. I have allowed the hon. and learned Gentleman to expatiate on the point, which has been well made, and I now ask him to confine his comments to the question that clauses 4a and 4b stand part of the Bill instead of making procedural points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I have no argument with you, Mr. O'Hara. I am merely pointing out that clauses 4a and 4b are radically different from the clause that was drafted with such care and legal expertise by Mr. Anthony Scrivener on behalf of the hon. Member for Worcester and that that is not the clause that will stand part of the Bill. It is important to bear in mind that some of the amendments that have been tabled and pressed to a Division and which now reflect on the shape of clauses 4a and 4b, have been moved by implacable opponents of hunting. The hon. Members who moved amendments to clause 4 as originally drafted and clauses 4a and 4b voted in favour of the Bill. The House and the public are entitled to know that in my submission I cannot produce direct evidence but can only infer from they did, said and knew the hon. Members concerned did so from motives that were entirely honourable, sincere
