							<b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Welcome back to the
proceedings, Mr. Gale. At the end of the previous sitting, I
was about to ask the Financial Secretary what discussions the
Government have held with other Governments that already use
track-and-trace technology and with third sector organisations in the
UK, such as ASH.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051099000374"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Mr. Gale. I want to
pursue the point relating to hand-rolled tobacco raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Braintree, particularly with regard to the
difference between the duty on hand-rolled tobacco and that on
manufactured cigarettes. I have been approached in respect of the
matter, as I suspect other members of the Committee have been, by
Philip Morris Ltd. Unlike most of its competitors, Philip Morris does
not produce any hand-rolled tobacco, although it is a substantial
producer of manufactured cigarettes. It has therefore taken an unusual
position for a business because it is in favour of higher taxes to
equalise the position of hand-rolled tobacco with that of manufactured
cigarettes.</div>
					<a name="07051099000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The figures
that Philip Morris presented to me raise an interesting point. It
provided them before the increases in the last Budget, but those
changes did not fundamentally change the position. According to the
figures, the tax on a packet of 20 manufactured cigarettes was
&#163;4.07, whereas the tax on an equivalent amount of hand-rolled
tobacco was &#163;2.15. That is clearly a substantial difference,
which must be one of the causes of the substantial increase in the use
of hand-rolled tobacco as a percentage of overall tobacco use in this
country, to which my hon. Friend referred. As he said, the proportion
appears to have doubled.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>
					<a name="07051099000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I have seen
two sets of Government figures. Both show that in 1990 the use of
hand-rolled tobacco represented 11 per cent. of tobacco use. That has
increased to either 22 per cent., according to an answer given by the
Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Don Valley
(Caroline Flint), to a written parliamentary question, or 24 per cent.,
according to the Treasury&#146;s pamphlet &#147;New Responses to
New Challenges: Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling
Strategy&#148;, which was published in March 2006. There is clearly a
substantial increase in the relative use of hand-rolled tobacco. It is
worth pointing out that in the 16 to 24-year-old age group, the use of
such tobacco among males increased from 10 per cent. in 1990 to 25 per
cent. in 2005, and from 2 to 12 per cent. among females in the same
period.</div>
					<a name="07051099000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that
those increases are largely driven by the different taxation system. I
suspect that the Government have a good reason for having lower
taxation for hand-rolled tobacco, namely smuggling. I should be
grateful if the Financial Secretary could confirm
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051099000375"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): To carry on my hon.
Friend&#146;s theme, the White Paper &#147;Smoking Kills&#148;,
to which I referred, said that the Government&#146;s objectives were
to help existing smokers to quit the habit and to help children and
young people to avoid becoming addicted in the first place. If, as he
suggests, more and more people, particularly children, are using
hand-rolled tobacco as an alternative to filtered cigarettes, is not
hand-rolling tobacco much more dangerous than filtered cigarettes to
the health of children and
adults?</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000376"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention. My hon. Friend
may well be right; I do not know whether hand-rolled tobacco is
essentially more dangerous to people than manufactured cigarettes, but
none the less it appears to be a growing market. We come back to the
tension that sometimes exists, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Windsor explored with regard to alcohol. Sometimes there is tension
between raising revenue and discouraging a certain type of behaviour. I
believe that the reason why the Government have kept hand-rolled
tobacco duties at a lower level is because of the fear of smuggling. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree pointed out, something like
half the consumption of hand-rolled tobacco is from smuggling sources.
It would appear that it is easier to smuggle hand-rolled tobaccos
simply because of the way in which it is packaged, and in many other
European countries the rates of duty on hand-rolled tobacco, as with
ourselves, are somewhat lower than for manufactured cigarettes. In
relative and absolute terms, the difference is even greater, so there
is a difficulty.</div>
					<a name="07051099000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there are one or two
problems, and I would be grateful if any figures are available to
clarify matters. Given the relative increase in the use of hand-rolled
tobacco over the last 16 or 17 years or so, what cost to the Treasury
has resulted in that increase of use? Going forward, has the Treasury
considered, given the different taxation systems that apply, that that
relative use may increase even further, thus reducing revenues? I was
also struck by the figure quoted by a number of hon. Members that the
cost to the Exchequer of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>smuggling cigarettes was something like &#163;2.9 billion. Does that
figure take into account the fact that the duty on hand-rolled tobacco
is kept low, presumably to try to reduce smuggling? I assume that it
does not. No criticism is meant by that, but the problem would appear,
in some respects, to be worse, given that steps are being taken to
reduce it.</div>
					<a name="07051099000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury&#146;s paper on tackling tobacco smuggling refers to how, in
2000, the Government believed that the range of actions taken could be
successful in reducing smuggling both of cigarettes and of hand-rolled
tobacco. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07051099000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
as HMRC&#146;s knowledge and understanding of the market has
improved, it has become clear that the market for smuggling methods for
HRT are different from those for cigarettes and different responses are
needed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specific
policies were announced within that paper, which was produced a year
ago, and a specific operational target was set out for hand-rolled
tobacco, reducing the size of the UK illicit market by the equivalent
of around 20 per cent. by 2007-08. We are now halfway through that
period, and I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary could give
us some information on what progress has been made.</div>
					<a name="07051099000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth pointing out
Sweden has abolished the distinction between the two levels of duty.
They have now, in effect, a unified rate, and I do not know whether the
Treasury has made any study to see what the consequence of that has
been, and whether that has resulted in an increase or decrease in
smuggling. As I also mentioned, there is an issue to do with a
differential rate throughout the European Union, and I would be
grateful to know whether the Government are in discussions with our
fellow European countries on that to see whether any thought has been
given to a co-ordinated approach to raising duties.</div>
					<a name="07051099000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I also give
the Financial Secretary an opportunity to scotch one myth, if indeed it
is one. The duty on hand-rolled tobacco is lower because traditionally
it was seen as being consumed by the poorest sections of society and
the Government did not want to impose costs on them. I wonder whether
the attitude of the Home Secretary in thinking that tobacco provides
some pleasure in an otherwise unpleasurable life in certain sections of
society influences Government policy. I am not saying that it does. I
should be grateful if the Financial Secretary could confirm that
smuggling has caused us to have a rate of duty that appears to
encourage more and more people to smoke hand-rolled tobacco. It is one
area in which the Government&#146;s anti-smoking policy appears to be
failing.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051099000377"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): We will not oppose
the duty increases; indeed, we support them. I want to add to the case
made by the hon. Member for Wycombe and others in respect of smuggling
and counterfeit products, which make up what can be called the illicit
market.</div>
					<a name="07051099000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I will come
to the obvious aspect of tax losses in a moment, but the duties have
two other effects. They undermine one sector of the retail
trade&#151;the small-time tobacconists, which have lost a lot of
their business to supermarkets. They are also losing out because of
smuggled branded and counterfeit products, which still get into the
country. Another, subliminal, effect is that it erodes people&#146;s
integrity if they find no difficulty in purchasing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>cigarettes and tobacco products which they know to be avoiding tax, and
think nothing of it. That should not be encouraged, and we need to
recognise the effect that it can have on people&#146;s views of
citizenship and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07051099000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
tax losses, the Minister will know that I tabled some questions to him
recently which ultimately referred me, very helpfully, to the
&#147;Measuring Indirect Tax Losses&#151; 2006&#148; report and,
specifically, to tables 3.3 and 3.4, on cigarettes and hand-rolled
tobacco. I will not go into the details of individual figures, but the
report helpfully provides some mid-point estimates&#151;the figures
are obviously not accurate, and guesstimates have to be made.</div>
					<a name="07051099000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The mid-point
range of the illicit market share in cigarettes has changed from 21 per
cent. in 2001 to 14 per cent. 2004-05, the latest year for
which figures are available. The underlying estimates of the revenues
necessarily have a rather large range: from &#163;2.1 billion to
&#163;3.3 billion in 2001 and from &#163;1.2 billion to
&#163;2.5 billion in 2004-05. Whatever the mid-points of those
figures ultimately turn out to be, they are very significant. The
losses on hand-rolling tobacco were estimated to be in the range of
&#163;500 million to &#163;850 million in 2000-01 and
&#163;680 million to &#163;970 million in 2004-05, which are not
insignificant figures.</div>
					<a name="07051099000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the problem of
smuggled and counterfeit products, the potential losses of revenue and
the other consequences that I mentioned will exercise the minds of the
Treasury. The smuggled market in Britain is beginning to be brought
under control, but it is still a significant problem. It has been
compared with that in countries such as Turkey. It has a market five
times the size of the United Kingdom&#146;s and is clearly
geographically far more vulnerable, but it has the problem under much
tighter control. There is a growing sense that the UK needs to put a
solution in place as soon as
possible.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051099000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07051099000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference has
been made to track-and-trace technology, which I understand is a proven
solution to the problem of smuggled and counterfeit goods. It is a
means of putting a covert marking on to products to enable enforcement
orders to determine the point of diversion at which the product enters
the illicit market. Voluntary measures, such as the memorandum of
understanding, are insufficient on their own. They need strict
compliance systems and legally enforceable sanctions if they are to be
effective.</div>
					<a name="07051099000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far,
the Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs have been
unable to provide a sufficiently compelling explanation as to why the
UK is the only member state not to have signed up to the agreement with
the European Commission, referred to as the Philip Morris agreement.
What is the
reason?</div>
					<a name="07051099000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
me turn to the counterfeit market, which is becoming a greater problem.
By definition, counterfeit goods will not be the same as the branded
products. Thus, if there is a health problem in relation to branded
tobacco products, there could be an even greater one in relation to
counterfeit products that are not manufactured under the conditions
that apply to branded products. The issue is substantially more complex
than smuggling. However, it is the loss of potential tax revenue that
needs to be at the forefront of our thinking today. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>is broad agreement that voluntary arrangements are insufficient; there
is a clear need for real protection. Every country that has implemented
track-and-trace technology or its equivalent has seen a successful
outcome as a direct consequence. In most cases, its introduction has
been led by the Ministry of Finance or whatever the equivalent is in
the country concerned.</div>
					<a name="07051099000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Smuggling and
counterfeit are both continuing problems. I note that in the 2006
Budget, the Chancellor published &#147;New responses to new
challenges: Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling
Strategy&#148;, which announced new measures further to strengthen
the anti-smuggling strategy, including working with tobacco
manufacturers to tighten controls along the supply chain. I shall be
interested to learn what results that has produced. What meetings,
discussions and agreements have taken place with the manufacturers and
what controls have been tightened along the supply chain? The effective
remedies probably boil down to three things: effective enforcement,
international co-operation and tough penalties. Getting just one right
will not do. We need action on all three if we are to stem tax losses
and protect what is left of the retail sector of confectioners,
tobacconists and newsagents, and the health of people who smoke
counterfeit
products.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale.</div>
					<a name="07051099000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a self-confessed, lifelong
anti-smoking crusader, I could not resist the temptation to contribute
to this part of the Committee&#146;s proceedings, and to welcome the
increases in duty. In my perusal of all the clauses, I have not been
able to find any reference to the welcome measure announced in the Red
Book of a reduction in the rate of VAT on smoking cessation products. I
understand that there will be a reduction from the normal rate to a
concessionary rate of 5 per cent., but for only one year from 1 July
according to the Red Book. That is welcome, and sets a useful precedent
for similar reductions in VAT to encourage good environmental
behaviour&#151;I shall come to that on later clauses.</div>
					<a name="07051099000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Financial Secretary
explain why there is no reference to that reduction in the Bill? In
case we do not have a further opportunity to discuss the matter, will
he also explain why it will be in place for only one year? That seems
perverse, particularly when it has been established through freedom of
information requests that almost half of primary care trusts in this
country cut their stop-smoking budgets in real terms during the
financial year just ended. That VAT measure may provide some modest
relief to help to restore the position, and it is an important means of
reducing the amount of smoking by encouraging people to take up devices
such as nicotine patches to help them to beat the habit, which I am
sure we all want to
see.</div>

						<a name="07051099000379"></a>
							<b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I want to try to establish again
the Treasury&#146;s direction of thought. What is the objective of
the changes in duty? We have heard about the balance between smuggling,
law and order, and illicit and legitimate cigarettes. Is the objective
to stop smuggling&#151;I am sure that the answer is, to a certain
degree, yes&#151;or is it revenue raising? We all accept that there
is an element of revenue raising, which is understandable, but is there
also a health objective to reduce the number of smokers in Britain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>by increasing the price and deterring consumption? Is there a
demand-reduction
goal?</div>
					<a name="07051099000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
answer may be that there are three, four, five or six objectives, but
if it is a combination of multiple objectives, will the Financial
Secretary tell us how his Department deals with the conflict in
objectives? To give a hypothetical example, if the anti-smuggling
measures worked, all cigarettes were purchased legitimately and duty
was being paid, the amount of duty would rise. But if there were a
reduction in the amount of duty&#151;this goes back to elasticity of
supply&#151;how would he resolve the conflict between raising revenue
to the Exchequer by encouraging more smoking and the health objective
of reducing the number of smokers? I want to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking to find out how that conflict resolution
would take place when there are multiple objectives in the
clause.</div>

							<a name="07051099000380"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> Welcome
back to our proceedings, Mr.
Gale.</div>
					<a name="07051099000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for South-East Cornwall made a reflective contribution. He mentioned a
concern that I am well aware of because I see the Tobacco Alliance
every year in the run-up to the Budget, but which no one else has
mentioned&#151;the impact of smuggling and bootlegging on independent
tobacconists and corner shops. I am conscious of how they are
profoundly undermined by illegal tobacco and bootleg sales.
Nevertheless, part of the pressure on them is a result of our shopping
habits and the change in the way we lead our lives. It is not due just
to tobacco duty or the level of
smuggling.</div>
					<a name="07051099000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman quoted a number of statistics that we published alongside the
pre-Budget report just before Christmas on the level of the illegal
market in the UK. The mid-point of the illicit market in
2004-05&#151;he was not certain about this&#151;was 14 per cent.,
which is down from 21 per cent. four years earlier when we launched our
anti-tobacco smuggling strategy. If we had not taken action, it would
probably have risen to 36 per cent.</div>
					<a name="07051099000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Members are
right to question the Government on whether the measures that we are
taking are sufficient, whether they are having the necessary impact and
how they are working&#151;that applies particularly to the new ones.
The hon. Gentleman called for legally enforceable sanctions and tough
penalties in voluntary memorandums of understanding with UK tobacco
manufacturers. I think that he served on last year&#146;s Finance
Bill. It might have slipped his mind, but at that stage we legislated
for a framework that gave the Government the ability to raise penalties
of up to &#163;5 million on tobacco companies that do not follow the
agreements and obligations when controlling their supply chains. I am
glad to say that we have not had cause to use those yet, but we will
not hesitate to invoke those penalties if necessary. I am sure that he
accepts that they could be an important weapon in our
armoury.</div>
					<a name="07051099000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right also about counterfeits being a growing problem.
According to the latest figures, in 2005-06, 51 per cent. of
large-scale seizures made by HMRC were of counterfeits. I continue to
believe, and to argue, that the UK&#146;s memorandums of
understanding are better than that struck between the EU and Philip
Morris, because the latter does not cover counterfeit tobacco and
cigarettes.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>
					<a name="07051099000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn briefly to the
point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow. If he is a lifelong
anti-smoking crusader, I congratulate him&#151;this must be an
important year for him. I am sure that he is pleased at the prospect of
the smoking ban in July.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000381"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> To clarify, I voted against the smoking ban in
public places. I agonised over that decision, as the Minister will
understand, because it put into conflict two vital
principles&#151;the freedom of the individual and the desire to
reduce smoking. I am afraid that the freedom of the individual won out
on that
occasion.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000382"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> It is interesting to hear how the hon. Gentleman
wrestled with his principles. To rephrase, no doubt he welcomes what
everyone anticipates&#151;a reduction in levels of smoking as a
result of the ban. Many on the Government Benches supported the
measure, even if he did not when it came before the House. The
provisions for reducing VAT this year on products that help people to
give up smoking and to reinforce and support the ban are not in the
Bill because we will introduce them under secondary legislation. Those
regulatory powers are in
legislation.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000383"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I wanted only to make a short quip: the Minister
said that hon. Members supported the legislation, but was that before
or after they went down to the smoking
room?</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07051099000384"></a>John

I know that it will not be easy for them in the coming
months.</div>
					<a name="07051099000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Windsor, for Braintree and for South-West Hertfordshire
tussled with what is undoubtedly a complex interaction&#151;between
duty, demand, revenues and levels of smuggling&#151;and a complex set
of considerations when weighing up the situation. The model that we
use, which we developed with assistance from independent academic
experts and had peer-reviewed by them, was published in December 2004.
If the hon. Member for Braintree is interested in receiving a copy, I
will ensure that he gets one. It shows that the inflation increase that
we propose in this Bill will not increase smuggling, that the prices
and duty levels of cigarettes are historically high in the UK and that
the cigarette duty rates are close to revenue maximisation
point.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051099000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07051099000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Wycombe kindly quoted my making this case during the consideration
of last year&#146;s Finance Bill, so I need not repeat myself. The
effect of the measure means that any big rise in the rates of tobacco
duty will reduce revenue and increase smuggling, so that is a central
consideration for us as we weigh up these duty decisions. He is right
to believe that my view and assessment of that has not
changed.</div>
					<a name="07051099000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 2000,
the tax on hand-rolling tobacco has been increased by the same rate as
the duty on cigarettes. As with cigarettes, our modelling and analysis
suggests that a real increase in the duty on hand-rolling tobacco would
significantly increase the smuggling problem and undermine our wider
Government health objectives. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>The duty level on hand-rolling tobacco is higher here than in Sweden,
and it is also close to revenue maximisation
point.</div>
					<a name="07051099000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
is the context in which we considered the duty decisions in the run-up
to the Budget in March. The clause would increase the rate of duty on
cigarettes, cigars, hand-rolling tobacco and other smoking and chewing
tobacco in line with inflation. We are conscious in all this that
smoking kills more than 100,000 people a year and is the single
greatest cause of preventable early deaths in this country. Therefore,
the increase supports the wider Government aim of reducing smoking
levels by maintaining the real price of
cigarettes.</div>
					<a name="07051099000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
a result of the real-terms duty increases both under this Government in
previous years and under earlier Governments, tobacco prices in the UK
are now at record high levels. The duty decision will maintain that
real price and will continue to encourage people to smoke less or to
quit. It should also therefore continue to help to discourage children
and young people from taking up the habit in the first place, and it
sits alongside what I think all members of the Committee might
recognise as a significant investment in national health services to
support people who are trying to give up smoking.</div>
					<a name="07051099000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2006, my own area of
Rotherham&#146;s stop smoking service saw more than 2,500 people,
half of whom quit smoking as a result. As we approach the prospect of
the smoking ban&#151;this may also be the experience of other members
of the Committee&#151;there have been increasing calls on that
service. I hope that it will be able to help an increasing number of
people to give up the habit.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051099000385"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I am entirely
supportive of the comments that the Financial Secretary is making about
how the duties are used to support Government policy in helping to cut
smoking. I am not sure how they are consistent with the comments that
he made about alcohol, especially those relating to particular types of
alcohol, such as special brew lagers. Such lagers are clearly linked to
people with specific problems. Why does he feel that the same
principles that he just explained in relation to tobacco should not and
do not apply in specific cases relating to
alcohol?</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000386"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I have two things to say on that. I am sorry that
the hon. Lady was not present for this morning&#146;s debate, because
it was quite a detailed debate about the elasticities and
inelasticities of demand, and how they differ for beer, cigarettes,
cars and houses. That is the economic reality. The other fact is that
within our beer duty regime we tax according to the strength of beer
and lager, so that strong lagers are taxed more heavily than weak ones.
So an element of the system of tax on beer and lager already reflects
the concerns that she
has.</div>
					<a name="07051099000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside our
duty decisions there is the prospective smoking ban in public places in
July, the NHS stop smoking services and the fact that, in October, we
shall raise the minimum age at which young people can buy tobacco from
16 to 18. I want to pay tribute in passing, Mr. Gale, to my
hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis),
whose constituency 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>sits between mine and that of your co-Chairman. He has been one of the
leading advocates and campaigners for just such a
rise.</div>
					<a name="07051099000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
are very conscious when we set the duty levels about the potential
impact on smuggling. We are confident that this inflation-only increase
will not lead to a rise in smuggling. The impact of the anti-smuggling
strategy since we introduced it in 2000 has been quite significant. It
first of all stabilised and then drove down the illicit market share.
It is clear that we need to do more on hand-rolling tobacco, as we
announced in the Budget last year. We are also tightening up the
provisions we put in place through the memorandum of understanding and
the legislation last year. I was asked specifically about the Philip
Morris International agreement. Apart from the fact that that was
negotiated between the European Commission and 10 of the member states,
as was pointed out to the Committee earlier, in part by dropping legal
proceedings against the company in the US, the main strengths of our
legislation to control the supply chain contrast with the Philip Morris
agreement in various respects.</div>
					<a name="07051099000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, our arrangements apply
to all tobacco manufacturers, not just to Philip Morris. Secondly, the
Philip Morris agreement excludes any tobacco products on which duty is
paid in another member state. Nearly all hand-rolling tobacco in the UK
comes from other parts of the EU and has duty paid in those countries,
so it would not be touched in this case. Thirdly, unlike in many other
member states, Philip Morris has only about a 5 per cent. share of the
market in the UK. Fourthly, as I explained to the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall, our penalties can range up to &#163;5 million if
companies under our arrangements are not following their obligations.
Finally, as I have also pointed out, the Philip Morris agreement does
not cover counterfeit tobacco, and counterfeit is clearly a growing
problem about which we and manufacturers are
concerned.</div>
					<a name="07051099000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to questions of track and trace and markets, we announced at the
Budget&#151;I hope that members of the Committee will not have missed
it, but judging by some of their comments they may have
done&#151;that we had reached an agreement with the tobacco
manufacturers in this country voluntarily to introduce covert markings
on packs of tobacco products. That will enable the counterfeit products
to be identified and traced more effectively. I expect those markings
to begin to be introduced on packets during the course of the year. The
hon. Member for Wycombe asked how we came to that judgment and this
agreement. We consulted very widely, including with ASH, the tobacco
manufacturers, other countries and potential suppliers of the sort of
technology that we were interested in
using.</div>
					<a name="07051099000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
this is a duty increase that continues our policy of maintaining a high
price for cigarettes without hampering our efforts to tackle smuggling.
It will help to reduce smoking. It will help to lower the costs
associated with smoking. I am glad of the indication from both the
Liberals and the Tories that they will not seek to oppose this
clause.</div>

							<a name="07051099000387"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> We turn to amusement machine licence duty which is
a slightly esoteric and long-standing excise duty. It is nevertheless
important to those who run establishments in which gaming machines form
a valuable revenue source. Since 27 October last year, our social
regulation, or our social law, has allowed machines with a 30p stake
and a &#163;25 jackpot&#151;in tax law, the so-called category C
machines that are in pubs, clubs and arcades&#151;to increase their
maximum stake and prize to 50p and &#163;35. In return, the industry
agreed to a stronger code of social responsibility on the operation of
these machines.</div>
					<a name="07051099000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definitions of gaming machines in excise law have traditionally
followed those in social law. We have had this discussion before in
Finance Bill Committees. However, as things stand,
the definition of a category C machine in tax law can be amended only
through primary legislation in a Finance Bill. The clause therefore
amends the definition in line with social law, effective
from22 March this
year.</div>
					<a name="07051099000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">An operator of
category C gaming machines can now increase the maximum prize that
their machines offer from &#163;25 to &#163;35 without becoming
subject to a higher level of duty. This is the first opportunity that
we have had to legislate for this change, and I hope that members of
the Committee&#151;there are eight Members on each side who last year
supported the cause of an increase in stake and prize levels by backing
early-day motion 1503&#151;will be glad that their campaign and their
arguments have found favour, first with the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport and now as reflected in our taxation
change.</div>
					<a name="07051099000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also should
confirm to the Committee that the change has been widely welcomed by
the industry. The national president of the British Amusement Catering
Trade Association, the trade federation that takes an interest in
amusement machines, welcomed the Budget decision by saying
that</div>
					<a name="07051099000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it&#146;s a big
thank you to Mr. Brown...It&#146;s good
news.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to bringing tax law in line with social law, clause 9 also
amends the existing excise legislation so that in future we are not in
this position. In future, commissioners may by order increase the
maximum stakes and prizes permitted for each category of machine for
the purpose of amusement machine licence duty. The clause will prevent
tax law from getting out of step with social law, and I commend it to
the
Committee.</div>

								Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> We have received no hostile representations on
the clause, so do not intend to oppose it. I feel slightly apprehensive
because I recollect that during the proceedings on a statutory
instrument in the past year in which the Financial Secretary and I
participated&#151;unfortunately, my researchers have been unable to
locate the debate&#151;he disclosed the fact that the statutory
instrument in question had been necessary because an error had crept
into the legislation which the Government, the official Opposition, the
Liberal Democrats 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>and everyone else had entirely failed to spot. Despite that caveat, as
we have received no hostile representations on the clause, we do not
intend to oppose

							<b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): My hon. Friend
the Financial Secretary said that the stake had gone up from 30p to
50p, which is a 67 per cent. increase, and that the maximum prize had
gone up from &#163;25 to &#163;35, which is a 40 per cent.
increase. It seems that the two percentages are out of kilter, and that
there is a bonus for the gambling industry. Perhaps he could say a
little more about that and allay my fears that that is the
case.</div>

							<a name="07051099000390"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My hon. Friend may be aware that there is a system
of regular review of stakes and prizes for gaming machines. It is
conducted under the auspices of the DCMS, which has policy
responsibility for the area. A review has been conducted and completed,
and a recommendation was made to raise the stake to 50p and the prize
to &#163;35 for this category of machines, which is one of the most
popular types of machine at many
venues.</div>

						The
DCMS, in part because it was considering the implications of changes in
social regulation through the Gambling Act 2005, did not implement the
stakes and prizes review recommendations. Finally, the Minister for
Sport made the decision last autumn that, in fact, we would make that
change. That was a decision for the DCMS. It set the new prize and
stake levels. What we are doing in this tax legislation is simply
bringing the tax category and tax treatment in line with the changes
that have already been made in social regulation. I hope that that
helps the hon. Gentleman.</div>

					<a name="07051099000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should point out that we are now in the environmental section of part 1
of the Bill, which deals with charges, rates and thresholds. I am
reminded of comments that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
made in the Committee of the whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>House, where he spoke, with regard to environmental measures, about the
need for carrots and sticks to try to change behaviour. Since we are
dealing with duty rates, the clause is obviously intended to be a stick
to encourage changes in behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07051099000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we welcome the
changes outlined in the clause, which are proposed to take place in
October 2007. Those changes represent indexation, following a freeze of
these duties since 2003. What it will mean is that there will be some
movement on the take of environmental taxes as a proportion of the
total tax take. Therefore, it is an important step in the right
direction, and one that we
support.</div>
					<a name="07051099000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, what
the amendment tries to highlight is the principle that, for some
people, even if there is a very big stick they will still not have the
opportunity to change their behaviour. The amendment would add a new
subsection to clause 10, which would enable the Treasury to specify
lower rates of duty on fuel in remote rural areas. It would go on to
allow the Treasury to specify what it considers to be remote rural
areas by statutory instrument.</div>
					<a name="07051099000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment relates to a
principle that is allowed by article 19 of the EU energy products
directive, which allows member states to apply for a derogation to
reduce duty rates in specific areas. That measure was adopted in 2004
by the French Government, with the support of UK Ministers and other EU
member states in the Council of Europe; Portugal and Greece have also
adopted it. I am sure that this measure will be familiar to some
members of the Committee, because it is identical to an amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on Report for the Finance Bill last year.
It is because we have changes in fuel duty in the Bill this year that
it is even more relevant to raise the issue now.</div>
					<a name="07051099000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In future clauses, we will deal
with greater differential rates for vehicle excise duty, so it is clear
that there will be action to encourage people not to use their cars so
much. It is very important at this stage that we consider those people
in very remote rural areas&#151;I am not talking about ordinary rural
areas, but incredibly remote rural areas&#151;who are hit not by a
double whammy but a triple whammy. Very often, they have lower incomes
than people in other parts of the country. In the highlands, including
in the constituency that my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey represents, average incomes are 85 per
cent. of the national average. Across the whole of Cornwall, they are
about 20 per cent. lower.</div>
					<a name="07051099000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, in the first place,
people&#146;s incomes in remote rural areas are lower. Also, their
costs of travel are higher, because they have further to travel and
there is often no public transport at all. On top of all that, they
then face higher fuel prices. It is the duty that forms a very large
proportion of those prices. In some very, very remote rural areas, we
are talking about differentials of 10p to 20p to the litre.</div>
					<a name="07051099000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the issue that the
amendment seeks to raise in order to highlight a principle. We welcome
the action that the Government are taking, but do they recognise the
impact that it will have in very remote areas? People in such areas
have lower incomes, so their fuel costs will represent a much higher
proportion of their outgoings. The measure will not only have an impact
on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>personal finances of individuals living in those rural areas, but
undermine the economic viability of many of those rural communities,
because if people travel further away to buy petrol, thereby emitting
more carbon, they will probably consume services and buy goods in that
community as well, which will mean that their own local community,
where fuel prices are higher, is undermined more widely than simply at
the petrol pump. Goods that could be purchased in that local economic
community will instead be purchased elsewhere. It will be undermined in
that way as
well.</div>

Gauke:
						</b> I would be grateful if the hon. Lady outlined which
parts of the country she thinks would constitute remote areas. I
suggest that that might include, say, the highlands of Scotland and the
west country. What other factors do those areas have in
common?</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> Obviously, the west country is well
represented on the Liberal Democrat Benches, but I would intend the
amendment&#146;s impact to be very limited, because ultimately we
want to support the benefit that other environmental taxes would have.
I would expect only a very small number of communities or none at all
in my own constituency to be included, because I represent the most
densely populated part of Cornwall and it has relatively good transport
links. The people in my area will not have to travel as far as others,
and the differentials in petrol pump prices are not as great as
elsewhere. However, in the highlands and islands of Scotland, where
there are differentials of 20p a litre, the measure will clearly make a
significant
difference.</div>
					<a name="07051099000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that the intention is to
limit the impact of the amendment. It would target only communities and
people who have no alternative to the car and for whom, even if public
transport were available, it would be less fuel efficient, because
there would be a bus driving one person around, rather than one person
using their own
car.</div>
					<a name="07051099000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point, with
which I hope the Minister will sympathise, is that there is a need to
recognise the difficulties that very, very rural communities face, and
unfortunately there is not recognition of that fact at the moment. As I
said, the impact of the amendment is intended to be very limited.
Unfortunately, it does not matter how big the stick is, those
communities will not be able to respond. All that people in those
communities will see is fuel prices taking up a larger and larger part
of their disposable
income.</div>
					<a name="07051099000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important, if the Government are to continue with their policy&#151;I
hope that they do&#151;that the difficulties faced by those people
are recognised. There are existing forms of duty, such as fuel duty and
vehicle excise duty. The Government have said that in the long run they
would like to move to road user pricing. Again, we would support them
in that, because it would be the most efficient way of ensuring that
the people least able to change their behaviour were not penalised
unfairly, but in the meantime, if we are continuing with changes to
fuel duty and vehicle excise duty, I make a plea to the Minister
that&#151;</div>

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The hon. Lady has just
suggested a move towards road user pricing&#151;something that her

I say that on the basis that I have moved similar amendments in the
past, but at least there was previously the advantage of a VAT offset,
so that we could fund such a measure. However, she has said that she
intends the impact of the amendment to be very limited. She began by
talking about rural and remote. She went on to talk about very, very
remote and she ended up talking about very, very rural. The problem may
lie in the definition, which I am sure other hon. Members will come to
and which we have debated in the past. Can she give us a clear
definition as to the number of people, percentage of population and
percentage of land mass that she expects to be
covered?</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The key point is that the amendment would
enable the Treasury to make that judgment. Indicators are available,
but unfortunately they are not consistently available across the whole
of the United Kingdom. I do not know why it would be impossible for the
Treasury to compile that
information.</div>
					<a name="07051099000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know
the practical difficulties of rolling out road user charging and that
there has to be a long-term policy. We also understand that it cannot
be implemented overnight and that is why there are changes to the
system in the Bill. We cannot introduce road user charging at this
point. On that basis, I do not think there is any inconsistency in
saying that it will ultimately prove more efficient, but we must deal
with the here and
now.</div>

							<a name="07051099000396"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> In responding to the useful intervention of the
hon. Member for Dundee, East, the hon. Lady has illustrated the
difficulty of her proposal. There is much sympathy for assisting those
in rural areas with the added costs of their daily lives, but her
inability to define the area that she describes as remote is palpable.
If there are certain geographic areas that benefit from a reduced rate
of duty because they are remote, there is a strong possibility that
those who live in adjacent areas will merely drive the extra miles to
get to the petrol stations offering petrol or other fuels at a
cheaper price and drive back again. Therefore, they will
contribute to excessive emissions because such journeys would be
completely unnecessary were it not for price
differentiation.</div>

at the moment, we are talking about price differentials of 10p to 20p.
We are not necessarily saying that fuel prices at the pumps should be
dramatically cheaper in those remote areas. We are saying that they
should at least be comparable and that there should not be a
significant difference. On that basis, such a system would not alter
behaviour.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> May I just conclude my remarks? The final
point that I wish to reiterate is that there is a precedent for this
concept across the European Union. The derogation is up and running and
has been used in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>France, Greece and Portugal. It is not a new or impractical concept that
the Treasury must try to get its head around. The key point, for which
I hope there will be sympathy in the Committee, is that fuel costs are
presently a significant problem for people in very remote areas. If the
Government feel that the amendment is not a suitable way to address
that problem, I would feel reassured if, at the very least, there was
some understanding from the Treasury of the difficulties posed and the
affordability problems for people who live in remote
areas.</div>

							<a name="07051099000400"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> It is &#147;Groundhog Day&#148; for those
members of the Committee who were present at last year&#146;s
proceedings. I wish to inform the Financial Secretary that my
researchers have found a copy of last year&#146;s debate in
<i class="I">Hansard,</i> to which I will refer in a moment. I shall say on what
points I agree with the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and then
what we disagree about somewhat&#151;in fact, quite a bit. As she
reminded the Committee, and this point is perfectly valid, people in
remote rural areas often do not have access to public transport in the
same way as people in less remote areas&#151; I am not sure if that
should be remote rural, rural remote or remote remote. In addition,
their circumstances often do not make cycling or even walking
practical.</div>
					<a name="07051099000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2003
national travel survey for England showed that, of half the residents
in rural settlements, less than 3,000 live within a 30-minute walk of a
bus stop. According to the expenditure and food survey for 2002-03,
households in such areas spend &#163;70.60 a week on transport,
compared with households in urban areas, which spend &#163;45.50 a
week on transport. There is less congestion in such areas, which can
lead to some counter-intuitive results. Obviously, a bus in a remote
area will be less environmentally friendly than a car if the bus has
only a few people in it. The hon. Lady is right to say that people in
such areas often need cars more than people in urban settings. Some of
those points were made by us, by the Liberals at some length and by
others during last year&#146;s equivalent debate. In some respects,
the amendment resembles the package that the Liberals tabled and that
we debated during the Committee of the whole House on last
year&#146;s Finance [No. 2] Bill and on Report. The amendment that
they tabled on Report was almost identical to this one: indeed, I
cannot see any difference. They also tabled an amendment to raise band
G VED rates in general, while reducing all bands for what were then
old cars and all bands except band G for what were then new
cars.</div>

					<a name="07051099000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other hon.
Members and I were mildly critical of the Liberal Democrat amendments,
because we were not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>convinced&#151;it says here&#151;that a single convincing definition
of the areas had been offered. Neither am I convinced that we have had
one today. In last year&#146;s debate, the hon. Member for Dundee,
East, who specialises in this sort of observation, pointed out that one
of the definitions would cover 98 per cent. of Scotland&#146;s land
mass. In addition, we were not convinced that cars would not be
registered in one area and used in another, or that we had a single
reliable estimate of the cost to public funds. In summary, we were not
convinced that the House should rush either to cut VED
or&#151;&#151;turning to the amendment, which is the same as last
year&#146;s&#151;&#151;that a case had been made for the need to
put such a power on the statute book before we had a full assessment of
the need for it and of the likely financial
consequences.</div>

							<a name="07051099000403"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> The amendment does not seek to define remote
areas, so it is difficult to say that we are not providing a consistent
definition. It is meant as an enabling amendment that would allow
problems to be recognised and then brought back to the House so that we
could determine whether the Treasury&#146;s proposals are fair and
whether they address what I hope thehon. Gentleman accepts is
a real problem in many communities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000404"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> I accept that it is a real problem, but I do not
think that it is particularly enlightening to have no definition this
year, whereas there were rather a lot of definitions last year. That
does not take us forward. The enabling provision is premature, and I
shall explain why in a moment. Whatever view one took of last
year&#146;s proceedings, it is significant that the Liberals&#146;
amendments that called for a cut in band G rates in some areas were not
resubmitted to the Committee of the whole House. Perhaps the Liberals
were persuaded of the difficulties that we argued were inherent in
those amendments, because they have not retabled them.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am happy to let the hon. Lady
intervene.</div>

the hon. Lady has not explained why her party did not retable the VED
amendments in the Committee of the whole House, despite arguing that
they were so very important or why it has not retabled them
now.</div>
					<a name="07051099000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the
hon. Lady that we need a more detailed Treasury view on all this. Last
year, the Liberals correctly pointed out that France has a derogation
from the energy products directive that allows it to charge the
equivalent of lower fuel duties in remote rural areas, as do Greece and
Portugal. However, they did not point out what the Financial Secretary
told us: that France was proposing a real increase in other, presumably
urban, areas to offset the decrease in remote areas. Neither has the
hon. Lady mentioned that today. The amendment would prepare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>the ground for a fuel duty decrease in some areas without preparing the
ground for an increase in other areas. I am not sure what revenue loss
that would entail; perhaps the hon. Lady can tell us. I am not
convinced that charging different fuel duty rates in different areas is
practicable, and I shall ask my hon. Friends not to support the
amendment if the hon. Lady insists on pressing it to a vote.</div>
					<a name="07051099000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the hon. Lady wants
to put the power on the statute book and then, presumably, to obtain
from the Treasury a full assessment of its practicality. That is
putting the cart before the horse. Surely, it is much more practical to
obtain the assessment of the power that the proposal would introduce,
including an assessment of any consequent fuel duty rise in urban
areas, and then to consider whether it is practicable to put something
on the statute book. With the greatest respect, the Liberal Democrats
have got it the wrong way round.</div>
					<a name="07051099000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial Secretary said

I am sure that he will be able to report from France this year. Should
the Treasury not now make, and in due course publish, an assessment of
what is happening in France, rather than replying briefly to the
debate? It should publish assessments of what is done there and in
Greece and Portugal in relation to fuel duty, and see whether that has
any applicability to the UK. Then we will be able to judge whether the
amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne will
have any merit in the medium or long term.</div>

								Rob
Marris:
						</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Wycombe, with his usual eloquence. He has clearly done the homework and
research that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne has not. The
chances of the amendment&#146;s being agreed today are getting pretty
remote, if not very remote. It is a typical Liberal Democrat amendment:
unfocused, uncosted and contradictory. Apart from that, it might be all
right. It is unfocused, because we have no definition of remote areas.
Partly because of that, and because I did not hear the hon. Lady
indicate otherwise, it is uncosted, although that is nothing new for
the Liberal Democrats. It is contradictory partly for the reasons that
the hon. Member for Wycombe pointed out.</div>
					<a name="07051099000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">A central plank of the Liberal
Democrats&#146; tax policy is, as I understand it, to increase green
taxes. So what have we here? An amendment that would, on the face of
it, result in a cut in green taxes. One can talk about vehicle excise
duty in lots of terms apart from its being a green tax, but the
amendment mentions lower rates of duty. That implies a differential.
There are two ways of having a differential&#151;one can lower it for
remote areas, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>whatever they might be, or raise it for non-remote areas. Raising it for
non-remote areas does nothing for people in remote areas. It might make
them relatively better off, but it does not do anything for them.
Conversely, lowering the rate for remote areas would go against what
the Liberal Democrats have spent the past year telling us that they
are&#151;although I do not think that they are&#151;which is the
party of green taxes. I urge my hon. Friends to vote against this
typical Liberal Democrat amendment, which is unfocused, uncosted and
contradictory.</div>

							<a name="07051099000410"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I have to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I
usually agree with him, because he makes intelligent contributions, but
when he decides to move away from those, he falls foul of his own
rhetoric.</div>
					<a name="07051099000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
appear to have agreement on the principle that those who live in
certain parts of the country might suffer significantly more than
others because of the general wish to increase fuel duty in the
important cause of the environment. To an extent, we are asking for
some discrimination, which is a good thing in framing many types of
legislation. Although we want to try to drive it out everywhere, there
are always small casesin particular parts of society that are
badly done by in trying to get the benefits that we want for the whole,
in terms of social and fiscal policies. If we accept that people are
being discriminated against because they have no possibility of
accessing public transport, and it would anyway be inappropriate to
provide it, then, for fairness and justice, we ought to try to find
ways in which we might be able to address that.</div>
					<a name="07051099000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I think that we are
talking about a very small number, which, to a certain extent, becomes
rather self-defined. Most hon. Members will have seen in their
constituencies a significant reduction in the number of filling
stations, both in and out of towns. In remote rural areas, those that
have survived are normally those that are charging 10p, 15p or even
higher more per litre. They are being charged more for the fuel because
it has to get there; they do not sell enough to sustain their overall
costs. They have kept going because people have gone to them; they
patronise them, not because they want to pay 10p, 15p or 20p more per
litre than people who live closer to supermarkets and towns, but
because it would be inappropriate for them to drive the distance purely
to save the money on fuel. They tend to go to that reasonably local
filling station, and that is why those stations have continued in
business much of the time. If they were any closer to supermarkets or
small towns, where fuel costs are significantly lower, selling petrol
would become almost impossible. They would have to put their prices up
to astronomic levels because they would sell so little fuel.</div>
					<a name="07051099000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To a certain
extent, the matter becomes self-defining. It is probably a distance
around certain remote rural filling stations. I do not know what that
would be; perhaps some people might be prepared to drive 10
miles, others a little more. However, essentially, it concerns those
areas that surround those filling stations that charge the levels that
we have been talking about.</div>
					<a name="07051099000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, there is the concept
of main residence, and what qualifies where people live. Our part of
the world has quite a few people who have second homes in remote rural
areas. Whether they would qualify as their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>principal residences is another matter&#151;&#151;probably not, so
it would be much beyond their residential qualification.</div>
					<a name="07051099000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, harking back to the
original point, there would perhaps be designated suppliers. It would
not be applicable to every person but available only to certain
designated purveyors of fuel. To designate filling stations in that way
might be very helpful, because it might underpin some of their
business. If they could sell fuel at the price that everyone else was
selling at, they might be able to keep going longer. There are often
places that sell food and provide other services. In considering
underpinning the rural economy, it is an important factor that, if
stations can provide fuel at a lower cost, it will stop people driving
even five or 10 to get their weekly shop at the local supermarket and
fill up at the same time. There is a plus point in looking at the fact
that some remote rural filling stations might be able to hang on a
little longer, and continue to provide a service for their surrounding
area for longer than they may at present.</div>

								Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is starting to cast a little
light through the fog of the Liberal Democrat proposals. If I
understand him correctly, he is proposing, first, that individual
retailers should be designated as eligible for the lower rate of duty;
secondly, that individual suppliers should be designated as appropriate
to supply those retail outlets; and thirdly, and most importantly, that
individual householders or motorists should be designated as suitable
parties to purchase their fuel from those designated garages.</div>
					<a name="07051099000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely, that would mean that a
garage, even if it was in a remote area, would be able to supply the
same fuel at two different rates to separate categories of driver. How
does the hon. Gentleman envisage that the cost of the proposals would
impact on the retailers who would supply these services? The
bureaucratic nightmare that he conjures up is beyond
belief.</div>

								Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I hope that that is not the case. I do not know
whether the hon. Gentleman, like me, was driving around as a designated
user of petrol in 1972, when because of potential petrol rationing I
was&#151;for some unknown reason as an assistant bank
manager&#151;a preferential user. Should rationing have come in, I
would have been able to purchase fuel at any petrol station because I
had a particular requirement to do so. It was presumably felt that it
would undermine the whole UK economy if one C. Breed could not drive
around the countryside seeing his customers.</div>
					<a name="07051099000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not alone in getting that
designation, as my bank made an application for certain individuals to
have the necessary access, which was quite easy to do. It was a
relatively simple Government scheme, which did not require huge
bureaucracy, but I can imagine the sort of bureaucratic nightmares that
there might be today.</div>
					<a name="07051099000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fortunately, the scheme was
never pursued, but it provided the opportunity for individuals not only
to access fuel, but to access it at a certain price. There are clear
examples of a similar situation in which differentials can apply. They
have been introduced in other European countries and it cannot be
beyond the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>wit of the Treasury team and the massive numbers of civil servants in
that Department to bend their minds around something involving a
relatively small number of
people.</div>
					<a name="07051099000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me
to the losses. I understand that last year my hon. Friend the Member
for, I think, Caithness&#151;some unearthly, lengthy place somewhere
in Scotland, the other end of the nation; it is a long way from the
nation of Cornwall to the nation of Scotland&#151;said that on very
rough calculations, the losses in Scotland were of the order of
&#163;3 million to &#163;5 million. I do not suggest that
that is an entirely accurate estimate, but in terms of the total amount
of duty that would be foregone&#151;I will give way as my hon. Friend
is coming to my
rescue.</div>

equalise it. Equalisation is not a problem; the amount of money that
will be foregone will be tiny in terms of the total cost of fuel
duties. The definitions of remoteness and so on can be addressed and if
we agree the principle it should not be beyond the wit of the Treasury
and the Government to find a way to tackle a small, but nevertheless
significant, injustice to a number of people. It is likely to persist
for ever, because I do not think anything will be

is so minimal as to be of little interest to everyone else. It is a
very tiny amount. The remoteness is not likely to change very much. We
have probably got it down to an irreducible minimum of filling stations
that are serving certain remote areas. If petrol prices continue to
rise, the motivation to go longer and to drive further to the

that.</div>

we have heard, his party is committed to raising more revenue from
green taxes. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>The Institute for Fiscal Studies stated that the overwhelming majority
of green taxes, as it would define them, in this country are fuel
duties. The figure is something like 80 per cent. If he does not want
to increase fuel duties, how does the Liberal Democrat policy hold
together?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000422"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> We do want to increase such duties, but we have to
recognise that very tiny minorities are sometimes unfairly dealt with
by various aspects of policy. Liberal Democrats argue that there is a
tiny minority who will never get a bus service and public transport. If
we push on with more and more increases for good environmental reasons,
those in that minority will become even more disadvantaged. Even the
small petrol filling stations that they have are likely to disappear.
People will have to travel further and further to get any fuel. We want
to arrest that decline and recognise that this is a tiny amount. The
amount of money that will have to be forgone is very small. In order to
gain our environmental credentials and to satisfy the environmental
agenda, we need to increase these duties. However, we also need to
address the issue of the tiny number of people who will be severely
disadvantaged on a continuing basis. I do not believe that it is
impossible to find a way to do so.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000423"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The debate has powerful echoes of our debates in
Committee on the Finance Bill last year. My arguments remain the same.
I want to be clear about what this proposal would and would not do.
First, it would break a long-standing principle of uniform tax rates in
the United Kingdom. The proposal here is to reduce fuel duties in
certain parts of the UK and not in others. It would also, as Members
have pointed out, conflict with environmental objectives and create the
potential for
fraud.</div>
					<a name="07051099000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the
proposal would not do is also important. It follows directly from the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s observations that there is generally less
competition and therefore higher prices in pumps and filling stations
in many remote rural areas. A duty cut for the provision of fuel in
these areas would not guarantee any reduction at the pumps for the
motorists and the residents whom the Liberal Democrats are concerned
about. It would be impossible to guarantee that a fuel supplier who
might benefit from a reduced rate of duty would pass such a reduction
on at all, or in full, to its customers. That is especially the case in
areas where there is little competition between suppliers because there
are fewer of them: precisely those rural or remote areas that hon.
Members are concerned about.</div>
					<a name="07051099000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, we must be clear
that the duty system in the UK does not make any allowances for where
oil is used. The duty becomes payable at the point at which oil leaves
the refinery, regardless of where in the United Kingdom it will be
used. The amendment would require a new system for petrol suppliers and
diesel suppliers to account for and then reclaim the tax that they
paid. I suspect that that would unpopular with many in the sector,
because they would be required to deal with a complex system and a
relatively high administrative burden.</div>

					<a name="07051099000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for Dundee, East also pointed out that definitions are
difficult. How do we define &#147;rural&#148;, &#147;very
rural&#148;, &#147;remote&#148;, &#147;very remote&#148; or
&#147;Liberal&#148;&#151;there are probably no very Liberal areas
in the country these days? With respect to the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne, she is ducking a central issue by simply saying that the
definition would be for the Treasury to determine by order. Unless the
proposal can be defined in a consistent way on a principled and
rational basis, it will not have much
merit.</div>

							<a name="07051099000424"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I recognise the significant problem in making
reductions. On the point about locality, I do not think that rural
suppliers make an exorbitant profit on their petrol; in fact, they have
to buy fuel at a significantly more cost than those who provide it for
towns. I do not think that they are making significantly greater profit
from their margin than others.</div>
					<a name="07051099000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the definition of
&#147;remote areas&#148;, not so very long ago we had to address
the problem of foot and mouth and we had to define areas that would be
available for special treatment because of their rural nature. We
managed relatively easily, over a much larger area, to give such
reasonable definitions so as to provide for certain areas that were
going to get special treatment following foot and mouth. I do not take
the Financial Secretary&#146;s view that it is impossible to provide
a
definition.</div>

France.</div>
					<a name="07051099000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the heart
of the French scheme is a proposal not to reduce tax but to aim to
raise additional revenue in certain areas&#151;there is the
flexibility to do that&#151;in order to pay for functions that have
been delegated from the centre to those regions. Hon. Members were
right to press the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne and for
South-East Cornwall about the intention behind their proposal. They may
wish to use the model of the French scheme, but that is its aim and
that is how it would work.</div>
					<a name="07051099000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of assessing the
French scheme, it has taken advantage of the derogation, but the system
came into effect only on 1 January, thus it is too early to tell with
any clarity or certainty how it is working. I do not believe that the
French model and the French use of the derogation, for the purposes
that the hon. Lady proposed, have much merit. Such an approach would be

in the past two years, it was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>with urgency because petrol prices were high and the rises were sudden?
That is perhaps less of an issue this year. Will he indicate that he
will consider the matter in the longer term, calmly and outside the
debate, to work out how we can protect remote, rural areas, whose
inhabitants pay much higher prices? We must particularly recognise the
possibility of similar episodes in the future, when the price may once
again rise to a disproportionately high

school in rural north Yorkshire, so I am concerned about that issue.
The Government remain of the fairly fixed view that such a solution is
not the best way to deal with those problems. If the hon. Gentleman
considers the situation in his own country, Scotland, he will recognise
that the rural transport fund there has supported more than 150 rural
transport projects since 1998. It is through that approach that we can

Goldsworthy:
						</b> I shall not press the amendment. I am
disappointed, however, because I introduced the amendments in a
constructive tone, to highlight what is a serious issue for a small
number of people. I should like to draw to the attention of the
Committee a report that was commissioned by The Highland council to
illustrate the scale of the problem. It was produced in 2000, but the
principle was the same. It found that &#163;88 million was
spent on fuel in that remote, rural area, which represented 3 per cent.
of its GDP. We are talking about a significant amount of money,
&#163;3 million of which was VAT windfall, so there was a roll-over
effect. It is a significant problem for a small number of people who
should not be overlooked.</div>
					<a name="07051099000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am
frustrated because we have not heard anything new from either the
Government or the Conservatives about what can be done to address the
problem. I am partially reassured by some of the Financial
Secretary&#146;s comments, but I am disappointed because I feel that
perhaps people were not paying attention. The amendment is clear: it is
to allow for a reduction in fuel duty without any accompanying
increases to compensate for that. That is not the same as saying that
we would not support increases in fuel duty in line with inflation,
such as those that will be introduced by the
Bill.</div>

understanding is that the Treasury may specify lower rates of duty for
remote rural areas; it does not say that it may increase them for all
areas that do not fall into that
category.</div>
					<a name="07051099000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn
now to another point. The green tax switch, about which my hon. Friend
the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) has spoken, is designed to
encourage changes in behaviour. The point that we have been trying to
make is that, in such circumstances, it would not encourage changes in
behaviour. Our position is therefore not at all inconsistent. My hon.
Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall clearly showed how limited
the measure would be in terms of the number of petrol stations that it
would affect.</div>
					<a name="07051099000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment does not say that we should adopt wholesale the scheme as it
exists in France; it says that there is clearly a problem for a limited
number of people. If the Government pursue their current policy, that
will make the problem increasingly difficult for those groups of
people. It also says that there is a precedent, a derogation, that the
Government have supported other countries in adopting, but the Govt
have so far chosen not to adopt that derogation themselves. That
derogation may provide a way to alleviate the difficulty that these
people face.</div>
					<a name="07051099000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government felt that the amendment is not an ideal solution, I had
hoped that they would put forward a better alternative. Unfortunately,
we have not heard such an alternative. Therefore, what most disappoints
me is the fact that the principle that the amendment tries to put
forward has been ignored. Until this issue is resolved, it will keep
returning.</div>
					<a name="07051099000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary made some valid points about the difficulties of
ensuring that that differential in duty ended up being passed on to the
customer in terms of price; those are valid issues to raise. However,
the concern is that this problem will not be addressed. A limited
number of people face this problem, but to them it is a significant
one, because a differential of 20p a litre will mean several
more pounds for every tank of petrol. If people are travelling longer
distances, that extra cost will be a significant proportion of their
income. So this is an important problem that has not yet been
addressed, and I am afraid that it may be &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;
again next year, if there is not even an indication from the Financial
Secretary that these issues will be examined. I beg to ask leave to

point.</div>
					<a name="07051099000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides for an increase in the main road fuel duty rate of 2p a litre,
and an increase in the duty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>on the rebated oils of 2p a litre to maintain cash differential with the
main road fuels rate in support of the oil fuel strategy. It also
provides for consequential increases in duty rates for biofuels and
road fuel gases, in order to maintain the differentials with the main
road fuel duty, differentials that, of course, are guaranteed under the
alternative fuels framework.</div>
					<a name="07051099000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the Government&#146;s
policy that, in general, fuel duty rates should rise each year at least
in line with inflation, and Budget 2007 set out fuel duty rates for the
next three years, first for environmental reasons; secondly, to ensure
funding for public services; and thirdly to provide greater certainty,
alongside other tax reforms that were in the Budget. Increases in 2008
and 2009 will be provided for in subsequent Finance
Bills.</div>
					<a name="07051099000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recognition
of the impact on specific sectors, the duty rates for rebated oils will
increase in future years by the same percentage as the main rates. That
represents, therefore, a much lesser increase than has previously
occurred; it also reflects the detailed discussions and analysis that
we have conducted with heavy users of rebated oils, such as open-cast
coal mining and rail companies. On that basis, I commend the clause to
the
Committee.</div>

Government have, in general, a policy of raising these duties in line

possibly the best assessment of the changes that he has just proposed

had</div>

would call &#147;complex interactions&#148;&#151;the phrase he
used about tobacco duties in relation to fuel duties. They have a
target of ensuring that 5 per cent. of all transport fuels should be
renewable by 2010-11. They have to take into consideration not only the
requirement to hit that target, but the competitive position of
industry, the effect on agriculture and farming, the consequences for
consumers and the effect on the balance between public and private
transport. All the while, I am sure there is in the Financial
Secretary&#146;s mind the memory of the events of 2000.</div>
					<a name="07051099000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are not very easy
pressures to reconcile and we shall not oppose the changes, but I
should like to ask the Financial Secretary a few questions that arise
from the generally favourable comments on the rises issued by green
organisations and the generally more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>unfavourable comments issued by those who have a direct users&#146;
concern with transport. Has he ruled out a return to the Environmental
Audit Committee&#146;s preferred solution, namely real-terms rises in
fuel duty? Secondly, as the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget
report last year that revenues from any real-terms increases in duties
would go straight into a ring-fenced fund for improving public
transport and modernising the road network, can the Financial Secretary
confirm that announcements to this effect will be contained in the
comprehensive spending review later this year?</div>
					<a name="07051099000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, what analysis has the
Treasury made of the effect of these rises on inflation, industry in
general and the road haulage sector in particular? Finally, is there
not an increasingly strong case for an increased duty differential for
high blend biofuels in order to make them cost competitive as the
Environmental Audit Committee has urged? That committee said that it
recognised</div>
					<a name="07051099000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
environmental benefits of a properly sustainable and well-regulated
expansion in the use of high-blend biofuels such as E85. Under the
current fiscal regime, however, it is unlikely that the market for
highblend biofuels will take off, due to its increased
costs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting, though, that it raised the same concerns about biofuel sourcing
as Friends of the Earth raised about sustainability criteria. I look
forward to the Financial Secretary&#146;s response to these
points.</div>

Afriyie:
						</b> I have just a few observations. The Financial
Secretary said that the objectives of these duties are for
environmental reasons, to raise revenue for public services and to
create certainty by laying out the future progression of these duties.
They are all fairly admirable goals and I have no complaint with them.
There is a danger that the green taxes are an excuse for revenue
raising or that they obfuscate the drive to raise revenues by hiding it
behind environmental issues. It strikes me that when we come to
vehicles and the duties on vehicles, consumers quite possibly already
pay many times more than it costs to tidy up the carbon they may be
emitting from their exhaust pipes.</div>
					<a name="07051099000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are coming on now to vehicle
excise duty with many different gradings. That is arguably a green tax.
We have these fuel duties now escalating with the various
differentials. Residents parking permits in some areas will be cost
more for gas-guzzling or large vehicles, the cost of parking at railway
stations is always increasing and then there is congestion charge in
central London which is arguably an environmental or a green tax to a
certain degree. Now we have talk of road
pricing.</div>

					<a name="07051099000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It strikes me
that at approximately &#163;30 per tonne to clear up CO<span class="Sub">2</span>,
there is no doubt that, if we are considering this as a green issue,
the motorist is already well over-taxed in that area. That is why, to
an extent, I am pleased with the Conservative party&#146;s position,
which is that if we raise green taxes, we will offset them against
taxes in other areas of the economy. Can the Financial Secretary
confirm&#151;or advise otherwise&#151;that there is an intention in
here somewhere to offset the increases in what are called &#147;green
taxes&#148; against 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>those in other areas? To echo my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front
Bench, how much of the additional money raised from these duties will
go directly to road improvements and carbon removal? The technologies
are available, so is anything ring-fenced to be passed, for example,
directly to carbon sequestration or other means of removing carbon from
the atmosphere? It is not that I would argue for any form of
hypothecation; I should just like to give the Financial Secretary a
platform from which to tell us what measures are being undertaken and
how much they have been increased, given that there is increased
revenue from fuel
duty.</div>
					<a name="07051099000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on a
point that applies to most broadly based taxes, does the Financial
Secretary recognise that the increases in these duties will, by virtue
of the kind of tax that they are, disproportionately affect the least
well off?</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> I do not intend to add further to the
comments that I made when introducing my amendment about our support
for the re-indexation of fuel duty to inflation, but I have a very
brief question. There is a differential in duty that is designed to
encourage greater take-up of biofuels, but different biofuels come from
more or less sustainable sources. That is a cause of great concern to
many people. Is it possible to differentiate through the fuel duty
mechanisms between biofuels from more and less sustainable
sources?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000439"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> First, there has been reference in passing to the
road fuel transport obligation that we propose to bring in from 2008.
That will require an increasing percentage of all fuel suppliers to
supply biofuels as a part of their product. It will be introduced in
2008 and by 2010-11 it will affect 75 per cent. of them. It is designed
to give a big boost to the biofuels market, with the environmental
gains that can flow from it in the UK. A central feature of the
introduction of and preparation for the obligation is an assurance
scheme, which the Department for Transport is discussing with those who
are interested, and on which it is leading the design work. The purpose
of the obligation is to secure the environmental contribution to
dealing with climate change. The quality and climate change impact of
biofuels that will be encouraged by that means will be important to us
as we introduce and develop the obligation scheme. I hope that that
gives a degree of reassurance to the Committee and others, particularly
to the green groups that have made that point and have helped us in the
work.</div>
					<a name="07051099000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Windsor for his offer to give me a platform, and
for the fact that he regards the rationale for the proposals in this
clause to be fairly admirable goals. I shall come back to his question
about offsetting green taxes, because that links to a point made by his
hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, who asked two or three questions.
The first was, &#147;Are the Government considering any real-terms
increases in fuel duty?&#148; We discussed this morning the basis of
the Government&#146;s forecasting in tax terms, and that element of
the Red Book is the quarter three RPI figure for this year, which is
3.38 per cent. So the rises of 2p per litre this year, 2p per litre
next year and 1.84p per litre the year after represent respective
increases of just over 4 per cent., just under
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>4 per cent., and about 3.5 per cent. In answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, we are already looking at three years of
fuel duty rises that have a real rise element to them. We have been
clear from the start that the resources that these will help to raise
will help contribute to the Government&#146;s spending on our
priority areas, such as transport and environmental protection. Our
decisions on that will be taken in the context of the comprehensive
spending review.</div>
					<a name="07051099000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want to pre-empt the discussion that we may have on a subsequent
clause, but would say that we have been clear about offsetting in
relation to the proposed landfill tax rises. The rise in the landfill
tax take from business will contribute to what we also announced in the
Budget as offsetting significant cuts in the main rate of corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="07051099000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on the
question of biofuels, which was raised by the hon. Members for Wycombe
and for Falmouth and Camborne, we are examining the place that they
will have in the obligation framework. We are looking at ways to ensure
that the framework can incentivise those. Hon. Members will be aware
that we have given special support through the company car tax and
vehicle excise duty systems to try to encourage high-blend biofuels. I
remain unconvinced that a duty rate differential is the best way to
encourage them, but they clearly have a potential to offer us a greater
gain in our efforts to tackle climate change, and in particular, to
offset what is at the moment, still an escalating path for the
emissions that we anticipate from road transport. It is an area of
policy that we are actively examining. I hope, on that basis, that the
Committee will allow clause 10 to stand part of the Bill.</div>

clause 11, page 8, line 12, at
end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(11) This section
shall come into force on a day which the Treasury may by Order
appoint.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(12) No order shall be
made under subsection (11) unless the Treasury has compiled and laid
before the House of Commons a report containing an assessment of the
impact of vehicle excise duty on farming, agriculture and on rural
areas.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07051099000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to make it clear at the start that this is a probing
amendment. I have absolutely no intention of putting it to the vote. We
have no wish to deprive the Treasury of the &#163;625 million that
this increase will raise over three years, and we could have raised the
concerns that we are about to air in the clause stand part debate. I am
also mindful that we will return to some of the concerns when we
consider clause 105.</div>
					<a name="07051099000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, tabling and speaking
to this amendment send a signal&#151;which we believe is important,
as I indicated in the last debate on amendment No. 1 on fuel
duties&#151;that we are concerned about some of the long and
medium-term effects of the Government&#146;s strategy on VED on
farming and agriculture more widely, and on people living in rural
areas. I want to explore some of those concerns in this debate. To do
so, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>it is necessary for me to describe what appears to bethe
Government&#146;s strategy in relation to important elements of
VED.</div>
					<a name="07051099000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						This
year&#146;s changes represent a cautious widening of the differences
between the top and bottom bands in order to widen the differential
between the most and least polluting vehicles. I note in passing that,
as so often in this Budget, the Chancellor has tied the hands of his
successor, as appeared to be the case with the last clause, and has
spelled out three years of changes. Widening the differential between
the most and least polluting vehicles is clearly sensible, and we will
not oppose the clause in the stand part debate. We want emission levels
from new cars in the UK to fall from around 170 g per kilometre to 100
g per kilometre by 2020, and by 2030 we want that figure to be an
average for all cars on Britain&#146;s roads. Our quality of life
policy group, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk,
Coastal (Mr. Gummer), is examining the means of achieving
that aim, including VED, of
course.</div>
					<a name="07051099000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend is also examining the effect of vehicle taxation on farming,
agriculture and rural areas. A written answer from the Financial
Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire
(Mr. Paice), the shadow Minister for Agriculture, points
towards some of the effects. My hon. Friend asked what estimate the
Treasury had made of how many band G vehicles, which are the most
polluting, are expected to be affected by VED up to the year 2011. The
Financial Secretary replied&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that
approximately 227,000 vehicles are currently affected, representing the
current stock in band G. Over the whole of 2007-08 that figure will
rise to 310,000. In 2008-09 it will rise to 416,000, in 2009-10 to
605,000 and the following year to 740,000.</div>
					<a name="07051099000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Financial Secretary
give us the figures for band A cars, so that we can see how successful
that band is becoming? Perhaps that information can be passed to him.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham says that
it is a very important consideration, so his answer will be very
important.</div>
					<a name="07051099000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
band G vehicles will be Land Rover Discoveries and Toyota Land Cruisers
that are registered and driven in urban areas and we are not&#151;I
repeat, not&#151;making representations on their behalf. As time goes
by, others will be sold on to farmers and agricultural workers and
others who live in rural areas who consequently find themselves paying
band G rates of VED. Some pick-ups used by farmers are also categorised
as band G vehicles, although others are classified as light goods
vehicles and thus qualify for lower VED.</div>
					<a name="07051099000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">When he replies to the debate,
perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us if he has an estimate of
the proportion of those band G vehicles that will be used by farmers
and agricultural workers in each year up to 2010-11, as the number is
growing every
year.</div>

							<a name="07051099000441"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I see the direction the hon. Gentleman is going
in, but, of the two sorts of vehicles that he referred to, are not
those that are being used on farms getting red diesel, which is taxed
at a much lower rate anyway? Will not the Toyota Land Cruisers, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>example, be sold on by the Chelsea-tractor driver in the middle of
Cambridge at a lower rate to the farmer precisely because it carries a
higher vehicle excise duty? In that sense, the purchaser will not lose
out.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000442"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> Yes, I acknowledge what the hon. Gentleman said,
but it is important to consider the combined effect.</div>
					<a name="07051099000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The work and
non-work problems are obvious. Farmers living in the countryside who
need band G vehicles for work&#151;for cattle trailers, for
example&#151;are not people living in urban areas who do not need
band G vehicles for whatever work they do. The National Farmers Union
claims that British agriculture and horticulture underpin &#163;90
billion of our economy, help to provide 5 million jobs and involve
approximately &#163;400 million of unpaid conservation work. I will
not list in detail the contribution that both make to the small
business sector, to animal welfare standards and to reducing carbon
emission by providing local food. Those working needs are clearly
serious.</div>
					<a name="07051099000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting&#151;inevitably we have received representations to this
effect, as the Financial Secretary will also have done&#151;that an
off-road band G vehicle used infrequently for work purposes will
produce fewer emissions than an on-road band C vehicle used frequently
for work purposes. As for non-work purposes, such as leisure and caring
responsibilities, the considerations that have already been discussed
in relation to remote areas apply, to some degree, so I will not go
over all of those again.</div>
					<a name="07051099000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to anticipate the
debate on clause 105, but I want to ask the Financial Secretary one
question: will he investigate, or is he already investigating, the
practicality of allowing an exemption for one band G vehicle? Since all
farm holdings must be registered, the argument is that such a system
would be relatively straightforward to administer and it would tend to
favour smaller holdings, because on the whole they have fewer vehicles.
Also, does the Treasury plan to produce, in relation to this
year&#146;s rise, any estimate of how many farmers will switch from
band G vehicles to light goods vehicles that are more lightly taxed
even though they may be more polluting? I look forward to hearing the
Financial Secretary&#146;s
reply.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The amendment has many echoes of the
principle that was referred to in our debate on an earlier clause and
amendment. Again, there is a concern about the differential impact that
these kinds of measures will have in rural areas where it is more
difficult for people to change behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07051099000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I listened very

					<a name="07051099000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might not
have been listening carefully enough, but I do not think that I heard
any definition of what the hon. Gentleman might consider to be a rural
area. Equally, I am not quite sure why other rural industries, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>for example horticulture, were not included in the report that the
Treasury would have to make.</div>
					<a name="07051099000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I take on
board the comments by the hon. Member for Wycombe that he has no
intention whatsoever of pressing this matter to a vote, but there is
another inconsistency that I do not understand. I noted that the hon.

as these changes ramp up&#151;as they should be ramped
up&#151;there will be some rural areas that will be particularly
disadvantaged.</div>
					<a name="07051099000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I would like to put on
record the fact that a large part of the demand for new 4x4s&#151;I
think that the figure is about a third of new 4x4s&#151;is located in
a handful of London boroughs. Therefore, not all the most polluting
vehicles are 4x4s; not all 4x4s are agricultural vehicles, and it is
possible to purchasenew working vehicles that would do the job
perfectly well and also fall into the lower bands. If the
impactof the changes that the Government have
proposedin clause 11 encourages the industry to
producemore fuel-efficient vehicles, of course that must be
welcomed.</div>
					<a name="07051099000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

						</b> I rise to support the amendment and also to remind
the Committee&#151;I think for the first time&#151;of my entry in
the Register of Members&#146; Interests in connection with my
partnership in a farming business. I do so first because farming is
referred to in the amendment, but also because I am a proud owner of a
4x4 vehicle, which I require to visit the parts of my farm that I could
not visit either in ordinary vehicles or on foot. It is an upland area
with some steep banks.</div>
					<a name="07051099000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, I raised my
concerns about the impact of the significant increases in the rates of
duty on working 4x4 vehicles that are proposed in this Bill and in the
Budget for the subsequent Finance Bill. I berated the Government for
not being imaginative enough to think about a descriptor which would
allow working vehicles to be excluded from the increase. I hope that
when we reach clause 105, which my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe
identified, the Government will seek to create an exemption for
vehicles engaged in farming, horticulture and forestry. I hope that
they have listened to the arguments that I and others made on Second
Reading and that they will respond positively and constructively. I
think it unlikely that the force of my argument has persuaded the
Government that that is the right thing to do, but I would be
absolutely delighted if the Financial Secretary would confirm that it
has.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>
					<a name="07051099000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an important matter. My
research shows that there are some 1.6 million sports utility vehicles,
although not all are in the top band of emissions. About 250,000 are
used for off-road purposes. According to the Countryside Alliance,
about 60,000 are used on working farms, 18,000 in the equine industry,
5,000 by gamekeepers and about 2,500 by rural veterinary surgeons. An
unknown number is used in the horticultural and forestry sectors. A
company in my constituency called Ludlow Drains requires such a vehicle
to transport its drain-cleaning equipment. There are many other small
businesses that require such a vehicle for multifarious working
purposes and would not necessarily benefit from the red diesel rates
available to farming
businesses.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The figures that the hon. Gentleman has given
us are useful. Will he clarify whether he is referring to the total
number of sports utility vehicles or the number of new sports utility
vehicles that will be caught by the changes to vehicle excise duty that
have been made last year and this
year?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000448"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> The figures are for all vehicles. I accept that the
changes bite particularly on new vehicles, but the precedent having
been set, they will affect all vehicles henceforward, as new vehicles
become second-hand vehicles. The relevance to the farming industry of
this issue is significant. According to the Countryside Alliance, the
average net income of farmers last year was &#163;21,300, so a
&#163;400 vehicle excise duty is effectively a week&#146;s income
to the average farmer. I must say that that average income figure is
rather higher than I was expecting, and higher than the figure that I
saw at the end of last year on the Public Accounts Committee, when we
reviewed the single farm payment scheme. It is not appropriate to
suggest that the measure will not have a significant impact on those
who are engaged in such business and who generate low incomes. It is
significant and that should be taken into account. I hope that the
Financial Secretary will reassure us that the Government intend to take
it into account at a later stage of the
Bill.</div>

								John
Healey:
						</b> This has been a usefully concise debate. VED rates
are set at those levels for good reasons. They perform two functions:
they raise revenue that we require for the public purse to fund public
services, and they help us to achieve some of our environmental
obligations and aims, which apply to rural areas as much as the rest of
the UK. The VED is designed to signal at the point of purchase that the
more polluting the vehicle, the more VED the purchaser will pay.
Indeed, it is a signal. It is backed by a very good labelling scheme
which is now in place. There is some evidence that there is a high
level of awareness and that it is beginning to play a part in the
purchasing decisions of car buyers. It is an important signal also, in
the long term, to motor manufacturers and designers.</div>

						Hon. Members

that for some, especially those in rural areas, the car is a necessity,
not a luxury. However, I do not accept that motorists have to drive
vehicles that fall within the higher bands just because they live in
rural areas. For example, various types of 4x4 vehicles fall in bands F
and E, not necessarily in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>band G, of the VED system. In addition, the measure has been designed to
affect not four-wheel drive vehicles but those with high CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
emissions.</div>
					<a name="07051099000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wycombe asked me how many band a cars we anticipate there
being by 2010-11. It is difficult to tell for certain, but our forecast
suggests that the number will increase by about two thirds between now
and then. The number of cars on the road in the second-highest band,
band B, which is also a low-emission category, is likely to almost
triple to some 670,000 to 680,000 by then.</div>
					<a name="07051099000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Turning to
the principal concern of the Committee, it is important to bear in mind
what the tax treatment of farmers and their vehicles is. The tax system
is designed so that, where a vehicle is an essential component of the
business activity, businesses can deduct from their turnover all the
costs incurred for the sole purpose of generating business profits.
Such motoring expenses are therefore allowable for deduction against
turnover in such circumstances. Furthermore, agricultural vehicles are
currently exempt from vehicle excise duty.</div>
					<a name="07051099000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Hon. Members
have mentioned clause 105. That will give the Secretary of State for
Transport the power to amend the definition of agricultural vehicles to
keep it in line with future technological and design developments.
Beyond that, I can see no case for special treatment of farming,
agriculture or rural areas within the VED system. Indeed, it would
complicate it, and it is likely to be costly and open to fraud.
Motorists would be able to register vehicles in rural areas and then
use them mostly, if not entirely, in areas other than rural areas. It
has been made clear that this was a probing amendment. I hope that I
have been able to respond to some of the points that have been raised,
and that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for having
clarified the exemption in relation to agricultural vehicles, to which
we shall come at a later stage. My understanding is that previously it
applied to tractors and other very heavy equipment, and the proposal
exemption would extend it to 4x4-type vehicles. Is it his understanding
that the extension would recognise some of the
difficulties?</div>

							<a name="07051099000453"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> Following the debate on agriculture and farming,
I have a few brief questions about the generality of the proposals.
First, the Environmental Audit Committee has said that the Treasury
should at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>least publish its rationale for the VED differentials that it adopts.
That suggests to me that the Committee finds the explanations of the
rises year on year to be obscure. If the Treasury has not already
published its rationale, will it do so, as the Committee
wishes?</div>
					<a name="07051099000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Friends of the Earth has argued that this year&#146;s rise in band G
rate will not make much difference to emissions. It
said:</div>
					<a name="07051099000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
changes are not enough to give people a strong incentive to purchase a
greener car... the Government&#146;s own research suggests a
&#163;150 differential would persuade 55 per cent of people to
change.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Financial Secretary disagree with that claim, and if so,
why?</div>
					<a name="07051099000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it can
be argued that large families need larger cars, and that a large family
in any setting may need, say, a people carrier, whereas no single
person in an urban setting can convincingly be argued to need a band G
car. The Automobile Association has called for the creation of a new
band H with an emissions threshold of 200 g/km, a rise on the current
threshold of 226 g/km, which would place most models of people carrier
into a lower tax band. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I thought that I heard
the Financial Secretary snort. It appeared to be a dismissive noise in
relation to the proposal. If he could kindly confirm the
Government&#146;s view on it, we would be grateful.</div>
					<a name="07051099000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, have the Government
ruled out adapting the weights of VED&#151;the idea is rather
complex, and I would be interested to hear the Financial
Secretary&#146;s view on it&#151;to reflect whether vehicles are
fuelled by carbon-neutral materials.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000454"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Minister knowsmy views
on the matter. The Government have gone some way with the proposed
increase in clause 11 and band G. However, I urge him again, as I did
last year when I tabled an amendment, to be a lot bolder. I would urge
him even to be a lot bolder on Report, in terms of having a swingeing
vehicle excise duty for vehicles above 250 g/km, which are bought new.
It would not be retrospective. Part of the problem with band G,
although I support it, is that it is retrospective. That is behind some
of the concerns that have been expressed. We need to set a date two or
three year&#146;s hence and say to somebody, &#147;If you buy a
very polluting vehicle&#151;say, above 250 g/km&#151;you will pay
through the nose for it, and we are warning you now, not
retrospectively.&#148; That would give the motor industry, including
the west midlands, where I am an MP and where, for example, Land Rover
is based, time to adjust.</div>
					<a name="07051099000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly, too much of the debate
is about 4x4s as polluting vehicles. In the borough in Richmond, in the
constituency of the hon. Member for Twickenham, it was widely reported
that parking charges for 4x4s were being whacked up. I said to him,
&#147;Is this true, or is it for polluting vehicles?&#148;, and he
said it was for polluting vehicles, but that it had been widely
reported as being for 4x4s as a kind of journalistic shorthand. In
fact, as many hon. Members will know, nine out of the 10 most polluting
new vehicles on sale in the United Kingdom today are not 4x4s. The only
one is a top-of-the-range Range Rover. Most of the other nine are
sports cars, such as Lamborghinis.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>
					<a name="07051099000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for Wycombe talked about people carriers, but some of those cars
do not carry more than two people. They are
ridiculous, and those vehicles are bought by very rich people who might
not be put off if there were a swingeing new vehicle excise rate duty,
such as band H, on a new vehicle. Sadly, that is not in force, but it
would do two things. First, it would allow the Government to send a
message. Secondly, if we had a swingeing rate of, say, &#163;2,000 a
year on those new vehicles, it would arguably affect the resale price
of them, which would in turn affect the purchasing prices that some
people make when considering whether to buy a polluting vehicle, or a
less polluting vehicle, in two or three years. It saddens me that we
are talking about greener vehicles. All vehicles are polluting. It is
just a question of the extent to which they do
it.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s ideas are very good
for averting future behaviour without penalising people in the way I
described. Why does he think that his Front-Bench team does not take up
the radical proposals that are targeted at reducing the number of
gas-guzzling
cars?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000456"></a>
								Rob
Marris:
						</b> I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be
able to give reasons for that. I find it hard to conceive why, as a
Government and a society, we cannot tell people that they will be taxed
on future behaviour, so they should make their choices in advance. Such
a framework would command some, although not universal, cross-party
support and would also garner quite a lot of support within the
country. Try as we may, in spite of what is talked about in the pubs
and clubs and in the media, we must get away from this obsession with
4x4s. There are 4x4s that put out something like 172 g/km and are quite
satisfactory for most agricultural, business and rural purposes, such
as towing a horse box, or perhaps even for a drain company or whatever.
Correspondingly, the most polluting vehicles are often things like
sports cars.</div>
					<a name="07051099000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is
possible to get people carriers that emit lower than 200 g/km, such as
the turbo diesel models. In terms of sending a message about future
behaviour by motorists, I should like clause 11 to introduce different
tax proposals and to change the behaviour of vehicle manufacturers.
There is not an instant technological fix for all of this but if one
looks, as I do periodically, at what has been happening to vehicle
emissions for new vehicles on sale in the UK, it is clear that more and
more options are available. Sadly, these are often not the options
chosen by the purchasers. For example, the Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion,
which is being introduced in July this year for sale in the UK, will
have emissions of 102 g/km. It does not break the magic 100 threshold.
I believe that the new Smart car turbo diesel, which will be on sale on
the continent but is not currently announced for sale in the UK, has
emissions of 83 g/km. The petrol version, which will be on sale in
Britain, is above the 100 threshold.</div>
					<a name="07051099000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In terms of
pressing the manufacturers and influencing the behaviour of buyers, we
need to say now what the situation will be in two or three
years&#146; time. That has happened a lot in the Budget already, and
some hon. Members have suggested that the Chancellor is tying the hands
of his successor. I do not buy into that. However, in terms of
certainty for the future, I will
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>support the clause, but I do not think that it is bold enough. Even now
I hope that my hon. Friend can come back with a bolder clause 11 on
Report.</div>

							<a name="07051099000457"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> The clause is a welcome step forward from
where we were last year when the differential between the top two bands
was less than the cost of half a tank of petrol for the most polluting
cars. That will begin to make a difference. However, have the
Government undertaken an assessment of the number of people whose
buying decisions will be affected by this differential band of vehicle
excise duty? Research undertaken by MORI in 2003 indicated that the
differential of the kind in the clause will probably affect 33 per
cent. of buyers, whereas the level recommended by the Energy Savings
Trust of &#163;2,000 would have a much bigger impact and would
influence the majority of people&#146;s decisions when buying a new
car. I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s thoughts on why the
Government chose the figure that they did. Perhaps he could give an
indication of longer-term plans that they have to ramp it up to that
higher level.</div>
					<a name="07051099000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want to add to what has been said about the retrospection element.
There is a problem that people&#146;s buying decisions and the resale
value of the car that they buy is affected by retrospection. There is a
certain unfairness. What work is the Minister doing with other
Departments to try to encourage changes in behaviour? The measure will
influence behaviour at the consumer end, but I note that there are no
compulsory energy efficiency targets for manufacturers. Unless such
targets are made compulsory, there will not be as quick a shift in
behaviour at the production end. Such measures, rather than simply
revenue-raising ones, would make a
difference.</div>
					<a name="07051099000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
wish to raise a point that was drawn to my attention by a constituent.
He has a car with a larger engine which he has had retrofitted to run
on liquefied petroleum gas, which means that its emissions are
significantly lower. My understanding is that he cannot benefit from
being taken down a band or two. Will people who are not buying a car
but making the car that they have more energy efficient benefit from a
lower VED
rate?</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000458"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> If the hon. Lady writes to me with details about
her constituent, I will have a look at the circumstances. On the
question of dealing and liaising with other Departments, specifically
on emissions targets for manufacturers and the progressive reduction
that we want, that is very much a Department for Transport lead. The
Treasury and I are, of course, very supportive of its efforts in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="07051099000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the matter
that the hon. Member for Wycombe raised, we set out in either the
pre-Budget report or the Red Book an explanation or rationale for the
decisions that we take on the differentials in vehicle excise duty. We
have done that consistently. It does not greatly surprise me that the
Environmental Audit Committee takes a different view. I appear before
it regularly, and always look forward to doing so. It generally finds
itself at odds with some of the tax decisions taken in the
Treasury.</div>
					<a name="07051099000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">On vehicle
excise duty, it is designed, as I said, to provide signals to those at
the point of purchase about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>the impact of the emissions of the cars that they are considering
buying. To that extent, it can have an impact not just on awareness but
on the motivations at the point of purchase. Mrs. Brennan
has not been introduced into the Committee&#146;s proceedings before,
but she is a significant illustrative case in point. My hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, West tells me that his wife, Amy, recently bought a
small Toyota. Its VED rate of &#163;35 a year was described as a
significant factor in her decision to buy that model. I welcome the
contribution that Mrs. Brennan has been able to make to our
proceedings, and I hope that it has been
helpful.</div>
					<a name="07051099000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
AA&#146;s view that we ought to be considering a further band in the
VED system, and the view of my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West that we need swinging rises at the top end of
the VED system, I shall take both as early representations for Budget
2008.</div>

							<a name="07051099000459"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> We now move on to the climate change levy. Any
discussion of it is bound to bear a resemblance to our discussion
during the Committee of the whole House on air passenger duty in one
important respect, although the first is explicitly linked to carbon
reduction and the second is not: both have been described as blunt
instruments. In the case of the APD, the phrase was the Financial
Secretary&#146;s, and in the case of the CCL, it was used by the
Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution.</div>
					<a name="07051099000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
far as I know, a man called Tony Grayling is still an adviser to the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#151;he
certainly was at one point fairly recently. He said of the CCL that it
does not provide an incentive to switch to lower carbon fossil fuels.
For example&#151;it is quite an important example in relation to the
discussion on the CCL&#151;the single rate for electricity under the
CCL provides no incentives for electricity generators to switch to
renewables. That is not surprising. The CCL undoubtedly has a blunt
effect; it is essentially an energy tax, levied on the supply of energy
to business, paid downstream by energy consumers. It has been
frequently argued, by us and others, that a structure that first
establishes an energy tax, then pays out a series of rebates to
businesses and then introduces a set of climate change agreements that
enables firms to escape from the structure of the taxation of rebates
that the Treasury has established in the first place is not especially
transparent. We want to see the CCL reformed into, or replaced by, a
carbon levy that is more closely linked to carbon emissions. To borrow
a phrase that I think was once used by Rab Butler, the climate change 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>levy is the best climate change levy that we have at the moment
and therefore we do not intend to oppose the clause.</div>
					<a name="07051099000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I would like to press
the Financial Secretary about the views expressed by Mr.
Grayling and by the Institute for Public Policy Research&#151;I think
that Mr. Grayling has done some work for the
IPPR&#151;with which the hon. Gentleman will be familiar. In a study
for the IPPR, Mr. Grayling suggested that the rates should
be increased towards &#163;70 per tonne of carbon, which is the
official figure used by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs for the social cost of carbon. I realise that it has proved
difficult to establish a precise figure for the social cost of carbon,
but what is the Treasury&#146;s view on that
cost?</div>
					<a name="07051099000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the
point about the rate for electricity, the IPPR study also recommended
that the tax rate should vary according to the fuel mix of the
supplier, based on carbon emissions because that would encourage
investment in clean coal technologies. Again, what is the
Treasury&#146;s view on that
issue?</div>
					<a name="07051099000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">A recent study
by the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the climate change
agreement targets were too lenient. I quote the
study:</div>
					<a name="07051099000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Firms
would have achieved their targets in any case and as such were enjoying
a reduced-rate CCL for effectively doing what they would have
done.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another study, by
Cambridge Econometrics and the Policy Studies Institute,
concluded:</div>
					<a name="07051099000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only for one
sector...did we find that the CCA target would have been missed
had no CCL ever
existed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051099000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the IFS
and the PSI wrong? Again, I look forward to the Financial
Secretary&#146;s response.</div>
					
					<a name="07051099000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051099000460"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> First, the hon. Gentleman is wrongin many
respects about the climate change levy andthe commentators are
wrong about climate change agreements. Together, these measures have
delivered for this country more than a quarter of the target for
emissions reduction that we are working towards under our Kyoto
obligations; that is a very significant contribution to our efforts to
help the world to tackle the climate change problems that we
face.</div>
					<a name="07051099000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that
I should welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman will not oppose this
legislation and this increase. I suppose that, in some ways, we are
making progress, because he and his party opposed the climate change
levy when we introduced it in 2001. The Chief Secretary, who I think
was responsible for that legislation at the time, remembers how
fiercely it was opposed by the Conservatives, who would not accept the
case for trying to introduce an Act to tackle climate change and would
not accept the case for the climate change
levy.</div>
					<a name="07051099000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, by 2010
the climate change levy will deliver carbon savings of more than 3.5
million tonnes a year; the climate change agreements will deliver
climate change savings of more than 2.8 million tonnes a year, and
together they are a central plank in our efforts to make such
savings.</div>
					<a name="07051099000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The levy
itself was designed less to have an impact on generators and more to
encourage greater energy efficiency among energy users, particularly
business users. To that extent, it is succeeding in the specific aims
that we set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>for it. We monitor constantly the way in which the levy and climate
change agreement operate. Clearly, we must consider some longer-term
questions, particularly given the interaction with a strengthened
European Union emissions trading scheme.</div>
					<a name="07051099000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is for the future,
however. The clause will increase the rates for the climate change levy
in line with inflation from April next year. We have always said that
the rates at which the climate change levy are charged should rise with
inflation over time. We legislated for this year&#146;s increase in
last year&#146;s Finance Bill. We are doing the same this year to
provide advance notice for the industry and others affected by the
changes to the climate change
levy.</div>

								Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I wish to address the clause because I am concerned
that the Government are applying double standards in their attempt to
justify a very significant increase in the aggregates levy of more than
20 per cent. after the levy has been stable for a number of years. The
justification in the Red Book is that it will encourage the sustainable
use of resources as some kind of green measure. Yet the Government then
provide themselves with an exemption&#151;they are saying that that
is suitable for the private sector, but not the public sector. Highways
have always been exempt from the aggregates levy and highways
authorities are probably the largest users of aggregates in the
country. Now the Government are seeking to exempt the
railways&#151;another Government user of aggregates. How do the
Government square that? Should they not be subject to the same
sustainability
argument?</div>
					<a name="07051099000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
main reason that I think that the clause applies a double standard is
that increasing the cost of construction for UK-sourced materials will
simply encourage the importing of materials. That was brought home to
me when I read the comments of Mr. John Webster, who I
believe is from a trade association. He
said:</div>

significant than the alleged negative environmental impact of
extracting aggregate resources. This country has plenty of the

extracted. It is a mockery to claim that the measure before us is
anything other than a revenue-raising measure by the Government.
Admittedly, it would not raise enormously significant

&#163;40 million in the first year. None the less, it is significant
for the construction industry because it will put up its costs. Those

						</b> I do not know, Mr. Gale. Whatever the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s leader says, if you vote blue in Ludlow, you do
not get green. This is not a revenue-raising levy. When we introduced
the aggregates levy in 2002, we cut the national insurance rate for
employers across the board. So, if anything, the Treasury is down on
receipts from the levy rather than up. In addition, it is an
environmental tax; it is an environmental tax for environmental
purposes. Its purpose is, first, to incorporate some of the external
costs that come from quarrying and, secondly, to try to encourage the
greater use of recycled stone and gravel.</div>
					<a name="07051099000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
assessment, including the independent assessment of the impact of the
levy since its introduction in 2002, shows that between then and 2005
the amount of newly quarried rock, stone and gravel in this country was
reduced by 18 million tonnes, and the amount of recycled aggregate used
in this country over that time increased by 5.5 million tonnes, so it
is having the sort of impact that it was designed to
achieve.</div>

when the aggregate levy was introduced there was a tax cut in another

the Red Book the increase in the aggregate levy will yield an
additional &#163;40 million in 2008-09 and &#163;45 million in

						</b> We feel that everything possible needs to be
done to encourage the diversion of waste from landfill. However, some
problems are occurring as a result of the way in which the landfill tax
works. In the Red Book, the increase in landfill tax is described as
&#147;supporting recycling&#148;. I should like to dwell for a
couple of minutes on how my local authorities are able to deal with the
issue and the types of pressure that landfill tax puts on
them.</div>
					<a name="07051099000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cornwall, like
many other areas, has a two-tier authority. We have one authority
responsible for collecting waste and another responsible for disposal.
It is therefore difficult to transfer the pressures on&#151;to divert
waste completely from the principal authority. That creates great
difficulties, as there are no direct incentives for recycling. The
pressure seems to be towards anything that is a diversion from
landfill. That can lock people into more environmentally unfriendly
ways of dealing with their waste.</div>

responsibility for the planning and management of waste disposal,
particularly of household waste, is split between collection and
disposal authorities, which can cause difficulties. Does she conclude
from that thatit would be best to move to unitary and
single-tier authorities in her area, or should collection and disposal
responsibilities be lodged with one or other level of the authorities

						</b> To help the hon. Lady, and with regard to the
intervention from the Financial Secretary, in those areas where people
think through the issues carefully, it is quite possible for councils
of different tiers to co-operate in a waste partnership, such as the
Shropshire waste partnership, to form a single entity to collect and
dispose of waste, without the need for a unitary
authority.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> I can see advantages in having greater
strategic control, not only of waste issues, but on other levels. One
reason why we support Cornwall&#146;s bid for unitary status is that
it would give the authority greater strategic control over the whole of
Cornwall. Unfortunately, Cornwall county council has been locked into
having an incinerator, which means that it is difficult to encourage
more recycling. Having a strong voice throughout the county may allow
the authority the time to explore other alternatives and to press the
case for them. Energy from waste is the only option that Cornwall has
been given so far, which means that the county will still suffer,
although the decision has been taken and the council is doing all that
it can to divert from landfill, as the incinerator will not be built
for a few
years.</div>

						</b> As my hon. Friend rightly said, Cornwall county
council has grasped the rather unfortunate nettle of waste-to-energy,
commonly known as incineration. I bring to her attention the
neighbouring authority in Plymouth, which last Thursday passed from
Labour to Conservative control. I hope that the new administration will
reverse the current contractual arrangements, whereby Plymouth city

Goldsworthy:
						</b> I need say no more. The concern is that the
council ends up locked into the decision, which has already been taken,
yet the impact of the landfill tax will continue to have an effect and
place pressure on council tax. There are difficulties, and I wonder
whether the Financial Secretary has considered an alternative, such as
a waste tax, which would encourage local authorities not only to divert
from landfill, but proactively to encourage recycling. He might also
consider measures to deal with packaging at the point of production,
rather than work out how to deal with it at the other end. The
provisions are useful for dealing with landfill, but there are
limitations to what they can achieve. They can be improved, and I hope
that the Minister&#146;s mind is open to pursuing those
improvements.</div>

Marris:
						</b> The basic rate of landfill tax is &#163;2 a
tonne; the clause will put that up to &#163;2.50 a tonne. Will my
hon. Friend the Financial Secretary reconsider that rate and work on
classification issues with the Department of the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency? If certain things are
classified as inactive or inert waste, they will attract the much lower
rate of duty and probably be put into landfill, as the cost to the
concern of doing so will be less. That would result in loss of revenue
as well as environmental consequences. I am sure that DEFRA and the
Treasury are already working on
that.</div>
					<a name="07051099000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly concerned with fly-ash, notto be confused with
fly-tipping, which is produced principally by coal-fired power
stations. I am indebted to Thomas Duve, who wrote an article for the
&#147;Science in Parliament&#148; magazine in spring this year for
the following information. Fly-ash is a glass, silica-rich mineral that
is left over when coal is burnt, and a lot of coal contains it to a
greater or lesser extent. It is currently classified as inactive waste
and is landfilled at &#163;2, which will increase to &#163;2.50 a
tonne.</div>

					<a name="07051099000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many other European Union
countries fly-ash is recycled for other uses, so because of the
classification and tax issue, which at &#163;2 and what will be
&#163;2.50 a tonne is rather low, we are not recycling what our
European neighbours are. That creates a double negative: we do not use
the useful material that will be in heaps outside every coal-fired
power station and we are clogging up landfill sites. Will my hon.
Friend assure me that he will look at those two issues? First, will he
reconsider the rate, even though it is increasing from &#163;2 to
&#163;2.50 and it has been announced that it will go up to
&#163;3.00 a tonne for inactive waste? Secondly, will he discuss with
his colleagues in DEFRA and the Environment Agency whether the
classifications for materials such as fly-ash and others are right? If
they are not right, we have a double-whammy because there is a loss of
revenue and an environmental negative as material is going to landfill
that need not do
so.</div>

that before, but I am happy to take a fresh look at it.</div>
					<a name="07051099000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am not sure
that I can be quite so positive in response to the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne. I am unconvinced about the need for a new waste
tax, and, in the end, tax is not the only type of policy that needs to
play a part in dealing with how we manage and dispose of waste and
increase waste recycling. The Government have a number of measures in
place and perhaps need to consider other future measures. She may be
interested to know that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs will shortly publish a renewed waste strategy that
pulls together much of the work that we have done across Government on
how to raise our game for the

Goodman:
						</b> Members of the Committee will have received large
numbers of representations about some clauses as they are of great
interest to outside bodies. As a parliamentarian, one reads some
clauses and finds one&#146;s eyebrows rising. When I read the clause,
I confess that I went to check the definition of a Henry VIII clause. I
will return to that matter in a moment, but before I do, as members of
the Committee will see on reading the clause, it empowers the Treasury
to charge for community tradeable emissions allowances, which is
reasonable enough. It states that the allowances will be allocated by
regulation and the people who allocate them will be appointed by
regulation. The regulations may impose fees, govern the making or
forfeiting of deposits, impose penalties, charge interest on the
recovery of penalties, and confer&#151;and I presume
withhold&#151;rights of appeal relating to the forfeiting of deposits
and the imposition of penalties.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>
					<a name="07051099000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial Secretary is
welcome to correct me if I am wrong, but I am not aware that I have
seen the regulations yet. In summary, although the clause does not meet
the definition of a Henry VIII clause, it does have a certain Tudor
flavour. The breadth of its scope invites some questions.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">I</i>
						<i class="I">nterruption.] </i>I hear a learned, historical
commentary from the Government Whip, but I will not please him by
responding to it and compressing my remarks. Some of the simple
questions surely are these: who will allocate the allowances; how high
will the fees and the deposits be; how large will the penalties be; how
much interest will be charged on recovered payments; and, above all,
will there definitely be a right of
appeal?</div>
					<a name="07051099000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expect the
Financial Secretary to say that the answers will be provided in due
course if the regulations have not already been published, but one
point is clear about any regulations that either have been or will be
published: they will not be amendable. No member of this or any
Committee will be able to propose that the people who allocate the
allowances should be different people or that the levels of fees,
deposits, penalties or interest charged should be raised or lowered.
Nor will any member of this or any Committee be able to debate the
terms of any right of appeal. He or she may simply be faced with the
choice of accepting or rejecting the proposals that
emerge.</div>
					<a name="07051099000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say
&#147;may&#148; be faced rather than &#147;will&#148; be faced
with good reason. I have taken advice and I am told that the wording of
the clause allows the Financial Secretary to choose either the positive
or the negative procedure. That is, as it was put to me, unusual. In
short, the proposals may not be considered by the positive procedure
route, which is highly
questionable.</div>
					<a name="07051099000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
regulations have not been published, when will they be? Can the
Financial Secretary at least give the Committee an assurance&#151;I
gather that he is usually very reasonable in this regard&#151;that
they will be dealt with under the positive procedure, and can he give a
guarantee that there will be a right of appeal, because that would seem
to be
important?</div>

						</b> All the questions that the hon. Gentleman has
raised are valid. I would like to underline the question of when we
will get a sense of when the regulations will be produced. I note that
the clause is limited in application to &#147;Community tradeable
emissions allowances&#148;, but not specifically EU emissions trading
schemes. That opens up the possibility of it being extended beyond
Europe and beyond greenhouse gases. Given that it has that wider
application, will we have to wait for more comprehensive regulations or
will they be specifically limited to the EU, and when will we see
them?</div>

						</b> Hon. Members have rightly pointed out that this
provision takes us into new territory. It allows us to provide the
basis for auctioning some of the allowances under the European
Union&#146;s emissions trading scheme, but in phase 2, which does not
start until 2008 and runs to 2012. As my right hon. Friend the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury said in a letter to, I think, the hon.
Members for Falmouth and Camborne and for Chipping Barnet yesterday,
the question of regulations cannot precede the detailed design of the
allocations and auctioning scheme. That matter will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>dealt with as the arrangements for phase 2 of the EU ETS are firmed up
across Europe. Once the scheme design is clearer, we will be in a
position to devise the regulations, covering the sort of points that
the hon. Member for Wycombe identified. When we produce the
regulations, we will do so in draft and we will consult as widely as we
need to on them. I can reassure the Committee that the points made this
afternoon will be taken into account in drawing up the
regulations.</div>

not want the Committee to lose sight of the importance of introducing
the possibility of auctioning into the allocation of allowances and

that we require to reduce emissions and deal with climate
change.</div>
