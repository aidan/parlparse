<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/095/1997095.htm">School Standards and Framework Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during the proceedings on the School Standards and Framework Bill, the Committee do 
meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o’clock and at half-past Four o’clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I say how much the Committee is looking forward to your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam. 
Your wisdom, fairness and, of course, your firmness will help our deliberations. Several Labour 
Members are making their debut in Standing Committee and the same may apply to one or two 
Opposition Members. I am sure that they will benefit from your guidance during our proceedings. We 
also look forward to seeing Mr. Gale, your co-Chairman, who will be taking over the chairmanship of 
the Committee when appropriate.
<P>
While there are new members of the Standing Committee, there are some old lags here too, if I 
may describe them as such, with experience of Standing Committees on education Bills. I last 
discussed an education Bill in Standing Committee in 1993 and I have quickly read the report of those 
proceedings to ascertain what I said, because I am sure that Conservative Members will remind me of 
what I said five or six years ago.
<P>
However, some hon. Members have served on more recent Standing Committees on education 
Bills, such as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). I am looking forward to working with my hon. 
Friends the Members for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), the Under-Secretary of State for 
Education and Employment, and for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) who have given long 
service to such Standing Committees. I also welcome to the Committee the Under-Secretary of State 
for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), who will be dealing with measures in 
the Bill that relate to Wales.
<P>
The sittings motion outlines the usual pattern that we adopt in such proceedings. We shall meet 
as and when is necessary in line with the motion. Whenever possible, we shall try not to sit on 
Thursday afternoons. However, we must make progress and, if necessary, we shall sit on Thursday 
afternoons to ensure, not only that the Bill is approved by the Standing Committee, but that 
Opposition Members have the opportunity of scrutinising it properly. I commend the sittings motion 
to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. 
McWilliam. Like him, I look forward to your wisdom and fairness—I do want to be outdone by the 
Minister’s grovelling either to you or to your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale. I have had the pleasure of 
serving on a Committee under your chairmanship before, Mr. McWilliam; I think that you chaired a 
Finance Bill when I was Financial Secretary; you were a wise and fair Chairman then and no doubt 
the same will happen in this Committee.
<P>
The Minister said that he has previously served on Committees discussing education Bills. I 
have not, so such a pleasure is in store for me and it is one which I await with keen anticipation. We 
shall be discussing a major education Bill and the official Opposition will approach it with a 
willingness to see the Government use their majority to get it through Committee. It is the 
Committee’s function to question Ministers, to probe the Government’s true intentions and to draw 
attention to the Bill’s shortcomings. We do not intend to be deliberately obstructive: we intend to take 
whatever time is necessary to ensure that the Bill is thoroughly examined by the Committee, which is 
why the Standing Committee procedure was established.
<P>
Against that background, Mr. McWilliam, may I say that we certainly shall not obstruct the 
sittings motion. As a Government back Bencher and a Minister, I have known Standing Committees 
spend two and a half hours debating a wide variety of issues, some of them loosely related to the Bill, 
to ensure that the first sitting is taken up solely with a debate on the sittings motion. We do not 
propose to pursue that course today, but some serious points need to be made at the outset and the 
debate on the sittings motion is an ideal opportunity.
<P>
I refer first to the precise words of the sittings motion. The Minister moved that the Committee 
should sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm, but said that he intends that the 
Committee should not normally sit on Thursday afternoons. The Opposition have no difficulty with 
that, but it would be convenient for all members of the Committee to know how much notice the 
Government are likely to give of their intention to sit on a Thursday afternoon.
<P>
New Members may not be fully aware of how the Government would achieve that result. The 
clerk may advise you to correct me, Mr McWilliam, but I think that I am right in saying that at the 
end of the Thursday morning sitting, and notwithstanding the sittings motion, the Government Whip 
will move that the Committee should meet again next Tuesday at 10.30 am. The first that the 
Committee would know of the Government’s intentions would be at 1 pm on Thursday. To put it 
mildly, it would be potentially inconvenient for all members of the Committee if the much-respected 
Government Whip [Interruption.] We have no reason yet not to respect him.
<P>
At 1 pm on Thursday we shall expect the Whip to move that the Committee will meet again on 
Tuesday at 10.30 am; however, if he stays in his place when the Committee is adjourned, the 
Committee will automatically meet again three and a half hours later—with only three and a half 
hour’s notice.  That is not acceptable. I hope that the Minister will at the very least undertake to give 
notice on the Tuesday of his intention that the Committee should sit on the Thursday afternoon. To do 
otherwise would be an unreasonable imposition on members of the Committee.
<P>
That first point essentially concerned the convenience of honourable Members. To those outside 
the Committee, the nature of the Bill is of much greater concern. The most important clauses enable 
the Government to introduce major issues of education policy by regulation. To any who seriously 
argued that that was not true, I would simply point out the first line of clause 1, which provides that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Secretary of State may by regulations . . . impose limits on class sizes”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so forth. The very first line of clause 1 reveals that the bill works by giving Ministers the 
power to make policy by regulation. We will not be able to have sensible discussion of the nature of 
the powers that are proposed under the Bill unless the Government give a clear statement of how they 
intend to use those powers.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking that before the Committee is asked to discuss 
clauses that give Ministers regulation-making powers—some of my hon. Friends may want to apply 
this point to the parts of the Bill that particularly concern them—he will publish, ideally, a draft of the 
regulations or, at the very least, a clear statement of the nature and purpose of the proposed 
regulations.
<P>
Let me illustrate the importance of that point by referring to a few clauses that rely on 
regulation-making powers. I have mentioned clause 1, which will give effect to the Government’s 
election pledge to limit infant class sizes to 30. That is not specified in the Bill, however; the clause 
gives the Minister power to introduce regulations to impose limits on class sizes and to fix the dates 
by which those limits should apply.
<P>
When do the Government intend to deliver their election pledge? Moreover, what is the nature of 
that election pledge? The concept of a class size of 30 does not find expression in the Bill, so what 
regulations will the Government introduce under the clause 1? The Minister’s hon. Friends may also 
want to ask such questions because, at the end of this Parliament, they will have to face the electorate 
against the background of the Labour party’s election pledges.
<P>
Clause 2 gives the Government further powers to make regulations to determine the precise 
nature of the plans that local education authorities must prepare to show how they will deliver the 
class size limits under clause 1. Clause 2(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The statement shall . . . take such form, as may be prescribed”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause also provides the Government with the power to prescribe who will be consulted over 
preparation of the plans. We need to know about the regulations before we consider the statutory basis 
of the regulation-making powers.
<P>
The Committee will remember that the Government said that they would pay for smaller infant 
class sizes by using money saved from the assisted places scheme. Clause 3 provides for the financial 
implications of clauses 1 and 2. Again, the provision of cash to enable LEAs to pay for the infant class 
size policy will be determined by regulations. If the Minister’s hon. Friends are interested in the 
deliverability of the pledge, they should ask, as LEAs will, about the regulations to be introduced 
under clause 3: how much will they provide for and how will that money be distributed between 
individual LEAs?
<P>
I mention the first three clauses, but I could pick on almost any passage of the Bill to make the 
same point: the detail of the Bill rests in regulation. It is hard for us to have a serious discussion of the 
measure without knowing more about the regulations that the Government intend to introduce. 
<P>
Let me briefly reflect on the other key passages of the Bill where the same principle applies. 
Under clause 21, the basis of foundation schools will be defined by regulation. Some Labour Members 
are concerned about the Government’s foundation school policy, and they would be interested to know 
what those regulations will contain. The hon. Member for Bath might be interested to know about 
foundation schools, especially as his track record on foundation and grant-maintained schools is one 
of an interesting evolution of policy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): It is consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It might be many things, but it is not consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman accuses me of inconsistency. I am sure that the Committee will 
be delighted to know on what evidence he basis that remark. If he were to refer to interviews that 
appeared in The Bath Chronicle in 1992, he should do so with considerable caution, and look at the 
subsequent interview in which one of the reporter’s remarks was rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall certainly refer to the remarks that the hon. Gentleman made which appeared 
in his constituency’s newspaper in 1992. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We would be very keen to see the benefits of a grant-maintained status being passed to all 
schools . . . maybe what we should do is have all schools opt out instantly.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we debate clause 21, the hon. Gentleman can enlighten the Committee as to what he said 
next in that interview.
<P>
In the meantime, before the hon. Gentleman says that he is even more enthusiastic about 
education action zones than the Government, they might like to consider that—at least, according to 
the words available to me—he was once even more enthusiastic 
than the previous Government about grant-maintained schools. We shall be interested to hear that 
debate develop.
<P>
The point of that diversion is to stress the importance of understanding exactly how the 
Government intend to use the powers under the Bill to establish foundations and foundation schools 
before the Committee debates clause 21.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) intends to seek an assurance that 
regulations on school organisation plans will be made available before their structure is debated. I do 
not think it unnecessarily partisan to say that the clauses on school organisation plans are some of the 
Bill’s more opaque passages. My hon. Friend will seek clarification of what those rather curious 
clauses mean before we debate them.
<P>
The same argument applies to the financing of maintained schools under chapter IV, in which 
the Government state that they favour 100 per cent. delegation. However, they also state that they will 
define, by regulation, how to distinguish between general and aggregated school budgets. Frankly, 
unless we understand the nature of those regulations, the proposition that they favour 100 per cent. 
delegation is completely meaningless. If we are to have a sensible debate on the financing of 
maintained schools, we must know what the Government intend to include in the regulations so that 
we can properly assess their meaning.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) has a substantial 
constituency interest in grammar schools—another key passage, where the teeth of the Bill lie in 
regulations. My hon. Friend will seek to catch your eye, Mr. McWilliam, to make his point and to 
make it clear that the Bill can be properly assessed only if the texts of the regulations are made 
available before the relevant clauses are debated.
<P>
The importance of understanding what will be in the regulations also applies to codes of 
practice. I am especially interested in two codes of practice. The first is that on admissions policy, 
which is paved by clause 75. The question of who is responsible for schools admissions and on what 
terms has been the centre of much political debate about schools policy for many years. Clause 75 
begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Secretary of State shall issue, and may from time to time revise, a code of practice 
containing such practical guidance as he thinks appropriate”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is impossible to have a sensible discussion about admissions policy on that basis. I hope that 
the Minister will be able to give the Committee a firm undertaking that a draft code of practice will be 
published and available to the Committee before we reach clause 75. That is a key part of the Bill; we 
cannot have a sensible discussion of admissions policy while the code of practice is held up the 
Government’s sleeve. I am not making an overtly partisan point—any fair-minded observer would 
consider that unreasonable.
<P>
The other code of practice in which I am interested is one about which Ministers are fond of 
talking, but which I believe—the Minister may correct me if I am wrong—is not paved in the Bill: the 
promised code of practice containing the Government’s view of the proper role of a local education 
authority. I have left that until last because it is in some senses the most unsatisfactory aspect of the 
Committee’s position.
<P>
One of the key questions raised by the Bill is where power should rest in the school system 
between the school, the governing body and the head teacher—the school as a local institution—the 
local education authority and the Secretary of State. The Bill has been subject to a wide variety of 
interpretations. Some LEAs have made no secret of the fact that they consider the Bill to be an 
opportunity to re-establish a direct managerial responsibility for schools that have established a degree 
of independence from them; Ministers have been reported as saying, at least in private, if not in semi-
public, that the Bill provides an opportunity for them to monitor and control the function of LEAs. 
They believe that it will take power away from LEAs and give it to the Secretary of State or, more 
precisely, in the routine business of government, to officials in the Department for Education and 
Employment.
<P>
If the Committee is to understand the Government’s intentions about who will be responsible for 
taking key decisions in the management of the schools service—the management responsibilities set 
out in the Bill—it needs access to the code of practice on the proper role of the LEA, which was 
promised by Ministers. It is also unsatisfactory for a Bill to be presented to the House of Commons 
seeking to redefine the relationship between schools, LEAs and the DFEE by a Government who have 
promised to set out in a code of practice their view of the future of LEAs, when the code of practice 
has no rooting in the Bill.
<P>
I seek from the Minister the assurance, not merely that the promised code of practice will be 
available to the Committee when we discuss the relevant parts of the Bill, but that that code of 
practice, once promulgated, will be statutory. if it is not, the obvious observation will be: it is fine to 
have a code of practice setting out what the Government think ought to happen, but how will it be 
enforced? The Government’s opinion is very interesting, but the statute is the statute. The 
Government should have a statutory basis for offering guidance to which the LEAs or schools—and, 
ultimately, the courts—must pay attention, rather than having the Secretary of State circulating a 
private letter. What are the Government’s intentions and when will they publish the code of practice? 
What are their intentions in terms of rooting it in the Bill, so that the provisions of the code of 
practice, when they are seen and understood, can be seen to have some practical influence on the 
evolution of schools’ policy?
<P>
I hope that Ministers will recognise those as serious questions that need to be addressed before 
the Committee gets into the meat of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> May I join in the grovelling flattery to you, Mr. McWilliam? You have already 
been described, rightly, as being wise, fair and firm. I am convinced that both you and Mr. Gale, who 
will take over in the chair from time to time, will be generous and helpful to the Committee. I 
apologise in advance publicly, as I have done privately, if I stray from the subject that we shall be 
discussing, but it will be because I care passionately about the issues.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said that his intention was to use the 
sittings of the Committee to test and probe the Bill, to draw out some of its shortcomings. It is my 
intention and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) to do 
all those things. In addition—and the reason the sittings motion is so important—we want to have 
some time available to try to change certain aspects of the Bill.
<P>
In some cases, we want to change the Bill radically. I made clear our keen desire to change the 
Government’s thinking on foundation schools in my speech on Second Reading, which I have no 
intention of repeating here. There are some other major changes that we shall try to persuade the 
Government to make. The sitting motion is important in allowing us time to try to improve certain 
aspects of the Bill with which we sympathise in broad outline. For example, reference has already 
been made to the Liberal Democrats’ support for education action zones, but certain provisions need 
to be improved, added to or changed.
<P>
The proposed sittings motion will be helpful. Like the right hon. Member for Charnwood, I 
believe that it would be exceedingly helpful if the Government gave a clear indication of when the 
Committee will sit and gave us plenty of advance notice. We in the Liberal Democrat party are more 
than happy to sit regularly on Thursday afternoons if it will ensure that the Bill will make speedy 
passage through its Committee stage.
<P>
The Minister mentioned some of us who have served on other education Committees. I have 
been a Member of Parliament for only six years, but I have already served on more than six education 
committees. Bearing in mind that there is not only this Bill, but another Bill on education currently 
proceeding in another place, my average will increase, if the Committee of Selection chooses me to 
serve on that Committee too. I am anxious to make speedy progress not only for my benefit, but 
because I believe that the measures in the Bill are important. The sooner that we can get the Bill on 
the statute book, the sooner pupils will benefit from the changes.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood made another important point. He referred to the various 
regulations in the Bill. I have had drafted for me a list of all the orders, regulations and guidance 
referred to in the Bill. There are 44 separate orders, regulations or guidance covering many important 
matters. In addition, there are 16 clauses allowing the Secretary of State to approve, or not approve, 
various actions taken by others. In each of those cases, there are issues that the Government must 
explain. Some are more important than others, but it is vital for the Minister to give the Committee an 
assurance that we shall have information on major regulations and guidance before we debate them in 
detail, and certainly before we are expected to give approval to a clause containing guidance, orders or 
regulations.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not, as the right hon. Member for Charnwood did, intend to go through those that I believe 
are the most important as we can discuss them with the Minister and his colleagues during the Bill’s 
passage. I believe that we are in for some interesting times as we debate them. I shall be particularly 
fascinated to hear what the Minister says about clause 102, which enables the Secretary of State to 
make regulations to set out compulsory nutritional standards for school lunches.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. However, I want to refer to his 
comment about not wanting to go through all the regulations that he thought were especially 
important. He might want to dwell on the fact that the code of practice on the role of LEAs will not be 
debated at all in Committee, unless we do so now, because there is no statutory basis for it as the Bill 
is drafted. The hon. Gentleman might like to say whether he shares my view about the importance of 
that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I certainly agree with 
the principle of what he is saying, but he will know that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate 
and Knaresborough and I have tabled amendments on a wide range of issues affecting different 
aspects of the Bill. No doubt he will be keen to hear, and perhaps show a willingness to support, a 
detailed amendment that I shall be tabling later today. There are some provisions relating to the Bill 
that are extremely important and which would be better included in the Bill rather than being done by 
regulation. We intend to table an amendment on that subject. The right hon. Gentleman may not 
necessarily agree with all of it, but we can debate that later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If the purpose of the amendment is to require the Government to give a statutory 
basis to their views on the role of the LEA, I agree with that principle. Clearly, I should have to 
consider the terms of the hon. Gentleman’s amendment before I sign up for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman’s show of support in principle.
<P>
You have been generous so far, Mr. McWilliam, but you might not be if we continue to debate 
the details of that proposed amendment. We are delighted that you are in the Chair. It is an extremely 
important Bill that deserves detailed scrutiny. We have a great deal of sympathy with the 
Government’s aspirations on many aspects, but in some areas we believe that improvements could be 
made. The sittings motion gives us the opportunity to do that and we shall support it.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call other hon. Members, I want to say a few words. There are 
quite a number of new Members who may not have served on Standing Committees before, and one or 
two who have had the doubtful privilege of serving under me once or twice. The rules of the Standing 
Orders must be made plain so that new Members do not get themselves in trouble. To save any doubt, 
hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets if they wish; hon. Ladies may do so at any time, because I 
do not have to give permission. However, hon Gentlemen should ask permission first.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. 
McWilliam. I will not grovel. I have not previously served on a Committee chaired by you, so this is a 
new experience for me. I have served on a Committee considering an employment Bill, but not one 
considering an education Bill, so I hope that the prefix “new” will be welcome to Labour Members.
<P>
I want to add to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, especially about the 
role of LEAs and the need for the code of practice to be made available for the Committee to debate. 
Many of the matters that we will consider in the coming weeks will be discussed by other bodies and 
Government Departments, so the timing of our proceedings is critical; we will need to have the 
information that will influence decision making outside the Committee.
<P>
The Government said in the White Paper—the precursor to the Bill—that their education 
reforms related to standards, not structure. However, the Committee will consider no fewer than 55 
clauses dealing specifically with structure, many of which relate to LEAs. The future role of LEAs is a 
matter of concern outside the House, not least to the LEAs  themselves. Clarification is needed and 
the Committee must debate these matters in detail.
<P>
On page 69 of the White Paper, the Government state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“LEAs must earn their place in the new partnership by showing that they can add real 
value.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some of the clauses will give the LEAs additional powers to control and manage schools, many 
of which have extremely good track records. Conversely, other clauses—particularly those relating to 
education action zones—will remove powers from LEAs. Ironically, those schools that are performing 
least well and those with socio-economic problems will be removed from LEA control. There is a 
good deal of contradiction about the exact role of LEAs.
<P>
Even before our proceedings have begun, events have given me cause for concern. On 28 
November 1997, in a presentation to the Local Government Association conference, Greg Wilkinson 
of the Audit Commission talked about the role of LEAs under the Government’s reforms. One section 
of his presentation was headed, “What could replace LEAs?” He suggested that LEAs could be 
replaced by hit squads, private suppliers, regionalisation and education action zones. Outside the 
House, LEAs are already hearing such suggestions about their future role. That role is uncertain, and 
it is critical that the Committee addresses in detail exactly what the Government intend for them.
<P>
One of the suggested replacements for LEAs is education action zones. I am gravely concerned 
about the way in which the Government have gone about their business. I have no doubt that they are 
enthused by the response to the White Paper but, however large the majority on the Government 
Benches, their behaviour has been highly irregular. The DFEE has already—in January—sent packs 
to LEAs, training and enterprise councils, Government offices, health authorities, businesses, 
religious communities and other organisations asking them to put in a bid to be considered as an 
education action zone, with a closing date of 20 March 1998, despite the fact that the House has not 
yet determined whether the Bill should be put on the statute book. Although the letter contains the 
caveat that the proposals will be subject to parliamentary approval, it is highly unlikely that the Bill 
will have received Royal Assent by 20 March 1998, but perhaps the Minister can give us some 
advance information.
<P>
The DFEE’s pack is not just a letter of information or a suggestion for people to consider; it 
contains detailed application forms. Any organisation or group of organisations serious about wanting 
to form an education action zone will have to bear the cost of preparing a bid. It is quite 
unprecedented to do that before a Bill receives Royal Assent, not withstanding the Government’s 
large majority. Through you, Mr. McWilliam, I ask the Minister whether advice was sought from the 
Cabinet Office on the appropriateness of dispatching that pack and almost certainly involving those 
authorities in the costs of preparing bids before the House has approved the Bill.
<P>
That brings me to another aspect of finance, the subject of more detailed clauses. I mentioned the 
financial implications of submitting a bid in respect of education action zones, but Ministers will 
doubtless be aware that LEAs are, at this very moment, urgently negotiating with the Department of 
the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the local government settlement, standard spending 
assessments and the supplementary bids that local authorities are putting in for 1998-99.
<P>
It is clear from the feedback from local education authorities that some of the moneys already 
announced by the Government—they have yet to be debated by the Committee—are to be the subject 
of matched funding, particularly those for improving standards, such as the capital cost of providing 
minimum class sizes in infant schools. Already, many LEAs are saying that they will not be able to 
match that funding. When the Minister replies to debates on such financial matters, it is critical that 
he gives the Committee detailed information about the coming financial year.
<P>
The Minister should say whether LEAs will be able to match the aspirations in the Bill, 
especially those that are intended to raise standards, many of which we agree with. I had a meeting 
with the Lib-Lab-controlled Devon county council on Saturday, and I was asked to make yet another 
plea to Ministers at the DETR to ensure that what is enshrined in the Bill is enacted in coming years. 
At the moment, the council does not think that it will be possible.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an indication of the progress of his colleagues in 
the DETR, especially in relation to the financial implications of many of the Bill’s proposals. We 
want to know whether our aspirations of higher standards are deliverable—whether local education 
authorities will receive the necessary finance in the coming financial year. That information needs to 
be timely. By the time the Committee has completed its scrutiny of this large Bill, decisions will 
almost certainly have been taken by other Departments that will have an impact on the decisions that 
the Committee will have made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am pleased to be a member of a Standing 
Committee considering a major Bill, especially an education Bill. I am keen to back up the remarks of 
my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood about the importance of publishing the regulations 
in advance of the relevant deliberations of the Committee, particularly the clause that will allow the 
future of grammar schools to be determined by local ballots.
<P>
The Minister already knows that I am a keen defender of my local grammar schools. First, they 
are excellent schools and I would like to keep the disruption of those schools to a minimum. Secondly, 
they improve the quality of all the local schools, both the secondary schools and the junior schools 
that precede them. Thirdly, and most importantly, they provide a vital opportunity to children 
regardless of their ability. The issue is important, although I accept only to some parts of the country.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a ripple of conversation in the Room. All hon. Members are 
entitled to be listened to in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> There are four grammar schools in my constituency. Altrincham boys grammar 
school and Altrincham girls grammar school have now been joined by two schools which were 
independent Roman Catholic schools and which opted into grant-maintained status a year ago. Those 
schools each have a different status, and the abolition of any one of them as a grammar school would 
have different effects on the overall education provision in my constituency and in the borough of 
Trafford as a whole.
<P>
The two Roman Catholic grammar schools have implications for the provision of Roman 
Catholic denominational education throughout the borough, especially given the recent decision by 
Trafford borough council to cease funding places at St. Bede’s college, an independent Roman 
Catholic grammar school. It is already placing enormous pressure on grammar school places and 
Roman Catholic education in my constituency.
<P>
The matter of how ballots may be conducted was thrown into sharp relief by Trafford borough 
council’s submission in response to the Government’s consultation process on such arrangements. As 
the Minister knows, that caused considerable concern in the local community. Trafford's proposal was 
that a ballot could be triggered with a low threshold and would be conducted throughout the whole 
borough, without taking into account the different interests of particular schools or parts of the 
borough.
<P>
Furthermore, it was suggested that the parents of children who attended independent schools 
would be excluded from the ballot, notwithstanding that many people who send their children to 
independent preparatory schools subsequently send them to the grammar schools because they deem 
them to be so good. All those matters were highlighted by Trafford borough council when it made its 
submission; some of them have been partly clarified by comments that Ministers have since made. I 
return again to the point that it is one thing for a Minister to make an observation or to give a 
reassuring remark; it is another thing to have a Bill that gives no detail about how the ballots should 
be conducted.
<P>
Regardless of the Minister’s proposals on how the ballots might be conducted and what might be 
covered by the regulations, there are many difficulties to take into account. What about the difference 
in treatment between grant-maintained grammar schools and other grammar schools, which are both 
located in the borough of Trafford? I accept that another member of the Committee, the hon. Member 
for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) represents grammar schools in her constituency while the 
constituency of the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Mr. Goggins) is not represented in 
Committee, but now covers Sale grammar school.
<P>
The difference between the grant-maintained and the non-grant-maintained grammar schools 
poses an important difficulty for the future of those schools 
under a single balloting regime. Given that grant-maintained schools will retain their status until 
April 1999, I presume that it will not be possible for them to be included in a balloting arrangement 
on their admissions policy prior to that date. As a result, even if the regulations stated that such 
matters should be carried out within local authority-wide boundaries, a ballot could be triggered that 
applied only to some of the grammar schools within a local authority area. If that happened, the 
impact of the result and the outcome of the ballot could be significant.
<P>
For example, in the borough of Trafford, where the grammar schools in the south of the borough 
in my constituency are predominantly grant maintained—as, incidentally, are most of the secondary 
schools—the parents of those pupils would be involved in a ballot relating to schools in the north of 
the borough to which they do not sent their children. Following the ending of grant-maintained status, 
there could be a further ballot—again conducted on a Trafford-wide basis—in which parents in the 
north who do not send their children to grammar schools in Altrincham would be consulted. That 
would be unacceptable. It is vital that any ballot should be based on a school’s catchment area and 
involve those in the local community of which the school is a part.
<P>
That is especially important in the light of the popularity of grammar schools—although not just 
grammar schools are popular. Central to my commitment to the local educational system in 
Altrincham, and the borough of Trafford as a whole, is my belief that it works to the advantage of all 
the secondary schools. The Committee will be delighted to hear that during our deliberations I shall 
refer not only to my excellent local grammar schools but to some of the other excellent secondary 
schools, such as Ashton-on-Mersey school. Anyone who believes that those of us who represent 
constituencies in which there is a selective education system are concerned only about grammar 
schools could not be more mistaken. I mention in passing that Ashton-on-Mersey school has—I 
believe uniquely—won a charter mark and been given an outstanding report from the Office for 
Standards in Education, despite drawing a large proportion of its pupils from an area of considerable 
social deprivation. If we are to have fair consultation on the future of such excellent schools, we must 
be clear how the Government will set out the balloting procedure before we discuss the relevant part 
of the Bill.
<P>
I do not intend to make any further remarks on the matter at present—[Hon. Members: “Hear, 
hear.”] I am delighted to receive such support from the whole Committee. I strongly endorse the view 
of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood that it is impossible for Committee members to 
scrutinise or give meaningful consideration to the Bill without having sight of the detailed proposals 
that will underlie its implementation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I told the Committee that I would try to be helpful to new hon. Members. 
When they are addressing the Committee, they are addressing the Chair, so the word “you” refers to 
the occupant of the Chair. As one of my daughters lectures at Reading university and the other has 
just graduated from Goldsmiths, and I have no intention of going anywhere near greater Manchester, 
references to me are inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): May I, like other members of the Committee, welcome you to 
the Chair, Mr. McWilliam? As a new Member of Parliament, I have not had the opportunity to serve 
on a Committee under your chairmanship before; indeed, I have not served on a Committee 
considering a Bill before. I look forward to the experience with more than a little trepidation. That is 
not a comment on your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam, which we have already seen to be fair and 
firm, as other hon. Members have said. It was the dire warnings given by the hon. Member for Bath 
about the impact on one’s life of serving on a Committee considering a Bill that caused me concern. 
He said that it would take over one’s life for the rest of one’s life—or at least for the foreseeable 
future.
<P>
However, it is right that a topic of such importance is debated properly and considered in detail, 
and for that reason we must be able to prepare well in advance for the issues that we will be 
addressing in each sitting. I echo the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, 
which were supported by the hon. Member for Bath, about the importance of knowing in advance 
whether the committee will be meeting on Thursday afternoons, rather than finding out at 1 o’clock 
on Thursday. We must have advance notice so that we can prepare properly for the debates, which we 
all agree will be on extremely important matters that deserve proper consideration.
<P>
Since coming to the House, I have been struck by the problems of planning timetables, business 
and diaries and the inefficiency, in a sense, of how procedure affects those matters. Given the 
Government’s statements on modernising the House to make it more efficient, it would be an 
appropriate sign of their intention to follow their desire for efficiency if they were to give us greater 
notice of Thursday afternoon sittings than is being considered. I hope that the Minister will take that 
point on board.
<P>
The practicality of implementing the Bill is a key issue. It is worthy of a note that the Bill has 
221 pages, including 124 clauses and 30 schedules, and is backed up by 346 pages of description in 
the notes on clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> A description is the last thing that the notes on clauses are.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I was about to make that point. It is striking how little detail there is within the Bill. 
The hon. Member for Bath said that the Bill refers to 44 orders and regulations. It is noticeable that, 
in so many key areas, we are referred not to detail, which can be debated in Committee, but to 
regulations that the Secretary of State will make from time to time, as he wishes. Therefore, as my 
right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, it is essential that the Government inform us of 
the regulations, orders or codes of conduct sufficiently in advance of debating the clauses that refer to 
them. The Government should at least do that—even if they do not publish the regulations in detail—
so that we can properly assess what such regulations might contain.
<P>
As has been said, that principle is relevant to many matters. My right hon. Friend the Member 
for Charnwood has referred to the new arrangements for the organisation of schools—school 
organisation committees and plans, to which I shall refer specifically. He described the clauses on 
those matters as opaque, which is putting it rather mildly. Having read those clauses, I opened the 
notes on clauses—the so-called description of the Bill—to find out what they would tell me. I had 
hoped that the notes on clauses would have given an explanation such that I would not have to make 
these comments.
<P>
In fact, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood has said, the last thing that the notes 
on clauses do is describe the Bill; they simply regurgitate, in slightly different form, what is in the 
Bill. Having read the notes on clauses, I am none the wiser about the clauses that they are supposed to 
describe. I am a new Member, so I still hope that—[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Did I hear the Minister say “exactly” from a sedentary position?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I give way to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. The people who drafted these notes on 
clauses are the same people who did so under the previous Administration. The notes on clauses serve 
exactly the same purpose.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Given all the statements that the Government have made about open government and 
their intention to govern openly, I had hoped that they would have produced documents containing 
more information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that some Labour Members might like to reflect on the 
true import of what the Minister has just said, which is that things are going on pretty much as they 
were before 1 May?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I echo my right hon. Friend’s comments and those that have been made about certain 
aspects of Government policy—[Interruption.]
<P>
The Chairman: Order. The right hon. Member for Charnwood has been in the House long 
enough to know that it is inadvisable to assist colleagues from a sedentary position.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I hope that all members of the Committee will reflect on the difficulty of properly 
debating clauses in the Bill unless their details are fully set out. It is disappointing that a Government 
who talk about open government have not taken the opportunity to go further than perhaps was done 
in the past to ensure that the document is a proper explanation of the clauses in the Bill, rather than 
simply regurgitating the statements in it. Having failed to do it in the notes on clauses, I hope that the 
Government will take on board the points that have been made about the necessity of ensuring that we 
see the regulations before we debate them.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am particularly concerned about school organisation plans and committees. That ties in with 
the comments that have been made about the role of the LEA and the need for a proper debate. It is 
not clear from clauses 23 and 25 what impact the school organisation and plans committees will have 
on the role of the LEA. There are many areas in the Bill where the powers of the local education 
authority are being eroded. That matter needs to be properly debated, but we cannot do that unless we 
have details of the regulations. We need to know the Government’s intention behind the opaque words 
in the Bill. I echo the concerns expressed in earlier speeches about the role of the LEA and look 
forward with interest to the amendment of the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
The LEA’s role is central to the education structure and how it is delivered. Its role, powers and 
the relationship of the balance of power between the LEA and the Secretary of State are key issues 
that must be debated properly in Committee before the Bill reaches the statute book. Having sat on a 
local education authority and having heard Labour councillors frequently talk about the need for extra 
powers to be given to the LEA and the Secretary of State’s powers to be reduced, I find it somewhat 
ironic that in the Bill, the Labour Government will do exactly the opposite. The Bill will take power 
away from LEAs, reduce local accountability and transfer power from the locally democratically 
elected representatives to the Secretary of State, on the basis of regulations that we have not seen and 
whose content we do not yet know. It is imperative that we see the regulations before we debate the 
issues.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) mentioned the financial 
aspects and the delegation issue. Clause 44 sets out the definition of delegated budgets, which is a 
matter that will be left to regulation. That is of particular concern, given the work that has been done 
recently by the Council for Better Teaching about the way in which local education authorities have 
been delegating budgets to their schools. I have taken a particular interest because Berkshire county 
council was used as an example. The figures show that the percentage of the budget that has been 
delegated to schools is significantly less than stated because of the way in which LEAs have been 
topslicing their education budgets, prior to determining the budget on which the delegation was based. 
Before we discuss the clause, it is essential to know exactly what the Government propose will form 
part of those delegated budgets and the basis of the calculation. We need to debate the issue because of 
the problems with topslicing in LEAs. That is essential, and I hope that the Minister will take on 
board the constructive points about the need to see the detail, so that we can have a proper, full debate 
on the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I reassure the hon. Lady? Having served on the longest running 
Committees in modern history—those considering the Telecommunications Bills in 1982 and 1983—
I can tell her that service on a Standing Committee does not take over your life; it just seems that way 
at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I must tell the hon. Member for Maidenhead 
that my hon. Friend the Member for Bath always issues dire warnings about everything. One of the 
dire warnings that he gave me before the Committee was to be brief, and not to repeat what other 
members of the Committee have said. I shall try to do that.
<P>
As a new member of a Committee, it is interesting to see how things shake out early on. It is 
interesting that the right hon. Member for Charnwood and other Conservative members—especially 
the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West—have emphasised one side of the education system, 
which is the privilege of the few. The Bill will deal with young people—children have not yet been 
mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> In my remarks, I made specific reference to one school—the Ashton-on-Mersey 
school, a grant-maintained secondary school in my constituency that draws half of its catchment from 
a Manchester overspill estate with considerable social deprivation. It is certainly not a school for the 
privileged few, and yet within a selective system in the borough of Trafford that achieves the best A-
level results in the country, the pupils of that school are achieving very good GCSE results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for that intervention; I refer the hon. Gentleman to the comments made 
by the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) on Second Reading. The hon. Gentleman 
spoke about the effects of grammar schools in Kent and how secondary modern schools there are 
producing results at the other end of the scale. However, this is not the time for that debate.
<P>
We Liberal Democrat members of the Committee are concerned to ensure that the Bill is 
inclusive. It is greatly to be regretted that it makes no specific reference to children with special 
educational needs. Some schools have significant numbers of children with special educational needs 
and children with behavioural difficulties who represent a real challenge to the teaching profession in 
relation to raising standards.
<P>
We intend to table a new clause to ensure that children with special educational needs are not an 
added extra but are included by local education authorities. It should be a duty for each local 
education authority to include such children. It may be that that is already provided by current 
legislation—the Minister has said previously that he believes that current legislation is more than 
adequate to deal with the issue. However, when we come to talk about grammar schools, I would be 
interested to find out how many children who are statemented for behavioural difficulties attend 
grammar schools. I think that we will find that few of them do. We intend to ensure that all children 
have access to all schools, not just the few.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Many points have been raised by members of the Committee about the sittings 
motion. I take the points that have been made. We will try to give as much notice as possible, but this 
is a matter for the usual channels to agree. We will have a guide to when we will have to sit on 
Thursday afternoons when we have a firm date for the Bill to be reported to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I understand the points that the Minister makes. There will, of course, need to be 
discussions through the usual channels, but I assure him that the official Opposition will try to ensure 
that the Government have their Bill in a reasonable time scale, subject to proper consideration in 
Committee.
<P>
I must press the Minister on the proposition that the Committee will conduct its business on the 
understanding that the Government give as much notice as possible of Thursday afternoon sittings. I 
do not think that that is sufficient. The Committee is entitled to have an undertaking from the 
Government that when it meets on a Thursday morning, it will already know whether it will meet 
again in the afternoon. That means that the Government must make their intentions clear on the 
Tuesday. That is for the convenience of not just members of the Committee, but the staff and the 
Minister’s officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was coming to exactly that point. When we know when the Committee’s 
proceedings are to be concluded, we will be able to give such an undertaking. It will usually be our 
practice on a Tuesday evening to give a clear indication, through the usual channels, of whether we 
think that the Committee needs to meet on a Thursday afternoon. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> May I press the Minister further? I think that he has conceded the point, for which I 
am grateful. Will he or the Government Whip say on the record, before the Committee rises on a 
Tuesday, whether the Committee is to meet on the following Thursday afternoon?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As I said to the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee, I am prepared to give such 
an undertaking when we have a clear agreement, reached through the usual channels, on the 
completion of the Committee’s proceedings. If it is helpful, we can put such notification on the record. 
I am not sure how that will be done, but I am happy to do it by correspondence or by whatever means 
the right hon. Gentleman regards as appropriate. Perhaps we could discuss that outside the 
Committee.
<P>
Both the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and the hon. Member for Maidenhead 
mentioned financial arrangements. I understand their concerns, and I shall say something later about 
how we hope to deal in Committee with local management of schools and delegated budget 
arrangements. As to finances and the role of the Department for the Environment, Transport and the 
Regions, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, as a result of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer's Budget statement on 2 July, an extra £835 million will go into the schools budget in 
April.
<P>
I am pleased to be able to tell the Committee that additional resources will be made available 
from April of this year. We are writing today to LEAs in England to notify them that an extra £125 
million will be made available in the financial year 1998-99 to deliver the Government’s pledge on a 
pre-school place for every four-year-old from this September. That money will be made available 
through specific grants, which is good news for local authorities as it will not count against their 
capping limit, which has already been laid down and is part of the provisional local government 
settlement. Today, we are notifying LEAs in England of the additional £125 million; we will inform 
those authorities, probably in February, of exactly how that money is to be distributed between them.
<P>
That is a clear demonstration of the Government’s commitment to invest in our children and to 
ensure that they have the best possible start to their school life. The way in which we shall achieve 
that is by having comprehensive, pre-school provision. From this September, every four-year-old child 
in England whose parents want it will have a place that will have been provided by the additional 
£125 million that we are making available today.
<P>
Incidentally, the money was freed up by the abolition of the nursery voucher scheme that failed 
to provide additional places—as the Select Committee discovered. We shall be diverting that money 
away from bureaucracy and away from the profit made by the company that operated the scheme. It 
will be used to ensure that we can guarantee a pre-school place for every four-year-old.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister clarify how the money will be distributed? As the Minister for the 
Local Government and Housing said in discussions on the local authority settlement, it will be given 
out in response to bids from local education authorities. The hon. Gentleman says that the money will 
provide a place at a nursery school for all four-year-olds whose parents want it. Those two statements 
may not be compatible. If it were to be an LEA bid, would there be a system by which the DFEE 
would determine which LEAs would receive money and which would not? If so, it will not necessarily 
be able to offer opportunities for every four-year-old whose parents want a place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am more than pleased to clarify the position. It is not a bidding round in the sense 
that people will be competing against each other. We have asked each local education authority to 
submit a plan to ensure that there will be a place for every four-year-old. The way in which we judge 
such plans will be based on the quality of places being made available by the local education 
authorities. Provided that they meet the quality assurance points and can demonstrate that the private 
sector has also been involved, the funding will be made available to deliver on that guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister knows that the expansion of pre-school places is not a matter that 
divides the parties. It expanded substantially under the previous Government and I am pleased to 
welcome the Labour Government’s commitment to our policy. Can he clarify whether the £125 
million that, when he first announced it, sounded as though it was extra money, is in fact money that 
was previously allocated to deliver exactly the same objective through the voucher scheme? Can he 
confirm that the announcement means that all that the Government have done is to take money that 
was allocated to the expansion of pre-school places and allocate to the expansion of pre-school places?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Rather than relying on the vagaries of the market to deliver a place for every four-
year-old—which was not the case because we did not have a place for every four-year-old last 
September—I can confirm that in September of this year there will be a place for every four-year-old. 
The Government are ensuring that public money is used in the most efficient and cost-effective way, 
as well as meeting the quality assurance points to which I referred earlier.
<P>
The arrangement will allow every local education authority to bring forward its early years 
development plan and will ensure that we can guarantee a place for every four-year-old from 
September. The previous Government were unable to do that, even though in 1972 the then Secretary 
of State for Education—now Baroness Thatcher—committed the Conservative Government to a pre-
school place for every child whose parents wanted it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sure that the Minister’s last comments mean that he disagrees with the 
previous Government over the machinery for the delivery of the objective of expansion of pre-school 
places, but that the money is the same money. No extra money will be going from the Treasury to the 
Department for Education and Employment. It is money that has been withdrawn from the provision 
of pre-school places through the voucher scheme to expand the money provided under the Minister’s 
chosen method. It is a matter of method rather than money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The additional £125 million is money that local education authorities—before today’s 
letter goes out—were unaware that they would receive. It will be new money that has not previously 
been notified to local education authorities. When authorities receive that additional support, which 
will not count against their capping limits, it will be given a broad welcome in constituencies 
throughout the country. Whether it be in Charnwood, Maidenhead or Bath, in every constituency in 
England—for the first time—every four-year-old whose parents want it will, from this September, be 
guaranteed a place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I think that the Minister is right that his announcement will be welcomed 
throughout the country. Whether it is existing money that is being recycled or whether it is new 
money, the fact that it may more appropriately be used as many of us want will certainly be welcomed.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that, in the notification to be sent to LEAs, an instruction will be 
given that they should use the money to ensure high-quality LEA provision and not predominantly to 
expand the number of children in already overcrowded reception classes? Does he acknowledge that 
although the additional revenue is welcome, many local education authorities have an additional 
problem—if they do not have the additional capital funds, they will be unable to make available the 
places that they desperately want to provide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on both points. The Under-Secretary, my hon. 
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris), has the pleasant task of going through all 
those early year development plans. She informs me that as she does so she will closely scrutinise the 
possible misuse of reception classes. There is no question of reception classes being allowed to expand 
to accommodate the additional children who will have a place provided for them as a result of today’s 
announcement.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that in the Budget statement on 2 July 1997, my right hon. 
Friend the Chancellor announced that slightly more than £1 billion capital would be made available 
under the new deal for schools. Another round of applications under the new deal finished last Friday, 
16 January. We intend to announce the successful applications in March. It will come as no surprise if 
we find that a number of successful applications are linked to nursery provision.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Have all LEAs now submitted their plans to the Department?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayers:</B> I am being briefed extremely well by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. She may 
want to intervene and give us the information.
<P>
I understand that the plans are still being submitted. A useful dialogue has taken place between 
the Department and the authorities to ensure that the plans meet the quality that all hon. Members 
seek. When that is in place we can release the funding, but we must ensure that the plans meed the 
quality assurance points before the funding is made available. I hope that that answers the questions 
raised by the hon. Member for Bath about the financial arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Nothing to do with the Bill!
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am seizing every opportunity.
<P>
I was asked about providing members of the Committee with as much information as possible 
about the regulations. I take the point and I do not want to hide behind a veil of secrecy about exactly 
what the Bill will achieve. I can say today that what I publish may not be in the form of detailed legal 
regulations, but we shall be able to give hon. Members a clear idea of the principles that underpin our 
thinking in a number of the key areas raised today.
<P>
I am aware of the concern that exists about grammar school ballots. I have received deputations 
from hon. Members on both sides about ballots on the future of the selective system being conducted 
in a fair and reasonable way. The position referred to by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, 
West was also discussed, but with a different emphasis, by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford 
and Urmston. Clearly, people will hold opposing views on the best way forward, but we seek—and 
through the regulations on grammar school ballots, we shall achieve it—that the decision should rest 
with parents who have an interest and that the ballots should be conducted so that neither side is in an 
unfair position or feels intimidated. Under those regulations, we shall introduce requirements on 
funding arrangements and, for example, on whether local education authorities can use public money 
to argue for one side or the other. We believe that it is inappropriate for LEAs to use public money in 
that way. They should be impartial; they should not be able to provide information in favour of one 
side or the other.
<P>
We should be able to provide members of the Committee with details by the sitting before the 
relevant debate on grammar school ballots. We intend to do the same with the framework for 
delegated budgets and the new regime for local management of schools. Again, concern has been 
expressed about how to provide more delegation for individual schools. During the next couple of 
weeks, we shall issue a further consultation document that will expose the Government’s thinking on 
delegation. Obviously, Members will have—and be aware of—that document when we debate the 
relevant part of the Bill. We shall also provide full details about school organisation, to which the 
hon. Member for Maidenhead has referred.
<P>
Clause 75 on the code of practice for admissions is slightly different. Under clause 76, we 
propose a discrete parliamentary procedure for the adoption of the code of practice and, therefore, the 
House will have an opportunity to agree or disagree with that code. That will provide an opportunity 
for detailed scrutiny of the code for admissions. All Members will have an opportunity to debate and 
vote on that proposal. That will produce the safeguards to which the hon. Member for Charnwood 
referred.
<P>
There is a difficulty with the LEA code of practice; there is no peg in the Bill on which to hang 
it. However, Opposition Members might table a new clause that provides such a peg. I have no 
problem with providing our early thinking on the LEA code, although it is early thinking. We want to 
consult widely on what is an appropriate code of practice for LEAs because there are many sides to 
the argument. Opposition Members have referred to the arguments that LEAs have put forward. We 
know that individual schools are worried about the misuse of new powers. We must therefore strike 
the right balance. There will be proper consultation to ensure that we produce a code of practice that 
reasonable people would regard an acceptable way forward. We shall consult widely to get the code 
right. 
<P>
I hope that I have reassured hon. Members about the matters that have been referred to in this 
debate. We intend to put before the committee papers on the details of grammar school ballots, school 
organisation and delegation of budgets, so that it can be aware of the Government’s thinking on those 
matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred to the Audit Commission’s views on the 
role of LEAs. Perhaps the commission is not reflecting the Government’s view. The commission has a 
particular view of what the responsibilities of LEAs should be, and how they should discharge them. 
The commission’s view does not always coincide with that of the Government. That is appropriate; 
we do not have a problem with it. It should not be assumed that the commission’s views are those of 
the Government.
<P>
On Friday, the Audit Commission will publish a document entitled “Changing Partners”, in 
which it refers to its view of the role of education authorities. A number of recommendations 
contained in that report may not reflect the Government’s views. I say that to draw an important 
distinction between the Government’s position and that of the Audit Commission.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton raised an important point about the invitation to 
submit applications for education action zones. I am informed that the convention is that when a Bill 
has had its Second Reading, information can be circulated to interested parties. The education action 
zones that are to be established from this September will be set up voluntarily. They will not have 
statutory underpinning unless the Bill reaches the stature book in July. People are aware from the 
bidding guidance that they will not have the range of statutory powers that an education action zone 
will have from September 1999. However, we feel that it is worthwhile establishing some zones on a 
voluntary basis from this September. They will have powers, for example, to disapply the national 
curriculum because that is dealt with in other legislation that is already on the statute book, but they 
will not have the power to disapply teachers’ pay and conditions because that measure is contained in 
this Bill.
<P>
We expect the first five education action zones to begin on a voluntary basis from this 
September, as it would be valuable to have some up and running. When the number is rolled out to 
the full 25 next year, they will have the full statutory powers contained in the Bill, if it is enacted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> May I press the Minister? He said that the action zones established this September 
will not have statutory powers unless the Bill is passed. He then went on to imply that they will not 
have the powers anyway. Will he clarify the position? Assuming the Bill is passed by the end of the 
summer, is it the Government’s intention that the education action zones established in September 
should begin with statutory powers or will they only click in for the second round?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Our view is that, in practical terms, it will be unlikely that we shall be able to give 
the full range of statutory powers to education action zones with effect from this September. On the 
best possible progress that the Bill can make we may be talking about Royal Assent in June or July. 
Education action zones will be established in September on the basis of the powers that are available 
at present. In practice, it would be very difficult for EAZs to exercise from September all the statutory 
powers that they may eventually have. The Government have seen the EAZ initiative as rolling 
forward, building up and devolving, so that although the first five may not exercise those powers, the 
subsequent 20 coming on stream later in 1999 will have the full range of powers. In law, they may 
well have the powers, but in practice, it is unlikely that they will feel able to exercise the powers that 
the House will probably give them in July—a few months before they start operating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I was looking at the commencement provisions of the Bill. I think that it would be 
within the Government’s power to bring the EAZs’ provisions into effect before September, if they so 
chose. Is the Minister saying that they will not do so and, for good order, EAZs will be without 
statutory powers in the first year but will have them thereafter? Is that the Government’s position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When we meet those involved in the five EAZs that we regard as being the front-
runners to start in September, we may discuss the powers that they feel are appropriate. If they are 
planning certain action that requires statutory provision, we may be prepared to trigger that with 
effect from July. We need to wait and see and consider the proposals as they come forward. It is an 
important initiative and we want to ensure that we get it right. If we have to hold back a couple of 
months or until next year, we are prepared to do that to ensure that the education action zone 
initiative gets off on the right footing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister said that it was customary after Second Reading for information to 
be sent out. Will he clarify whether there is a precedent for competitive bids to be invited with a cut-
off date that falls either during the Committee stage or on Report? Did he or did he not take advice 
from the Cabinet Office on whether that was appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As the hon. Lady has been a Minister, she will know that communications between 
Departments are not disclosed. I do not intend to break with that today and create a precedent. The 
hon. Lady never did; neither did the right hon. Member for Charnwood. I do not intend to break that 
well-established convention.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to allay hon. Members’ fears about details being made available to 
the Committee as we reach relevant parts of the Bill. I hope that the Committee will give the Bill the 
detailed scrutiny that it deserves. It is an important measure; it is one of the Government’s flagship 
Bills. The sooner we can get it on the statute book, the sooner we can improve standards in schools 
and provide the quality of education that children and parents are crying out for. We shall then have 
done a service for the people of our country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I wish briefly to respond. First, I am grateful—I am sure that all members of the 
Committee are glad—for the Minister’s undertaking that Thursday afternoon sittings will not be 
sprung upon us.
<P>
Secondly, the Committee will have enjoyed the new Labour press release on the alleged funding 
of pre-school places. That money has always been available. Indeed, it was allocated under the 
principle established by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he said that the Government would 
operate largely within the budgets that they inherited from their predecessors. Those budgets were 
allocated for exactly that purpose by the Government’s predecessors and I enjoyed the relabelling—
the new ''early years” initiative that was announced this morning. It was classic new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has announced his absolute confidence in the 
Minister’s assurances. Perhaps he has a secret understanding with the Minister and can tell the 
Committee whether we shall be sitting this coming Thursday afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has given an undertaking that it will be announced before the rising of 
the Committee on Thursday morning whether we are to sit on Thursday afternoon. We therefore have 
50 minutes to wait. However, I believe that we shall meet on Thursday morning and then on Tuesday, 
but not on Thursday afternoon. It would be a record-breaking, pledge-breaking process for the 
Minister to have offered his best endeavours an hour ago and to announce later the same morning that 
we would meet again on Thursday afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> For the record—and I think that the record will show this—my comments were 
subject to an important condition, namely agreement between the usual channels about when the 
Committee stage would be concluded; but no such agreement has been reached. When it has been 
reached, notification of Thursday afternoon sittings will be given on Tuesdays.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. Perhaps he is in a better position 
than I am to given the hon. Member for Bath the answer that he seeks. It would clearly be a breaking 
of faith if, in present circumstances, the Committee were to meet this Thursday afternoon.
<P>
The more serious point relates to what the Minister had to say on the code of practice on 
admissions. He is quite right that clause 76 provides for a specific parliamentary acceptance of the 
code of practice. I accept that absolutely, but it does not alter the fact that there are other major 
provisions in the Bill involving admissions, such as who is responsible for them, which are the 
admissions authorities for individual schools, how the admissions policy should operate between 
schools and LEAs—and ultimately, in this new, highly centralist, interventionist world, presumably 
the Secretary of State himself. With respect, the proposition that the admissions code of practice can 
wait for later parliamentary approval under the terms of clause 76 does not work.
<P>
The code of practice under clause 75 is a key part of the Bill’s effect on the delivery of the 
schools service. I am not asking the Minister to change what he said earlier, but to reflect on it. Even 
if we cannot have a draft of each aspect of the code of practice before we reach clause 75, I hope that 
we can receive an outline of the sort of issues that he intends the code to cover and the direction in 
which he intends it to travel.
<P>
It would be perverse if the Committee were offered, as it has been, the outline of a code of 
practice that is not provided for in the Bill and were denied an outline of the code of practice that is 
provided for in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will reflect on what he said about that.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for what he said about the purpose of the regulations covering 
grammar schools, schools’ organisation plans and financial delegation, all of which will have been 
welcomed by the Committee. I hope that he will consider the same principles in relation to the 
regulations covered byclause 21, which determine the establishment of foundations and what they 
should look like—a matter that will certainly be of value to the Committee. I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will similarly consider clause 37, which seeks to define the powers of governing bodies.
<P>
Clause 35 introduces a host of schedules which determine the outline of the powers of governing 
bodies; clause 37 provides that the Secretary of State has power to set out the terms of reference for 
governing bodies and to define the respective roles and responsibilities of the governing bodies and 
head teachers. A range of specific powers will be provided for in regulation and, to make sense of that 
clause, we need to know the outline of those regulations before we debate them. I hope that the 
Minister can give a similar undertaking about that.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also reflect further on what he said about the non-statutory 
code of practice governing the role of LEAs. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton, 
the hon. Member for Bath and I have stressed the importance of the code of practice to our having a 
proper understanding of the Bill. The Minister’s response was that there was no peg in the Bill on 
which to hang the matter so that it could be discussed. The hon. Member for Bath has already made it 
clear that he intends to provide such a peg and the first question for the Government will be whether 
they intend to take up the proposition that the code of practice should be rooted within the Bill. If they 
do not, how do they intend the code to be enforced?
<P>
I repeat my earlier question: does the Minister intend the code of practice simply to be a 
statement of the Secretary of State’s opinions? If he does, any court must look at the statute, not just a 
circular sent round by the Secretary of State in which he expresses his opinion. What do the 
Government intend the nature of the relationship to be between the code of practice on the role of an 
LEA and the Bill? The Minister seemed to be saying that there is no peg in the Bill, so the matter is 
irrelevant. It is not irrelevant to the Bill, a major purpose of which is redefining the balance of power 
within the schools system. The Government should think again about having a code of practice that 
elucidates their thinking on the subject and divorcing it completely from the Bill. 
<P>
When he said that there was no peg in the Bill on which to hang a discussion of the subject, the 
Minister was not arguing in favour of not publishing a code of practice, but highlighting exactly why 
it must be published and linked to the Bill. I hope that he will urgently consider the matter, not least 
because he will have to respond to the Liberal Democrat amendment. As I made clear earlier, I have 
no difficulty with the sittings motions and I am happy for the Committee to accept it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 1<w1></center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to set limits on infant class sizes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 1, line 10, leave out from ‘impose’ to end 
of line and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘on local education authorities a statutory duty to offer to all infant children resident within 
their area a place in a maintained school in a class of a maximum size prescribed within the 
regulations.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first amendment for the Committee to consider relates to one of the Government’s election 
pledges: that children aged five, six or seven in a maintained school should not find themselves in a 
class of more than 30. I do not intend to challenge the proposition that the Government put that policy 
to the electorate and have not merely a mandate but an obligation to govern in accordance with their 
election manifesto. The purpose of the amendment is not to undermine or challenge the nature of the 
Governments mandate; indeed, it is intended to respect the essence of that mandate, but in a way that 
addresses some of the problems that the practical application of the policy is likely to produce for 
families, schools and local education authorities.
<P>
There is an obligation on Members of Parliament of all parties to respect the electorate’s recent 
decision, but, at the same time, we must not regard ourselves as absolved from the need to consider 
some of the practical difficulties that that decision may raise. We do not contend—and nor did the 
previous Government—that class size, for infant classes, in particular, is wholly irrelevant. It is 
clearly true that some research evidence links later educational attainment to class size in the infant 
age group. We should not really need elaborate research to substantiate the proposition that, all other 
things being equal, most people prefer their children to be educated in smaller rather than larger 
classes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman say, so that it is absolutely clear and on the 
record, that on behalf of his party he now contradicts the view of the former Under-Secretary of State 
for Education, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), who said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“there is no proven casual connection between class size and educational output.”—[Official 
Report, 13 December 1994; Vol. 251, c. 767.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that that was incorrect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> What I am saying is that it has never been part of our case that class size is 
irrelevant. That is very different from saying that there is an automatic determination between class 
size and educational attainment. A slightly larger class with children from a more privileged 
background and a better teacher is likely to result in higher educational attainment than a slightly 
smaller class with more difficult children and a less able teacher. There is no automatic determination 
between class size and educational attainment.
<H4><center>[Sir David Madel in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
However, there is some evidence that class size has a strong influence on educational attainment 
for children aged five to seven. We shall not support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for 
Bath, which would apply the Government’s policy not just to infant classes but to junior classes, 
because the research evidence focuses on infant class sizes. The Government are right to concentrate 
their class size policy on the infant age group, whereas the hon. Member for Bath is wrong.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath sought clarification of our view; I am trying to set it out, as it lies 
behind the amendment. I recognise that class size is relevant, but it is not the only consideration in 
deciding how a particular child’s needs should be met in a particular school. Other issues should 
properly be addressed in determining admissions policy for infant classes, especially parental choice.
<P>
I do not believe it sensible that, in encouraging smaller infant class sizes, a statement of public 
policy should trump any expression of parental preference or practical application on the ground. The 
Government have elevated a desirable and important influence on educational outcome in infant 
classes to an absolute that must be taken by admissions authorities in all cases to be more important 
than other factors that could influence a rational decision on a particular child in a particular set of 
circumstances.
<P>
That is the central problem with the clause. The Minister may want to correct me but, as I 
understand the clause, the intention is to create a legal framework within which no infant class can in 
any circumstances be planned to include more than 30 children. That is regarded as the principal 
determinant of policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): It is a privilege to witness the apparent conversion this morning of 
the right hon. Member for Charnwood on class sizes. He refers to the desirability of having no more 
than 30 children in a class, but was that one of the aims of the Conservative Government? If so, why 
did class sizes increase under that Government, especially in recent years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have set out clearly what I believe to be the key issues in determining policy on 
this subject. As to infant classes, if all other things are equal, I acknowledge that there is parental 
preference, which is supported by research, for a smaller rather than a larger class. In fact, there is no 
evidence identifying 30 as the magic number. The real world is surely more complex, and we should 
not imagine that class size is the only policy consideration—
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Member for Waveney before I come to the Minister. The 
real world is more complex; class size is not the single determinant. There is a linkage, but there is no 
automatic determination. A privileged class with an able teacher is likely to do better than a slightly 
larger class with less able children and a less able teacher. Simply to say that the priority in all 
circumstances is to attain a specific number is, as I said, to elevate into an absolute one determinant in 
a desirable admissions policy. That is a grotesque oversimplification of what is desirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be in trouble with his hon. Friend the Minister if I allow 
him to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We very much welcome the conversion of the Conservative party to our view that 
class size makes a difference. Does the right hon. Gentleman now regret the fact that he was a 
member of a Cabinet that consistently, year in and year out, denied that class size made a difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With great respect to the Minister, the previous Conservative Secretary of State, my 
right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard), consistently argued that class 
size was relevant, but not absolute. That is precisely the argument that I am making now. If the 
Minister wants to build bridges, perhaps I can invite him to come a little further across the bridge. My 
proposition is that class size is a relevant influence, but not the only one. Another factor that a 
sensible admissions policy should take into account is the parental view about what represents the best 
educational interests of a child, given the family circumstances and the school organisation in a 
particular locality.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the previous Secretary of State consistently argued, parents and families 
can select a school as a first preference for the education of their infant child, but the public policy 
under clause 1 may prevent that school from accepting the child. Families’ experience of Government 
policy will be that they will be denied their first choice, despite the fact that the school may agree with 
the parents that it can best meet the needs of the child. The LEA will allocate the child to a different 
school, which, from the family’s point of view, will be an inferior choice.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I am a former Treasury Minister, and I remember arguing that one of the problems for the 
education service was that 17 per cent. of school places were unfilled and asking how we could expect 
more school places when there were unfilled places. The clear implication of Government policy is 
that LEAs, which have always been, and always will be, under financial pressure, will allocate a child 
to an existing place in a school that is the family’s second or third choice. That is despite the fact that 
the professional opinion of the head teacher and teaching staff of the family’s first choice of school is 
that their school can best meet the child’s needs.
<P>
That first choice can arise for many reasons, which is why I included a number of motivational 
issues in the amendments that I tabled. Parents may prefer their child to be educated in a 
denominational school, but the LEA may think that there is a more appropriate place in a non-
denominational school. Is that or is that not a legitimate exercise of parental choice? It could arise 
because the child is being allocated by the local education authority to a school which is further 
away—in the next village—than to one that represents the first choice of the parents, the child and 
the teachers.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Obviously, that issue is likely to arise in rural areas. Are parents wrong to have preferences 
about denominational and non-denominational education? They are legitimate choices for parents. 
But the Government say that another principle should be more important than the one that the family 
itself believes is important. The question is whether the public policy of fixing absolutely on the 
number 30 should be regarded as more important in determining to which school an individual child 
goes than the private policy preferences of an individual family. Which is more important?
<P>
The amendment would reconcile my desire to see parental preference accorded its proper role 
with the Government’s undoubted election commitment. The LEA should be subject to a statutory 
duty to offer a place in a class of, say, fewer than 30—I have not sought to determine the number 30 
because the Government have not done so in the Bill. As I said earlier, it is an example of the 
Government making policy by regulation. Labour Back Benchers may wish to observe that there is a 
political commitment to the number 30, but there is no legal commitment to it in the Bill. Whatever 
the Government want to deliver in terms of an absolute limit in class size, is it sensible to say that that 
is always more important than parental choice, local circumstance and local preference? Would it not 
be more sensible to say that the statutory authorities are under an obligation to offer a place in a class 
of below whatever number the Government determine because of an election commitment, but to 
leave the ultimate decision to parents and admission authorities for schools, as happens at present?
<P>
We all know that it is not purely a matter of parental choice. In the current system, there is an 
element of parental preference and the admission authority reconciles those choices for infant schools 
in most cases without reference to an appeals structure. Why cannot we leave those authorities to 
make the ultimate decision? The Government can deliver their political commitment by requiring the 
local authorities to offer to each child in the infant age range a place in a class of fewer than 30. That 
would be a far more effective way of reconciling the Government’s political commitment with the 
other commitments that they should have to choice and flexibility.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> 
Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify the purpose of his amendment? He has just referred to the local 
authority’s obligation to offer places to children and it is possible to see the amendment as a desire by 
the right hon. Gentleman to reverse the Greenwich judgment. A local authority would give preference 
to children within the area, rather than using another criterion allowing children to cross the border. I 
suspect that that was not the right hon. Gentleman’s intention, given that the Conservative party gave 
no inkling of that when it was in government. We have already seen one reversal of a Conservative 
policy and I should like him to clarify the exact intention of his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I can give the Under-Secretary the clear assurance that I have not the slightest 
intention of supporting a reversal of the Greenwich judgment and I do not see how the terms of my 
amendment could be taken as such. If the Under-Secretary has legal advice to that effect, I defer to it. 
I hope that she is willing to accept the principle that I described to the Committee. Having been a 
Minister myself for long enough, I know that a parliamentary draftsman will never accept a draft 
offered by anyone else. Even if the draft were perfect and the best possible way in which to deliver the 
policy objective, I have no doubt that we would receive a different draft to maintain a principle that is 
important to the parliamentary draftsman—if to no one else.
<P>
A more flexible way in which to deliver the maximum class size commitment to an individual 
family to to make the offer to the family, but to leave the family and the admissions authority of the 
school to be the ultimate determinant of whether that offer is in the best interests of an individual 
child.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Having been a chairman of an education committee, I 
am interested in the way in which the right hon. Gentleman approaches the issue of practicalities. If 
the decision to increase the class size to 31 is eventually made by others, can he explain what will 
happen to the rest of the children in the class whose parents then return to the LEA and say that they 
want the promise of their children being educated in a class of 30 or fewer to be met? Such a situation 
does not sound practical. I should be interested to know how the right hon. Gentleman thought that 
such a measure could be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I put the question straight back to him, 
and invite him to think of a better way in which to put the interests and preferences of the child first 
and to deliver a political commitment that is reconciled with the interests and choices of an individual 
child. Exactly the same argument can be put to the hon. Gentleman. Let us consider a class of 30 in a 
village school. Is it desirable for the 31st child in that village community to be denied access to the 
infant class and told that he must attend the neighbouring school? It seems barmy to me.
<P>
To pick up the spirit of French republicanism, let us consider the family that chooses a non-
denominational education because it does not want its child to attend a Church school. That would not 
be my preference, but I accept that it might be the preference of other parents. The LEA says that a 
child cannot attend a non-Church school, and that children must attend a Church school, because it is 
the only place where the LEA can deliver the absolute of a maximum class of 30.
<P>
If the parents made a different  judgment about what is important to them and the education of 
their children, it would be inconsistent with a huge amount of the Government’s rhetoric and clause 
77, which deals with parental preferences, for the Government to elevate the political commitment of 
a class size of 30 above the specific choice of the child’s parents and the professional judgment of the 
teachers who were employed in the school that the parents chose. Which do the Government believe 
should be the prime determinant of admissions policy? Should it be the political commitment that was 
argued out on the hustings, or should it be the choice of the parents and the professional judgment of 
the teachers? I cast my vote with the professional judgment of the teachers and the choice of the 
parents. If my child’s education were at stake, I would be more interested in such matters than I would 
in the Government’s political commitment. I accept, however, that the Government have made that 
political commitment. The amendment is an attempt to reconcile the primacy of the child’s interest 
with the public policy commitment that the Government gave at the election.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall give way to the Liberal Democrat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If the regulations state that the maximum size is 30, how would the amendment 
help?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If the authority is obliged to offer a place within that maximum, under the 
Government’s policy a child may be offered a place in the school to which that policy would allocate 
him, but his parents may say, “Thank you, but I prefer the school of my first choice, and that school’s 
admissions authority is prepared to accept my child.”
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): If I understand the right hon. Gentleman correctly, an 
authority would have an obligation to offer each child a place in a class of under 30. What would 
happen to that promise if there were already 30 children in a class and another parent opted to bring a 
child to that class, having turned down a place elsewhere? What would happen to the promised places 
for the 30 children already there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I understand the question; it was asked by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk 
(Dr. Turner), and I responded by saying that the Committee has to chose between the perspective of 
the children and parents and the political absolute that an infant’s education cannot be as well 
delivered in a class of more than 30 children as it can in a class of fewer than 30 children. The 
Government are taking a relevant principle and saying that, in all circumstances, it must determine 
the answer. That is where they are wrong. 
<P>
I am moving the amendment to allow the Government to deliver the policy to those families who 
share their belief that the principle is the only thing that matters. The vast majority of parents will 
regard the principle as relevant, but not the only factor. In making their choice, they will balance that 
principle with a number of other factors, of which I have mentioned only two. If parents believe that 
that is the only factor that matters, they will have the assurance in statute that their choice can be 
honoured. Experience shows that the vast majority of parents would not regard it as an absolute 
choice, but would treat it as one of several relevant considerations.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I should like to add to what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Charnwood. I think that I can assist those Labour Members who challenged the amendment. The 
Government have introduced clause 1 to honour an important election pledge to limit class sizes for 
five, six and seven-year-olds to 30. I do not know why they plucked that magic figure of 30 out of the 
air when a lot of evidence shows that 24 would have been a much more sustainable number—
[Interruption.] Twenty four would have been much more sustainable if it was backed with 
evidence, but there is nothing magic about 30. Having committed themselves so vocally and in such 
terms at the general election, the Government now face the problem of delivering that promise.
<P>
We challenge the Government because otherwise LEAs will be so tied by statute that they will 
not be able to take account of two additional factors—parental preference, as identified by my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, and being able to take account of teaching standards and 
expertise. Those factors, too, determine what is delivered in classes, regardless of whether class size is 
just above or just below that artificial number of 30.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We seek, through the amendment, an acceptance from the Government that—as my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Charnwood rightly pointed out, this is extremely relevant in rural primary 
schools—if they are to honour their election commitment equitably to all parents, they must provide 
for an additional classroom and an additional teacher for existing local village primary schools. 
Labour Members are shaking their heads, but I shall quote the words of the Minister. On 22 May, he 
responded in a written answer to the question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on 
the number of additional places in the state sector that will be required as a result of ending the 
assisted places scheme.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We received our first insight into how the Government intend to honour their commitment of 
imposing a maximum number of 30 children in an infant class. The Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“There are 800,000 empty places within existing LEA provision so there is ample scope 
available to accommodate the 10,000 or so pupils who would otherwise have entered the assisted 
places scheme each year.”—[Official Report, 22 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 123.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Bearing in mind that the assisted places scheme had been extended from the secondary to the 
primary age group, it is clear that what the Government have in mind in order to honour their election 
commitment is filling empty spaces.
<P>
If the Government intend to honour their commitment equitably, taking into account parental 
preference for schools—whether because they are denominational schools or because of their 
locality—they must put money behind that pledge to provide the extra classroom or the extra teacher, 
or sometimes both, for those schools. LEAs will be required to consider such matters when a lot of 
parents want to send their children to a popular, well-thought-of local primary school.
<P>
We would love to hear the Minister’s explanation as to why the magic number 30 does not 
appear in the Bill. If LEAs are obliged by statute to carry out the provisions of clause 1 as drafted to 
the letter, there will be no flexibility, nor will there be any obligation to provide an extra class or an 
extra teacher in order to accommodate the needs of people locally. The amendment was prompted by 
concern about filling empty places, which in rural areas sometimes means moving children great 
distances, in order to honour the Government’s pledge. The Government should take account of the 
rights and preferences of parents.
<P>
In response to the White Paper last year, the National Governors Council said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Unless the law is changed in a number of areas, smaller class sizes will not become a reality. 
Our concerns relate to standard numbers (many schools have a standard number of more that 30 or a 
multiple thereof); and appeals against refusal of admission. While we welcome the proposal in the 
technical paper which will enable appeal committees to refuse an appeal if it will result in class sizes 
over 30, this may give rise to a difficulty, particularly in rural areas, where young children moving 
into the area may be refused a place at their local school and have to suffer long journeys.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is concern about the definition of class size”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is still concern about that definition because, despite their election promise, the 
Government have not written it into the Bill. The NGC continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Many responses have suggested that the issue should be approached on the basis of 
pupil/teacher ratios rather than set class sizes.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is what the Government have in mind—jiggling in the background with other factors—it 
would be helpful for the Committee to know that that is how they wish to fulfil that election pledge. 
Parents, especially those in rural areas, are concerned that LEAs will not have the necessary resources 
and that, because of a statutory obligation under the Bill, LEAs will simply hold up their hands and 
say, “Sorry, we can do nothing about it; we are obliged by law to offer that place”—which might be 
miles from where the child lives, in a school for which the parents expressed no preference.
<P>
On the basis of the research into whether smaller infant class sizes are good or bad, I said that 24 
pupils would be a preferable class size.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I have been doubly blessed this morning: I have heard 
the conversion of the right hon. Member for Charnwood who now too supports the figure of 30; and 
the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton now appears to be outdoing Santa Claus and supporting 
the figure of 24. I did not hear them do that when they were in government.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood implied that this was not a wrecking amendment and 
that there was an intention to respect Labour’s manifesto pledge. However, we are talking not about 
one parent exercising responsibility, but about several parents doing so. Therefore, the cumulative 
effect of the amendment would be to put inordinate pressure on LEAs.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood has mentioned that LEAs are continually under financial 
pressure. Of all the constituencies of members of the Committee, mine has the largest percentage of 
pupils in classes of more than 31. I can imagine the enormous pressure that would be put on the LEA 
in Blackpool if the amendment were agreed to.
<P>
I fully understand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton about 
the position in rural areas, but she should consider the position in urban areas where schools are hard 
pressed and where—regardless of the Opposition’s intentions—the amendment would make matters 
worse.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are supposed to be just that. The hon. Gentleman’s 
intervention was a shade long.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Research carried out by Mortimore and by Ofsted shows that, in the early years 
in certain circumstances, it is not just numbers that matter, but teaching quality. That is why my right 
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk, the former Secretary of State, rightly said that 
parents might prefer to put their children into a class of 33 rather than 29 pupils because of a 
significant difference in the results and standards of the schools in an area. The amendment would 
allow parents the flexibility to do that.
<P>
Hard and fast lines cannot be drawn.  The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) has 
an urban constituency. An appendix to the Library’s research paper 97/136, which deals with the Bill, 
shows that in many LEAs—for example, Bromley and Kingston—where class sizes are higher, 
standards are higher for children at key stage 1. Whereas, in Tower Hamlets, classes are smaller, but 
for various reasons, results are lower.
<P>
Under the Government’s proposals in clause 1, LEAs will have no flexibility and there will be 
no allowance made for the differences between schools, or between urban and rural areas. As a 
Member of Parliament representing one of the few remaining truly rural constituencies in England, 
that is of grave concern to me. Governors have told the Government that the inflexibility of the clause 
exists to fulfil a political objective, which means that dogma is dominating the wishes of parents and 
governing bodies—and, perhaps, those of LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We have much sympathy with the hon. Lady’s argument, but we do not believe that  
amendment No. 60 meets the objective. As I remarked to her right hon. Friend the Member for 
Charnwood, if the regulations required a maximum of 30 pupils per class, even a village primary 
school would have to abide by it because it would apply to the whole LEA. Despite the hon. Member 
for Blackpool, South’s comment about urban areas, the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton was 
right to draw attention to the fact that a problem does arise in rural villages, especially where there are 
multi-age key stages 1 and 2 classes.
<P>
However, despite the hon. Lady’s conversion to classes sizes of 24, which no doubt will be 
described in tomorrow’s papers as the most important feature of today’s Standing committee, she 
must recognise that, according to the House of Commons paper, there are 13,502 school classes which 
have more than 30 children. That is an appalling indictment of the education system as we approach 
the next millennium. The Government are right to attempt to tackle the central issue of ensuring that 
all children are educated in classes of reasonable size. The question of whether 24 or 30 is reasonable 
must be decided by someone, somehow. In our view, it is basically right that the Government make 
the decision and introduce legislation that ensures that children throughout the country are supported 
in that way.
<P>
There must, of course, be flexibility, as the right hon. Member for Charnwood said. Although his 
amendment fails in that objective, he is right to insist that there should be flexibility. We all agree that 
smaller classes are crucial at key stage 1. Remembering the environment in which I worked for many 
years, I know that they are the most important building block for improving educational standards. 
We are extremely pleased that that objective is a central plank of the Bill.
<P>
We also believe that small classes at key stage 1 are essential if we are to build on and profit 
from early years education. It would be nonsense to throw away that quality education as children go 
into reception classes, or large classes. Small key stage 1 classes are the best way to increase 
standards. During my time as a secondary teacher and head, I was converted to the idea that standards 
cannot rise at key stages 3 and 4 unless we deal fundamentally with what takes place in the early years 
and at key stage 1. I am delighted to support that principle.
<P>
Flexibility is crucial to a school and—I remind the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton—
perhaps even more important to a rural primary school than to a large urban one. Therefore, we 
fervently believe that we cannot address the issue of key stage 1 class sizes without considering key 
stage 2 class sizes. A primary school does not organise itself in such an arbitrary way; it looks at the 
whole of its standards relative to its deployment of staff. Children could be moved from key stage 1 to 
key stage 2 classes, to give multi-age classes; there could be classes of 33, 35 or 40 children at key 
stage 2 if a school wished to distribute its resources to meet that challenge.
<P>
We shall oppose amendment No. 60 first, because it does not achieve what it sets out to do and, 
secondly, because we do not believe fundamentally that a pledge can be made at key stage 1 without 
one also being made at key stage 2.
