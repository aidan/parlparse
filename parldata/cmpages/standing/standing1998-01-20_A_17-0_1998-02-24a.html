<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Hon. Members may remove their jackets if they so wish. As the chapter of the Bill that the Committee is about to debate is of considerable interest to all members of the Committee, I propose to allow a reasonable degree of licence in the discussion on clause 90, but that may be reflected in my clause stand part decision. It is not an invitation to hon. Members to make overlong, repetitive or out-or-order speeches.
<H4><center>Clause 90</center></H4>
<H4><center>General restriction on selection by ability or aptitude</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 66, line 40, leave out from "ability" to "any" in line 43.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 33, in clause 91, page 67, line 25, leave out "by ability or".
<P>
No. 34 in clause 91, page 67, line 27, after "continue", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"until the appropriate local education authority has, within three years of the coming into force this Act, and after consultation with relevant persons and bodies, determined the future or otherwise of such a school,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 35, in clause 96, page 70, line 18, after "arrangements", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unless the appropriate local education authority has, within three years of the coming into force of this Act, and after consultation with relevant persons and bodies, determined this issue.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall spend the majority of my speech on amendments Nos. 32 and 33. I am sure that the Committee understands the intention behind the amendments, in that they are designed to bring about the end of partial selection based on ability. Some members of the Committee may wonder why they do not refer to the ending of selection by aptitude, but subsequent amendments will provide an opportunity for us to discuss that. The Committee was delighted to hear previously from the Minister that he intends to give us a clear explanation of the distinction between aptitude and ability. We are looking forward to hearing it.
<P>
It is likely that the amendments will be strongly resisted by both the Government and the official Opposition. Although I fundamentally disagree with the official Opposition, they have long argued the importance of selection in schools and have a track record of developing it, so it will come as no surprise when they resist our proposals. The amendments may also be opposed by the Labour party not only those on the Government Front Bench, but those on the Back Benches. When in opposition, the Government spoke out frequently and strenuously against selection in schools, as I shall demonstrate, so the real surprise is the attitude of the Labour party and the Government.
<P>
In some parts of the country, as a result of the previous Government's policy, children are facing more ability tests to gain places in local schools of their choice. At chapter 7, paragraph 33, the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The use of partial selection, though limited, has led to controversy and caused parents concern in areas such as Bromley and Hertfordshire".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The White Paper was right to draw attention to the concerns of those who live in areas where there has been partial selection. Despite the general restriction against selection imposed by clause 90, the Committee will note that clause 91 will give statutory force to existing partial selection on aptitude and ability. However, should complaints be made, the adjudicator may decide to end partial selection.
<P>
The Committee knows only too well that selection does not give choice to most parents; it gives choice to only the few children who pass a selection test. Generally speaking, it is the school that selects the pupil, not the parent who selects the school. One effect of partial selection, which was introduced by the previous Government, is that when one school starts to select, its neighbours feel obliged to follow suit. That domino effect has resulted in some children having to go from one school to another, taking test after test.
<P>
I shall illustrate the problem. Parents in Wandsworth receive a document entitled "Choose a Wandsworth School". The borough of Wandsworth has 10 secondary schools two are Roman Catholic, which select by interview; another two select 50 per cent. of pupils on general ability; one selects 25 per cent. of pupils on general ability; another selects 50 per cent. of pupils on subject specialisms; one school is a city technology college, which selects 100 per cent. of its pupils; and the remaining three schools have a banding system, taking 20 per cent. of pupils from each of the five bands.
<P>
Each of the secular schools has an entrance test, and all those tests are different. All the tests take place under examination conditions and last for three hours. In the schools that select 50 per cent. of pupils, siblings account for the entire remaining intake. No places exist at those schools based on proximity. Many local children who fail the test or who have no older siblings are not within the catchment area of any other school and must therefore travel five or six miles to school Wandsworth is a large borough.
<P>
One Wandsworth parent wrote to me recently, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My daughter's junior school shares a campus with Graveney School, which selects 50 per cent. on general ability. This year, 17 pupils from that school took the test for Graveney School, and 6 got places. There are certainly 4 children living within 200 metres of the gates of Graveney School who have no place. 7 children have no offer of a place anywhere at the moment.
<P>
The situation in the junior schools is invidious. After the test results are revealed, some of the children feel humiliated; some refuse to attend school and face their friends; they lose self-confidence and self-esteem. In the terms prior to the tests perhaps a third of the year 6 pupils have private tuition; the classes are divided between oldest or only children who are full of uncertainty, and younger siblings of secondary pupils who have confidence in their future education.
[Mr. Foster]
<P>
Many of these children are 10 years of age when they take up to 7 different entrance tests. Those who do not attain a place are given a very clear message that they are failures. The system produces pressure on such young children that can only be described as abusive."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another parent from Wandsworth also wrote to me. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The last few months has been hell for everyone and continues to be so for some. My own son has got a place but I have seen him lose confidence and self-esteem in the process. His teacher reports that the whole of year 6 is very difficult because of the stress the children are under. The least able are given a very clear message that they are failures.
<P>
Partial selection has produced in Wandsworth a system that is abusive to children, a bureaucratic nightmare and which does nothing to raise standards for anyone but the ablest 10 per cent."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the system that the Bill will enable to continue. Frankly, that is appalling.
<P>
The Committee will be well aware that it was the Education Act 1988 that introduced grant-maintained schools and gave the main impetus to the extension of selection. When the Act was going through the House, the Conservative Government said that the new grant-maintained schools would not be allowed to change status for five years. As we all know, that promise was quickly abandoned.
<P>
More recently, a June 1993 circular signalled the beginning of the introduction of wider partial selection. Paragraph 47 of circular 6/93 states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Secretary of State believes that the introduction of a limited amount of selection in a secondary school involving the selection of a total of about 10 per cent. of pupils on the basis of ability or aptitude in one or more of music, art, drama and sport, will not in general lead to a significant change in character of the school as a whole."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We saw the beginning of partial selection not by legislation, but by that circular, which said that from then on, a change to selection of 10 per cent. in those areas would not be considered a significant change in the character of the school, so it could proceed on that basis.
<P>
Three years later, in June 1996 in circular 6/96, that ability to select was extended. Selection of up to 15 per cent. in any subject or combination of subjects, or by general ability, is now likely to be possible without the need to publish statutory proposals. Therefore it was through regulation, not primary legislation I stress that because it is important that more and more partial selection was introduced.
<P>
What was the Labour party's view of all of that? The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), the Government Whip, is always delighted to be quoted in Committee. As he so rarely contributes to our debates, it is useful occasionally to put his words on the record. On 27 January last year, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Real choice comes when parents can choose a good comprehensive on its merits from among several in the vicinity. That is real choice: not taking an examination and failing."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman is now going to oppose the amendments, he has obviously changed his mind about that.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), spoke eloquently about the issue of selection and partial selection in particular in the same debate. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The arguments against selection are well known and well made: it weakens parental choice and preference; it institutionalises low expectations of children; and it labels too many of our young children as failures."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"One of the problems we encountered in Committee was that the Government failed to understand that, if one school decides to select, that decision affects other schools. The legislation not only gives individual schools the right to select, but creates troublesome consequences for all the other schools in the area."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She made that point even clearer later, when she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If schools select 20 per cent. of their intake through academic selection, the same number of children may be refused the right to attend their local school." [Official Report, 27 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 92-97.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Under-Secretary opposes the amendments, she will be going back on her clear opposition to partial selection when she spoke just over a year ago.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Just a week before the general election, the Prime Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Mr. Major calls it a policy of selection. I call it a policy of rejection. Selection for the few, rejection for the many."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Several organisations involved in education feel strongly about this issue. Perhaps the most important organisation that we should take into account is the Local Government Association, which is concerned about the possibility that partial selection might remain and states that it is "to be regretted."
<P>
What are the Secretary of State's views? I have gone back over many years and read many Labour party manifestos. Until the most recent manifesto, Labour consistently made it clear that it is totally opposed to selection of any type [Interruption.] The Minister is clearly anxious that I use more up-to-date quotes from the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> What about me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister wants to know why I am not quoting him. The answer is simple he will respond to the debate 
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is replying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am disappointed; I had assumed that the Minister would respond. That is why I chose to quote what the Under-Secretary had said.
<P>
On 23 January 1996, a press report of the Second Reading debate on the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill stated that, to Labour cheers, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"That is why we are against selection, why we will remain against selection, why any debate about selection is a past agenda, a dead agenda."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know what other people have said more recently about selection. Surprisingly, in its October 1996 report to local council tax payers, even the flagship Tory borough of Westminster stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"By giving schools greater freedom to select pupils, one could be seen to be diminishing parents' rights to select schools. Consequently, the result of this could be fewer, rather than more, satisfied parents."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I said that I wanted to concentrate on the Secretary of State's views. I apologise to the Committee, but I intend to read a lengthy quotation from the Secretary of State. I hope that Labour Members will listen because it is directly relevant to the amendment. On 11 November 1996, the Secretary of State talked about the problems being faced in Bromley under the Conservative party. He began by quoting Bromley's Conservative chairman of education, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The greater the extent of selection by ability, the greater the limits on choice for all except parents of the brightest children. The opportunities available to the less able or to those who happen to live further away from the school than most will be reduced in direct proportion to the increased opportunities of more able children and their parents."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I agree with the chairman of education in Bromley. Goodness knows, he ought to know what sort of shambles he will be facing when extension of partial selection takes place. Children will be denied entry to the school that they would expect to go to.
<P>
I have a letter from a mother in Croydon who explains that she took her daughter to an open day at the school of her choice a week or two ago. The child's primary school has fed into that secondary school for many years. They looked forward to her going there with her older siblings and with the children she'd played with when growing up. When they arrived, they were handed a pamphlet, and they suddenly discovered that the school intended to select 15 per cent. of its pupils."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mother said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The bombshell fell when we sat down to listen to the head teacher's speech and had an opportunity to look at the Edenham brochure that had been handed to us when we first arrived."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"She describes how she had to explain to her daughter that, instead of her going there automatically because she is from the catchment area never mind about preference she might be denied a place because they live on the fringe of the area and the 15 per cent. might apply to the school from over the boundary and push her out.
<P>
Frankly, that is a disgrace." [Official Report, 11 November 1996; Vol. 285, c. 53.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That disgrace will continue if the amendments are not supported.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Does the hon. Gentleman, like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, support specialist schools? Would not the amendment lead to the end of such schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted to have the opportunity to answer that question, although we shall probably discuss the issue later. I and my party are very much in favour of specialist schools. However, the point is not whether we favour those schools and giving parents the opportunity to choose from a range of different schools the point is the selection and admission procedures for specialist schools, and on that we disagree fundamentally with the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Let me finish answering the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford).
<P>
The hon. Lady will know that the Bill provides for selection to specialist schools based on aptitude. I said specifically at the beginning of our debate that the amendments relate to assessment by ability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the Minister reads the amendments, he will realise that.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall finish my point and then give way to the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and then to the Minister.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Colne Valley will wait until we debate aptitude, when I shall explain my party's views on that and how the issue relates to specialist schools. For the reasons I have explained, specialist schools are not relevant to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Since I first asked him to do so, another question has arisen in my mind originally, it was only one. When he referred to the nonsense of the distinction between aptitude and ability, I thought that at least he was not going to join the Minister on that extraordinarily rotten floorboard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am glad to hear it. If the hon. Gentleman is not going to do so, could he explain how a specialist school could develop a high level of attainment in its specialist subject if the law requires it to be blind to the ability or aptitude of students in that subject? How can a cathedral develop a choir if it cannot find out whether applicants can sing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I look forward to answering that question later in our debate [Interruption.] There is a clear answer, but were I to develop the themes of aptitude and the as the right hon. Gentleman put it rotten floorboard of attempting to distinguish between aptitude and ability, I fear that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale. I promise the right hon. Gentleman that, if possible, I will take the opportunity to return to that point [Interruption.] Several members of the Committee want to intervene I do not know who wants to speak first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I cannot contain my anticipation until later, when the hon. Gentleman promises to elucidate on the questions asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. Will he say whether it is possible to have an aptitude for, say, mathematics or English?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I suspect that it is possible to have an aptitude for all sorts of things, but clearly no one has yet devised a means of assessing it. That is the difficulty that the Minister will face. [Interruption.] We are told that the 11-plus is an assessment of aptitude. Were that true, we could reasonably assume that there would be a clear correlation between results at 11-plus and key stage 2 standard assessment tests, which examine mathematic ability. Unfortunately, as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) may be aware, the research shows no clear correlation between the two. Therefore, the 11-plus does not measure aptitude in mathematics successfully.
<P>
The point that I was making before the various interruptions was that in opposition, the Labour party was extremely critical of partial selection by ability and was clear about its determination to get rid of it. However, the Bill gives the opportunity for partial[Mr. Foster]
selection to continue, which is a huge U-turn by the Labour party, as no one can deny. The Bill will not end all partial selection, and there is worse to follow.
<P>
Partial selection has taken place not through direct legislation, but through circulars, which the Committee knows are not authoritative legal interpretations of the law. The Bill puts partial selection into statute and gives it the full force of the law. That is being done for the first time and by a Labour Government. The sad truth is that the Labour Government do not know how much partial selection they are authorising. They no more than the previous Government know how many schools have a partial selection policy. The answers to parliamentary questions make it clear that a complete list is simply not available.
<P>
That raises a problem for the future. The Under-Secretary will no doubt say that some partial selection may stop because the adjudicator will be empowered to make that decision. In those circumstances, the adjudicator will be making his or her decision on the basis of a code of practice on an issue which, for the first time, will have become part of legislation. That opens up the possibility of a legal challenge between an adjudicator's decision, which will be based simply on a code of practice, and actions that will take place on the basis of statute. I can foresee real growth in education litigation.
<P>
It will be interesting to see how the Government respond to those circumstances. I have a copy of a letter dated 26 January 1998, addressed to Mr. P. Winbourne from Miss S. Nairne of school admissions team 2. On the role of the adjudicator on the issue of partial selection, Miss Nairne, presumably speaking on behalf of the Government, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The role of the adjudicator will be to resolve disputes about whether the admission arrangements for an individual school complement those of other schools and reflect the needs of the area. It will thus be for the adjudicator to consider, in the event of a complaint, whether existing partial selection in an individual school should end."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly states that partial selection may continue if the adjudicator does not decide that it should end.
<P>
Partial selection can continue in two instances: first, if there are no complaints; and, secondly, even if there is a complaint, the adjudicator decides that it can continue.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must be clear about what that letter is saying. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In doing, so, he" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the adjudicator 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will be guided by a statutory Code of Practice which we anticipate" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not definitely 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will give a clear steer that, in principle, it should indeed be ended."<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as it is for Parliament to decide what the code of practice will be, it would be inappropriate for a civil servant to say in a letter what it will be? Therefore, it is appropriate to say "anticipate". If a civil servant, on behalf of the Government, had said what the code of practice would include, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would have objected because Parliament had not considered the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I hope that the Minister will intervene again and tell the Committee whether the code of practice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will give a clear steer"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the adjudicator that, in principle, partial selection should be ended. The Committee will note from the Minister's complete silence that he is not prepared to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) for giving way because he is making an important point. The Minister leapt to his feet to say, rightly, that civil servants should not pre-empt the will of Parliament: neither should they speak other than on behalf of Ministers. If the civil servant expected the code of practice to contain provisions that would bring selection to an end, presumably she was speaking on behalf of the Government, so the Minister should now back her up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister certainly should, which is why I gave him the opportunity to do so, but the Committee will have noted his unwillingness. The Minister has been passed a briefing note, so he may now wish to intervene.
<P>
The matter raises a fascinating point in law. If the adjudicator is told to make a decision based on what he discovers in the local area by taking into account all considerations before him, that is a reasonable role for an adjudicator. However, if he is given
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a clear steer that, in principle, it" </FONT></UL>
<P>
partial selection "should indeed be ended", the adjudicator will no longer be independent, but will be the puppet of central Government, delivering what they say. I hope that someone in the ministerial team will explain the position to the Committee. It is an interesting legal position, as well as political embarrassment for the Labour party, which has clearly made a massive U-turn. The Government are not clear how their policy will work.
<P>
I said that I would refer to what the Secretary of State has said about these issues. What did he say about partial selection? I hope that Labour Members will pay special attention to what the Secretary of State told the House only a few months ago. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am able to confirm that the Bill and the criteria I will lay down as part of our admissions policy will remove partial selection where it currently exists. That causes havoc in terms of the admission of local children, and denies fairness to parents because of the lack of choices and opportunities open to them." [Official Report, 22 December 1997; Vol. 303, c. 664.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it. In introducing the Bill, the Secretary of State said that it will remove partial selection where it exists. That is not what the Bill does; it allows partial selection to continue in different parts of the country, with the havoc, as the Secretary of State put it, that that creates. It was the Secretary of State who said, "Watch my lips. No selection by exams or interview under Labour." Sadly, unless the amendment is accepted, selection by ability will continue in some schools.
<P>
The other two amendments predominantly deal with selection in grammar schools. The Government propose that it will be possible to change the status of grammar schools by parental ballot. We welcome the opportunity for those decisions to be taken at a local level, but we believe that admissions and the other arrangements for different schools in an area are best made by the local, democratically elected education authority after widespread consultation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 would provide an opportunity for local education authorities to take decisions, after consultation, on the future of grammar schools in the first three-year period so that there would be no need to introduce what the Government propose a cumbersome and unnecessary system of parental ballots. However, amendments Nos. 32 and 33 are absolutely crucial. They show that the Government have made a massive U-turn, not only in moving from opposition to government, but since 22 December 1997, when the Secretary of State introduced the Bill on the Floor of the House and categorically stated that the Bill will remove partial selection where it exists. To give effect to that commitment given by the Secretary of State, I hope that all members of the Committee will support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Bath focused on partial selection and on the effects of clause 90. However, as he has said, this group contains amendments that would not only deal with the provisions that permit partial selection but would introduce a major change in the proposals on grammar schools. Therefore, this group of amendments provides an opportunity to debate partial selection in the general education system as well as to focus on the main issues raised by the Government's approach to grammar schools.
<P>
I have sympathy with much of what the hon. Member for Bath said about the Government's position. However, when he moved the amendment, I thought that I would conclude that his speech was wrong but clear. After his remarks about specialist schools, I concluded that he was, like the Government, wrong but muddled. It was all very well for him to promise at some future, indeterminate point that he would explain to the Committee how to develop a specialist school without allowing it any capacity to distinguish between one potential recruit to the school and another, but he did not return to the subject. That did not come as a huge surprise to me, however; I have asked that question not only of Liberal Democrats, but of many representatives of the Labour party.
<P>
Before the election, Labour spokesmen adopted the same approach as the hon. Member for Bath, which was to say that they would return to the matter on another day, but hope that another day never came. But the Government then discovered that another day did come, and they recognised that they could not deliver a specialist school without giving it the right to distinguish between one recruit and another. They have invented the doctrine of aptitude and ability to justify their retreat.
<P>
To my surprise, the hon. Member for Bath sought to cuddle up to the Minister on that rotten doctrine, which will not bear the weight that the Government seek to place on it. The hon. Gentleman must decide whether he is in favour of a universal, comprehensive system, which means the allocation of pupils to schools a recognition from which the advocates of comprehensive education of 25 years ago never sought to resile. Either he is in favour of that system, or he is in favour of a more diverse system. He said that he was in favour of specialist schools, so he must face up to the implications of choice and, with it, selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is now seeking to intervene. I look forward to a brief encapsulation of the doctine to reconcile what I consider to be irreconcilable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman chides me for implying that I promised to return to the matter, but did not do so. I said that there would be an opportunity later in our proceedings for me to do so, and I draw his attention to amendments Nos. 377 and 378, in his name, which will give us the opportunity to debate the issue. I did not want to cloud my point with matters that we will debate later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's explanation but, as ever, he has not advanced the argument. He did not explain how to deliver [Interruption.] He said that he was in favour of specialist schools. That is not consistent with the principle of not allowing selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Wait and see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Indeed, I wait in keen anticipation as, I suspect, do Ministers, as that was the question that they left open for themselves ahead of the election and then failed to resolve.
<P>
It is important to deal with what the hon. Member for Bath said in his opening remarks when he referred to the relationship between selection by schools and choice by parents. In many cases, the words "selection" and "choice" mean the same thing, as do "ability" and "aptitude". If one chooses, one selects. That is what the process of choice means. If we believe that parents ought to be a key determinant in which school a child attends, we are delivering a system that allows the decisions of choice or selection to be made between parents and schools in the majority of cases, rather than being determined by a central authority.
<P>
That fundamental choice under admissions policy must be made by anyone who is interested in the issue. Are we interested in choice and, with it, the consequence that is selection, or do we believe that admissions policy is better decided by allocation? I shall put my cards firmly on the table. I am in favour of choice and selection; I am not in favour of allocation of pupils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): What I am about to say is pertinent to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bath will say later in our proceedings. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that parental choice is the first and overriding criterion by which children should be allocated to schools? Will he put it on record that the Conservative party believes that the choice of parents is overriding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The phrase that I used was "key determinant". I remember saying at an earlier sitting[Mr. Dorrell]
that parents' wishes cannot always be delivered. Indeed, the process of schools choosing potential recruits itself limits the choice of individual parents.
<P>
I invite the Committee to recognise that the allocation of pupils can be determined either by a central authority or between parents and schools, with a system for resolving differences that schools and parents cannot resolve for themselves. The latter seems a much more attractive model than the central allocation system.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The same argument was used earlier about the relative balance between schools and LEAs on the management of schools. Should the central authority rest with the school, which has a direct relationship with the parents? Should the school be a local institution serving the parents of the community, the LEA acting in reserve and dealing only with those questions that cannot be dealt with directly between the school and the family? Or should the school be part of a more centrally managed system?
<P>
I made it clear at earlier sittings that I am in favour of schools acting as local institutions and responding to local needs. The admissions policy is an important part of the process; it vests authority in the institution of the school.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): On the basis of my experience in my constituency, the distinction that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to draw between, on one hand, choice and selection and, on the other, allocation by a central authority is a false one. What would he say to the 80 per cent. of parents in my constituency who are denied choice because their children have failed the 11-plus? Does he accept that the result of that system is that all children are allocated by a central authority to a particular type of school?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No, I do not accept that. Of course, I accept that there are limitations on parents' choice. It is another version of the question that I was asked by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who wanted to know whether I thought that parental choice was absolute. No, it is not not in this, nor in many other aspects of life.
<P>
The critical difference between the system described by the hon. Lady and the system of allocation is that the majority of decisions about where a child is educated are made by the schools and the parents, rather than by the LEA. It happens much less often now than it did 20 years ago, but it used to be the model for the great majority of children. Most places were allocated and the parents received a letter telling then where the child would be educated. The parents had to appeal against that decision if they wanted a choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): Cannot the right hon. Gentleman see that the greater the amount of selection in an area, the less parental choice there will be as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) so clearly pointed out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am interested that the hon. Gentleman wishes to return to the argument about there being a key difference between selection and choice. He will be invited by the Minister to vote in favour of a number of the Bill's provisions. One purpose of our debates is to find out exactly where the Government stand on the balance between allocation and selection and choice. [Interruptiuon.] The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) does not seem to have warmed to the principle of selection and choice, which the Minister is encouraging him to rediscover. I welcome that apparent evolution of thought on the Labour Benches.
<P>
I emphasise that, with the exception of his regrettable lapse on specialist schools a subject to which we shall doubtless return the hon. Member for Bath has been magnificent this morning in being wrong but clear. He is consistently in favour of LEAs having power they should be in charge, make decisions and be the arbiter of all that is wonderful in the education system. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is fundamentally wrong about that, but, apart from his one lapse, he has at least been clear.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the Government's policy on the issue is a complete shambles. It is clear from the quotations that illustrate the development of the Labour party's policy on selection that Labour Members are unable to communicate in clear language. The number of times that words are substituted by a series of stars because of the sensibilities of Conservative Central Office, such words cannot be committed to paper is significant. There is the famous quotation of the late Anthony Crosland:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it's the last thing I do, I'm going to destroy every f***ing grammar school in England. And Wales. And Northern Ireland."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Byers:</B> In 1967?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Yes. That is the evolution of thought the same incoherence apparently gripped the Deputy Prime Minister when he was discussing the subject in 1996, when he said that he was not going to "defend any f***ing hypocrites". He was referring to the choice that middle-class parents were seeking to exercise in a way that he thought was inconsistent with Labour party policy. Incoherence is manifest in Labour's vocabulary.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner: </B>(North-West Norfolk): Will the right hon. Gentleman reflect on the fact that my right hon. Friend's immediate predecessor as Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard), spent much of her time in the early days closing grammar schools? I was present at a meeting at which she voted to close the very grammar school that she attended. Surely the right hon. Gentleman recognises that we are trying to adapt to the new millennium and to leave behind the arguments of the old one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have set out, I believe reasonably clearly, my thinking on the subject. I seek to draw out the different strains of thinking on the Government Front Bench. From the beginning, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has established himself in our Committee as one of the more consistent Labour Back-Bench mouthpieces on the position of the Government Front Bench. His Back-Bench colleagues have been more catholic in their views. It will be interesting to see how many of them seek to intervene in the debate on selection and how the balance of argument lies among the Minster's friends if he still regards them as such by the end of our debate.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath said, one does not have to go as far back as 1966 or thereabouts to draw out the different strands in Labour thinking on selection. The Secretary of State said in 1996:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is 30 years since Crosland embarked on this. I don't think anyone should expect me to complete his work in the first three months of a Labour Government."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fair enough, but it clearly implies that he intends to continue with Crosland's rather crudely expressed objective. In January 1996, the Secretary of State was at pains to say that he agreed with the line which the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk now proposes that seeking an end to selection should be part of Labour's policy. Indeed, the Secretary of State went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have made a clear pledge that there will be no more selection. I'm going to be as blunt as that."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was barely two years ago. On another occasion, the right hon. Gentleman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Read my lips. No selection, either by examination or interview, under a Labour Government."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath says, that sits decidedly oddly with the terms of clause 90, which introduces no fewer than four although two of them are the most controversial continuing bases for selection within the maintained system. Clause 90(1)(b) apparently demonstrates that the Government do not have a fundamental objection in principle to the continuation of grammar schools. Given that the Government are maintaining the place of grammar schools in statute, we must assume that they do not believe that they are fundamentally wrong in principle.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath developed the argument about partial selection. Partial selection is inconsistent with what the Secretary of State said in January 1996. As I said on Second Reading, the terms of clause 93 are especially inconsistent with what the Secretary of State said then. I repeat his words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have made a clear pledge that there will be no more selection."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 93, unlike the rest of the Bill, does not even set selection in aspic; it allows the development of selection. The Government cannot even take refuge in the small print and say that there will be no more selection. In the clauses relating to existing general selection and grammar schools, the Government seek to hold development in a freeze frame as of today. However, under what they call selection by aptitude the nonsense of which we will discuss under clause 93 continued development of selection will be allowed.
<P>
I hope that in replying to the debate the Minister will set out with some clarity what is now the Government's policy on the subject. Do the Government still believe, as did Anthony Crosland, in the principle of allocation that decisions should be made fundamentally for the purposes of social engineering, without being pejorative about it, by the local education authority? Or is the Minister now prepared to back up the policy contained in the Bill with a statement of education policy that reflects a shift in Labour party view from allocation towards choice and selection? The policy set out in the Bill is fundamentally inconsistent with what Labour education spokesmen describe when asked what is their philosophy on education.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath made clear, there is a further inconsistency in the Government's policy, because the Bill will continue to allow the principle of choice and selection, while the briefing to the adjudicator points in a completely different direction. That is totally unsatisfactory from Parliament's point of view. We are being asked to agree to the Bill while it is the Government's express intention to introduce a code of practice that will be inconsistent with what is in the Bill. Where do the Government sit on the question of choice and selection, on the one hand, and allocation, on the other?
<P>
The other question that the Government must answer is, given that the Bill allows the continuation and, indeed, the development of the principle of choice and selection, how can they possibly justify telling schools with existing arrangements for choice and selection that those arrangements must be frozen? The arrangements are right the Government have no objection to them in principle and do not seek to legislate them away but they cannot be changed. That is the effect of clause 91, but the hon. Member for Bath wants to remove the arrangements. I do not want to remove them, but nor do I want to see their development cut off. The Government cannot easily justify freezing the arrangements so that they cannot develop in a way that reflects the needs and ideas of the community.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, by saying that the arrangements cannot be changed, he is ignoring entirely the fact that they can be changed if they are objected to locally? I assume that we must wait and see how the burden of proof will lie. The arrangements can be changed, but not by ministerial diktat. He has spent much of his time complaining about the Government taking powers to the centre, but does he not acknowledge that the arrangements can change and that there is a mechanism for change?

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No, I do not acknowledge that. Clause 91 states that the pre-existing arrangements can continue
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so long as there is, as compared with the arrangements in force at the beginning of that year 
<P>
(a) no increase in the proportion of selective admissions in any relevant age group, and
<P>
(b) no significant change in the basis of the selection."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman would like to persuade the Minister of the strength of his argument, it would be an interesting debate. He may like to make such a case in a speech.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Surely the right hon. Gentleman recognises that admissions arrangements for schools in the locality must be agreed among the admissions authorities. If they are not agreed, the arrangements go to an adjudicator. That is a mechanism for change and a way in which such arrangements may be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he is talking about general admissions arrangements under[Mr. Dorrell]
the provisions that were discussed at last Thursday's sitting. The clause will safeguard existing partial selection arrangements as long as there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no significant change in the basis of selection."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Arrangements are in place at present and I am complaining that they will not be allowed to develop. I do not understand how the Government can justify that, any more than I understand how they can justify the arrangements for grammar schools.
<P>
There are 161 grammar schools, and there may be support in other parts of the country for the development of more. The Government are willing to endorse and bless the arrangements that are acceptable to the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), although they will make matters more difficult for them. The Government are willing to let the arrangements continue in Buckinghamshire, for example, but if a community elsewhere in the country wants to introduce grammar schools that will be impossible.
<P>
The Government are in a hole because they have not thought through their policy. They have not set out clearly whether they are in favour of allocation or of choice and selection. They want to minimise political embarrassment by not stirring up a hornet's nest, and the result of that is a dog's breakfast. We have arrangements that are allowed to continue as long as no one moves, like a rabbit stuck in headlights, but we will not be allowed to develop an idea to which the Government have no fundamental objection.
<P>
Chapter II is the most unsatisfactory element of the Bill, many aspects of which I find unsatisfactory. Everyone knows that admission policy is an issue of great sensitivity. The hon. Member for Bath recounted the problems with individual selection arrangements. Of all education policy issues, selection is the one that impacts most directly on people's lives. The Government have sought to fudge it in a way that will satisfy no one. It will not allow those who believe in a system of choice and selection to develop their ideas, nor will it satisfy people like the hon. Member for Bath, who is in favour of a completely different set of ideas most of the time.
<P>
The clause satisfies no one. The Government hope that this difficult problem will go away. They do not want to sit down and try to resolve it. The clauses will not stand the test of time. It will not be long before most members of the Committee will be back in this Room trying to help the Government to clear their mind on what their admissions policy should be.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed both the Opposition and the Liberal Democrat spokesmen a fair degree of leeway, and I shall certainly allow the same degree of leeway to the Under-Secretary when she replies to the debate.
<P>
It is the Chairman's job to protect the interests of Back Benchers and to ensure that they have a fair opportunity to speak. However, I shall be keeping an ear open for repetition. I call Mrs. May.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): Thank you, Mr. Gale although I am not sure, after your comments, that I am so keen to speak.
<P>
I hope that all members of the Committee will agree that the education that we provide should be right for each child. The hon. Member for Bath promised what I suspect will be a fairly esoteric debate on a later clause about the difference between aptitude and ability [Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman promised us a speech on the esoteric difference between aptitude and ability. I trust that when the time comes, I shall have the aptitude for the debate, although I am not sure whether I shall have the ability to make that differentiation.
<P>
If the education that we provide is to be right for each child, children who are musically gifted should be provided with an education that enables them to develop that talent; children who are good at sports should be able to develop their skills; children who are academically inclined should be provided with an education that meets those needs; and children with practical skills should be enabled to develop those skills to the best of their ability and in a way that will meet their particular needs.
<P>
I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Bath, because I thought that he would speak about the concept of selection per se. He did not. He seemed to be making two arguments. First, he said that the Labour party had made a dramatic U-turn on selection since it came to power. Indeed, I entirely agree with him on that, as does my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. The Labour party used to be implacably opposed to selection; it now accepts selection, as we can see from the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath's second argument seemed to relate not to the concept of selection, but to the practicalities of partial selection. He seemed to claim that parental choice should take precedence over selection. It ill-behoves the Liberal Democrats, who have consistently put the needs of parents bottom of the list of priorities, suddenly to try to use the argument of parental choice in this instance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath then added to the confusion by railing against partial selection, yet in response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Colne Valley he accepted that partial selection was acceptable in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> At no point did I say that partial selection was acceptable in any circumstances. I hope that the hon. Lady will acknowledge that and retract her statement.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> If I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's reference to accepting the concept of specialist schools 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> You did.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In that case, Mr. Gale, I look forward to our future debate with even more interest. The hon. Gentleman's position is perhaps even more confused certainly, he has confused the Committee this morning, because he now appears to be saying that the concept of specialist schools is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he previously said that he would accept specialist schools, but now says from a sedentary position that he does not think that they are acceptable? We await a future debate to hear the answer.
<P>
If we accept that the education that we provide for each child should be that which is right for each child, the concept of selection ensuring that a child receives the correct education slots neatly into place. In his earlier comments, the hon. Member for Bath was complaining about the practicalities. For example, when he said that individual schools set different tests to ascertain whether particular children were appropriate for admission, he was implicitly accepting that there should be a general test rather than individual tests for each school. Either the hon. Gentleman is saying that all schools should have selection, or he is saying that we should have a simple comprehensive system based, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, on allocation rather than parental choice or selection.
<P>
A recent sitting of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, on which several other members of the Committee sit, took evidence in the context of our study on disaffected children on the curriculum and its appropriateness. Someone who came before us in a public session said that he believed that comprehensive schools had not worked because they did not ensure that children received the education that was right for them in terms of their different skills, aptitudes or ability one can use the word one prefers. He believed that comprehensives had, by and large, tried to gear themselves too much to academic needs, neglecting the needs of children with more practical abilities. He was making the point in regard to disaffected children, but it is of more general interest.
<P>
It is worth investigating the extent to which the comprehensive movement has provided for the needs of every child. Our argument is simple and is based on the fundamental principle that we should attempt, as far as possible, to ensure that the education we provide for every child is right for that child and meets his or her needs. The child's abilities should be drawn out and he or she should be equipped to develop those abilities for the future. If we accept that need, it immediately follows that we will want to consider each child individually and ask what should be provided for him or her in the classroom or the school. Selection therefore follows closely from such a concept.
<P>
That concept is not based on the premise that the man in Whitehall or in the town hall knows best, so he can lay down that a particular child should go to a particular school and another to another; it is based on the need to marry the considerations of parental choice and of selection there is a tension between the two to ensure that the school that a child goes to will provide him or her with the best education, in the light of his or her abilities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I have said before that the Government often swing between a Jekyll and Hyde polarity and whoever wrote the clause must have drunk potion A and converted to Mr. Hyde, because it will have a pernicious effect on education. The hon. Member for Bath seems to be saying that we should throw away potion B, but might occasionally need something that will convert us back to common sense in regard to the education of our children.
<P>
The Government have often pleaded that we should not write proposals into the Bill. Yet here they are trying to cast in stone the views of certain Education Ministers which, goodness knows, have changed in a variety of areas in recent years. They want to crystallise those views at a particular point so that they are prepared to tolerate an element of selection for some schools, but refuse all other change. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, it is a totally muddled and contradictory position.
<P>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Bath's amendment will make that position worse. I listened with interest to his stories of parents' experiences in the borough of Wandsworth; but we did not hear so much about parents' experiences in his own constituency of Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> There is not a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Let me share with the hon. Gentleman the problem that parents experience in my constituency in Surrey, where we have a non-selective system. Unfortunately, that does not prevent parents from having to come to my surgery to complain about the bureaucratic nightmare of trying to find the right school for their children. They do so because in any system which attempts to offer an element of choice, there will also be a element of disappointment. That is not answered by moving to a purely non-selective system whichever system is chosen, there will be disappointment. Given that the choice involves people's children the subject about which they care most such disappointment will be very great.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman read the Audit Commission's report on parental choice and selection? If he has, did he read the section in which it was made clear that the previous Government's policy of introducing partial selection increased the number of dissatisfied parents that is, those who did not get their first choice and led to what the commission described as "planning gridlock"?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I remember the report to which the hon. Gentleman refers, although I did not read every line of it. The previous Government made an honest start to try to introduce an element of choice into the education system. Of course, in the process, many untapped feelings of parents came to the fore. In any system in which a greater expression of choice is allowed, people will express dissatisfaction at the choice available. However, many parents will see their children go to the school of first choice, and will be highly satisfied with the system. There will also be many parents whose children have not gone to the school of first choice. Nevertheless those children have gone to the same school that they would have gone to otherwise, so their parents have no real grounds for complaint about the introduction of the system of choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): In view of what the hon. Gentleman just said, how does he[Mr. Gordon Marsden]
reconcile that endorsement of dissent among parents letting 1,000 flowers bloom with his support of the previous Government's centralising policies in education?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As I have said, I was not a member of the previous Government. I endorse the Conservative principles that led us to diffuse power from LEAs to schools and, through the process of choice, to individual parents who, by expressing their preferences, pointed out the excellent schools in an area. That created benchmarks against which other schools could measure themselves; they could learn lessons by asking themselves, "Why do parents want their children to go to that school, not to our school?" I am proud of the previous Government's efforts to diffuse power from LEAs to individual schools.
<P>
In a previous debate, we heard Ministers endorse local management of schools and say that they want to extend that principle, as we do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even by my standards, this debate is becoming too free ranging. The hon. Gentleman must return to the principles of selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I appreciate your comments, Mr. Gale. Obviously, Labour Members are leading me astray.
<P>
We heard of the tales of parents in Wandsworth. I do not want to discount their disappointment. As I have said, choosing which school their children should attend is vital for any family, but it would be completely misleading for anyone to suggest that a non-selective system would avoid the painful process that families undertake.
<P>
I frequently see the parents of bright children who do not have first call on the best schools in Guildford because they live in outlying areas. I often hear of the problems of a bright child whose only choice of school is one of the least academic in the town, which certainly causes considerable anxiety, and that is in a non-selective system.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), I have taken advantage of being a member of the Select Committee to ask wide-ranging questions on these issues. I well remember talking to the head of an inner-London school who said that the comprehensive principle works fine for a large group of pupils with a wide cross-section of ability. The implications of that are clear. In the comprehensive system, it is all very well to have selection within the school and not between schools. The system works when the school is large enough and the cross-section of ability is wide enough, but, in some areas, there may be a collection of smaller schools, which cannot provide different types of education for all the different children within each school, because they do not have the resources. The intake of some schools may not have a great range of ability, or perhaps there will be a handful of pupils whose needs are not met, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said.
<P>
There are so many contradictions in the Government's approach. They acknowledge that over-16s must be selected, but with an element of a view to their ability. Yet, the Labour-controlled LEA in Birmingham says that schools should have a non-selection policy for 14-year-olds. Therefore, children will not be selected at first, yet, two years later, they may be thrown out because they do not measure up. That is bizarre and shows how contradictory is the Government's policy and how wrong they are to prescribe it in the Bill when they acknowledge that much of it is so confused that they would be better making it up as they go along.
<P>
I take exception to the remarks of the hon. Member for Bath because he has not thought through the effects of banding. Let us imagine that there are three schools in a certain town: one has an excellent reputation; the second has a sound reputation; and the third is the weakest in the area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Leafy Lane school.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have many such schools in Guildford which have an outstanding record and which take children from a broad area.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): Or near the gas works.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No, I am glad to say that we no longer have a gas works. It may be different in Devonport.
<P>
All the parents in the area will want their child to go to the best school, and one way or another, it is a fair bet that, in a non-selective system, that school will end up with a high-ability group. The second school will take advantage of the banding system proposed by the Government and will end up with children with a normal spread of ability. That will leave the third school with children preponderantly with the least academic ability. The Government's proposals will make it possible to subvert selection when they are trying to prevent overt selection.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, the issue of aptitude versus ability is a rich field for overt selection to remain. We heard the example of a music test, which I mention because it is relevant to clause 93(2), which rules out an aptitude test

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am endeavouring to be as lenient as possible to allow as much debate on the broad principle of the chapter as is reasonable. By the same token, we shall clearly be debating clause 93, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to retain his comments until then.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale, but the point that I was making is relevant. A child could be asked to sing "Twinkle, twinkle little star" from memory, but if he had to read it from a music sheet, it could be argued that he was being tested for his literacy, if not his numeracy. That is the nonsense that the Government are creating. What if a school decides to test for aptitude in information technology skills? How will it be possible to test such skills, without testing an element of numeracy? What about religious schools? Will it be illegal for Sunday school classes to test a child's aptitude and then to make the information available to religious schools in the area when such schools are assessing which children to select?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman feeling well?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I feel very well.
<P>
The Government are being so prescriptive that a point will be reached when what they are trying to achieve will be challenged under the new legislation on human rights. Not only should we reject the Government's proposals, we should reject the attempt by the hon. Member for Bath to turn the screw one notch further, which will make the position even worse.

<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> The Committee needs to be reminded of the Bill's purpose. On Second Reading, it was clear that the Government wanted to achieve co-operation and, indeed, all-party support so that the nation's schools could focus on standards. I worked with all parties for many years in Norfolk and went round the county trying to find the right way to replace the grammar school system, which symbolises more than any other the concept of selection by ability. Does the party of the right hon. Member for Charnwood remain wedded to the philosophy of a grammar school in every town? It failed to attract support from a single headmaster in Norfolk the county I know best. In the early days in opposition, the right hon. Gentleman was able to announce certain changes in Conservative policy. We need to have consensus on the matter, instead of sterile arguments about competition and the GM experiment. The co-operation that the Government want in their efforts to advance standards would benefit from wider support.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath said correctly that the Labour party has not believed in the principle of selection by ability for many years, and he rightly grasps what unites us. The right hon. Member for Charnwood ignores the fact that until relatively recently, the majority of his party had also accepted that principle. That does not mean that we cannot look at history especially those of us who owe a debt of gratitude to a grammar school education and recognise that grammar schools played a useful role post war, but they are not the way in which to organise education. That is especially obvious in Norfolk.
<P>
In the week of the Countryside rally, I should have thought that we would hear the Opposition talk about the appropriate way to organise education in a rural environment. When the nearest school is a long bus journey away, parents do not want to work out how far away a grammar school or a selective school are they want to go to a local school and find that it is a darn good school, the existence of which is predicated on high educational standards. That is what the Bill is about.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath does not recognise that if we are to try to bury the hatchet over the old argument about selection that everyone loved to have 10 years ago, the Government have to allow some issues to be settled locally. Instead of Government diktat about the future of grammar schools, there will be opportunities locally to debate and vote on whether grammar schools continue to exist. Personally, I hope that their number will decrease.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, but I confess that I am confused. Is he personally in favour of partial selection? If not, does he agree with what the Secretary of State told the House on 22 December: that it was right to remove partial selection where it currently exists? What is the hon. Gentleman's position on partial selection?
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> I am happy to tell the Committee that in my view, partial selection was an unfortunate consequence of the competitive GM experiment introduced by the previous Government. The hon. Gentleman may agree with me; I believe that partial selection was introduced by the previous Government with the intention of making a creeping move towards grammar schools. That is not the way forward.
<P>
Sometimes, the way to ensure that an argument dies a death is to compromise somewhat and, if there is local sustenance for a particular arrangement, to allow local people to have their say, rather than for central Government simply to abandon them. I hope that, through local decision making, difficulties and problems posed to local people and to other schools in the locality by partial selection, including those which the hon. Member for Bath has highlighted, will be addressed.
<P>
I would have though that members of the Committee would recognise that the Government are trying to ensure that the emphasis in the debate on education can return to school standards, where it should be, from school frameworks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he hopes that partial selection will be phased out. Can he reconcile that with the fact that clause 93, which is in this chapter of the Bill, foresees further development of partial selection?
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would not go too far down that road; we will come to clause 93 in due course.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> I heed your advice, Mr. Gale; no doubt we shall return to the matter.
<P>
The real needs of education sometimes require us to be slightly more sophisticated than the yah-boo of party politics allows. Some of the criticism that Ministers are suffering is because they understand the need for some finesse to secure the best way forward. That means not simply applying a doctrinaire view as new ideas arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> There is an old rule in the House that hon. Members believe what they are saying in inverse proportion to their bluster. In terms of the bluster ratio, the hon. Gentleman has just risen to a new high.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I note that; I might even press the right hon. Member for Charnwood perhaps privately to tell me how to measure it.
[Dr. George Turner]
<P>
I hesitate to go on at length; perhaps we should have a longer debate, Mr. Gale, because you said that we should not go down that particular avenue. However, the Committee should recognise that the best way forward is for local people to realise the problems created by partial selection in their locality. If the adjudicator listens carefully to the arguments and can deal with them, the problems of partial selection should be manageable. Indeed, I hope that partial selection will be significantly decreased if not banished during the lifetime of this Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned his party's manifesto, saying that it sought to unify and create a sense of partnership between political parties. What we heard in today's debate shows that there remains a fundamental philosophical difference. The dilemma for Labour Members is that, contrary to their party's manifesto, we have seen something of a U-turn. The manifesto clealry stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There should be no return to the 11-plus. It divides children into successes and failures at far too early an age."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Although the contribution of the hon. Member for Bath was confusing, the Liberal Democrats have been consistent in not supporting selection. They have never supported it and I doubt if they ever will.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> Some of them do locally, though.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We can always rely on Liberals to act differently locally.
<P>
The truth is that the Government are seeking to accommodate the views of middle England. That is the reason for the difficulties pointed out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. The Government's track record in opposition was clear. Their belief was repeated in the manifesto in May. Yet they now find that selection is quite popular in many parts of the country among the middle England voters whom they now seek to keep on board for the next election and they have had to modify the Bill as a result.
<P>
The Bill certainly contains flaws, and we do not support parts of it, but the Government are now struggling to give practical application to something to which they are not philosophically committed. I wondered whether the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk realised that if the Liberal Democrats press the amendment to a Division he will shortly have to vote. It does not sound as though the hon. Gentleman will be voting with his Front Bench. We shall be interested to see how he votes.
<P>
It is interesting that such a philosophical divide should be found in a Committee of which many members have benefited from a grammar school education. The grammar schools that have educated Labour members now opposed to selective education include Chester City grammar school, the Minister's alma mater 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go any further, and fascinating though it may be, the hon. Lady should not be talking about total selection. The clause deals with partial selection.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I simply state that some members of the Committee are now opposing something from which they derived considerable educational benefit including the two Liberal Democrat members.
<P>
It would be wrong to debate the merits or otherwise of selective education without drawing attention to one of the great successes of selective education, which has not yet been mentioned. I speak of Northern Ireland, where secondary education is almost wholly selective. Results and outcomes have been talked about a great deal throughout our proceedings, especially by Government Front Beach Members. From Second Reading onwards, they have emphasised that the purpose of the Bill is to raise standards in education. They talked about standards, not structures. We could take issue with them on that but, if they are genuinely concerned with raising standards, it seems strange that the example set by Northern Ireland in selective education is not one that they have considered as a model.
<P>
The track record for staying-in rates in Northern Ireland for post-16 participation in full-time education is the highest of any of the regions in the United Kingdom. In 1994-95, the latest period for which figures are available, 79 per cent. of 16-year-olds went on to full-time education in Northern Ireland. In other regions in the United Kingdom, that ranged from 61 per cent. in the north-east to 78 per cent. in the south-east.
<P>
As for examination achievements, which is another miserable outcome for standards, on which the Government place so much emphasis, 35 per cent. of pupils in Northern Ireland achieve two or more A-levels. That is better than the average for England, which is 29 per cent., Wales, which is 26 per cent. or Scotland, which is 30 per cent. Only one region in England the south-east, with 36 per cent. had a higher percentage than Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Lady believe that other factors, such as the amount of money spent, class sizes and religious denomination arrangements, may have slightly influenced such issues?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In seeking to raise standards, which we have been told is the main objective of the Bill, I said that the Government have not looked carefully at the role model set by Northern Ireland. Before the election, the Labour party said, "Education, education, education." Surely it is intended to have excellence as typified by Northern Ireland throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. The Government said that resources will be put into education to raise standards. Therefore, if more money were spent in Northern Ireland, that should not be a problem for the Government. They have billions of pounds from windfall taxes and other pots that they have raided.
<P>
The lack of finance should not be a determining factor if the Government can identify a model that has been seen to work well elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It is extraordinary that, rather than that example being used by the Government, it is tended to be treated like the back water at the end of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We have six secondary schools in Harrogate and Knaresborough, all of which are comprehensive. None have any selection. All have had excellent Ofsted reports and three of them were congratulated by the former Secretary of State on being outstanding schools. Surely those achievements should be put up as a model of perfection, not the divisive system in Northern Ireland of which the hon. Lady seems to be so proud.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> That is typical of the Liberal Democrats. If the current system in Knaresborough 
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> And Harrogate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> If the current system in Harrogate and Knaresborough is successful, that is great. We pay tribute to it. That was the policy of the previous Conservative Government: to provide diversity and excellence in education, so that decisions could be made locally about the system of education that suited pupils best and also produced a result. If that system is working well in the hon. Gentleman's area, I pay tribute to it.
<P>
The Government want to raise standards overall in the United Kingdom. We do not oppose that principle, but there is already a good working model of that, of which the Government have clearly not taken notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady raised an important issue. As she speaks from the Conservative Front Bench, we must know for the record whether she is advocating the model of schooling in Northern Ireland for England.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am advocating that, where selective education is seen to work, it cannot be dismissed on dogmatic grounds as can the Liberal Democrat's amendments and contributions to the debate and some of those of Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> What is your view?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is for the Minister to answer on questions of policy; it is his Bill. We are talking about the principle of selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady must recognise that she is speaking for the Conservative party from the Front Bench, and that carries a responsibility. Is she advocating the Northern Ireland model of schooling for England yes or no?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am saying that the fact that selective education is seen to work in Northern Ireland overrides the dogmatic principle that selection is bad. Labour Members have told us of the traumatic effect of 11-year-olds having to sit an examination. Clearly, that is not the case in Northern Ireland and, because selective education works well there, it cannot be ignored in talking about overall selection in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I apologise for interrupting, but it is clear that the hon. Lady does not intend to answer the Minister's question, so I shall ask her a more simple one. She is suggesting that, because examination results are better in Northern Ireland, where there is a highly selective system, we should support such a system. As that is the basis of her argument, will she consider the fact that in one county 49.3 per cent. of children achieve five A to C grades at GCSE, while in another comparable county the figure is 43.7 per cent? Which of those two local authorities should we use as the ideal model for the rest of the country?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> That is typical of the Liberal Democrats. They want to have an ideal structure that, from the centre, can be deemed to be the national structure that they, LEAs and everyone else can impose. The point that I am making is that selection in Northern Ireland is not adverse to children's education the results speak for themselves. I am not advocating one structure so that it can be lifted from one area and imposed on another.
<P>
The principle of selection has been attacked, and all I am saying is that when members condemn selective education as being bad for children, difficult for parents and wrong on philosophical grounds, there is a good example in Northern Ireland that disproves those objections. [Hon. Members: "It does not."] The chorus says, "It does not", yet we have heard that the trauma of taking examinations at 11 is detrimental and that there is disappointment for the children and their parents, but is everyone who goes through the education system in Northern Ireland traumatised by it? Clearly, they are not the results, not just those of the higher echelon, speak for themselves.
<P>
Critics often say, and it has been said in Committee, that selective education disenfranchises those children who have less academic ability. In fact, Northern Ireland shows us that that is wrong; those at the top do not receive a good education at the expense of the less able. In Northern Ireland, only 4 per cent. of 16-year-olds have no graded GCSE. That percentage is lower than in any other part of the United Kingdom. In England, the proportion was 8 per cent. in 1994-95; in Wales, 11 per cent. and in Scotland, 6 per cent. So selective education in Northern Ireland means not only higher standards, which all members of the Committee should praise, but that those with less ability end up with more when they leave education.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Under-Secretary shakes her head those results were provided by the Library; if she is saying that they are wrong, I shall challenge the Library.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have demonstrated in their amendments an underlying objection to the principle of selection. Members of the Government including senior members were until 1 May also opposed to selective education, particularly the 11-plus. Now, with the Government's desire to please middle England, we have a Bill that contradicts the philosophy and principles of the Labour party and tries to accommodate all opinions. That underlying lack of principle in regard to education has become typical of the Government.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Will the hon. Lady develop her point that her party does not necessarily want to impose a different scheme? Where does that place the commitment, on which the Conservatives fought the election, to have a grammar school in every town? Could she clarify the position of the Opposition Front Bench on that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The policy was to have a grammar school in every town that wanted one. The underlying principle of all Conservative education policy is to give local people the right to have a range of schools available to them a range that the Government wish to reduce so that parents, governing bodies and so on can decide what they want. If the hon. Gentleman is asking me whether that will be in our next manifesto, he will have to wait and see, because we are undertaking a policy review on it. He knows all about policy reviews because his Government have about 150 of them in progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> The hon. Lady cannot get away with waxing lyrical on the subject without going into more detail. Does she agree with the hon. Member for Bath that the situation in Northern Ireland is, for all the reasons he gave, totally different from that of the rest of the United Kingdom? If that is true, is it not also true that generalising from a specific example, as the hon. Lady is doing, is grossly irrelevant?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> No, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I am trying to respond to some of the points raised by his hon. Friends. Some hon. members have claimed, for example, that sitting an examination at the age of 11 is traumatic and that some children have the opportunity of sitting a mock 11-plus or of having additional tuition for it. Many years ago, I sat the 11-plus I do not claim that it was the same exam as the one today but my school provided no tuition or preparation for it. My father went to W. H. Smith and bought the published examination papers for the previous three or four years 
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Is that not what schools should be doing? If a child has to sit an exam the 11-plus, GCSEs or whatever it is surely incumbent on the school to ensure that the child is prepared as well as possible for it. No one takes a ballet or piano exam without having had the right tuition for it first. Being prepared for exams is nothing new.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> What is the point of all this?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman say, "Bribe the examiner"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I definitely did not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> For once, the hon. Gentleman correctly brings me to book. The point is that the Government are saying that the mere fact that an 11-year-old finds it traumatic to sit an exam means that the 11-plus should be thrown out and I am therefore trying to convince the Committee that, with the right preparation, tuition and school, that trauma can be greatly reduced and is no longer a justification for rejecting selection by examination. Every child in Northern Ireland is a testament to that because no one can say that those children who sit a selective examination are traumatised by the experience.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I should like to deal with some of the fundamental and flawed arguments made by Conservative Members to justify their position on the clause and during the more general debate on selection which ensued. First, they maintain that there is no fundamental differences between partial and total selection. They used that argument to muddy the waters and to criticise the Government's position on selection. Secondly, their argument that parental choice and selection are synonymous and different from central allocation is also flawed. Thirdly, their belief that the aim of the education system should be to provide the right education for each child begs many questions. Fourthly, they argue that assessing the right education for the child should be done on the basis of a test of general ability.
<P>
On the first point we were, as you reminded us, Mr. Gale, debating partial selection, but it was very clear from the views expressed by Conservative Members that they would like to reintroduce wholesale universal selection, including the 11-plus, which I have in my constituency. That muddies the waters. They have tried to argue that allowing partial selection, particularly on the basis of aptitude, is fundamentally the same as the extreme form of selection such as the 11-plus in my constituency. That is a very broad argument. The Government's position which I support, although I oppose universal selection such as the 11-plus is that the issue to be assessed is how far the degree of selection in an area skews the whole education provision to the extent that it disadvantages the majority of pupils and denies choice to the majority of parents.
<P>
Partial selection, particularly by aptitude, can be a mechanism for creating specialist schools that enhance the diversity of provision in an area, not just for children in that school but for the area as a whole. Partial selection for example, for musical or sporting ability can enhance the educational provision in an area. In stark contrast is the system of universal selection, such as that in my constituency, which skews the whole provision to the disadvantage of the vast majority of children and parents. The argument that those systems are part of a continuum that is fundamentally linked in concept and practicality of implementation is flawed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, not least because the two of us represent the vast majority of the boroughs to which she referred. I wonder how she reconciles her comment that that system disadvantages the vast majority of children with the incontrovertible fact that the borough of Trafford gets the best A-level results in the country and the 10th best GCSE results.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Comparison must not be made only on the basis of raw results. Account must also be taken of a wide variety of factors, particularly the socio-economic profile of an area. When Trafford is compared with areas with a completely non-selective system for example, Solihull with a similar socio-economic profile, Trafford does no better.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may be familiar with the Audit Commission report on Trafford's grammar schools, published some four years ago, which showed that a number of grammar schools in Trafford did not produce the results that would have been expected in terms of the baseline levels of attainment of the pupils they received through the selective system. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Lady. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West drew attention to the fact that the Trafford results, measured by attainment, are the best achieved by an LEA. She is arguing that the results can be adjusted to be worse than those in Solihull. Is she really saying that socio-economic circumstances in Trafford are better than in any other district?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am not arguing that the socio-economic circumstances are better, although the grammar schools in the south of the borough, to which the right hon. Gentleman is alluding, must be in an area with one of the highest socio-economic profiles in the country. There is no point arguing. I have a different view of the results than the right hon. Gentleman. We need to acknowledge that a range of factors affects the ability to compare results and to determine their validity. The right hon. Gentleman is not doing that.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Opposition Members seem to be trying to take us down the same old path of wholly selective schools. A technical school in my constituency is selected by pupils on the basis of their technical ability. The school draws pupils with a wide range of abilities across other subjects who have a particular ability in technology.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I think that that illustrates my initial point. Limited partial selection has the benefit of enhancing the range of provision in an area for everyone, not just for people at a particular school, whereas skewing takes place when selection is universal or based on general ability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If we had the definition of ability and aptitude, we would be clear about the debate. Agreeing to selection by aptitude is greatly worrying. What reliable tests exist for selection by aptitude? Does the hon. Lady agree that aptitude, especially in subjects such as music, is often the ability of parents to provide children with a background, and they are judged by their social class?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman's last point raises an issue which underlies all selective systems, not just for musical ability. It underlies tests of general ability, as I hope to explain.
<P>
I do not know of any reliable measures of aptitude, but there is the opportunity to listen to the opinions of teachers when children move from primary school to secondary school. There is also the possibility of schools discussing pupils' interests with them. That already happens. We need to bear in mind that aptitude might not only mean a higher level of ability in subjects such as sport, music and information technology, but include the interests of a pupil who might not necessarily have a high ability in a subject. Aptitude can embrace that.
<P>
The second premise is that choice and selection are synonymous more selection means more parental choice. I want to challenge that subterfuge and expose it for what it is. Greater selection means giving more choice not to parents, but to schools. For every parent and pupil family selected into a school, many more parents and children are excluded. The idea that we can equate conceptually the notions of parental choice and selection is a subterfuge which, as I tried to make clear in my intervention on the right hon. Member for Charnwood, results in allocation to a type of school.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is the hon. Lady arguing that if parents in an area choose a selective system for deciding which school their children go to, that that choice should be paramount?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We shall discuss later the mechanism that the Bill proposes for parents to express choice in deciding whether or not to move away from selective systems. Certainly, in terms of the application of the Bill when it becomes law, the results of those ballot processes will be binding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Lady suggested that I had asserted that the introduction of selection leads to choice. In fact, I argued the opposite the introduction of choice leads inevitably to selection, not surprisingly, because choice and selection are conceptually the same thing.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It may be interesting to examine the record. I understood that the right hon. Gentleman's point is that selection and choice are two sides of the same coin not that choice leads to selection, but that selection leads to choice. That argument has been made by several Conservative Members and we should expose it for what it is. It is not true that, generally, more selection leads to more choice for more parents. That is wrong; the opposite is true.
<P>
Thirdly, education needs to be right for the child, which begs many questions, not least how to assess, especially at the age of 11, as is normal, what is right for every child. In my area and in areas in which selection is prominent as a feature of admissions policy, decisions are made at the age of 11 not on the basis even of the child's ability at that point, but on a quite spurious assessment of the child's potential for the next seven years. On the basis of that test of potential, children are placed in one type of school or another. Children who are not placed in grammar schools then receive, by and large, an education in which aspirations and expectations can be lower. Even the practicalities of what examinations children can enter can be more limited. In a debate about raising standards, it is nonsense for hon. Members to advocate the allocation of children at the age of 11 to an education that is limiting in its expectations and in the range of subjects[Ms Hughes]
and levels of examinations that they may take. If we are serious about raising standards, we cannot talk about allocating children at the age of 11 on the basis of a test that spuriously purports to measure not even ability at that point, but potential over the next seven years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Lady's argument. She seems to be saying that it is impossible at any stage to measure a child's ability or aptitude, and that that therefore leads to the argument that selection should not take place. However, at the beginning of her remarks she said that she would support the concept of partial selection. I should add that none of us has advocated the concept of a test at the age of 11.
<P>
The hon. Lady talks about not assessing a child's potential at any age. How, then, does she believe that those children whom it is felt appropriate to send to specialist schools will be selected, if not on their potential?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I was emphasising the linking of the application of a test at the age of 11 purporting to measure potential, and the allocation of children on the basis of that result to schools in which the potential of children was limited by the education and opportunities available in such schools. That is not the case with partial selection, especially by aptitude, which is completely different.
<P>
My fourth point hinges on the question of the validity of the tests that we might undertake, especially tests of general ability. I should like to share with the Committee some of the results from my constituency, in which there is a general test of ability at the age of 11 an 11-plus on the basis of which children are allocated either to a grammar or to a secondary modern school. First, a small minority in my constituency pass the 11-plus. Only 20 per cent. of all children in my constituency are given the choice of a grammar school place. When I consider the variance in pass rates across different parts of the borough, I wonder what the tests are really measuring. The variance ranges from about 6 per cent. in some wards in my constituency to 45 per cent. in other wards in the borough, but not in my constituency. The pass rates correlate pretty closely with the socio-economic profiles of different parts of the borough.
<P>
It is often argued that selection is a means of enabling poor children with ability to have an advantaged education that will help them get qualifications to improve their quality of life. However, the poorest two wards in my constituency and one of them has a high proportion of children from minority ethnic groups have the lowest pass rates of 6 per cent. and 7 per cent. The argument that selection is a mechanism to enable the raising of standards of achievement among socially and economically disadvantaged pupils is nonsense. The system profoundly fails those pupils by allowing so few of them to get the sort of education that that argument purports to provide.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I believe that grammar schools are better for all. They are better for the hon. Lady's constituents as much as for mine. On her specific point about her two poorest wards, I must challenge the assertion that the 6 or 7 per cent. who pass the 11-plus could be increased by removing grammar schools. Grammar schools are not an ideal solution, but they provide some opportunity for children coming from those areas. By removing that opportunity, we would simply kick away the ladder. It is vital not to do that.
<P>
The hon. Lady seems to be arguing that selection is bad for her constituents, even if it is good for mine. Does she believe that a LEA-wide ballot on the future of those grammar schools would be inappropriate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall come to that issue later.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman's language is interesting, but quite inappropriate. I have not argued for abolishing or removing grammar schools. I have talked about the process by which the vast majority of children in my constituency, some of whom have more need than most for a good-quality education, are, on the basis of a test, allocated to a standard of education that does not address their needs or help them to achieve high standards.
<P>
Pupils are divided into two groups, one of which is provided with a certain standard of education, while the other gets a lower standard with lower aspirations. That division is done on the basis that pupils aged 11 will not be able to reach higher standards over the next seven years. That is wrong and it is indefensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I agree very much with many of the hon. Lady's remarks. Given what she has said, why does she support continuation of selection by ability? Why will she support an extension to selection by aptitude at a later stage?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I have tried to make it clear that there is a fundamental flaw in the argument that partial selection, particularly by aptitude, has the same consequences for children within an LEA area as predominant or universal selection by ability. Our yardstick must be the impact of a particular set of arrangements on the opportunity for the possibility of raising standards across a whole local authority. In that sense, a degree of partial selection can be helpful in enhancing opportunity and diversity, whereas selection that is predominant, which affects large numbers of children or is universal has the opposite effect. It skews the whole education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that she fundamentally disagrees with the Secretary of State, who said that partial selection
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"causes havoc in terms of the admission of local children, and denies fairness to parents because of the lack of choices and opportunities open to them." [Official Report, 22 December 1997; Vol. 303, c. 664.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I agree with the provisions of the Bill in the sense that they reflect the situation at present, acknowledge the need to raise standards without disrupting the education system and reflect the Government's view and mine that universal or predominant selection in an area to which Opposition Members would like us to return is something that we implacably oppose and to which we do not want to return.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> This has been a wide-ranging debate and discussion. I have become aware of many issues; some of them were raised by the amendments and some were not. I especially enjoyed the right hon. Member for Charnwood's contribution, which took us on a trip through history, back to the time when England last won the World cup. I thought that he might stop on his way back to the 1990s to remind us that Margaret Thatcher closed more grammar schools than any Labour Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> With the greatest respect, I will not. I shall make a little progress in my speech and give way later.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood used the phrase "intellectual development" to describe changing one's mind as the years went by. That is a nice phrase, which I think that I might use in future. Perhaps more by its actions than its words, the Conservative party has gone this way and that in terms of its policy on selection.
<P>
We made it clear in our manifesto that we would not return to the 11-plus. I shall pick out three reasons many of which have been alluded to by my hon. Friends for that.
<P>
First this is a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston just made there is the issue of expectations. There is a huge danger that selecting pupils at 11 gives a message to a group of children that they are not expected to succeed at 16 and beyond. When pupils got their 11-plus results when I was a child, it was a case of "Have you passed for grammar or failed and gone to the secondary modern?" Instutionalised low expectations of children a phrase quoted by the hon. Member for Bath that I used previously are a danger. That is the problem of the11-plus.
<P>
Secondly, the 11-plus detracts from the idea of parental preference and parental choice. When the right hon. Member for Charnwood was making his point about two sides of the same coin, he did not address the issue of whose hands the selection and the choice were in. That is the crucial point the 11-plus puts the power to choose in the hands of the schools. We want to put the power to exercise a preference in the hands of the parents. That is the fundamental difference.
<P>
Thirdly, and most importantly, selection for grammar schools at 11 was developed at a time when this country needed only a high skilled minority of people. We could survive and compete economically by training and educating a few to the highest standards. We did that exceptionally well we were the best in the world at it but there was no need for the rest of the populace to be highly skilled, because the economy into which they would move did not require that of them. It is a tragedy that this country has been too slow in comparison to its competitors to realise that the winners int he world now are those countries who train and raise the skills of every child. The 11-plus was never set up to do that, and I do not believe that it can do that now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Having paid a generous tribute to the work of grammar schools, does the Minister accept that the answer is not to get rid of grammar schools, but to improve the standard of other schools? Is not that the tragedy of post-war education policy, which levelled down and destroyed what was good rather than raised standards in general?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. What really makes the difference is quality of teaching, among other factors. That encapsulates the phrase, "Standards not structure".
<P>
To return to why I am not in favour of the 11-plus, labelling a group of children failures at 11 makes teaching more difficult. That is stacking the odds against the school and the teacher being able to do their best. I accept that it is only anecdotal, but there is too much anecdotal evidence of people who have succeeded as adults but felt that they had to overcome a barrier of having failed the 11-plus. Some adults have succeeded despite that. They refer back to that failure as an additional barrier, but many adults do not overcome the barrier of being labelled a failure at 11. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's first statement that quality of teaching is crucial, but I do not believe that his other remarks follow. However, we both agree that what makes a good secondary modern or a good grammar school is the quality of teaching.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister began by gently chiding those who stretched the limits of the debate, but as far as I can see, nothing in the amendment nor anything that I said included an impassioned defence of the 11-plus. We are focused on whether schools should be able to select pupils in a way that reflects their aptitude or ability. So I hope that the Minister will not rest her case purely on the shortcomings of the 11-plus examination. In particular, I hope that she will focus her remarks on the principle of partial selection. The question for the Government is whether they believe that all the weaknesses of the 11-plus inevitably attach to the process of selection, and whether the process of selection, rather than the 11-plus examination, is at fault. If they believe that, why are the Government continuing to provide for partial selection and grammar schools?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. The policy review takes place more quickly each day, because the right hon. Gentleman has just said that the Conservative party is not in favour of selection at 11. The 11-plus was only ever one type of examination for implementing selection at 11. It is useful to know that the Opposition have moved away from that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Now answer the question.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I move not to partial selection. I wanted first to respond to those hon. Members who raised the issue of selection, not just partial selection. I know that you said, Mr. Gale, that some latitude might be acceptable.
[Ms Morris]
<P>
The comments of the hon. Member for Bath were exceptionally well made. His description of events in Wandsworth rang a bell and are true of the situation in other local authorities. The reasons why I commented on the problems of partial selection when I was in opposition are exactly the same as those referred to by the hon. Gentleman. Partial selection can cause havoc with admission arrangements. It can also cause confusion and disappoint parents. The hon. Member for Bath and I do not differ on that, so there need be no allegations of U-turns. The difference in our positions is in what we believe should be done about the problem and how it should be tackled. We could have introduced a Bill to abolsh partial selection that would have been easy.
<P>
It makes me smile because, from the earlier comments of the hon. Member for Bath, one would have thought he belonged to a party that, by diktat from Westminster, told local authorities what to do. I remind him that, in Birmingham, there are Liberal Democrat councillors who support grammar schools and Liberal Democrat councillors who support corporal punishment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> Name names.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall afterwards, privately. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath can guess.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argued with force and passion that the decision should be taken centrally and that everyone else should comply, but that is not consistent with the rest of his policy. At the general election the Liberal Democrats nationally were opposed to grammar schools, but their policy was to leave it to local authorities to decide whether to put up with the policy. Is that right? I am happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman agrees from a sedentary position that it is right. That constitutes a kind of intellectual development, but we need a new word to describe the situation in which intellectual development goes on at one point in time rather than over a period of months or years.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must not accuse us of not giving a central diktat about partial selection. He would not do it and it has never been his or his party's practice to do it and we shall not do it either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister chides the hon. Member for Bath and refers to his intellectual development. However, the hon. Gentleman has been a model of consistency compared with the Minister's approach. She said that in her view I should be interested to know whether it is also the Government's view there are shortcomings in partial selection, and that the policy should not be adopted. However, clause 90(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The following are permitted forms of selection by ability ... any selection by ability authorised by section 91".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what we are discussing. Is the Minister in favour of preserving arrangements for partial selection? What is the Government's policy?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Patience, patience. I shall deal with that matter immediately.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State described the problems associted with partial selection. I told the hon. Member for Bath that the question was how to deal with that. We could have passed a law saying that there should be no more partial selection. Even the right hon. Member for Charnwood must admit that the Government have consistently tried to bring about local decision-making and to encourage local agreement.
<P>
The previous Government wanted to promote a policy about grant-maintained schools, but they did not announce the policy, say that GM schools were a good thing and leave the matter to local discretion and to local agreement; they bribed schools to become grant maintained and they disadvantaged those that refused to. The previous Government put their head on the line they set the target of ensuring that 1,000 schools became grant-maintained within two years. That is not our policy. It is harder to say, "Leave it to local agreement," but that is grown-up politics, which is the third way to do things. On several occasions my hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards has discussed that approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister cannot have it both ways she cannot talk about grown-up politics and leave the Secretary of State hanging out to dry. She said the policy is to leave decisions to local authorities, but on Second Reading I apologise for repeating this quote, but it is of great importance the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am able to confirm that the Bill and the criteria I will lay down as part of our admissions policy will remove partial selection where it currently exists." [Official Report, 22 December 1997; Vol. 303, c. 664.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does the Minister explain that difference? The Secretary of State said that the matter will be dealt with in legislation, but the Minister has told us a completely different story. Which is the truth?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> That is not the case. I made it clear that I agree with the comments that my right hon. Friend made on Second Reading. I shall deal with the code of practice the hon. Gentleman should hang on and wait.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister stretches the Committee's credulity by discussing local discretion and the fact that the Government want to preserve LEAs' freedom of action. I must remind the Committee of provisions to which we have already agreed. I could cite many provisions from clauses 7 and 8 I am spoilt for choice. Clause 8(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may under this subsection give an officer of the authority such directions as the Secretary of State thinks expedient".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That comes from a Government who now seek to dress themselves in the clothes of local discretion. The Minister's case is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman, who was a member of the Conservative Cabinet, must have included that phrase in legislation on many occasions. It is a belt-and-braces clause that often makes its way into law. We have made arrangements locally for admissions authorities to get together to agree about admissions, but that will not involve the approach that was used in Wandsworth, which the hon. Member for Bath mentioned.
<P>
The Government have decided to leave the matter to local
