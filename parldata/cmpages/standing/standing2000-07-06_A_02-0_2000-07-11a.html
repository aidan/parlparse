No. 23, in page 1, line 9, after `child', insert `or young person'.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I hope that the Bill will have swift passage through Committee, and that we shall discuss matters of substance. Committee members may be surprised that I should say that at the outset of deliberations on this group of amendments, as it might appear, on first glance, that adding the phrase, ``young persons'' after ``child'' is simply a matter of presentational gloss. However, I am concerned about the fact that the Bill will be a working instrument that will affect many young people, so it is important to strike the right tone in the relationship between care leavers, the eligible child or young person and the surrogate parent or local authority. Young persons who are over 16 will object if they are affected by legislation that is called the Children (Leaving Care) Act and if they are described as children in the regulations on which they have to depend.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister of State for his letter, in which he tried to deal with some of the matters that I raised on Second Reading. I am not convinced that we cannot improve the Bill's phraseology so that it acknowledges that young persons should be active participants in the process of their being looked after. I appreciate that parliamentary draftsmen are not too concerned about what people think of legislative descriptions that are supposed to apply to them, but people have to live with the consequences of legislation, and when one is trying to persuade young persons to work with a local authority, it is important to accord them the dignity and respect that they deserve. When one is 15 or 16, and certainly when one is 17 or 18, there is nothing worse than being described as a child, which is paternalistic and, to be frank, extraordinarily bad manners and so likely to set the relationship off on a poor footing. I urge the Minister to think again. I realise that the situation is complicated because the Bill amends another Act&#151;the Children Act 1989&#151;but I am sure that the ministerial advisory team contains sufficient ingenuity to deal with the problem.
<P>
Let me now deal with amendment No. 24. Although the Bill is a worthy one, it is likely to produce a fairly rigid straitjacket unless adequate flexibility is introduced. A young person in care who wishes to continue in care may strike up a stable relationship, although he may no longer feel that he should continue to be part of an arrangement that involves being parented by a local authority. We shall discuss that is more detail when we reach amendment No. 34. I have frequently come across cases in which children cope with a family&#151;perhaps that is the best way to put it&#151;and families cope with their children up to the age of about 16. They have not gone into care, but are extremely vulnerable and need the support and the parenting role of the local authority. One of the worthy aims of the Bill is to provide young persons with access to the direct support of a local authority acting in loco parentis, but such young people would be denied such access.
<P>
Will the Minister look at the qualifying criteria for being an eligible child? I realise that the Bill was drafted before the amendment was accepted in the House of Lords, so we might have a problem discussing a different category of older children and young persons. If we accept the provision without amendment, we could create difficulties for vulnerable children and young people whose family relationships have broken down after the age of 16&#151;15 years and nine months, if we adopt a three-month qualifying care period, and 15 years and six months if a six-month period is chosen&#151;because they might be unable to benefit from this extremely positive measure.
<P>
On those grounds, I move the amendment and look forward, as usual, to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): At this rate, as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) hopes, the Committee's consideration of the Bill could be quite rapid.
<P>
As I said at the first sitting of the Committee and on Second Reading, there is a consensus on the Bill between both sides of the Committee. We are interested not in posturing, but in determining how the Bill will work, exploring some of the concerns that have been expressed to see whether those are real problems or whether the Minister can reassure those who raised them, and trying to improve the Bill.
<P>
Although I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's desire to ensure that young people are involved in the process, I am not sure that his amendments would achieve that objective. He has tabled later amendments&#151;as have others, myself included&#151;with the same objective in mind, but the enhanced involvement of young people can be achieved by other means. Simply to change the term ``child'' to ``child or young person'' would not achieve anything of substantive consequence. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that it would upset the overall architecture of the Bill and that the amendments would necessitate the making of significant consequential amendments both to the Children Act 1989 and to the Bill. I simply do not believe that the hon. Gentleman's amendments would address the problem that he has identified.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 could have a substantive impact, in that it would allow the Secretary of State to prescribe categories of young people who are assessed as needing care. I assume that proposed new sub-paragraph (3)(d) refers to categories of young people in care at the age of 16 who qualify irrespective of the period that they have spent in care. However, the Secretary of State already has those powers under new sub-paragraph (3)(a), and amendment No. 24 would add nothing to them. In working together to improve the Bill, we should not be sidetracked into such cul-de-sacs, but should move swiftly on to consider other areas in which we can do something more substantive to improve the way in which the Bill works. Its terminology is inevitably dictated by the previous legislation&#151;the Children Act 1989.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take my comments in the spirit in which they are intended. The issue that he has flagged up can be dealt with more effectively through other amendments that have been tabled by him and by other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan </B>(Cardiff, North): On Second Reading, I briefly discussed the Bill's terminology because a group of young people from Wales who came to a meeting in the House had said that terminology&#151;in terms of the use of the phrase ``young person''&#151;was important to them. I understand that there are technical difficulties with making the Bill consistent with the Children Act, but it is important that young people should be part of the process that will be set in train by the Bill. I know that the terminology used in legislation sometimes has to differ from that which we would choose to employ, but in the case of this Bill, the terminology used should be designed to ensure that young people are treated with respect&#151;as young people, not children.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> It is always a pleasure to serve on a Standing Committee with the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). The hon. Member for Isle of Wight always says that he looks forward to what I have to say, and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge then does my job for me by responding to the hon. Gentleman's amendments. We have got off to a good start. Perhaps I will not have to say anything about the Bill, because the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will make all my speeches for me. He must have been looking at my notes again.
<P>
I am sure that we all agree with the arguments that have been advanced by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight and by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan). Naturally, we want young people to be treated with proper respect. The hon. Gentleman is worried that the terms in which the Bill is couched may appear to patronise young people and it is true that good social care practice should not involve that kind of mistreatment. However, there is no real danger of such problems surfacing in the world outside and we shall work closely with local authorities through several programmes, including the quality protects initiative, to ensure that social care practice in children's services continues to improve.
<P>
There are two problems with the amendment. Although we can all agree about how we want people employed by local authorities to relate to children, we are dealing specifically with a legislative framework. The clause covers 16 and 17-year-olds, who are defined as children for the purposes of the Children Act 1989, which is amended by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am following the Minister's comments closely. Does not the Bill provide an opportunity to reconsider the definitions used in the 1989 Act? Things have moved on in the past 20 years and, nowadays, relationships with young people can be much better if one stops calling them children, even if only for legislative purposes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> One can always argue about that. The hon. Gentleman is inviting us to adopt a new definition in respect of 16 and 17-year-olds, so we would still need a definition of ``children''. The term ``child'' is perfectly appropriate for one, two or three-year-olds. If we were to follow the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, we would have to do far more than simply accept his amendment. There would be a contradiction between the Bill and the Children Act, which uses the phrase young person to mean one who is over 18; the amendment would apply that definition to a category of people who are below the age of 18 and who, for the purposes of the Children Act, are styled children. We could follow that path, if the hon. Gentleman wanted to pursue the matter, but we would have to rewrite huge parts of the Children Act to do so.
<P>
There is a distinction between the legal framework and good social care practice. We would not expect social workers to describe 16 and 17-year-olds as children, but there is a perfectly logical case for keeping the Bill consistent with the Children Act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. The Act does not call people over 18 ``children'', because that would be inappropriate: they are adults, and their status as such is set out clearly in the Act and in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 would give the Secretary of State new powers to identify eligible children. The Bill already provides those powers, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has said. The amendment would add powers to prescribe who is an eligible child, but, if the hon. Member for Isle of Wight reads new sub-paragraph (3)(a), as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge invited him to do, he will see that the Secretary of State already has powers to prescribe additional categories of eligible children. Therefore amendment would create no meaningful new powers.
<P>
I accept the arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman, as, I am sure, do all members of the Committee, but we should make a distinction between social care practice in the real world and the necessary constraints imposed by the drafting of legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North drew our attention to that. In making such a distinction, we are not patronising young people or decrying their involvement in the care provided by local authorities, and we do not want the hon. Member for Isle of Wight to get the impression that we do not envisage young people participating actively in their care. The thrust of our proposals is to ensure the full and active involvement of young people in all of the new initiatives, especially in respect of pathway plans, which will be agreed with the young people themselves. Many of my hon. Friends would say that the hallmark of successful leaving care arrangements is that they are, so far as is possible, the result of agreement between the young person and the local authority leaving care team.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight understands our intentions and our reasons for not accepting the amendments. They would damage the Bill, by confusing the definitions of children and young persons&#151;two distinctly different legal concepts&#151;and thus amendments blurring the distinction. I hope that he will accept that we do not intend to patronise, in any way, young people in care.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I would never accuse the Minister of patronising anyone. I mean that genuinely.
<P>
I accept the Minister's explanation of his position on amendment No. 24. I was attempting to explore what would happen in individual cases. I hope that the regulations will allow the flexibility to encourage relationships with young people who would not be eligible under the Bill, but who have need. It should not require the personal intervention of the Secretary of State on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's comments on Second Reading, is he suggesting a relaxation of the criteria for time spent in care, so that those who are in care for a shorter period than has been set down, or those who have never been in care, should benefit from the arrangements?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful for that intervention and the answer is yes in both instances. The Bill fulfils a social need felt by children and young people. There should be no artificial distinction drawn between needs that arise before the age of 16 and those that arise after that age, especially if abusive relationships with parents are involved. It is often when young people become able to assert their independence within an abusive household that they need the greatest help, and that often happens after they reach the age of 16. It would be a pity not to take the opportunity to allow young people the support that is clearly set out in the Bill. Having listened to the Minister, I happy that the Bill includes the young people that I have described and I shall not to press amendment No. 24.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Minister's response to my imperfectly drafted amendments Nos. 18 to 23; clearly, sequential amendments would be necessary because I ran out of time after drafting amendments to include ``or young persons'' in clause 1. The issue that they address is an important one. I agree with the Minister that there is no intent to patronise; any social worker who wants to work successfully with young people cannot afford to be patronising. However, it will not be helpful if, when discussing their extraordinary powers over young people, they are asked what gives them those powers and the response is ``The Children Act and the amendments made to it.''
<P>
In the Care Standards Bill, especially the bits about Ofsted, there are three cut-off ages used for defining children for various purposes. Recent legislation reduced the age of sexual consent to 16 for all, the argument being that at that age people should be able to make their own decisions. By inference, we decided collectively that young people were no longer children at 16 and it is a shame that we are not taking the opportunity today to tidy up&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that we have decided collectively that, at 16, young people are no longer children. Is he suggesting that we should go through the entire body of legislation and change from 18 to 16 the age at which various disabilities, responsibilities and obligations start to apply? Is he really suggesting that, at 16, people should have all the duties and obligations of adulthood piled upon them?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I think that we should take the opportunity, when it arises, to amend old-fashioned and patronising legislation. Today, the Committee has such an opportunity to examine the Children Act to see whether the definitions used are still appropriate to today's society. I am not suggesting that the Government should introduce a raft of new legislation for the sake of political correctness. We are not discussing political correctness; we are discussing the practical application of a piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas </B>(Ceredigion): I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's case. Does he agree that, although social workers would never refer to young people as children, when they sit down together to work out a pathway plan, they might be asked to explain what it is all about? They will have to explain that it is because the young person to whom they are talking is an eligible child or a former relevant child. That in itself will give the young person a poor impression of the way in which he or she is being treated.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. I envisage a great many discussions taking place between pathway advisers and young people who might like to be on ordinary benefits who, when they challenge the arrangements, will be told, ``This is because you are an eligible child.'' That is not the best way to form a positive relationship between a social services department and a child who may be fairly disaffected, not only with his or her parents, but with all figures of authority, including the local authority. Being reminded that one is regarded as a child in legal terms is perhaps one of the strongest incentives that I can think of not to co-operate with the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have to press the hon. Gentleman once more, because he is now talking about language. A short time ago he talked of substance and cited the example of the reduction in the age of consent to suggest that, collectively, we had come to a view that children passed into adulthood at the age of 16. The hon. Gentleman is a Liberal Democrat Front-Bencher. Is it his party's position that people should be able to vote, enter into legally binding contracts and marry without parental consent at that age? Can he tell us about the substance as well as the language issue?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Dear, dear&#151;the hon. Gentleman invites me to spend the next half hour exploring my party's policy. I have no problem telling the hon. Gentleman that it is our party conference policy that voting should be allowed at 16, because it would encourage people to participate in the democratic process. We earnestly want to work towards that end&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's remarks are not directly relevant to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Michie, albeit not because I wanted to be saved from exploring the issue further. I was severely provoked by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
There are two issues, one of which is presentational, but has a substantial practical consequence, which is why I invited the Minister to consider some redrafting. I realise that it would create a great deal of work for civil servants, but I have a great deal of faith in our civil service and I am sure that they would be able to carry out the task if the political will was there. However, my amendments as drafted will clearly not do what I should like them to do, so, while urging the Minister to return to these matters later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 1, line 26, after `needs', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including a statutory assessment of his housing needs'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a real pleasure to participate in the Committee stage of this important Bill. I suspect that my amendment is probably in the wrong place and perhaps not drafted accurately. My hon. Friend the Minister is agreeing wholeheartedly. However, the spirit of the amendment is important; I believe that it is fully in line with what the Government are trying to achieve.
<P>
The basis of the Bill is the idea of local authorities being good corporate parents. It is important to acknowledge that, as young people leave care, the question of where they will live is crucial. It is important also to note that many local authorities that have primary responsibility for looking after young people, for example, shire county councils, are not housing authorities.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The fundamental improvement that was made in the Lords to what was a good Bill anyway, is the extension of the statutory duty towards young people in care up to the age of 21. It builds on powers in existing legislation to enable young people to remain in residential care or as lodgers with previous foster carers beyond the age of 18. That is tremendously important. When I worked in this sector, I applied the maxim that the longer young people could be kept in care, the better their chance for the future. One of the serious issues that this very good Bill sets out to address is the fact that, increasingly, young people have left care at 16. They should remain in care as long as their needs require it, and the Bill will enable that to happen.
<P>
When young people move on from care, a variety of possible placements should be available to them. Hopefully, many of them will move on to higher education and to university accommodation. Others will move on to places such as foyers associated with social support and training, or to supported lodgings, house shares and semi-independent flats. The list of options is considerable and I hope that the opportunities will develop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> At the outset, the hon. Gentleman said that he thought his amendment might be in the wrong place. I am not clear whether his remarks apply to 16 and 17-year-olds or 18 to 21-year-olds. As the amendment is worded, it would apply to 16 and 17-year-olds, but he seems to be talking about 18 to 21-year-olds and the cases are quite different. It would help the Committee if he clarified that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. My point applies to all young people who are looked after beyond the age of 16. Those under 18 would be in a slightly different position from those over 18. It is important to have a statutory assessment of housing needs. There could be a tremendous variety of places for young people to live in after leaving residential or foster care. That is desirable. What is undesirable is the present situation, where young people often end up in temporary, inadequate and run-down accommodation, which is often in some of the worst areas, where we would neither choose to live nor want our children to live.
<P>
There will be a huge responsibility on local authorities to develop new forms of accommodation for children once they have left care. The new forms of accommodation that will be developed, such as foyers, lodgings, house shares and semi-independent flats, will be temporary. Unlike other young adults, those who leave care seldom have a family home to fall back on. A young person who leaves home to go to university, for example, or who wants to try being independent, may later return to the family home because things have not worked out quite as he or she expected. That solution is not available to youngsters leaving care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman say more about the statutory assessment of needs? The current assessment of statutory housing needs lets down children leaving care, who often end up low on the list and in poor accommodation. Does the hon. Gentleman have in mind a different assessment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I shall try to answer the hon. Gentleman in a minute or two.
<P>
Young people who may have had good move-on accommodation immediately after leaving foster or residential care can face significant problems when that temporary accommodation comes to an end or they lose it because of problems. It is essential that they have a fallback position as they do not have a family home and a year or two later foster placement or a place in a children's home may not be available.
<P>
In response to the hon. Gentleman, young people leaving care should have a statutory right under homelessness legislation to be regarded by local housing authorities as being in priority need of housing. However, that is not the be all and end all of the matter, nor will it be the end of their problems. Young adults will still require the sort of assistance set out in other parts of the Bill; it is fundamentally important for young people leaving care to have the security of a place to live, which would give them the comfort and support that they need.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is not often that I agree with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson)&#151;
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> You have been jolly rude about him!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Yes, and the record will show that he has been jolly rude about me on occasions. We shall agree to carry on in that way, to avoid an unbearably stifling consensus. The hon. Gentleman serves a valuable purpose in the Committee for that and other reasons.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argued eloquently for adequate accommodation arrangements to be made for people leaving care. I am constrained not to dare to anticipate what the Minister might say, but it appears that the powers that the hon. Gentleman wants, and the obligations placed on local authorities to provide appropriate accommodation, are in the Bill as drafted.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman did not state clearly the distinction between what is appropriate for those aged 16 or 17 and what is appropriate for those aged over 18. For those aged 16 and 17, a form of supported, rather than independent, living should be encouraged. He spoke about encouraging people to remain in care for as long as is appropriate and about reflecting as closely as possible the practice in natural families, in which children are fortunate enough to be cared for by their parents. I am sure that he would not want to create, through the availability of different types of independent housing for young people aged 16 and 17, perverse incentives for them to leave a protected environment to live independently.
<P>
The social housing system clearly needs to make better provision than it does at present for those aged 18 and leaving care. However, I hope that the Minister and the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it would not be helpful to hold out the offer of an independent flat to 16 and 17-year-olds. That would send the wrong signal and go very much against the grain of what the Bill was designed to achieve. I hope that my comments are helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre is absolutely right. In two-tier local government, the type of housing accommodation that can be offered to young people within one social services area varies enormously. We all recognise that different housing authorities have different demands made on them and different resources available to them. From my experience, it is clear that the willingness to participate in assisting a young person to move from care to independence varies. It is fundamental that district councils and housing authorities are involved in the planning stage and see that as part of corporate parenting.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that it is not appropriate to give permanent tenancies to young people aged 16 and 17, and local authorities are often reluctant to do so. Obviously, a permanent tenancy may be appropriate in some circumstances, such as when a young person has a child, but even then it may not always be the best option. I have seen too many disasters when young people are given a shiny new flat, but are not adequately equipped to take it on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Before we make further progress, I want to make it clear that I was not suggesting that 16 and 17-year-olds should have permanent tenancies. I understand that most local authorities do not allow under-18s to have such tenancies. However, they could be planned for. The Bill is in great part about planning for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. The housing Green Paper includes widening the vulnerable groups to allow care leavers to have permanent tenancies. I believe that young adults should be able to return to that option at an appropriate stage, when they have left university&#151;if they have been fortunate enough to go&#151;finished training or lived in temporary accommodation. They might have lived in a house in multiple occupation for a period, which is appropriate for some young people.
<P>
We welcome the commitment to license houses in multiple occupation and look forward to that important legislation. Licensing HMOs will mean that they receive a clean bill of health before young people move in. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said that those necessary types of accommodation are often the worst, because they are not regulated. For years, the Conservatives resisted pressure from local government, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats to license HMOs. I am sorry to depart from the consensus, but that is an important point. We must provide a safety net for vulnerable groups using that necessary accommodation. It is right that such young people should be able to take advantage of permanent tenancies&#151;not when they are aged 16 or 17, but later. We have a special responsibility to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to say that once people have been in care, they should have a pass that allows them to parachute into the top, or near to the top, of a housing list. Will he consider the dangers of perverse incentives? It may sound bizarre to us, but I can envisage people thinking that passing through the care system could give them a benefit over their peers later in life. We should not send out such a signal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I do not think that young people enter the care system with the long-term goal of getting a council flat. That argument has been made about young women, and I do not agree. The fact that an individual has left care should generate a sizeable number of points in any assessment of housing needs. Of course, if people have good jobs and can provide for themselves, they should not be given a permanent tenancy before people in more need. In assessing housing needs overall, however, the fact that someone has left care is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre for moving the amendment. As always, he spoke a great deal of common sense, and I am sure that he drew on his extensive experience. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was worried that he might be accused of doing my job for me in resisting the amendments, but my hon. Friend already did that, when he recognised that his amendment was to the wrong place in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 1 deals with 16 and 17-year-old children who are already in care and who are therefore being accommodated by the local authority in one of a variety of ways specified in section 23(2) of the Children Act. I assume that my hon. Friend is more anxious about those young people, defined as relevant children, who are 16 or 17 and not in local authority care, and what accommodation the local authority would be required to provide for them.
<P>
I can reassure my hon. Friend that the local authority will meet the housing needs of eligible children. Clause 2 deals with relevant children and will insert proposed new section 23B(8)(b) into the Children Act to place the responsibility for providing accommodation to the relevant child clearly on the local authority. My hon. Friend and I agree on the substance of his point. The local authority will meet the housing needs of both eligible and relevant children as part of its statutory corporate parenting role, which we will strengthen with the Bill. Proposed new section 23B(6) makes it clear that the local authority will also have to assess the housing needs of a young person who has left care. Proposed new section 19B(7) makes similar provision for eligible children.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee if I am being rather long-winded. I agree with the sensible suggestions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre. Unlike the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I do associate the word ``consensus'' with my hon. Friend. There is consensus about the housing requirements of the young people whom we are discussing today. I say to my hon. Friend, for whom I have a high regard, that I am absolutely confident that the Bill addresses precisely the concerns that he has raised. We shall ensure that the housing needs of these vulnerable young people are properly addressed.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) referred to other initiatives that the Government have taken. For example, we have issued new guidance to local authorities about homeless care leavers, to ensure that they are treated as priority cases. I can say to him with confidence on this occasion&#151;as on all occasions&#151;that we are on the job here. We do not intend vulnerable young people in this category to slip through the net, or to be provided with unsuitable accommodation.
<P>
We shall have regulation-making powers under the Bill to deal with the question of what constitutes suitable accommodation for young people. We can all imagine cases in which we would be concerned if a young, vulnerable care leaver were put into premises close to a dodgy inner-city area. There is comprehensive provision in the Bill covering both categories of children in relation to their accommodation requirements. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friend that we are on the job, and that we are not going to let these young people down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> What else can I do in the face of such a fulsome response? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 2, line 4, leave out `for' and insert `with'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 26, in page 2, line 5, after `shall', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`arrange with the care leaver to'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 27, in clause 2, page 3, line 19, leave out `for' and insert `with'.
<P>
No. 29, in clause 2, page 3, line 21, after `assessment', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with an eligible child or young person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 30, in clause 2, page 3, line 35, after `shall', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`arrange with the care leaver to'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Again, the amendments are an exploration of attitude. I am always happier to do things with people rather than to or for them. I want to explore how the process will be seen by people who may not be directly involved in it.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 is now technically flawed because we have abandoned the idea of using the term ``young persons'' and are sticking to the term ``children''. I hope that that will not give the parliamentary draftsmen too much of a problem. The other amendments seek to define how the pathway process should work. The Bill requires local authorities to produce a pathway plan for a child. That is not as satisfactory as producing it with that child or young person. I am not entirely confident that local authorities would not engage a pathway planner to sit in an office writing pathway plans that look absolutely wonderful, and send notes to the child concerned to say, ``This is your pathway plan''&#151;and that would be it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Is the hon. Gentleman deliberately or accidentally overlooking the assessment process that will precede the preparation of a pathway plan? That assessment process will, through regulations, include consultation, assessment, evaluation and record keeping. Surely that is the ``with'' bit of the process that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am interested in that contribution, because people are also assessed before sentence is passed by courts. Assessment does not necessarily imply a degree of co-operative working. I am concerned that this process should be seen to be co-operative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> The hon. Gentleman gave an example in which a social worker would send a pathway plan to a young person with a note saying, ``This is your pathway plan''. Does not he recognise that, in reality, the young person would send it back saying, ``No, that is your pathway&#151;file it somewhere appropriate.''? The idea that that happens is for the birds.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my case for me. That happens in relation to the statementing that education authorities carry out. A statement is issued, and an authority says, ``That is your statement. You can take it or leave it, or go to a tribunal.'' Tribunals are not involved in this context, and the Bill contains no provisions that would mitigate against bad social work practice. I do not suggest that field social workers who are involved with young people would condone bad pathway planning. However, that involves yet another performance indicator for local authorities. If they were asked, ``How long does it take for your pathways to be drawn up?'' someone might reply, ``The Bill says that we simply have to create a pathway for someone, but it does not require us to do that with them. Here is our pathway.'' I paint a particularly bleak picture for the purpose of argument.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reassure me that the Bill will not have that effect and will acknowledge that a partnership process is involved between the local authority as a parent and the relevant young person. Too many children become disaffected with their families because families tend to do things to them rather than with them. That process should not be duplicated in the instructions as to how a local authority should carry out its responsibilities. I hope that the Minister will consider our suggestion seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising an important point in this group of amendments&#151;in contrast with my view of the previous group of amendments that he moved. He said that the pathway plans will have to be agreed if they are to work&#151;they will have to be negotiated between the young person and the authority. There is common ground in the Committee on that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point is that the Bill's drafting suggests that a local authority that wanted to avoid carrying out its duty in accordance with the spirit of the Bill might be able to produce something that was called a pathway plan, which satisfied the Bill's requirements but which did not enter into its spirit. On Second Reading, the Minister discussed local authorities that did not live up to our expectations about fulfilling their duties relating to children, especially those in care. The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford was too quick when he said, ``Don't worry, that will never happen because the young person will resist the process.'' That may be true, but in the neat filing system of county hall, there may be a piece of paper headed, ``Pathway plan for child X'', which would satisfy the requirements of the social services inspectorate&#151;I assume that it will be involved&#151;when it examines the matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight made a good point. I hope that the Minister will respond by saying that the Government intend to use their regulation-making powers to ensure that the problem will not arise. I want to take the hon. Gentleman's point a little further by discussing the nature of the contract&#151;I use the term deliberately&#151;between the child or young person and the local authority. The pathway plan will be a course of action that is worked out through an iterative process between the authority in the parental role and the young person. Its essential elements involve the local authority telling the young person how it will support him or her in going down their chosen route. A series of milestones should be established to allow both parties to see that progress is being made down the pathway that is mapped out in the eponymous pathway plan.
<P>
That is merely a formalisation of the kind of process that goes on in most ordinary families. Unfortunately, such formalisation has to occur when children are cared for by bureaucracies rather than families. Many families find it financially strenuous to support children in further or higher education, but are happy to do so on the basis of an implicit contract whereby the child or young person commits himself or herself to a diligent pursuit of the pathway to which the family has agreed. We are trying, as far as is possible, to simulate the situation in a normal, functioning family.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the issues that has emerged from this short debate is that of negotiating power. If the pathway plan is to work, it must be negotiated and agreed between the young person and the local authority. It would be naive of us to think of that as a negotiation between equal parties. The authority is the body that provides the financial wherewithal to support the objectives of the plan, and the young person may feel that he is not in a position to negotiate effectively. Many of us have suffered the experience of entering into agreements under duress. One is never committed to them as one is committed to those that are properly negotiated and freely entered into. Will the Minister clarify how a proper sense of ownership will be given to both parties to the contract?
<P>
On Second Reading, I used the term ``sanctions'', which considerably livened up a rather consensual debate, and to which the Minister for Public Health took great exception. Given its connotations, it may be an emotive word, but I reiterate the underlying principle. If entering into an agreement or contract is to have any meaning, there must be a price to be paid for breaking it. The Minister's letter to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, which has been copied to other members of the Committee, made it clear that some of the local authority's obligations&#151;such as the obligation to provide accommodation and maintenance&#151;are absolute.
<P>
In response to the invective that was hurled at me on Second Reading for suggesting the need for sanctions, I point out that the Bill stipulates that, although accommodation and maintenance cannot be withdrawn, local authorities might, as part of a pathway plan, agree to give additional support to young people. There must be two-way traffic in that respect. If the local authority is prepared to go beyond the basic obligatory requirements by giving additional support to a young person to try to meet objectives that are mapped out in a pathway plan, it must be possible, as part of the process of monitoring performance against that pathway plan, for those additional benefits to be withdrawn if they are abused.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> The hon. Gentleman is painting with a broad brush. To allow us to understand how his sanctions would work, can he give us an example of a case in which it would, in his opinion, be appropriate to take something away? He talks about extras&#151;when would he claw them back?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thinking on my feet, I can imagine a situation in which a young person in my constituency in Surrey might make an agreement with the local authority to take up some kind of work in London that was low-paid, but which, nevertheless, provided some worthwhile learning or training experience. The local authority might decide to provide support by meeting the travel costs. If it subsequently turned out that the young person was not, in fact, doing what he was supposed to be doing in London&#151;let us say, he was spending his afternoons in Leicester square&#151;the local authority would be justified in withdrawing that benefit, because of the deviation from the agreed course of action and, thus, non-compliance with the pathway plan.
<P>
That does not seem especially controversial to me, and I was surprised that Government Members were so resistant to it on Second Reading. My understanding of general Government policy&#151;the Minister will correct me, if I am wrong&#151;is that young people should be given opportunities for education, training or work, but that there should not be a fourth option of life on benefit. That option should be available only for the very short term, to help someone over a particular problem. I believe that that is the Government's approach, and that it is the right approach. However, I am concerned that, in seeking to simulate for children in care and leaving care the situation of children who have been more fortunate, we do not inadvertently create a fourth option for children leaving care, because there is no sanction to deal with a young person who refuses to undertake education, training or work. We must understand how an authority dealing with such a young person is expected to respond, when someone says, ``I don't care what the Government's policy is for other children. The Bill gives me a fourth option, and I shall exploit it.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I was interested by the hon. Gentleman's example of a young person wasting his afternoons in Leicester square. Is he saying that the local authority would unilaterally withdraw support in such a case? The authority would be obliged to discuss the pathway plan with the young person again and find out why he was not achieving what had been agreed. We are considering an amendment that would place the word ``with'' in the clause, but the hon. Gentleman would place the entire onus on the local authority to drive the scheme, allowing the young person leaving care no scope to learn and grow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I acknowledged at the outset that there is a strong case for ensuring that the pathway plans become contracts, negotiated between young people and the authorities that look after them. I went on to say that, although I support that as an aspiration, I acknowledge that there may be difficulties in practice. One such difficulty is the unequal negotiating power, and perhaps things need beefing up in favour of the young person. Another difficulty is the lack of any sanction to deal with the case that none of us wants to see. For positive reasons, we all want to think about people who are being held back by lack of opportunity and who, if only they were given the opportunity, would respond positively and go on to higher and further education and training and seek work. Members of the Committee with direct experience will concede that some people will try to exploit the system and if they spot a loophole that allows them to avoid the three options that the Government are offering&#151;education, training and work&#151;they will exploit it. I am anxious to ensure that the pathway plan includes a mechanism to cover the problem.
<P>
Everything that I have heard from Ministers on the opportunities for young children and their obligations leads me to believe that the Government do not want to create a loophole that allows people not to pursue education, training or work. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is so and tell us how he will deal with the problem, perhaps through regulation-making powers. As I said on Second Reading, none of these concerns is in any way fatal to the Bill, but I want to hear from the Minister the details of how he intends to address these practical problems, which I am sure his officials have identified for him. He may be able to tell us about regulation-making powers that will ensure that the situation that I outlined does not arise. We would be failing in our duty if we did not recognise the possibility of there being a loophole in the Government's stated approach to the creation of opportunities for young people to ensure that they are productively engaged in education, training or work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> The attraction of this provision is that it lays down in law what all good social workers already do or want to do. If they are held back, that is due to lack of statutory backing or resources for their work. What is described is a process that begins with an assessment of needs, followed by the drawing up of a plan, followed by continual review of that plan. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, it is a formalisation of a process that any good parent would go through, but it is necessary because of the circumstances of the young people that we are discussing.
<P>
I want to speak about the uneven negotiating powers of local authorities and their workers and the person whose plan is being prepared. It is odd that the Bill does not state that the young person concerned should be directly involved at every stage. There is provision for regulations to state who will be consulted and it would be an amazing oversight if the person whose plan is being considered, whose needs are being assessed or whose plan is being reviewed was not included. The matter is so obvious and important that it surprises me that it is not covered in the Bill. Everyone else who may be consulted can be dealt with in regulations.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to a matter that I raised on Second Reading. I referred to advocacy for those who, for one reason or another&#151;for example, lack of confidence, ability or physical presence&#151;cannot make his or her case at the right time. That is when the powers of an advocate will come to the fore. Is there a provision for regulations to provide for advocates to be available for those whose plans are being considered and who want them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I want to follow on from the comments of the two previous speakers. In the relationship involved in drawing up a pathway plan, the inequality will be on the side of the young person concerned. We should be strengthening the Bill on the advocacy point rather than on the local authority point, because the local authority, by virtue of it strength and its position of influence over the young person, will be able to impose sanctions, so to speak. I feel strongly that ``sanctions'' is not the right word, but it was used by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. If a pathway plan is failing, the local authority official will insist on sitting down with the young person concerned and going through the plan. Basically, the young person will be told, ``We will no longer support you unless you are prepared to keep your side of the bargain.'' I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that that is what a responsible parent would do. Children and young people will exploit loopholes&#151;that is the nature of growing up, exploring boundaries and discovering what is, and is not, possible. I do not see why children in care will be any different in that respect from children in family relationships. They will always want to test what they can do within the boundaries that are set for them. I feel strongly that we should not put a system of sanctions in the Bill; we should leave this for the pathway plan.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight are interesting, although I approach them with some caution because I am not sure that the word ``with'' would strengthen the Bill; indeed, I am a little concerned that it might occasionally weaken it by removing some of the local authority's responsibility to ensure that the pathway plans are reviewed, updated and fully implemented. The word ``with'' in the Bill would allow poor local authorities to say, ``We are not getting co-operation from the young person in question, so we are washing our hands of responsibility for him.'' I am not sure whether amendments of this type are the best way of addressing the issue. Would not a better approach be the regulations that the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly, might make? Regulations should set out clearly how the young person would be involved in the drawing up of his pathway plan and how he or she will have access to independent advocacy at every stage. It is important to consider this method in the regulatory process that would follow from the Bill.
<P>
The amendments do not come in quite the right place. Amendment No. 25 is better suited to sub-paragraph (4), under which the local authority undertakes an assessment of a person's need. The assessment should come at that point: the pathway plan flows from there. I look forward to hearing the Minister's view of how the regulations might work, the ways in which independent advocacy will be available for young people and how he envisages the pathway plans working in practice to address some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge&#151;although, of course, this will not take in the entirety of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Will the Minister also say whether he thinks that the changes suggested by the amendments would improve the Bill or whether it would be better to look at regulations?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> The young people from Wales who came to the House earlier during the Bill's passage referred specifically to the word ``for'' rather than the word ``with'', as did Voices from Care from Wales and the children's charities from Wales. Today's discussion has helped to highlight the fact that it is not the language of the Bill, but its spirit that will determine how the pathway plans are carried out. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the Government's proposals for regulations to reinforce their message.
<P>
The plans will not succeed unless young persons and local authorities work together, and I support those who say that advocacy must play a part. I stress strongly that many of young people involved will have serious difficulties as a result of experiences that many of us cannot imagine; some will be disabled, or have learning difficulties. It is essential to build in a great deal of support for such children, so that they are in a position of strength when working with their local authority. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge should be aware that it is inappropriate to talk about sanctions in connection with a Bill that deals with the parental responsibilities of local authorities. Many young people have disturbed and damaged private lives, and the local authorities must work closely with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that understanding that one has responsibilities is an essential part of the maturing process? Does she agree that it is essential that young people understand their obligations as well as their rights?
<P>
<B>Ms Morgan:</B> I entirely accept that young people have responsibilities, but it is inappropriate to talk about sanctions in that context. Many young people will fail and then try again. The important point is that the local authority as the responsible parent will stick with them through their difficulties; the use of the word ``sanction'' weakens that case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Lady has usefully provoked me to clarify my point. Of course, young people will fail, but I was talking, not about an innocent failure, but about a case in which a young person deliberately abuses what is made available to him or her.
<P>
<B>Ms Morgan:</B> Abuse of the system is often a form of mistake made by the young person&#151;we must remember the background of many of these young people. In that context the word ``sanction'' is inappropriate. However, I entirely agree that young people have a responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The debate has been useful in raising important issues of policy and practice in respect of how the Bill will operate after it receives Royal Assent, which I hope will be soon.
<P>
We are discussing human relations between young people in care and those who are entrusted with their care through the local authority. The Bill, the regulations and the guidance could go into every nook and cranny and specify every aspect of that relationship; they could explain the process of negotiation and how the pathway plan will evolve; but the on-going relationship between a young person and his or her adviser or members of the care team looking after that young person must be based on trust, confidence and mutual respect. I shall be honest with the Committee and say that we, as Members of Parliament, know from our own lives and experience that one cannot legislate for good relationships. However, the Bill will establish a new process that will vastly improve the position of children leaving care, give them a better start in life and equip them for adult life. Those are things that we have consistently failed to do in the past.
<P>
The Bill provides mechanisms to achieve those aims in the expanded range of duties, and the pathway plan and young person's adviser described in clause 1. In requiring the local authority to provide a pathway plan for young persons we are trying to make a break between how things were done in the past and how they should be done in future: we have expressed that intention through the use of the word ``for'', but it would be a mistake to assume that that excludes the word ``with''. It does not. Use of the word ``for'' over and above the word ``with'' covers all the contingencies that we can envisage. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) who has experience of working with young people, has hit the nail on the head. If we had chosen ``with'' rather than ``for'' there would have been a danger of some local authorities using it as a mechanism to avoid preparing a pathway plan by claiming that it was impossible to produce it ``with'' the child.
<P>
We expect local authorities, in discharging their statutory responsibilities, to behave reasonably and responsibly and to pursue the best-quality social care practice available, but, as we know, that does not always happen. We are trying to construct local authorities' new duties and responsibilities in a way that will prevent such adverse consequences arising&#151;although, obviously, I cannot say that they will never arise. An opportunity to achieve that is provided through the regulation-making power on the face of the Bill, which clearly specifies the process by which the pathway plan should be produced. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North raised concerns about her contacts with young people on this matter: we will ensure that young people are involved in the preparation of the plan.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge talked about ownership of the plan, which is of fundamental importance. We want such a sense of ownership to emerge, because the plan's value would be compromised without it. We want to encourage responsibility&#151;a theme addressed by many hon. Members. Involving the young person fully in the preparation of the pathway plan is a classic way of demonstrating that responsibility and ensuring that the assessment system adds value to the process of a child leaving care. There is no point going through the process if we do not add value to that young person's experience, and the pathway plan is a central mechanism, but it is likely to achieve the desired success only if we can ensure the young person's full involvement in its preparation. Some hon. Members have overlooked the important fact that the young person's adviser is likely to play an influential role in helping the young person in his or her negotiations with the local authority during the preparation of the plan.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North talked about the importance of advocacy in the context of the balance of the relationship between the local authority and the young person. We have made it clear before, and I am happy to make it clear again today, that we intend young people to have access to proper advocacy services as part of the complaints procedure that social services are required to operate under local authorities social services legislation. We will introduce statutory guidance to ensure that there is access to proper advocates, where necessary.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for mentioning the social services complaints procedure, because there is no specific complaint to the tribunal system allowed if there is a profound disagreement about the pathway. Could the young person and his or her adviser use the social services complaints procedure to resolve matters that could not be negotiated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> In extreme cases they could do that. We all want to ensure that the process of drawing up a pathway plan is not an acrimonious, bitter experience, or the rather bleak process conjured up by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. A combination of what is on the face of the Bill, the regulations and the guidance will be needed to get the process right. The guidance will be important, because it will allow us to state matters more subtly than is possible in regulations. Other amendments have been tabled on what the regulations and the guidance should contain. Guidance is, by definition, a slightly more flexible tool because it allows us to go into a little more detail to cover the wider range of possibilities that may emerge, whereas regulations tend to provide a take-it-or-leave-it solution to problems. Guidance is far more subtle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> How might the guidance address the need for independent advocacy? The Minister knows that personal advisers are appointed by the local authority; therefore, although they may be drawn from the voluntary sector and be independent, some young people may not regard advisers as their advocates because of the link with the local authority. Will the guidance set out how local authorities might ensure that local voluntary advocacy services are open to young people at the planning stage, for example, so that they can turn to another person for advice on a draft pathway plan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The Secretary of State has powers to issue statutory guidance under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. We intend to use those powers to ensure that young people have access to an independent advocacy service. However, there are capacity constraints in the system: advocacy services are fairly well established in some parts of the country, but not everywhere. We need to increase the capacity to provide specialist services for children in dispute with their local authorities about aspects of the care planning process or negotiations about the pathway plan.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot tell the hon. Member for Ceredigion about the details of the guidance because, as he will be aware, we are still consulting. A fortnight ago, we issued the consultation document, which proposes changes to the social services complaints procedure. One issue under consideration is that raised by the hon. Gentleman: if there is a dispute, to whom does a young person go and what powers do they have to help resolve the dispute?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister says that guidance is a more subtle and flexible tool than regulations. Will the statutory guidance be subject at any stage to parliamentary scrutiny, as regulations are? If not, we shall have to satisfy ourselves about the Government's intentions regarding statutory guidance during the proceedings of this Committee, given that such guidance may form an important part of the overall legislative picture.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should think that the hon. Gentleman knows my answer. Affirmative or negative resolution procedures would be followed in respect of regulations, whereas the statutory guidance issued to local authorities by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State under section 7 would not. The House gave the Secretary of State that function and it is a long-standing power provided by the principle legislation&#151;the 1970 Act&#151;under which local authorities discharge their social services responsibilities. At the time that that legislation was passed, the House chose to give the Secretary of State powers to issue guidance and laid down the procedures that should be followed.
<P>
We always consult widely about guidance. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not conjure something up in the dead of night and bundle it out to local authorities the following morning. We always consult the key interested parties. If the hon. Gentleman and his party want to be consulted on the statutory guidance, I have no objection to sending the guidance to him, or to any other hon. Member, so that they can consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful. For the record, I accept the Minister's offer on behalf of my party. We would be happy to be consulted on the statutory guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am always happy to keep the hon. Gentleman on board. I hope that he is pleased with that. There is absolutely no reason why the hon. Gentleman and his party should not offer comments to the Secretary of State now, while he is consulting. The consultation is public, carried out through the local authority and the Local Government Association, in which his party is actively represented, and political parties have a variety of other opportunities to participate in the consultation process. All this might be taking us slightly wide of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of advocacy, will it be restricted to help with making complaints about resources? Does he acknowledge the positive liberating power of advocacy in many other situations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want to limit the range of circumstances in which children in care have access to advocacy arrangements and I do not have it in mind to confine advocacy to complaints about resources. That would not be sensible. Resources might be an important cause of friction between a young person and a local authority, but our debate shows that concerns could go much wider. We have heard about career plans, educational opportunities, housing and a variety of other issues that might cause a young person concern during the development of his or her pathway plan.
<P>
I apologise again for being long-winded, but I am anxious to ensure that the Committee does not draw the wrong conclusion from our choice of words in the Bill. I am afraid that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight did so. He assumed that we did not plan to work with young people and children in developing the plans. Of course we shall do so. We shall use a combination of regulatory powers to determine who can and cannot be involved in the assessments, and more detailed guidance on some of the wider concerns that have been raised. I am sure that everyone who has spoken understands that the best way of making the pathway plan successful is for the young person to have full ownership and participate actively in its preparation and development. It would be utterly stupid to imagine that the pathway plan could work without that.
<P>
I hope that the Committee is confident about the Government's intentions and why we want to resist the proposals. I am obliged to say that amendment No. 29 is horribly defective. It refers to eligible children, but ought to refer to relevant children, because clause 2 deals only with relevant children.
<P>
The wider issue of sanctions for non-compliance with aspects of the pathway plan was also raised, but later amendments deal with that. If the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge can be patient, I shall answer his concerns then.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> This has been an interesting debate. I tabled the amendments to discover whether the Bill could enshrine the sort of relationship that exists between parents and their children in a normal family. In such a relationship, the children have input, but do not necessarily dictate the outcomes. Input into the pathway plan would guarantee a similar relationship for relevant children&#151;I am grateful to the Minister for putting me right on the terminology. I am much reassured by what I have heard this morning.
<P>
I was surprised that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge saw my amendments as strengthening the hand of the local authority, because my intention was to strengthen the hand of the relevant young person. I am certain that the process will not always be smooth and happy&#151;after all, it not so in natural families. The relationship between relevant young persons and the local authority will be difficult at times, and the young people may waste their time in Leicester square, or if they are children of the proper sort, at Lords. A related question is that of how one defines education. It means more than simply attending lectures. I am not sure whether I spent much time attending lectures at medical school, but I qualified and gained much experience while I was there. It was wonderful to do that at the taxpayer's expense.
<P>
I am sure that we will debate further the sanctions proposed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the restrictions on the activity of younger persons when we reach later amendments. I understand that there is a hang-up about using enabling words in enabling legislation, and, given the Minister's undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 4, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) The assessment referred to in (4) above shall be carried out<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the case of a child who is an eligible child at the date this section comes into force, within three months of the coming into force of this section; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in the case of a child who attains the age of sixteen after the coming into force of this section, not earlier than three months before he attains that age and not later than three months after he attains that age.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment represents a modest amendment and an attempt to be helpful. Clause 1 would insert into the Children Act new paragraph 19B(4), which says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the local authority shall carry out an assessment
<P>
</UL></FONT>of the child's needs. That paragraph does not say when such an assessment shall be conducted, so the amendment suggests a window of six months, from three months before the child reaches 16 until three months after the child attains that age. That may not be the right length of time, or the appropriate point at which to place the window in the child's life, but the Minister has said on Second Reading and elsewhere that one of his concerns is that there is a wide gap between best and worst practice among local authorities. Given what we have been told, we have to proceed on the assumption that local authorities may attempt to avoid complying with the spirit, if not the letter, of the requirements that will be placed on them.
<P>
My interpretation of the Bill suggests that the letter of the law does not clarify the time scale in which an authority has to make an assessment, so the amendment is a probing one, designed to establish whether and how the Government intend to deal with that. Could regulations be used? If so, which regulation-making power would be used? Would it not be better to place the relevant provisions in the Bill? Substantively, we need to establish at what point in a child's career the Government consider it most appropriate for the assessment to be made. Should it be made well before they are 16, at 16 or immediately after 16? Constraints on local authorities' human resources mean that we cannot be too prescriptive. If we said that the matter had to be done on, or within a week of, a person's 16th birthday, practical difficulties would arise.
<P>
The amendment is intended to flag up a potential loophole available to local authorities that are minded to try to exploit the situation. The Minister said that local authorities have previously tried to circumvent the spirit of the duties that have been imposed on them, so I look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I welcome the amendment. It is important to discuss the likely time scale for the preparation of the plans. There is an obvious loophole, which could be exploited by an inefficient, ineffective of negligent local authority. My reading of proposed paragraph 19B(7) suggests that it will give the Secretary of State the necessary powers to make regulations regarding the timing of the preparation of such plans. I hope that the Minister will confirm that and say what time scale the Government believe would be effective. Young people could be kept waiting while local authorities plead numerous resource problems or staffing difficulties, but such important provisions must be triggered within a realistic timetable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for moving the amendment, which touches on an important issue that we intend to deal with in regulations and guidance. The hon. Member for Ceredigion is right to say that proposed paragraph 19B(7) will give us the power to make the relevant regulations. It is always encouraging when Opposition Members help me out. I hope that I can offer help to them, too.
<P>
Whenever we issue guidance or regulations&#151;I have made this clear in previous debates&#151;there will be proper and full consultation with all interested parties. I am happy to extend that courtesy to all Opposition spokespersons, if that would be helpful. If the provisions were set out in the Bill, it would preclude the need for such a consultation exercise&#151;there would be no point in having it. We are currently determining whether the relevant period should be three or six months; we have not started that consultation process, but we should do so soon. That is another reason for dealing with the matter in regulations and guidance.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about the six-month window, and we shall make such a proposal in the draft guidance relating to the reassessment process. However, I have a problem with the three-month time scale that he proposes for the other category of young person that he mentioned, because it would clash directly with exams preparation and other events in the life of a young person aged about 16. A slightly longer window&#151;perhaps four months&#151;might be required for that assessment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although we agree with the sentiment of the amendments, we prefer, for the reasons that I have given, to deal with the matter through regulations and guidance. We shall consult about the six-month window and consider the possibility of a four-month window for other children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I forgot to make one point when I made my opening remarks. I suggested a window of six months before and after the 16th birthday, but my understanding of the definitions in subsection (4) is that an assessment can be carried out only for an eligible child&#151;that is, a child who is 16 or 17. Notwithstanding the regulation-making powers under subsection (7), the Secretary of State would not have the power to make a regulation that created a window for an assessment that began before the child was sixteen, because they would not be eligible until that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It would be possible for the local authority to start the assessment process in advance of a young person's 16th birthday. We would be concerned if the Bill created difficulties in that respect, but I do not believe that it does.
<P>
I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and share his concern&#151;and that of the hon. Member for Ceredigion&#151;that the assessment should take place within a defined period of time. We shall clearly spell that out in the guidance or regulations. I accept the logic behind the six-month period; that would be sensible. However, in relation to the first group of children in the amendment&#151;those who are eligible at the date on which the section comes into force&#151;the proposed three-month period might create difficulties, given that many of those young people will be involved in exams. A longer period of time might be required to complete the assessment process in that respect.
<P>
I accept the substance of the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but the matter can be dealt with otherwise than in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Do the Minister's remarks about the first group of eligible children in the amendment preparing for exams give us a clue about when he expects the section to come into force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> For clarification, we have already said that we expect that the commencement of the Bill will begin next April, which would clash with exam preparations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I take the Minister's point. It would not be appropriate to allow the two to interfere with each other.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his comments about the principle behind the amendment. I agree that it is probably best to deal with the matter through regulations, and he has clearly stated that that is the Government's intention.
<P>
I would appreciate it if he and his officials would consider the way in which the definition of an eligible child works, to ensure that it is clear that a local authority can&#151;perhaps even should&#151;begin the process before the person in question becomes an eligible child.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 10, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and review procedures for the purposes of sub-paragraph (5).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is another attempt to be helpful. New sub-paragraph (7), which we have just discussed, allows the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for assessments under new sub-paragraph (4). That will be required to deal with not only the timing of assessments, but the matters that they will take into account, how they will be conducted, and the people who will be consulted. For some children in care, it may be appropriate for their parents to be consulted on, and involved in, the process. It would be equally important to lay down procedures for reviewing plans. It is not clear that a corresponding power is to be given to the Secretary of State in relation to the local authority's obligations under new sub-paragraph (5), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The local authority shall keep the pathway plan under regular review.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The simplest way to address that problem would be to insert into new sub-paragraph (7) an additional regulation-making power for the Secretary of State to make provision for the conduct of those reviews. In cases where an agreed conclusion to a review proves difficult to reach, it might be appropriate to provide for an appeal against the outcome. The Secretary of State will need such a power, which would ensure uniformity in the approach to reviews. I assume that the Government, having given themselves the power to make regulations about assessment, seek to ensure a degree of uniformity in the carrying out of assessments. That should extend to reviews.
<P>
It is easy to envisage some authorities discharging their duties regarding plans and reviews more diligently than others, unless regulations ensure that that does not happen. I fear that, if the regulations address only the assessment procedure and the plan-making procedure, those authorities not complying diligently with the spirit of the Act might carry out the assessment and make the plan, but then fail to review it appropriately.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will treat these as helpful suggestions and tell us, if he is not minded to accept the amendment, how he intends to ensure that reviews are properly conducted under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has fulfilled a useful purpose in drawing attention to this issue. The way in which the Bill is laid out may have caused him some confusion about our intentions. Clause 3 on page 6 of the Bill makes provision, in proposed new section 23E(2), for a power to make regulations along the lines that he proposes. I assure him that the power to issue regulations covering the issues that he has identified is already in the Bill. We do not need to duplicate such a provision in clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Indeed, I see that clause 1 goes on from dealing with assessments to deal with pathway plans, and then comes back to give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations in relation to assessments. However, as the Minister rightly said, the power to make regulations in relation to pathway plan reviews is contained in clause 3. That appears to address my concern, although I cannot be absolutely certain, having had only a moment since he drew my attention to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 14, after `19C', insert `(1)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 16, after `adviser', add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to persons or classes of persons who are
<P>
(i) fit to be personal advisers; and
<P>
(ii) not fit to be personal advisers.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to probe the Minister as to the Secretary of State's intention in specifying who should act as personal advisers under the provisions of proposed new section 19C.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 would give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations in relation to the classes of persons who were fit to be personal advisers, and the classes of persons who were not. I want to establish , first, how the Government will ensure that appropriate personal advisers are appointed and, secondly and substantively, what sort of people and organisations the Minister expects to fill the role. I flagged the matter on Second Reading, so it will be no surprise to the Minister to hear that I want to ensure that the Government envisage a proper role for voluntary organisations in providing personal advisers for young people.
<P>
On Second Reading, I referred to Surrey county council, which has subcontracted its scheme for care leavers to a voluntary organisation with good initial results. We believe that personal advisers should come from outside the social work profession and that they should have no direct association with the local authority that is caring for the child. I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether he shares that view.
<P>
During consideration of the Care Standards Bill and the way in which children in care are offered additional protection, the Minister commented on the failure of many local authorities to observe to the letter their duties under the 1989 Act in respect of visitors for children, who would perform a function similar to that of the personal advisers that we are discussing. It is important to ensure that appropriate people who can perform the function that we envisage in new section 19C are available to young people and that unsuitable people are not allowed or able to slip into the role. Will the Minister explain how the Government envisage the role being filled and the sort of people they expect to perform the vital task. Comments from other hon. Members during earlier debates made it clear that the role of personal adviser will be significant in the relationship between the young person and the local authority, and the negotiation and agreement of a pathway plan and its implementation. It is vital that we ensure that the role is performed by the right sort of people .
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> It is most important that advisers have the trust and confidence of young people and that young people have a strong element of choice in who becomes their adviser.
<P>
It is also important that we do not restrict who qualifies to be advisers. People who would not immediately be considered suitable might be ideal for a particular young person and it would be regrettable if we specified that advisers should be ex-social workers or members of specific voluntary bodies. However, we should bear in mind that advisers must have the right qualities and background. The way in which advisers are chosen in Wales will be the duty of the National Assembly for Wales, but I hope that the Assembly and the Secretary of State will bear in mind that unusual people can sometimes provide the advice that young people need. It is also important that there be a proper support structure for personal advisers; they will be a crucial element of the young person's development. Support for advisers must be built in and should be agreed at the beginning of their appointment.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> What arrangements will there be to help advisers to do the job in an informed way? I am thinking about access to records, and I assume that a young person under the age of 18 will not, necessarily, have such access. Will the nominated adviser have access to records, so that informed advice can be given to the young person?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We have come to a point in our discussion at which we need to make a judgment call about what we want to do in the Bill, what can be done in regulations or guidance and what can be left to local discretion. To keep the debate in the correct context, we should remember that responsibility for employing such people will rest with the local authorities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge suggested that we should specify in regulations who would be fit. I do not see how we could do that, without setting out a list of formal qualifications&#151;perhaps professional, perhaps vocational. That is not the right way: the personal attributes that someone might bring to the role of adviser to a young person are of equal, if not greater, importance. I have thought long and hard about the suggestion that we should have regulations, but I am not convinced. In my mind's eye, I cannot see what form regulations defining someone's personal attributes would take. I am sure that most members of the Committee would have similar difficulties. Those of us who have employed people will be in favour of allowing for a personal judgment call about the attributes of the person who wants to act as an adviser-so will the young person involved, given the sensitivity and importance of the relationship. In the Government's view, this is an area in which we should not be too prescriptive. Regulations might force us into a straitjacket, and that would be counter-productive. We want to leave the matter to the discretion of the local authority, although we shall probably deal with it in the statutory guidance that we issue to local authorities on how the Bill should be applied at that level. That strikes the right balance between ensuring that we give the authorities some assistance in deciding who should be employed, while not fettering unreasonably their discretion to draw upon the widest possible range of people of all backgrounds who might be suitable.
<P>
With regard to what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, I stress that we do not want to exclude social workers from working as advisers to young people. We want to exclude unsuitable people from working with children in that role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Could someone who is employed full-time by the authority&#151;the corporate parent&#151; be a young person's adviser and represent him in negotiations with that authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, that would be possible. We will consider that situation in our discussions with local authorities about the guidance that we have in mind. I do not know how common such a case would be, but I will not rule it out as a possibility.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee have been involved in the passage of the Protection of Children Act 1999. That Act, which we intend to bring into effect in October, will apply to employment in that setting, so there will be no question of unsuitable people who should not work with children slipping through the net.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I have understood the Bill correctly, personal advisers will be appointed in respect of young people who are not covered by the Protection of Children Act because they are over 18; yet I imagine that they will not be vulnerable adults within the context of this Bill. Will the people in question be prohibited from being personal advisers to people over 18?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My understanding is that they will be, but I shall look into the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman about it. There is no question but that the Protection of Children Act will apply to employment as a young person's adviser. It will be possible for checks to be made against the list maintained by the Secretary of State under that Act. Under those provisions, it will be impossible for a local authority, or any other employer, to employ someone in such a position if his or her name is on the list and it will be an offence for anyone on the protection of children list maintained by the Secretary of State to seek such employment.
<P>
I accept much of what the hon. Gentleman said about the need to ensure that we help local authorities to implement the measure sensibly; given the variety of different circumstances that are likely to arise, it is probably sensible not to be over-prescriptive in regulations at this stage, because we want to avoid a formulaic, list-based statement of the qualifications and personal attributes that a young person's adviser should have. It is a complex issue, which cannot be dealt with sensibly through regulations.
<P>
This is a classic case of guidance giving us greater flexibility in a complex range of circumstances, and my instinct is that the statutory guidance in section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 should be our choice. It is not take-it-or-leave-it guidance. Local authorities are required to take it into account when they exercise their social services functions.
<P>
I hope that I have not given members of the Committee cause for concern about how we shall deal with the issues. We are not complacent about them; we want to ensure that proper safeguards are in place so that unsuitable people do not work with young people leaving care. Regulations are not the best way to resolve the outstanding issues, which are best dealt with by using the guidance powers in section 7.
<P>
<B>Dr Brand:</B> Before the Minister sits down, I should be grateful if he would respond to my point about access to advisers' records in respect of young people over 18 and those between the ages of 16 and 18.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I had forgotten that the hon. Gentleman had made that point and I am grateful to him for drawing it to my attention. I hope that there might be an opportunity to answer his questions later in the Committee. It would not be sensible to do so now, as it is a complex issue involving data protection and other matters, and I want to give the hon. Gentleman a full response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid I cannot tell the Minister that his comments have allayed my concerns. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations, not require him to do so. I thought that the Secretary of State might find it useful to have such a power when it was necessary to regulate the type of persons used as personal advisers&#151;for example, if local authorities were failing to appoint appropriate people. The Minister made it clear that guidance will be used to deal with such matters, but guidance is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In some respects, that is not a cause of concern: the Minister always approaches these matters sensibly and I have no fears about him formulating the guidance, but he will not always be there and we are making legislation that will have to last for a long time.
<P>
I was slightly alarmed when the hon. Member for Cardiff, North talked about ``unusual'' people being appropriate for employment in some cases as personal advisers. I am not too sure what she means by unusual people. The hon. Lady has drawn attention to the fact that authorities might have widely differing views about who is an appropriate person to act as a personal adviser to a young person. Relatively few authorities are currently under what might be described as extreme political control, but we need not cast our minds too far back to recall authorities that were and the sort of policies that they espoused. I do not think that the Minister would want such policies to determine who is a suitable person to be a young person's adviser.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> By ``unusual'' person, I meant someone whom of one might not automatically think. We should think, not of any particular group of people, but of someone who is best for the young person. I do not want the role to be restricted to people with a social work background. An ex-foster carer or someone who has provided mentoring services might act as a personal adviser&#151;someone who might not necessarily have professional qualifications in social work, but who has the personal qualities that my hon. Friend the Minister described. It is important that we are not restrictive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I can envisage a situation in which not all personal advisers are former or current social workers or foster carers and thus embedded in the system, but come from the world beyond and can help to pull the young person out of care. The hon. Lady has done the Committee a service by using the term ``unusual'', because it draws attention to the fact that the large number of people who will appoint the advisers might hold disparate views on the type of people who would be appropriate. It was with that in mind that we tabled the amendment. I do not think for a moment that the Minister is about to allow wacky local authorities in some obscure part of the country to start appointing people whom he considers to be wholly inappropriate, but it is disappointing to hear that he intends to use guidance to restrict the unfettered choice that the hon. Lady has described. I agree with other hon. Members about the need for support for personal advisers; they will have to deal with some quite difficult young people and will therefore need considerable support.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A question has arisen in my mind about who makes the choice. The word ``choice'' has been used frequently, and hon. Members have said that young people must have a large say in who is appointed as a personal adviser. It is self-evident that if an adviser whom the young person does not like is foisted on him or her, the relationship is unlikely to be fruitful. Nevertheless, the Bill does not require the local authority to consult the child when appointing a personal adviser. The authority could comply with its statutory duty simply by marrying a list of names of children to a list of names of advisers, although that is clearly not the intention behind the provisions.
<P>
It would not stretch the bounds of imagination too far to think that, if young people could nominate their advisers without being restrained by regulations about appropriate people, they might suggest inappropriate people. We all accept that 16 and 17-year-olds are not necessarily best qualified to identify the role models who will prove to be most suitable for them. Should the local authority or the young person make the decision? Will the young person have a power of veto? That issue remains unresolved.
<P>
How much time will the advisers spend with the young people for whom they are responsible? How much will be invested in the exercise? I remind the Minister of what the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said on Second Reading&#151;incidentally, the right hon. Gentleman made the same comments when he announced the Government's intention to introduce the Bill, 18 months ago. He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Then there is the shoulder to cry on, the encouragement to do a bit more work at school or college, the morale-boosting chat before going to an interview, the consolation afterwards if the interview goes wrong, or the celebration if it goes right. Young people want someone to provide a lift when they want to go somewhere, a meal, or, when they are a bit older, someone to take them for a drink, someone to get the washing done, someone to touch for a tenner when they are skint, someone to keep an eye on them, someone who cares about them.&#151;[Official Report, 21 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 377-78.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether it was his understanding that the young persons' advisers would carry out all those functions. I shall not read out his whole response, which was rather long; suffice it to say that he said that, in so far as it was possible, he hoped that the young persons' advisers would take on those roles, although they might not be able to fulfil all those functions. He envisaged a fairly continuous relationship between the adviser and the young person, which would involve quite a lot of time and resources. That relationship is different from one in which the adviser has only irregular contact with the young person, for example, when plans are being drawn up or reviewed. Perhaps the Minister could give us an idea of the number of advisers' hours available per young person, as that would provide a better picture of how the relationship will work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras did not relate only to young persons' advisers, particularly as he made similar comments when he announced that the Bill would be introduced? My right hon. Friend was talking about the many aspects of the Bill that would provide support similar to that derived from normal parenting. If young people are not leaving care at 16 and 17, but staying in education until they are 24, we must create proper pathways for them and ensure that more money is available for care leavers. It is a question of the whole package. We must provide the simple support mechanisms that ordinary children expect, rather than just young persons' personal advisers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is not for me to speculate on what the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras had in mind when he said originally that young people wanted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>someone to provide a lift when they want to go somewhere...someone to take them for a drink, someone to get the washing done, someone to touch for a tenner when they are skint, someone to keep an eye on them, someone who cares.&#151;[Official Report, 21 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 377-78.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>The next time that the right hon. Gentleman and I interacted at the Dispatch Box, he accused me of stooping to bathos, but I am not sure whether he was in a position to make such an accusation, having used the above words.
<P>
I ask the Minister to clarify the amount of time&#151;and therefore money&#151;available to support personal advisers. It is not clear whether the personal adviser will see the child once a month, once a quarter, when the plan is reviewed, every week or every day. Will the adviser be even more accessible than that? Will he or she live nearby, expecting a knock on the door and a request for a lift to the cinema or for a tenner? We must have a clearer idea of the role of young persons' advisers. At one end of the spectrum, the role could be relatively formal, with the adviser involved in the assessment, drawing up and review of a plan; at the other, it could involve what by anybody's stretch of the imagination is the opposite extreme described by the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, wherein the adviser is on tap 24 hours a day to provide additional support services.
<P>
The debate has left me deeply unhappy about the definition of a personal adviser. I would not want that aspect of the Bill to lead to unexpected and undesirable outcomes, but, from comments made, it seems that we may have difficulties with some of what is envisaged. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am obviously keen not to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, nor to give him any reason to feel uncomfortable with our proposals. He asked a number of specific questions but, with the greatest of respect, it would be difficult to answer them with the precision that he wants. I am sure that he has had a chance to consider the consultation document ``Me, Survive, Out There?'' in which we spell out in considerable detail our initial thinking about those who might act as a young person's adviser and the responsibilities and roles that they would fulfil. The hon. Gentleman has the opportunity to reflect further on that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the extent of contact between an adviser and a young person. Again, it is difficult to be prescriptive. The amount of contact will vary enormously from one young person to another, and depend on a huge variety of circumstances. It would not be sensible for me to say that we expect the typical contact to be 10, five or 40 hours a week, because the needs of individual children and young people vary enormously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Can the Minister help us by saying what resources will be available so that we know, on average, how many contact hours there will be per child?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman knows that the answer to that question is that I cannot give him a precise figure for resources. We shall make an announcement in the next spending review on the resources available to social services. Decisions about implementation of the Bill will be heavily consequent upon that announcement; as my noble Friend the Lord Hunt of Kings Heath made it clear in another place, we shall not ask local authorities to take on new responsibilities and duties unless we provide them with the resources to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Presumably, then, the Minister envisages minimum requirements being imposed on local authorities through guidance or regulations; otherwise, the exercise of appointing personal advisers will be merely a paper exercise, matching names together on a file. What will the minimum contact be? Will it, for example, accord with the guidance offered under quality protects, of a contact episode once every three months?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, it would not be sensible to set that as the minimum contact level.
<P>
The process will not be a paper exercise. A local authority would not be able to discharge its responsibilities to appoint a young person's adviser in a mechanistic way, without making clear the relationship expected between the young person's adviser and the extent and degree of contact between them. That would have to be part and parcel of the process of appointing a young person's adviser.
<P>
There are powers in new section 23D(2) to issue regulations relating to the functions of young persons' advisers. The hon. Gentleman focused on the personal qualities and attributes of those important new advisers, although he also expressed concern about what they do. We are all anxious to ensure that the right people are appointed and guidance is the best way to do so, because it enables us to go into the relevant issues in more detail than we could do in regulations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight was anxious about access to personal files; we are not aware of any difficulties that would prevent a young person's adviser having access to information that the hon. Gentleman would think appropriate. That will be especially important in the negotiations leading to the preparation of the pathway plan, which we would expect the adviser to look at.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am pleased to hear that. I asked the question because in my constituency advocates acting for people with learning disabilities have problems gaining access to their clients' notes, in spite of having their consent to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I suspect that the cases relate to medical records. I shall explore the matter if the hon. Gentleman will write to me about it. Sensitivity about access to medical records is appropriate, but the individual should decide who sees his medical records and we do not want to change that. As for young persons' advisers and their access to files relating to a child or young person, there will be no problem about that, but we are happy to give further thought to the matter. If necessary, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that subject.
<P>
I might not have satisfied the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but not for want of trying. I am at one with the hon. Gentleman in his appreciation of the risks involved and his anxiety about what young persons' advisers will do, who they should be and what their relationship with the young person will be. The Bill makes it clear that it is the local authority's responsibility to arrange the appointment of a young person's adviser. As in the preparation of a pathway plan, it will be important to involve the child or young person as fully as possible in the appointment of the young person's adviser.
<P>
