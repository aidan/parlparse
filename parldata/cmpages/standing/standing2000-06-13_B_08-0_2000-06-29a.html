<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I beg to move amendment No. 254,
<P>
in page 23, line 29, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) the Knights of St. Columbanus;
<P>
(h) Opus Dei;
<P>
(i) the Irish National Foresters; or
<P>
(j) the Jesuits.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the view of the Ulster Unionist party that the clause should be removed altogether. Therefore, we shall vote against its inclusion in the Bill when the time comes. However, as the Government are reluctant to change very much in the Bill, we wish to add to it.
<P>
Clause 47(1) lists several registrable associations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, the Independent Loyal Orange Institution, the Masonic Lodge, the Orange Order, and the Royal Black Preceptory. We wish to add the Knights of St. Columbanus, Opus Dei and the Irish National Foresters.
<P>
As I understand it, the Knights of St. Columbanus is an organisation that is designed to promote the Roman Catholic faith and, therefore, it seems to be somewhat different from the Orange Institution. I know very little about the Opus Dei, other than what the Minister of State said the other day when he remarked that he did not know whether any members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Opus Dei or any other religious grouping that adheres to a strict code of religious views and principles. From that, we must assume that it is a religious grouping that adheres to a strict code of religious views and principles.
<P>
We have also included in our amendment the Irish National Foresters. That organisation is so secretive that we could not find out anything about it from our research, so we assume that it is a secret organisation. In addition, we have included the Jesuits. I am told that one must be a Roman Catholic priest in order to be a Jesuit. I do not know whether that it true, but presumably it would be possible to give up the priesthood or to be in training for the priesthood and to be a Jesuit, so there could be a Jesuit in the RUC.
<P>
This whole thing is stupid anyway, but if the Government are including so many other organisations, we might as well include a few more. However, I certainly disapprove of the Orange Order being included in such a list. I have a copy of the qualifications of an Orangeman, which are very good. It says that an Orangeman should,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome, and scrupulously avoid countenancing . . . any act or ceremony of Roman Worship; he should, by all lawful means resist the ascendancy of that Church, its encroachments, and the extension of its power, ever abstaining from all uncharitable words, actions, or sentiments towards any Roman Catholic.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the Orange Order is opposed to the Roman Catholic Church and its doctrines, it is not in any way against Catholics; it believes that they have every right to hold whatever doctrines they wish. In seeking to propagate the Protestant religion, it acts with compassion and gives significance to the rites of Catholic people.
<P>
That is no different from the doctrines of the main Protestant denominations. Article 31 of the 39 articles of the Church of Ireland, which are the equivalent of those of the Anglican Church, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ to the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The fact is that the doctrines of the Orange Institution are no different from those of the main denominations. Article 22 of the Church of England and the Church of Ireland states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping, and Adoration, as well as of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may know that the Scottish confession of faith states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sins of the quick or dead; but only a commemoration of that one offering up of himself, by himself, upon the cross, once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same; so that the Popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominably injurious to Christ's one only sacrifice, the alone proposition for all the sins of the elect.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having told the Committee the doctrines of the Anglican Church, the Church of Scotland and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, it seems to me that they are absolutely no different from the rules and doctrines of the Orange Institution. They are compliant with them—indeed, they do not all go as far as the Church articles. The Orange Institution and the other loyalist institutions should be removed from the clause—the whole clause should be removed. It is repugnant in this modern society to make such a provision, but if the Government are intent on pursuing it, I propose in amendment No. 254 that four other organisations should be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I would welcome your guidance. If one were a member of one of the four organisations—possibly more, but in my case only one, in amendment No. 254—should one not participate in the vote?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can say that there is no difficulty in participating in the vote, whatever organisation one belongs to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I will be brief. When the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs discussed the issues last year, if I remember correctly, I was advised to declare a non-pecuniary interest as a member of the Orange Order. Whether that is relevant to today's proceedings I do not know, but I make that declaration in case it is appropriate.
<P>
I strongly support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson). The arguments are straightforward. If there must be a list of registrable associations, it is important that it is right, fair and proper. One could argue, as my hon. Friend has, that the clause is wrong in principle and that it is an expression of prejudice and bigotry, with which one could well do without.
<P>
If we are to have a list of associations, let us get it right for heaven's sake. The four organisations listed in the amendment would, from my point of view and in a demented sense, complete the list. There is no reason why those who argue for there to be a list of registrable associations should not agree that the important principle is to get the list right and that those organisations should therefore be on it.
<P>
I do not like the clause at all. I note in particular the reference to the Apprentice Boys of Derry. At the invitation of its leadership, I spent time with the group only a few days ago. What strikes me about the absurdity of its presence on the list is that, of all organisations, it has an exemplary record of trying to co-operate with the Parades Commission and of engagement with concerned residents' organisations, or whatever they are called. There is no justification for its inclusion. However, as I say, if we are to have a list, amendment No. 254 is essential for the sake of completeness. I do not like it, but if the list is to exist, those four organisations should be added to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The clause would be obnoxious to any right thinking person. I despair when I look at the list of the six organisations that are to be registered, which somehow suggests that people in those groups should not be members of the police service or, if they are already members, should almost be placed automatically under suspicion. The person who drew up the list knows absolutely nothing about Northern Ireland, its history or those organisations.
<P>
I have lived in Northern Ireland for virtually all of my 62 years. I grew up during the war when the IRA was active. I lived through the 1956 to 1962 troubles and served as a special constable during part of that period. I must tell the Minister that the Ancient Order of Hibernians was highly respected among those from the Protestant tradition. When I was a lad and we used to talk as one did about neighbours and whether a neighbour might be involved with the IRA, our elders—people such as my grandfather—would say to us that we did not have to worry about them because they were ``decent old Hibs''. The Ancient Order of Hibernians has traditionally been an extremely honourable organisation.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some people might wonder at my beginning by talking about a Catholic organisation but, in terms of my responsibility to Northern Ireland, I cannot consider exclusively Catholics or Protestants; I must look at our society. What I would apply by experience and repute to the Ancient Order of Hibernians, I would apply to the other five organisations on the list.
<P>
Whatever problems there might be regarding the right to march or to parade on the Queen's highway and whatever that might suggest, the Orange Order has done a huge amount to keep young people from involvement in loyalist paramilitarism in the past 30 years. It has been a wonderfully good influence. If elements in that organisation, but peripheral to it, exploit it and so give a different impression of it, their actions come as a reaction to the constant carping criticism that has been used by Sinn Fein-IRA—and perhaps by others—to try to prove a political point. I do not agree with some of the organisation's politics, but the core membership of the Orange Order has been a wonderfully stable influence in Northern Ireland for many years. The Royal Black Preceptory is, to be blunt, a more religiously committed element of the Orange Order in the broadest sense and not a narrow, fundamentalist sense.
<P>
I do not belong to either organisation, although my grandfather did. I am familiar with thousands of people who belong to one or to both of those organisations, one of which extends from the other—one cannot be in the Preceptory without being in the Order. I know the sense of injustice and insult felt by the many decent people who are broad-minded and pluralist in their approach to the problems that we have in Northern Ireland. It is scandalous that those organisations are listed.
<P>
I belong to two of the other organisations listed. I have been a member of the Masonic Order under the Irish constitution for 37 years. The Masonic Order in Ireland is a charitable organisation. It may have less relevance now that we have universal and free education than it had when I joined and in the years before that, because we no longer run schools for the sons and daughters of decreased brethren. However, we still look after the widows and assist the families of deceased brethren in cases of disablement or other family difficulty. We also subscribe to other charitable organisations: the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is one of the bodies that benefits from the work done by our order. The list in the clause suggests that members of the Orange Order and others are pariahs; it shows the total ignorance of the Government and those who drafted the Bill.
<P>
Almost by accident, I am also a member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry; I joined at the instigation of a 90-year-old man with whom I used to sit in the Masonic lodge, because it used to engage in similar sorts of charitable work. It is totally insulting that those organisations should be listed. I cannot convey strongly enough my personal sense of grievance, let alone the grievance felt by the greater number of ordinary, decent people who are members of the AOH, the Apprentice Boys or the Masonic Order—and, although I have no personal knowledge of them, the Orange Order or the Royal Black Preceptory.
<P>
If the Government have regard for anyone other than those who come from the ranks of Sinn Fein-IRA, if they have any regard for ordinary people who are the backbone of society in Northern Ireland, they will remove this offensive clause. They have no justification for it. Let the Minister give a single, solitary example—I ask for only one—from each of the six organisations listed where membership has led to injustice in the way that members of the RUC have carried out their duties and responsibilities to society. If he can do that, I shall be prepared to listen. If he cannot, but instead displays unadulterated prejudice—it will not be his prejudice, of course, but the prejudice of the Government and the parliamentary draftsmen, who do not understand the nature of society in Northern Ireland—I shall be convinced that I am right.
<P>
 Extending the list simply shows how utterly and completely ridiculous it is to have a list in the first place. I hope that the Committee understands that we cannot continue down a path that implicitly places the backbone of society, the ordinary decent members of Northern Ireland society, under suspicion while we, at the same time, allow those who have been involved in murder and destruction to be placed without any constraint whatever on police boards and district policing partnerships.
<P>
If members of the Committee are serious about wanting to do what is best for Northern Ireland, they will take heed of what I have said today. If they do not, I shall be obliged to conclude that they do not care and that the Bill is not about the interests of the people of Northern Ireland or about law and order, but that it is some sort of political mish-mash to get the Government over a political hurdle. If so, hon. Members' support for it will have little relevance. That is not why they were sent to the House.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> In opening the debate, the hon. Member for West Tyrone referred to the Westminster confession of faith. He did not record all 39 articles, but my memory of it is that article 13 refers to predestination. I do not know whether it was predestined that I should be doing this job, but I am prepared to wear the hair shirt and try to deal with these difficult issues.
<P>
It is appropriate for me to deal with the generality of the clause as well as with the amendment. The clause requires members of the police force to inform the Chief Constable of any ``registrable association'' if asked to do so. Certain registrable interests are listed in the Bill, and the list may be amended by order by the Secretary of State. The listed associations are those mentioned by the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs in its report, ``Composition, Recruitment and Training of the RUC'', published in July 1998, on its inquiry into the registration of interests by police officers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) was a member of that Committee; I do not know whether he suffered a Damascene conversion on his way here today, but we should reflect what the hon. Gentleman signed up to. He moved an amendment to the Committee's report, which became the substantive decision of the Committee. That amendment stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Officers (including new recruits) who belong to organisation such as the loyal orders, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, or other exclusive groups who generally prohibit membership on religious grounds, should register their membership privately with the management of the RUC so that complaints about any bias can be seen to be fairly assessed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Among those who signed up were members of the Ulster Unionist party—the hon. Members for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) and for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)—and the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), who is a member of the Democratic Unionist party. I would argue that what we are doing in the Bill is not far removed from what the hon. Member for Basingstoke signed up to and sought to persuade other members of the Committee to agree to. We want to explain his change of mind—if he is prepared to accept it as a change of mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister is factually correct, but he should consider the amendment that I tabled to the report. I was hoping, by that amendment, to win support to remove the Select Committee from the position that it had adopted. If I had gone further, there would have been no chance of winning support. That was a tactical move, on my part, away from the position that the Committee had adopted in its report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to get into a long debate about the matter. Others will judge whether such an approach was tactical or not. One way of rejecting something in a report that one is fundamentally opposed to is to vote against the report in total. In such a situation, one would not use most of the same language and refer to the registration of interest in the same way as the Committee. However, that is a matter for the hon. Gentleman to square with his conscience; I do not know how he would go about his confession of faith.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of the information being disclosed, the clause places safeguards on the handling and disclosure of registered information and makes it an offence to provide false information. The information will be available only on request to the police ombudsman. Information registered will be held by the police service on a confidential basis on an individual officer's personal file and will not be publicly available. Statistical information must be published by the Chief Constable in his annual report. That is almost exactly what the hon. Member for Basingstoke argued for in tabling his amendment to the Select Committee report.
<P>
The clause achieves Patten recommendation 126, in paragraph 15.16. The commission recommended:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that all officers—those now in service as well as all future recruits—should be obliged to register their interests and associations, and that the register should be held both by the police service and by the Police Ombudsman.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In making that recommendation, the commission recognised that police officers, like everyone else, are entitled to their private views, and to join legal organisations that reflect those views. The key issue is whether membership of such organisations affects officers' ability to discharge their duties effectively and impartially. That argument was set out in paragraph 15.15 of the report. By requiring officers to register their interests, we are not stating that they should not have associations with exclusive organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister tell us, as I am sure that he went to the trouble of ascertaining, whether any member of the commission was a member of any organisation? I do not refer to secret organisations, but to those that are fraternities possessing secrets. Was any member of the commission a member of the Knights of St. Columbanus or Opus Dei? I am sure that the Minister, with his thoroughness for detail, will have made himself aware of such facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for the compliment, but I do not know that detail off the top of my head. He has made a serious point and, if those interests were registered at the time of the commission's formation, I will provide the hon. Gentleman and the Committee with that information. It may be in the report, but it is a comprehensive document and I do not carry all of it in my head. However, I do not know where such information would take us. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that those serving on the commission acted in a prejudiced way, by virtue of the fact that they may have included a member of the type of organisation to which he has alluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister implies by his rhetorical question that they would have been prejudiced if they were members of those organisations. I have not suggested that. I am trying to illustrate the fact that if members of the commission could have been members of any such organisation and could be believed not to have been fair and objective in analysing the questions that the report dealt with, the same rules of thumb should be applied to all of them.
<P>
I notice that the Minister strayed into discussing the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is making an intervention, which should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Indeed, I should have made it a point of order. If the Minister is going to stray into the territory of amendment No. 255, which we shall deal with later, I would like to stray into the territory of amendment No. 256. However, on your ruling, Mr. Malins, I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The earlier part of the hon. Gentleman's comments was a wilful misrepresentation of what I said. From the report of our proceedings, others can judge whether I said what he claimed that I said; I do not believe that I did. I was trying to help, and to explain that I would make such information available if it existed and was not yet in the public domain. I was questioning the logic.
<P>
I was dealing with the entire clause because the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for Basingstoke suggested their total objection to the entire clause. I hoped that they would accept my arguments, but we shall wait and see how that plays out.
<P>
By requiring officers to register their interests, we are not stating that they should not have associations with exclusive organisations, although Patten and the Chief Constable said that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would prefer that public servants were not members of secret societies or organisations perceived to be sectarian.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will the Minister accept that a lot of the organisations are in no way secret organisations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am setting out the view of the commission and the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> What is the Minister's view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I will come to my view in a moment. I am quoting the view of the commission, a respected body of men and women who studied the issue, and the Chief Constable, who is highly respected. They speak for themselves.
<P>
The issue is not membership, but the officer's ability to discharge his or her duties. Perception is also relevant. The commission found that the problem of loyal orders and excluded societies was—again I quote from paragraph 15.16—``largely one of perception''. In a sense, the commission may even have accepted strong arguments of the sort made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). The clause attempts to tackle the issue of perception, which he raised, to ensure that proper disclosure is afforded to those who need such information in a way that recognises that the issue is sensitive and emotive. Officers have rights, with strictly defined safeguards in subsections (7), (8), (9) and (10) of clause 47.
<P>
I come to the detail of amendment No. 254. When we drafted this part of the legislation, we thought long and hard about the organisations that should be included in the clause. Informed by the conclusions of the commission and the Select Committee, we came to the view that something had to be done on the subject: we had to address the issue of which organisations should be listed. It is clearly not an exact science. However, I have listened to the views expressed today, and hon. Members have raised several interesting issues and important points.
<P>
When we were trying to come to a conclusion on the list of organisations, we did not have a list provided by the commission—it did not provide the Government with a clear-cut list of interests, beyond the reference to the Orange Order and the Ancient Order of Hibernians. As soon as we touch on the issue of the Orange Order, we enter a complex area. What some perceive in Northern Ireland as the Orange Order may be one or more of several loyal institutions, including the Independent Loyal Orange Institutions, the Royal Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys. They are all distinct organisations, and we had to be careful that we dealt with that complexity. In reaching decisions, the Government considered the 1998 report of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on ``The Composition, Recruitment and Training of the RUC''. The list in the Bill is a combination of organisations mentioned by the commission and those that the Select Committee determined to be exclusive. I believe that to be a reasonable approach.
<P>
I have given thought to the list provided by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, however I do not know whether he genuinely wants those organisations to be listed, or whether the amendment is a probing one. I will give further consideration to some of the specific points made by him and his hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone. We may rule out the Jesuits as a group on the list because, as I understand it, to be a Jesuit one has to be a serving priest. If anyone can give me different information about that matter, I would be interested to hear it. Opus Dei and the—

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Knights of St. Columbanus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that name. I want to give particular attention to those two organisations, because they may be of a similar character to others that have been listed, and it would therefore be appropriate to amend the legislation. I will give the matter further consideration before Report. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment, although what I have said does not necessarily mean that those organisations will be listed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I hear what the Minister says and, no doubt, he will be able to give some idea of his intentions before Report stage. On that basis, we certainly accept his assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I will receive representations, one way or another, about the matter, which will help my thought processes. The hon. Member for West Tyrone asked for an example of a member of one of the listed organisations who has acted to the detriment of the RUC: there is at least one example of recent vintage. I do not want to give the details of the case, because I believe that it relates to an individual officer. I will find out more information on that matter and, if it is not the case or there is more detail, I will advise the hon. Gentleman and the Committee of it. I do not want to deal with that debate at this point.
<P>
I hope that, with that explanation, we may seek the withdrawal of that amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Having heard the Minister's explanation and given the fact that he will reconsider the situation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 24, line 1, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No 15, in page 24, line 1, leave out `in response to a request under subsection (3)'.
<P>
No. 266, in page 24, line 2, after `information', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`regarding any registrable association that he may have'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 260, in page 25, leave out lines 1 and 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The amendment deals with the penalty that will be imposed on a police officer who does not give the required information. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any person who in response to a request—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from the Chief Constable—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provides information which he knows to be false—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, where a person is asked whether he belongs to a registrable organisation and gives a false answer—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 8(1) of the European convention on human rights, the right to a private life must be respected, so members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have every right to belong to such institutions. In our view, a person might properly refuse to answer such a question, and his liability
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is therefore excessive and disproportionate. Indeed, subsection (5) would criminalise what are lawful organisations, and should therefore be removed.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): I should like to speak to amendment No. 15 and the consequential amendment No. 266. As it stands, the Bill will make it a criminal offence for a police officer to provide false information about his involvement with registrable associations when he is specifically asked to give such information. However, it is silent in respect of officers who volunteer information that proves to be false. In other words, the Bill will attach no criminality to the voluntary provision of false information, and that anomaly should be corrected.
<P>
The requirement to register membership of a listed body, which was debated in connection with the previous amendment, is vitally important. Whether in Northern Ireland, Ireland or the UK, there is a growing demand for openness in virtually every walk of life. We are increasingly being asked to disclose interests that may—and sometimes may not—conflict with the duties that we are required to perform, and that is particularly true in Northern Ireland. 
<P>
As has been mentioned in respect of earlier clauses, the problems are both real and perceived. People have an historically strong belief that undue influence on public and private life in one community or the other from sectional interests, membership of secret societies and—as it were—membership of societies with secrets, has a hidden and perverse effect on superficially reasonable and genuine decisions. An example is freemasonry in the judiciary, which is frequently debated. In a sense, we are talking about membership of the marching orders, if I may use that collective phrase, and membership of the RUC.
<P>
If it is to be an acceptable cornerstone, any new order of policing must be absolutely open and be seen to be open. My community therefore believes, to a greater or lesser extent, that it is important that membership of such organisations should be registered by all police officers, whether or not they are required to or requested to by the Secretary of State. Patten recommended that all officers should be obliged to register their interest in an association, and that that register should be held by both the police service and the police ombudsman.
<P>
We wish that Patten had gone much further than that, and prohibited membership of certain secretive sectarian organisations. However, that was not his opinion, and he did not recommend it. We are willing to accept the compromise that he proposed. However, we cannot accept that the Bill does not implement even that compromise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> When the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) uses the word ``sectarian'', is he implying that the word involves some kind of dubious concept, or is he using it merely in the sense of belonging to a branch of Christianity or a religious organisation? If we know what he means by the word ``sectarian'', we will better understand the point that he is trying to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not need me to educate him as to the meaning of the word ``sectarian'', coming from the communities that we come from. It certainly does not mean the membership of a sect. When he and I use it as a colloquialism in everyday life, it means the intolerance of another's viewpoint, and the pursuit of aims and objectives to destroy and impinge upon that viewpoint.
<P>
 That is what sectarianism means in its colloquial sense in Northern Ireland, and that is what is meant when the word is used. It does not mean that one is a member of a sect, but that an unjust, unfair or unacceptable attack or influence has been brought to bear against members of another organisation. That, as I think that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will well know, is what is meant by the word ``sectarianism'' in Northern Ireland.
<P>
As I was saying, our submissions regarding the exclusion of a member of the police service from membership of any of these organisations were not accepted by Patten. We are prepared to go with what Patten suggested, but the Bill does not do so. It is only on the basis that the Chief Constable will require the registration of membership or interests in other organisations that falsehood in giving that information attracts a criminal offence. Where no request is made, and membership of the same kinds of organisations is participated in by a member of the police service, and he voluntarily gives false information about that, there is no penalty whatever. That is an anomaly that the Government should take on board. The amendment is a reasonable proposition.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 proposes that it would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in response to a request under subsection (3)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that the Chief Constable would make a request for the registration of interests. Amendment No. 226 would amend the clause to specify that the information should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>regarding any registrable association that he<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or she—that is, a member of the police service—``may have''. Those are reasonable propositions in this context, and I ask the Minister to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that you will admit, Mr. Malins, that up to now I have managed to contain my anger at certain elements of the Bill. I find that increasingly difficult to do. None the less, I shall persist in my attempt.
<P>
In response to my suggestion that the Minister list at least one example for each of the six organisations to be registered, he responded that he thought that he might be able to find one. I must remind him of the caveat that membership of the organisation should be the reason why the officer did not perform his duties properly. That is an important caveat. Despite all the pressures, about 40,000 people—I do not have the exact figures—have served in the RUC over the past 30 years, yet the Minister thinks that he might be able to come up with only one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is what the hon. Gentleman asked for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I asked for one from each organisation. The Minister can say nothing to convince the Committee that there is any breadth or depth in the attempts to justify the inclusion of this clause in the Bill, after 30 years during which 40,000 people have served in the RUC.
<P>
I am delighted that I intervened on the hon. Member for South Down, and heard that he was using not the dictionary definition but the colloquial definition of sectarian. He also alleged in Committee that members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and all the other organisations listed, would be considered people of ill intent because of their membership. He implies that they would have unreasonable prejudice against their fellow citizens because of their membership of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Apprentice Boys of Derry or the Masonic Lodge. That is a weak and pitiful argument to put to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me for a definition of sectarianism. I gave him the definition according to the way in which the word is used in the communities in the north of Ireland.
<P>
Membership of the organisations referred to in clause 47 might lead to them influencing their members. Membership, because it is secret and hidden, causes fears that might be unfounded, but might be quite justified, about any or all of those organisations. The registration of membership of such organisations does not, of itself, impinge on those organisations. The problem lies in their hiddenness and their covertness. Membership of secret or quasi-secret societies should be made known, if the member concerned is serving the public. The public should be able to make a reasoned judgment about whether the actions of that person are coloured by his membership of a quasi-secret or secret organisation.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that brief intervention. He has struggled manfully to ameliorate what he said previously, but the record will show that he talked about sectarian organisations and defined ``sectarian'' in terms of ill intent and—I cannot quote his exact words—suggested that it included unreasonable prejudice. Such is the folly of clause 47.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I will, in a moment. If I were a policeman, would I have to register my membership of Dungannon rugby club? Dungannon rugby club gets a great deal more of my time than the Apprentice Boys of Derry or the Masonic order. Perhaps I should be ashamed to say that. I have a great affinity with my rugby club and its players and would be distraught if any of them were embarrassed by any misdemeanour that they might commit. If I were a policeman, I might be more tempted to protect the welfare of the players than I would be by anything arising from membership of any of the other organisations listed in the clause. Perhaps I should table an amendment on Report requiring registration of membership of rugby clubs—golf clubs, too, Mr. Malins. Would that affect you?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would, undoubtedly, affect me and my handicap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I suspected that that might be the case.
<P>
This is a ridiculous clause. If it did not make us angry, we might laugh at it. People will think it utter, unmitigated nonsense that they should find themselves guilty of an offence if they hide the fact that they are members of one of the listed organisations. I would be the last person to suggest to a policeman—or policewoman—that he or she should be untruthful. However, if I were a policeman, and I was presented with this, I would feel inclined to be what we call crooked. Many police officers will want to be crooked, twisted or a little bit perverse about it. To criminalise them for that would be to infringe their right to a private life. That is what it comes down to. Can a police officer have a private life and keep it private?
<P>
We could have had a simple clause stating that no police officer is entitled to a private life outside his own home. That may sound ridiculous, but it is as close to what the clause suggests as damnit is to swearing.
<P>
 We have not yet alluded to amendment No. 260. After the imposition and the threat, we have the Chief Constable reporting, under subsection (11)(b), on how successful he has been in obtaining admissions from police officers that they belong to one of the specified organisations. The matter becomes more and more ridiculous. I cannot emphasise that enough, but I think that I have made my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I do not wish to be drawn on the amendments that refer to the validity of the clause, but I was struck by the oddity of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Down. If I understand them correctly, amendment No. 15 would introduce an extraordinary notion to the obligations that someone should have placed on him. The clause requires a police officer, at the request of the Chief Constable, to supply certain information, but the amendment would leave in the air when that information would have to be supplied and whether any excuse would be tolerated for not supplying it. If there is no provision allowing reasonable excuse, what will happen to someone who forgets for a few days? We must assume that the Chief Constable will send out annual, six-monthly or three-monthly requests for information and that non-compliance with a request would constitute a criminal offence.
<P>
A burden will be placed on individual police officers who, every morning when they wake up, will have to ask themselves whether they should be supplying the Chief Constable with information because their status might have changed since the previous night. That is unreasonable. I have never come across such a notion and I simply do not understand the thrust of the amendment or the purpose for tabling it.
<P>
Amendment No. 266, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for South Down, fudges the issue of whether someone could escape sanction after supplying false information about not having any such interest. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for saying that I do not see what purpose the amendment would serve.
<P>
I have a lot of sympathy with the generality of what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said. Clearly, there is a valid argument for having no requirement on police officers to declare lawful activities or participation in lawful organisations. We must also accept that we have gone some way—some people might say that it is undesirable even in this country—in having disclosure of interests by Members of Parliament, members of the judiciary and so on. If that provides reassurance, even if it is unnecessary, and provided that that disclosure does not compromise anyone's personal security—I understand that the Minister will say it could do that—I confess to neutrality if it is thought that disclosure would be helpful in building up trust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I should like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subsection (7)(a) so that he can make a better judgment on the element of the clause that we are discussing. He will find that the information tendered is to be made available to an ombudsman, who will look into an alleged infringement. Why would an ombudsman do that in relation to that part of a policeman's life that is registrable, unless he wanted to make a judgment based on that issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and I appreciate his concern. However, I wonder whether that is really the nub of the issue.
<P>
I shall give an example. I think that the hon. Gentleman has probably accepted the idea of there being an ombudsman; I do not recollect any opposition to that proposal. On the whole, the ombudsman system has worked fairly well in this country. Even if this clause were not in the Bill, if a complaint were made about the activities of a police officer, the ombudsman would be entitled—if he thought that membership of any body might be relevant to his inquiry—to request that officer to supply that information. If that request were refused, the ombudsman might be entitled to draw an inference that could be prejudicial to the police officer who was the subject of the complaint. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views on that.
<P>
I wonder whether we can completely get rid of the idea that organisations to which we belong are not relevant. I shall give the hon. Gentleman another example. I might belong to a club; in the English context, that may not be deemed to be of great importance. However, a complaint might be made about my conduct—if I were a police constable—in which it was suggested that I had stopped a car containing four members of the club, and that I had let them off even though the driver was blind drunk. In those circumstances, my membership would clearly be a relevant consideration. In the course of the investigation, that information would probably come out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I take on board the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, he is implying that membership of the club is questionable and dubious, and that, by implication, the club itself is contributing to the officer not carrying out his duty properly. If a club is a lawful organisation, I do not believe that it should be registrable in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and he is fully entitled to make it. However, to his mind, the mere listing of an organisation—the fact that it has to be declared—attaches some kind of taint to it. I sympathise with that view. When we deal with matters of this kind, there should always be a presumption that a lawful organisation conducts itself lawfully, and that that is the end of the matter.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested in his earlier intervention that membership of such an organisation could in no circumstances be relevant to an inquiry by the police ombudsman. I disagree. I can think of occasions on which membership of dozens of organisations, including many not listed here, could become relevant. I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. However, I adopted a neutral position on it because, in terms of building reassurance, we cannot escape the fact that, in the context of Northern Ireland, the organisations listed might be ones that have given rise to what the hon. Member for South Down called unreal anxieties. Nevertheless, those anxieties may exist. Therefore, although I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's point, I can see why the Government and the Patten report recommend that such organisations be included as registrable and the details supplied to the Chief Constable and the ombudsman. As far as I can see, the information will not be supplied to anyone else.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I refer to amendment No. 255. It will be almost impossible to convict anyone of the offence. The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any person who in response to a request . . . provides any information which he knows to be false shall be guilty of an offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not a matter of the Chief Constable's knowing that the information is false; the person who is giving the information must know.
<P>
I know a little about the Orange Institution, and I can tell hon. Members that there are those who think that they are in the Orange Order, but are not. There are also those who think that they are not in the Orange Order, when they are. Someone might not know whether he is in it, and the only way in which we could find out would be by asking the organisation concerned whether a particular policeman was a member.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that someone might not know whether he is a member of the Orange Order? If that is so, how can he say that the Order has all the necessary desirable attributes, if it does not know whether it has undesirable members?
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that voluntarily providing false information would be every bit as injurious to a police officer's credibility as providing false information on request? If he agrees with me, will he support my amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in the world long enough to know something about human nature and how such organisations work. There are people who think that they are still members of the Orange Order, although they have been put out of it, and people who are still on the books, although they think that they are out of the organisation. The information that such people would give might be false, although they would not know that. The clause refers to information that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he knows to be false.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be almost impossible to prove whether an officer is telling the truth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit O¨pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the crucial point is that the individual giving the information knows it to be false? His argument could apply to every law in the United Kingdom. Everyone could pretend that they did not know the situation. In the real world, the clause is workable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I suspect that few laws are written as stupidly as this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The issue of uncertainty about membership seems to have caused some hilarity among Labour Members. The same point would apply to membership of political parties. There are grey areas there, too, about renewal dates for subscriptions and so on. The situation is the same for any organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for supporting my view. It will be almost impossible to convict anyone under the clause. Perhaps, the Minister would address that.
<P>
Amendment No. 260 would remove the reference in clause 47(11)(b) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assessment of the extent to which members of the police force have complied with the duty under subsection (3).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the Chief Constable will say that, as far as he is aware, every policeman who is supposed to have registered has done so, and 99 per cent. of those who have not have said that they are not registrable. It is a mystery to me what else he can say. How can one make an assessment without adopting that approach? Were a Chief Constable to say otherwise, he would be implying that some members of his force were dishonest and not telling the truth. Surely no Chief Constable would have the audacity to say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a useful discussion, and I anticipated that we would deal with many of these issues. The debate has been somewhat Jesuitical, although I do not use that phrase in a pejorative sense. I would not want to burden the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone with that description, because it would not sit comfortably with organisations of which they might be members.
<P>
I welcome the support offered by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who dealt with many issues that I wanted to address. I understand the difficulties that the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone have with this clause in particular, but we shall simply have to agree to differ. Other arguments have shown that, on this matter, the hon. Gentlemen are isolated.
<P>
When making the declaration, constables will declare that they will act impartially, and accord equal respect to all individuals and their legal traditions and beliefs. However, there is the important issue of perception, openness and transparency, which we have sought to address in clause 47. If we are properly to address existing misconceptions, officers must be obliged to give accurate and true information.
<P>
Amendment No. 255 would allow members of the police force to give false information, without sanction, about registrable associations of which they were members. That would be wholly unacceptable. If, as others have argued, the principle behind the provision is right, some sanction should be applied.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone asked whether it would be easy to take people to court over such matters, but that is not a matter for me. I cannot make that judgment—we provide the law, and others will exercise it. Arguments that have been exercised in this Committee could be used as a defence, but it is for a court of law—not me—to decide whether a person is guilty.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone said that there is a conflict between registration and article 8 of the ECHR, which establishes the right to respect for one's private life. We do not propose that membership of a registrable association should be a criminal offence, but we want to catch people who give false information, and I contend that the provision will not conflict with article 8. The requirement that information be provided is entirely compatible with article 8(2), which enables exceptions to be made if they are necessary, proportionate and pursue a legitimate aim. We believe that these provisions fall within that category.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone returned to the question of a specific example, but in referring to each and every listed association, he moved the goalposts a wee bit. He asked for a particular example—although I may have misinterpreted him—and I hinted that such an example does indeed exist, but I did not want to rehearse it. The officer in question has been disciplined, and the incident occurred some years ago, so the offence could be regarded as spent. Moreover, I do not know whether the officer is still serving, and in those circumstances I was trying to protect the individual in question.
<P>
 At least one example is relevant, but the case rests not on that but on the arguments that were advanced by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and on the clause's underlying principles, which involve openness, the need to tackle misconceptions and the issue that the Patten report highlighted. Amendment No. 255 is not sensible, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it to a Division.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down spoke to amendments Nos. 15 and 266. Not for the first time, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield pre-empted the logical analysis of the reasoning that supports those amendments, both of which are flawed. If they were agreed to, the clause would contain no definition of who the ``person'' was or to whom the information should be provided. If they were agreed, the clause's applicability would become so wide as to render it absurd.
<P>
However, the amendment highlighted a technical flaw in the Bill—that as it is currently drafted, it would not be an offence to volunteer false information. We accept that that is wrong—the drafting will be corrected on Report.
<P>
I share the Patten report's sentiment that police officers should be entitled to their own private views, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down does so, too. It should be legitimate to join legal organisations that reflect their views. I notice that the hon. Gentleman nods in agreement. The clause's provisions will not abuse that right. I hope that amendments Nos. 255, 15 and 266 will not be pressed to a vote.
<P>
On amendment No. 260, I appreciate the position that was adopted by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone, but their approach flies in the face of Patten's proposals. Our approach will deal with the relevant perceptions and misconceptions—the amendment's attempt to restrain the Chief Constable from presenting information about his officers' compliance with his requests for information on registrable interests does nothing to further our objective. If the Chief Constable possesses the information, and it is desirable to deal with the misconceptions, the annual report will play a desirable function. It could lay to rest many people's fears in this context. It is appropriate for the provisions to remain in the clause, and amendment No. 260 should be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Government will obviously push ahead with the clause. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 24, leave out lines 6 to 14 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) shall issue a request under subsection (3) to every member of the police force not less than once every three years;
<P>
(b) shall update information received under this section where the person to whom it relates informs the Chief Constable that there has been a change in his registrable associations;
<P>
(c) shall retain information received under this section until three years after the person to whom it relates has ceased to be a member of the police force;
<P>
(d) each year shall supply the Ombudsman with information as to any registrable associations of every member of the police force obtained by him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 228, in page 24, leave out lines 12 to 14.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The amendment would replace subsection (6) with alternative provisions. We rehearsed some of the relevant arguments in debates this afternoon. To summarise, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to make it incumbent on the Chief Constable to request each officer to provide the information that will be required under the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not less than once every three years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That should be a duty—the approach should not be laissez-faire. I hope that the Minister agrees that that is a reasonable request.
<P>
The amendment's second point is that there should be a continuous update of information when the relevant person says that there has been a change in his registerable associations. That, too, is a straightforward and logical proposal. The amendment's third point is that the information should be retained for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>three years after the person to whom it relates<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has left the service. The information should be given to the police ombudsperson.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment embodies three concepts: declaration, the need to update and monitor registrable interests and the need to continue to hold that information for a reasonable time, which we believe is three years after the termination of employment.
<P>
Debates in various public forums make it clear that there are questions about the legality of holding such information for more than one month—that is the Government's preferred period—after a termination. I am not a legal expert and I cannot find any legal references that give firm direction in this respect, except that common practice in organisations is that the chief executive of other employers of persons should, for a plethora of reasons, keep records for a reasonable period. For instance, the Inland Revenue requires records to be kept for at least six years before they can be destroyed—it is an offence not to keep them, or those relating to national insurance, health and social security. I do not understand why the Government support the 30-day period after retirement—it would be only 28 days in February. The amendment is logical and in keeping with normal commercial practice. I hope that the Minister will agree to it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> Before I speak to amendment No. 228, I want to comment briefly on the interesting speech of the hon. Member for South Down. I understand the reasons that lie behind the amendment. My concern is that it may slightly hector the police to have such a regular administrative requirement. In view of the Government's response to the previous group of amendments, the Minister may find a rather more discreet and less emphatic way to keep the records updated.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> One of the most important provisions of amendment No. 17 is contained in paragraph (a), which would impose a duty on the Chief Constable to ``request'' information. There would be no record without that request.
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> That is a fair point. I am arguing from a practical perspective. The hon. Member for South Down put his case effectively.
<P>
We tabled amendment No. 228 for the reason that the hon. Gentleman discussed—the need to retain information. We, too, were somewhat surprised by the one-month limit, which will begin on the date on which the person to whom it relates ceases to be a member of the police force. There may be a legal reason for that—if so, I am sure that the Minister will tell us about it. Such information might be relevant to a court action—clause 47(7)(d) contains the relevant provisions. It is therefore inappropriate that it be destroyed within one month of the person's leaving the police. Why is it not treated like any other part of a person's personnel record, which must be retained on file for a fixed period of time after his or her departure? I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I noticed a point contained in amendment No. 228 on which I wanted to concentrate. I am sure that the Minister will deal with it. There have been several recent cases, some celebrated, in which police officers have deliberately resigned or left the force and so put themselves beyond disciplinary proceedings. That has handicapped serious inquiries.
<P>
The issue under debate is not as heavy as that. It relates merely to membership of an organisation, but some disciplinary cases might go beyond someone's presence in the force, so the issue could be relevant. If the information has been destroyed, the clear implication would seem to be that the Chief Constable no longer has it and cannot communicate it to the authority concerned in subsection (7). It would not be satisfactory if efforts were made in the course of such proceedings to avoid disclosure of membership of any organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Again, we have touched on an interesting aspect of a complex piece of legislation. I understand the motivation for certain parts of amendment No. 17, such as that which places the responsibility for requesting information on registrable associations firmly with the Chief Constable. In my view, that is already implicit in the Bill. I cannot see how that could not be complied with or that the Chief Constable would not be able to honour his obligations under clause 47(11) in the annual report. I accept that there may need to be further clarity, and I shall return to it on Report. I think that the responsibility is implicit, but it may not be explicit enough and we shall deal with that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down suggested that the information on the registrable association of officers should be held for considerably longer than one month after the officer leaves the service. Again, I have some sympathy with the point, but a balance has to be struck. In reality, once a police officer leaves the service he is no longer an officer. That is why the one-month figure was included. It is a reasonable administrative period. Leaving aside the way in which the provision will apply immediately, we are conscious of the fact that the ombudsman can go back more than one year. Therefore, one year becomes the touchstone by which judgment is made, rather than the three-year criterion.
<P>
I have some questions about whether that is appropriate, given that the officer is no longer a serving police officer. If there were any criminal wrongdoing, he might be pursued through a court of law. The argument is about how we discipline someone who is no longer a police officer on the basis of registration, non-registration or a breach of the registration provisions. What is the purpose in that? That has not been explained. The argument has been made for three years. Why should a person be pursued for that period when he or she is then a private citizen and no longer a serving police officer?
<P>
The case has to be made on a stronger basis. I understand that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. O¨pik) would leave the period open-ended. In one sense, that is an even worse scenario. Officers have human rights as well—they do not sign them all away the minute that they put on uniforms. Indeed, they have the right to be protected and respected in law. There may be unforeseen eventualities in which a one-year investigation by an ombudsman alights on some request for information with which it would then not be unreasonable to comply. That would raise questions in my mind about the entitlement to pass on information about someone who is a private citizen and no longer a serving police officer. I can imagine that those who represent the interests of police officers could put up a defence in those circumstances. We are prepared to be flexible because we want to take into account eventualities of which we cannot conceive now but which may occur to us later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The Minister has given an open-ended response to our probing amendment. I thought that there might be legal conditions of which I was not aware concerning the length of time. The Minister has rightly acknowledged the issue at stake. As the Government give the matter thought, will they consider that the length of time for which the information is kept may define the length of time in which it is possible to institute proceedings in a legal context? It will be much harder to institute proceedings after a year, if information turns out to be salient for the prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> How will there be disciplinary proceedings against someone who is no longer a serving police officer? If the question is one of criminality, the ordinary courts of law will deal with it. It is unlikely that someone would say, under oath, that he was not a member of a particular organisation when he was. That would be perjury, and that person would fall foul of an even heavier penalty than is provided for in the disciplinary aspect that we are discussing. Why would people want to pursue those who were no longer serving officers for the offence defined in the clause? I have not heard arguments for that, but I understand that this is a probing amendment and that the hon. Gentleman is going to probe me again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The amendment does not concern the disciplinary aspect of the proceedings, but refers to the words in subsection (7)(d) about criminal or civil proceedings. The type of case to which I refer does not necessarily have anything to do with internal police matters. The information may turn out to be relevant to wider court proceedings. I am focusing on that and not on the disciplinary process, which, as the Minister said, might seem somewhat spurious after the individual had left the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I assume that the hon. Gentleman is now agreeing with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> On disciplinary matters, yes, as that was not the issue for me. I was asking about the wider context of civil or criminal proceedings in which the information might become relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If the matter falls within other courts of law, the laws and rules that apply about the giving of evidence in that context would be relevant ones. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is saying that the information should apply for ever.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down argued for three years for the issuing of the request, but we decided on one year, because that relates to the provisions that will apply to the ombudsman in normal circumstances. I have set out my concerns about the practicalities of the proposals, and have tried to be helpful and to strike a balance that people might accept.
<P>
I want to speak to paragraphs (b) and (d) of the amendment, which I am not convinced are necessary. We have provided in subsection (6)(b) for a requirement to be placed on the chief constable to update information on registrable associations when an officer informs him of a change to his details. In subsection (7)(a), we have provided for the ombudsman to obtain such information in connection with the exercise of her functions. My hon. Friend's amendments are simply a different way of achieving those ends. We have set out to achieve what he seeks in his amendment and, on that basis, there is no reason to accept it.
<P>
We are prepared to give a response on Report to the need for clarity in the Bill and to address the issue of the length of time for which information is held, which we believe should be one year.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and sympathetic reply. I understand that he wants to consider the issue dealt with in paragraph (a) of the amendment, to make the Bill clearer in that respect. He says that the matter is covered in other parts of the Bill but that there should be clarity in the clause. I take that on board.
<P>
I am somewhat puzzled by the failure to understand why we suggest that records be retained for three years. It has been implied that that is an arbitrary period, taken out of the air.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister is right to state that an officer who has left his post is no longer an officer, but the consequences of actions during office may linger for some time. A person who has resigned is certainly a private citizen, but is still responsible, and in some circumstances liable, for actions performed in a previous employment or designated position. The status of private citizen comes into play on resignation, but the consequences of the employment do not cease. The human rights of people in general continue, just as those of the officer should be preserved when he becomes a private citizen.
<P>
Our three-year recommendation is based quite straightforwardly on the statute of limitations, under which civil actions can be taken up to three years after the event. Surely it cannot be suggested that evidence that might be pertinent to a civil or criminal action that could be commenced up to three years from the date of the relevant event should be capable of destruction within four weeks of that event. I see no logic in that. It flies in the face of natural justice. I think that our proposition is far stronger than the Government have realised and I ask the Minister to consider that the statute of limitations is very relevant.
<P>
I think that the Minister may want to intervene. I am not sure; his body language is not clear to me. [Interruption.] I am in a quandary. One part of the reply that I have received teases me into seeking leave to withdraw the amendment, but another part of it forces me to press it to a vote.

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I read my hon. Friend's mind. Let me assist him in another way. Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998 requires us to retain data where it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for which it is processed. That is the third data protection principle. The clause is about registration of police officers, not ex-officers. An argument about data protection, which perhaps my hon. Friend has not considered, needs to be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. It is vital that the information recorded under clause 47 should be kept longer. I ask the Committee to consider the amendment favourably because of that.

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have already, in an intervention, alluded to subsection (7)(a), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No information received by the Chief Constable under this section shall be disclosed by a person to whom this subsection applies except—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to the Ombudsman or an officer of the Ombudsman or to any other person in connection with the exercise of any function of the Ombudsman.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What reasonable inference is to be drawn from the knowledge that a person is a member of one of the listed organisations? If an alleged offence came before the ombudsman, she would have to judge the issue on the facts. That is the natural law. If she were in doubt and decided to use the fact that someone was a member of a particular organisation to bring her decision down on one side or the other, the connection between that membership and the offence would be a supposition. An offence, an infringement of the codes of practice or another misdemeanour should be proved on the facts, not on the basis of an assumption that membership of a perfectly legal organisation would make an offence likely.
<P>
As for confining the information to the possession of the ombudsman, we should ask what knock-on situation might arise from the ombudsman's findings. I should have thought that she would have to justify her conclusions. If she justified them on the basis of the person's membership of one of the listed organisations, it seems to me—although I am not a lawyer, and I am open to correction—that she would be infringing the conditions on which she was given access to that information. However, the person who was being investigated would have a right to know how the ombudsman reached a conclusion.
<P>
The ombudsman may be given access to the information, but because of the restraints on who should have access to it, she cannot say whether she has taken it into consideration. What recourse to justice would the police officer have if the ombudsman's decision went against the officer's interests? Would he be able to ask for judicial review? Could he write to the House of Lords? It seems that the basis on which the decision was made would be cloaked from those who would subsequently have to judge the validity of the decision.
<P>
I believe that it would be improper and unique for the ombudsman to be expected to take membership of a legal organisation into account in order to come to a conclusion. I cannot think of any other example of such a requirement being imposed in a judicial or quasi-judicial system.
<P>
With this amendment is grouped amendment No. 257—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This might be a convenient moment for me to remind the Committee about not having a clause stand part debate. As we are making progress, it is in my mind to take a refreshment break at 5 o'clock, give or take a minute or two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Malins, for that moment's respite. I meant to refer to amendment No. 259. Subsection (10) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (7) to show that, before the disclosure was made—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the disclosure that someone was a member of one of the proscribed organisations—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he obtained the information otherwise than in his capacity as a person to whom that subsection applies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If ever there was a nonsense element to the Bill—we seem to have had a series of them—this must be one.
<P>
What would I do if I was determined to reveal legitimately gained information that a police officer was a member of one of the proscribed organisations? I might be using ``proscribed'' in the wrong sense, in so far as the groups are not illegal although they come within the terms of the Bill. It is probably better to talk about a group being one of the listed organisations.
<P>
If I wanted to reveal that a police officer was a member of a listed organisation to damage him or her, having obtained the information legitimately through my position and duties, I would not have to reveal that information but could instead send someone along to observe the policeman attending, for example, a lodge meeting. That person would report to me that they had seen the police officer attending a lodge meeting—that he had entered the lodge at 19.45 hours and had left at 20.30 hours or whatever had been the case. I could then legitimately reveal on the basis of information brought to me that an officer was a member of such an organisation.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our amendment says that it should not be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (7) to show that, before a disclosure was made, he had otherwise obtained the admission. If the clause is included and a person becomes entitled to such information through his or her office, their primary responsibility should be to their office, irrespective of the way in which they allege that they came into possession of the information. That is why there should not be such a defence.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will see the sense of amendment No. 259 and that he will consider pragmatically the wisdom of allowing the ombudsman to have information that can have no relevance when considering an offence. It might have relevance in deciding why an offence could have been committed, although not why it was committed, but that has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of a police officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 18, which is simplicity itself. It suggests that the information available to the Policing Board in respect of senior police officers be made available to the board in respect of all officers. There seems no justification in the context for differentiation between senior officers and other ranks. For instance, the Board might want to commission a study of the effects of membership of registrable associations but the information would not be available unless the Chief Constable had such data in respect of all police officers. It is illogical to say that the information made available to the Policing Board should be in respect only of senior officers. Why can it not be made available to the board for specific purposes in respect of all officers? Otherwise, there will be an effect on the board's management of such issues. In particular, it will be impossible for it to have data of any integrity. I would like to think that the situation was fairly simple and logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is a complicated cluster of amendments, but I shall try to work through the logic of the proposals. We are dealing with two diametrically opposed points of view, which is not unusual in our considerations, but the Bill aims to find a way through that and to strike a balance. I understand that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is completely opposed to the registration of interests. The amendments deal with his concern about the disclosure of registered information.
<P>
I shall deal with the amendments sensibly, but we may enter a wider debate. Amendments Nos. 256 and 257 would be contrary to Patten's aims and recommendations and the Government's position. The ombudsman should have access to the information received under the clause, and that was Government policy before the Patten Commission produced its report. The Bill provides for the ombudsman to have the information. Such provision is necessary and sensible, although members of the Committee could have a long argument about it.
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that giving information to the ombudsman would show prejudice and that she does not need it. I do not accept that argument at all. It is the job of the ombudsman and any decision-maker to take relevant considerations into account and exclude those that are irrelevant. People who hold those positions must always take such judgments, and that responsibility has been imposed on the ombudsman. The registered information might dispose the ombudsman to dismiss a complaint as readily as anything else, but that would be a matter for her. She needs the information to make a judgment. If the ombudsman is dealing with an allegation, but does not have the information, how can she test it?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister is not dealing with my point. Whatever the complaint, the ombudsman must deal with it according to the facts. A complaint might involve two constables, only one of whom is a member of a listed organisation. It is a joint complaint against the two constables. How can the membership of a listed organisation be relevant in such a case? I do not believe that that information is relevant in any case. In my example, the two constables are part of the same inquiry, and are both being investigated for the same alleged misdemeanour. One constable's membership of a legally listed organisation will be drawn to the ombudsman's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The question is whether the information is relevant to the ombudsman's consideration. The hon. Gentleman says that that information is never relevant. However, the Government believe that it could be relevant. This is a question of allowing for transparency. People may allege that every officer serving at a police station in Northern Ireland is a member of the Orange Order. Those people may say that they have therefore been treated unfairly. That complaint may be made. How does the ombudsman deal with such a complaint? It could be deemed to be vexatious. She must have access to information. That is why information that may be relevant could disprove the complaint and might not always lead, as the hon. Gentleman fears, to the complaint's being proved. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> There is almost an onus on the ombudsman to show a prejudice. Those organisations are listed because the integrity of the officers who are their members is in doubt. It almost imposes a prejudice on the ombudsman, when it is incumbent on her to take such membership into consideration. That cannot be in the interests of justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I disagree fundamentally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> May I resume my point? The Minister makes what he says is a convincing argument. That must be weighed against the fact that he can give me perhaps one example involving perhaps 40,000 police officers over 30 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The clause does not oblige the ombudsman to take membership into account. That is a matter for the ombudsman's judgment. The clause does not impose a prejudice on the ombudsman. It simply provides her with a range of information that may be relevant to the complaint. She judges whether the information is relevant and whether to take it into consideration.
<P>
If an officer were alleged to be a member of the Orange Order, the Ancient Order of Hibernians or any of the other organisations listed, and to have acted with prejudice, and the ombudsman did not have the information, she would be denied access to a fact that could be relevant. If the officer were not registered as a member of those organisations, she could immediately dismiss the case.
<P>
I cannot say exactly how the ombudsman will go about her business, but I suggest that she might judge the complaint, then either investigate it further or dismiss it. The ombudsman will need the relevant information, so I am not prepared to accept amendments Nos. 256 and 257. We have a fundamental difference of opinion, not for the first time, but, I hope, perhaps for the last time. I have tried to set out my reasoning, and I shall be more generous with some of the hon. Gentleman's other amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall make just a brief point. I do not want to fall out with the Minister, but part of the weakness of his argument is the fact that he keeps saying, ``I'm only the Minister. I don't know how the law will work in practice.'' The Minister is the legislator. He is not here to make bad law and say, ``Someone in the judicial system can work it out later.'' He is here to make good law. He is not doing that and he admits that he is not doing that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps somebody could put that point to the Committee to decide who has the best judgment. I do not know whether any of the amendments allows that—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No sedentary interventions, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I believe that the clause is good law, but the purpose of the Committee is try to identify any weaknesses in the Bill and improve it accordingly.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the aim of amendment No. 270, tabled by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. It would ensure that people to whom disclosure can be made had registered information only when they needed it to perform their duties. That is a complex issue, and we are trying to make the law as perfect as it can be. I shall take further legal advice on the points made by the hon. Gentleman, so he may have helped me to make the law better.
<P>
I question the practical effect of amendment No. 269. I have no doubt that the Chief Constable will be alert to the security and protection of the information that he has on officers' registrable associations. He would be conscious of any sensitive intelligence information about officers and their alleged membership of particular organisations, and I am sure that in disclosing summary information he would look carefully at what he was revealing both directly and indirectly. I have every confidence in him. I gave serious consideration to the change proposed in the amendment, but my legal advice is that the current drafting of the clause provides greater protection.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to look at exactly what is meant by amendment No. 271; we will consult further with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone on that. In dealing with the issue of disclosure we have been anxious to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. That is why we have the offence of unlawful disclosure which the hon. Gentleman seeks to remove through amendment No. 258. I am surprised that he seeks to do that.
<P>
I also find the drafting of amendment No. 259 rather illogical. In effect, it would mean that, if one of the persons specified in subsection (8) knew of a registrable interest of a member of the police force because, for example, he lived in his locality, he would be liable to conviction if he passed on that information. As we all know, Northern Ireland is a small village. It is difficult for information not to be in the possession of a lot of people. People inevitably know other people's interests and associations.
<P>
Individuals would have to demonstrate that the information was obtained other than through their employment or office to avail themselves of the defence set out on the face of the Bill. They could not simply claim that as a defence, but would have to make out a case. On the basis of those arguments I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 256 and not to press the other amendments grouped with it. I have accepted amendment No. 270 in principle and I want to look at amendment No. 271 again.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 18, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. As he often does, he has highlighted a technical deficiency in the Bill. We are going through the Bill to try to identify any technical deficiencies and fundamental issues that need to be addressed. I can envisage occasions on which the Board would require information on the registrable associations of members of the police force other than senior officers, however, I would not want the drafting to allow fishing expeditions to find out the registrable interests of individual officers.
<P>
My experience of Northern Ireland is that there are people who are prepared to exploit the law for such purposes, although I do not believe that that is the intention of my hon. Friend. As Patten said, it is not membership of exclusive organisations per se that is the key issue, but whether such membership affects an officer's ability to discharge his or her duties effectively and impartially. We must protect that principle. I have set out my views on the amendments. Amendment No. 18 has identified a matter that we shall look at again. We shall return to it if possible on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> We have made minuscule progress, but I do not fail to recognise that the Minister has taken into consideration the points that we have raised in amendments Nos. 270 and 271. I believe that the whole clause will be revisited at considerable length on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> At the outset it must be emphasised that amendments Nos. 19, 20, 21, 267 and 22 refer to clause 48, which has the brief title ``Code of Ethics'', whereas amendments Nos. 24, 25, 26 and 27 refer to clause 49, which has the title ``Guidance as to use of equipment for maintaining or restoring public order''. The Chairman's selection requires me take those matters together.
<P>
The lead chapter of the Patten report outlined his vision of a new beginning for policing. He immediately addressed the issue of human rights, which will be embodied in the code of ethics. I believe that that is not coincidental that that issue appears at the start of such an important report, but that it is an underscoring of the importance of the code of ethics and human rights. The compelling fact is that such issues are central to all matters pertaining to a new police service. Patten said in that lead chapter
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is a central proposition of this Report that the fundamental purpose of policing should be . . . the protection and the vindication of the human rights of all . . . There should be no conflict between human rights and policing. Policing means protecting human rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another quotation that I came across which seems to emphasise that comes from the late Frank Wright, lecturer at Queen's university. He said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>National conflicts, once they are fully developed, revolve around issues of law and order and justice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we reflect for a moment, we will recognise the truth of that. Over the years in Northern Ireland we have seen shoot to kill, paramilitary beatings, Diplock courts, kangaroo courts, discrimination and economic bombings. They characterise the conflict of the past three decades and are expressions of horrendous injustice visited upon all our traditions. We now have to move on.
<P>
Because of that history, the constitutional and institutional issues that are to be settled ultimately revolve around the issues of law, order and justice. In a sense, that is the essence of the Good Friday agreement. It established the Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission, the Patten commission and a criminal justice review body, which are all concerned with law, order, justice and human rights.
<P>
The intention behind the amendments is to make human rights the heart of the new beginning for the police service and of a new political order in Northern Ireland. Central to that is the code of ethics, which is anticipated in clause 48. It is self-evident that the police have a central role to play in the management of the code of ethics. My party maintains that it is necessary that the Policing Board is, and is seen to be, the agency that considers, approves and issues the code of ethics. That is important in building confidence in the new police service and in giving credibility to the design and enforcement of human rights requirements.
<P>
Why is that? First, human rights are not an option or an add-on in any political or policing context. They are a crucial, central responsibility, which should be given to the Policing Board. Secondly, the Policing Board will be the independent, cross-community, representative agency within the new policing structures. It needs to have ownership—in association with the police, the Human Rights Commission and the police ombudsman—of the code of ethics; which embodies the human rights culture and structures of the new police service. The best method to ensure that ownership is for the Policing Board to consider, approve and issue the code of ethics.
<P>
Thirdly—and this is not an exclusively nationalist point—many members of the RUC will continue in the new police service. I accept that. However, it may sit uneasily with the police to have lead responsibility for human rights design, given that they are just emerging from a period of great trauma and suffering, and will inevitably be influenced by that. That is human nature. It is important that the real or alleged human rights abuses that are laid at the door of the RUC do not influence the code of ethics—neither should they be perceived to influence it. That is why the Policing Board should take charge of the transition, and have lead responsibility in the code of ethics.
<P>
The main purpose of the amendments is to integrate into the planning process for the code of ethics the board, the police, the Human Rights Commission and the police ombudsman. The Policing Board, which is representative of the community, should be the core body in the consultative process by which the code of ethics is designed and implemented. The amendments would give it that responsibility.
<P>
Clause 49 deals with guidance on the use of equipment for maintaining or restoring public order. In the context of Northern Ireland, that primarily means plastic bullets. Indeed, the notes from the Library refer, in terms of equipment, only to plastic bullets. That is, in itself, a very emotive issue and the reason why it is difficult, in the same breath, to deal with a code of ethics and the requirement for guidance on equipment in a plastic bullets ethos, but that is what we must do.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I wonder how the community in Britain would react to death caused by plastic bullets, which are available to the police service there, but have never been used. In Northern Ireland, 14 deaths have been caused by plastic bullets in 25 years. If that figure were extrapolated to the United Kingdom, there would have been 700 deaths during the same period, which shows the scale of the issue. A further three deaths have been caused by rubber bullets. If we remember that those deaths occurred in disputed circumstances and that it is accepted that the victims were generally civilian and innocent—many were children—we begin to understand the anger that the use of that lethal weapon has caused in Northern Ireland.
<P>
It is important to put the matter into context and to understand the influence of background, to which reference was made earlier in terms of registration of interests. I draw the Committee's attention to a period of four days, 7 to 11 July 1996, when members of the Protestant Unionist community—I must use that phrase for identification—were protesting and 662 plastic bullets were fired. During the ensuing four days, 11 to 14 July, when members of the nationalist Catholic community were protesting with no more vigour than that of their Protestant or Unionist counterparts, a mammoth 5,340 plastic bullets were used. In one section of the community, 662 plastic bullets were used in four days; in another section, during the following four days, nearly 5,400 plastic bullets were used.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Words have many meanings and I must refer the hon. Gentleman to Patten, who referred to plastic baton rounds. They are not bullets and it would help our examination of the matter if the correct terminology was employed. It is very emotive to talk about bullets when that is not accurate and not the description used by Patten.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I certainly take on board what the Minister said, but no one could seriously argue that that enormous statistical difference is not important in revealing the difference in attitude when dealing with one community and the other. Any reasonable person would conclude that the judgment used is subjective.
<P>
To put the matter in context, the equipment covered by the guidance to which clause 49 refers is lethal. The Patten report was not written in the nationalist or Unionist image; it does not refer to policing as the Social Democratic and Labour party would have designed it, but we accept it as a baseline around which a new beginning can evolve. To prove that Patten is not in our own image, one of the issues on which we and Patten differ fundamentally is the continued use of plastic bullets. We told Patten that plastic bullets should be withdrawn immediately; that remains our attitude. A lethal weapon that has caused so many injuries should not be available today, tomorrow or the next day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman note that Patten considered what happened in other police forces? The circumstances in which the use of baton rounds were sanctioned would, in a number other countries, including the Netherlands, lead to the use of live rounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I note what the hon. Gentleman says. I do not want to extrapolate that argument and say that live rounds should have been used on 5,340 occasions in four days, or 662 occasions during the another four days.
<P>
However, there is a problem. Patten said about plastic baton rounds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we would like to see the use of PBRs discontinued as soon as possible . . . But we do not wish to see a situation in which the police would have no choice but to resort to live rounds . . . We recommend that an immediate and substantial investment be made in a research programme to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternatives to the PBR.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the implementation plan for policing reform, the Government state that they are committed to carrying out a research programme on alternatives to plastic bullet rounds; that the research will also consider the deployment of equipment within an overall public order equipment strategy; and that the research programme will be launched in June 2000. It is now the end of June, and this weekend, Saturday 1 July, we enter the intensive marching season, so I wonder at what stage the Government's research programme into PBR use has reached. Has it commenced? When will it end? Who is conducting the research? What experts are involved? What degree of independence do they have? What are the study's terms of reference? We do not know anything about a matter that has a direct bearing on the amendments to clause 49. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer my questions, so that the Committee gains a better understanding of the degree of urgency and concern attached to it.
<P>
One set of amendments deals with the code of ethics and the other with the use of equipment for maintaining or restoring public order. Both sets sit happily together, in terms of who does what, which is why they are grouped together. I hope that the Government will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As I listened carefully to the hon. Member for South Down, I was struck by his arguments in respect of clause 49. I regret to tell him that, even though I understood his reasoning, the more detail he went into, the more convinced I was that he is wrong.
<P>
Nobody wants to use baton rounds or any ``mechanisms'' to restore or maintain public order, if such use can possibly be avoided. We have never used baton rounds on the mainland of Great Britain, although we came jolly close during the Broadwater Farm riots—as I recall, the rounds were issued, but not used. It is regrettable that such things should be required for public order purposes, but the rules of their use are such that they are used as an alternative to live ammunition in circumstances in which the degree of public disorder is such that police in many other countries—including the United States and, remarkably, some European countries that are regarded as having liberal credentials and enlightened policies, such as the Netherlands—would not hesitate to exploit any discretion to use them.
<P>
I am reminded of a large 16th-century cannon pointing outward from Dover castle which has on it the words ``Ultima ratio regum''—the ultimate rationale of kings. I regret to have to say to the hon. Gentleman that, although one hopes it is based on democratic credentials, the process by which states enforce their authority sometimes involves the use of force. The 16th-century iron founder who founded that cannon was simply reflecting what people said at the time.
<P>
Who will take those unpleasant decisions? Will it be an unelected board or the Secretary of State, where, politically, the buck stops? I have not the slightest doubt that it must be the politician. A Minister is answerable for policy, for his actions and for the use. It became increasingly clear to me as I listened to the hon. Gentleman that, given the gravity and nature of the issue, it is fundamentally flawed and wrong to give the board that power.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I quote his argument back to him. He says that the power should rest with an elected politician— the Secretary of State—but I am sure that he is aware that 10 members of the 18-member Policing Board are elected representatives. Moreover, the community that might suffer the consequences of any decision elects them. The ultimate responsibility must rest with the elected representatives of the people of the north of Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but in the context of what is happening in Northern Ireland I do not believe that his proposal is workable. Under the clause, the Secretary of State must consult on the guidance; he cannot act arbitrarily and ignore the consultation process. He must consult the board, the Chief Constable and the Police Association. Clearly, provision is made for consultation, and it would be extraordinary if there were not.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that there will be elected representatives on the board. I do not know how devolution in Northern Ireland will proceed. The vast majority of decisions about policing in Scotland are taken in Scotland. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is asking me whether the board, as constituted, is democratically accountable.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that. The board may have many virtues, but that is not one of them. He should reflect on the fact that, ultimately, a democratically accountable person should take such decisions. I accept that there are imperfections. He might argue that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is a rather remote figure. I appreciate that, but the same can be said of all aspects of democracy. I urge him to think carefully, although I appreciate all the sub-texts and anxieties, many of which come from his community. The buck for issuing guidance should rest with the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): I am not sure how the Minister will respond to the debate, but if he accepts the amendments although there will be gains, there will also be losses. I am therefore perplexed about how to respond to amendments suggested by those such as human rights lobbies and others in Northern Ireland for whom I have the greatest respect.
<P>
There was a sense almost of anger, especially in the nationalist community, when it was suggested that the Chief Constable would be responsible for the code of ethics. My difficulty with the proposal is that the Bill must be impartial but also rigorous. Many of the objections to the Chief Constable as the author of the code of ethics come from an historic distrust or historical records to which the nationalist community wish to draw our attention; but the theme of the Patten report is that there should be a new beginning. If we disregard the calls on history made by the unionist community, we may also have to disregard those made by the nationalist community. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As a professional philosopher, what strikes me as especially significant about a code of ethics is that much depends on our conception of ethics. First, it is important that the Bill should specify a code of ethics, rather than a disciplinary code, because a code of ethics would try to get officers to have a sense of the morality of what they are doing in their daily practice and operations. Ethics is an operational matter, as well as a matter of principle. The Bill's early clauses do not explicitly state that, if a radically unsuitable code of ethics is produced, the board should have a formal role. It would be sensible for the board to have such a role, and I therefore feel drawn to the amendments. I hope that the Minister will respond to that suggestion when he replies to the debate.
<P>
I am somewhat devoted to the ideas of Emmanuel Kant and a code of ethics is about legislating for oneself—taking into oneself an idea about what is right and making that a law binding on oneself. That concept of ethics is much richer than a utilitarian view, for example, which might be at the back of some people's minds. The idea of a code of ethics is that it is self-prescribed, therefore, in this instance, the police themselves should be the authors of it. They should say what they believe it is right to do, explicitly propose it and bind themselves to it. We would agree with that, were it not for the history that makes people suspicious and say, ``No, these are not the kind of people who can adopt a Kantian ethic or form an idea of what is right for their operations and prescribe a law which is then binding on themselves''. However, if there is to be a fresh start for the police, there should be an element of trust. That might be foreign to those who criticise the arrangements, but if there is to be a new beginning and a new sense of trust, clause 48 as drafted will put it into effect.
<P>
Paragraph 4.8 of the Patten report mentions a code of practice on policing and a code of ethics. However, he states that the draft code produced by the Association of Chief Police Officers might be appropriate. That would fulfil my criterion that a code of ethics should be produced by the people on whom it will be binding. Ethics of that kind are needed if there is to be a sea change in how people think about the operation of policing, which Patten demands.
<P>
There is something to be said for swallowing clause 48(3), which proposes that the Chief Constable should produce the code of ethics and also, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down said, something to be said for reviewing it to see whether it has been done well or ill, which would be the formal responsibility of the Policing Board. In that respect, we could move a little further towards the amendments.
<P>
If there is to be a new beginning and if we are to trust a newly configured police service, we should think seriously about allowing the code of ethics to be produced by the police service, as testimony to its own capacity to make a fresh start.

<P>

<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> I am inherently sympathetic to the amendments, which relate to the power of the board and the extent to which we should be willing to trust it. The arguments advanced rest on the assumption that the board was set up to be fair-minded on difficult decisions about policing. The amendments highlight some of the more difficult issues that will face policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
It has been said many times, by hon. Members on both sides of the House, that we are planning for success rather than failure; we have now come to the crunch, when we determine to what extent we will assume success, and the extent to which we will empower the new structures to take decisions on the assumption that they will be right.
<P>
The composition of the board is well structured and well designed; discussions on a cross-community basis will therefore be forced to have a depth that would not otherwise have been possible. That does not mean that taking decisions will be easy and, more to the point, it does not mean that fractious debates within the board will be avoided, but the board is the right place for decisions to be taken and debates to be held, because it will carry the can for the quality of the police service that ensues.
<P>
On that basis, I have no difficulty with the argument promoted by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) that the code of ethics should be in the hands of the board. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments; I wonder what counter-argument he will advance if he does not do so.
<P>
We are straying into even more delicate territory when it comes to equipment. The strongest argument for maintaining those responsibilities in the hands of the Secretary of State, which the Minister will probably use, is the assumption that if the equipment were used, things would be in such a bad state in Northern Ireland that the board was unable to carry out its functions in a normal fashion. That is the only argument that would carry any weight. We must trust the board to be sufficiently well constituted to work effectively, even in those difficult circumstances; nevertheless, this is a judgment call.
<P>
It is not surprising that the Government are nervous about such difficult decisions, and where responsibility for making them should reside. If the Minister rejects the amendments, I hope that he will, at the very least, return to his advisers. He should consider a compromise wherein the Government allow decisions to be nominally in the hands of the board for a probationary period, and introduce a break clause so that if things do not work, the Secretary of State can quickly take the powers back. That would be messy, but it would be preferable to not empowering the board now. It would also take courage, because there will be some washback on the Government if it is the wrong call. I ask the Minister to be courageous, because that would be the best way to show that we trust the structures that we are creating. If they work, we will have a world-class policing structure in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I ask my hon. Friends to be sufficiently courageous to resist the charming arguments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and to accept my view and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead that the Bill has got it right.
<P>
I agree with the line taken by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on clause 49. In Northern Ireland today—and occasionally in future, although to a lesser degree—one thing that the Secretary of State must do is determine what the guidance contains. He must consult when he wants to change it, but there may be circumstances in which a rapid decision that only the Secretary of State can take is necessary. Clause 49 is right.
<P>
On clause 48, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead made a good point about the historical reaction of the various communities; our hon. Friend the Member for South Down and his party occasionally react in an understandable way, but when we say, ``Oh no, not the Chief Constable—let it go to the board,'' we are, with due respect, thinking in terms of the past. The present Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has a very high reputation and I would have no doubt about placing the matter in his hands, let alone that of his successors.
<P>
I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said about the Patten report. It is significant that Patten did not recommend that the code of ethics should be drafted by the board. It is also significant that he chose the draft code of the Association of Chief Police Officers, updated to take account of the Human Rights Act 1998, as a good example of what the Chief Constable may do.
<P>
The board has many powers over the Chief Constable. Operational matters, standards of conduct and practice are undoubtedly matters for the chief officer of police, but he must consult with the board and the board is responsible for holding him to account. If it is not sufficient for the board to have powers to secure a satisfactory code of practice from a Chief Constable who is only too anxious to oblige, then I do not know what is.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I am sure that the entire Committee will readily understand much of the sentiment, and certainly the purpose, of the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. As he explained clearly, the earlier amendments in the group would give the Policing Board responsibility for preparing and issuing the code of ethics instead of the Chief Constable, and for issuing guidance on the deployment and use of public order equipment instead of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 19 to 22 deal with the code of ethics. The Bill currently requires the Chief Constable to prepare and issue that code. The reason for that is that the Chief Constable is the leader and manager of the police service in Northern Ireland, just as in any police service anywhere else in the UK. There is no resiling from that clear fact of life. Accordingly, the Government considered it appropriate for the Chief Constable to show such leadership in preparing the code of ethics—taking advice, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) said, from existing practice elsewhere—and setting the standards of practice for police officers. However, the Government recognise the importance that many members of the Committee attach to the board and its leading role in the code of ethics. On reflection, therefore, we will introduce amendments on Report to require that the code is subject to approval, and issued by the board, giving it the final say on the code of ethics. We do not believe that it would be right to divorce the Chief Constable from the preparation of the code and I do not think that that is the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down or his party. My hon. Friends the Members for Leominster and for Hemel Hempstead made it clear that the Chief Constable is rightly a central figure in that process and should be at the centre of any discussion.
<P>
We will therefore amend the Bill to provide for the Chief Constable to prepare a draft code for approval and for the board to issue that code. Once the draft is submitted, the board will consider it and will be free to accept it in the form submitted or to make any amendments that it wishes, after consulting the Chief Constable. That is exactly the process that applies under the Bill to, for example, the annual policing plan and we consider it appropriate to apply that consistency of approach to the code of ethics. With the assurance that the Government will introduce amendments on Report, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 would enable the Policing Board to revise guidance on the deployment and use by the police of equipment for maintaining or restoring public order. The Bill, as has rightly been pointed out, enables the Secretary of State to prepare and issue such guidance. The Patten Commission described the equipment used by the police for public order purposes as one of the most controversial aspects of policing in Northern Ireland; paragraph 9.12 of its report refers specifically to that. On the use of plastic baton rounds, I emphasise the point made by my right hon. Friend the Minister: there is a difference between plastic baton rounds and plastic bullets. It does not serve the purpose of our discussion to confuse the two. As Patten said, that issue is of course—and rightly—controversial and has been the focus of attention. Sadly, it remains necessary for plastic baton rounds to be available to the police in certain circumstances, although the need for them has, fortunately, diminished as the security situation has improved.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down quoted some of the statistics on the possible use of such equipment over the years, although I suspect that it would not have been used in every case that he quoted. There have equally been cases—he cited the example of Drumcree in 1996—of police officers being injured in the pursuit of public order. In a tragic case in 1998, for example, a police officer named Mr. O'Reilly was injured and subsequently died; he was aged 30 and was from Waringstown. There are therefore clearly circumstances in which the police are put at great risk.
<P>
The deal that most countries make in regard to policing is perhaps not always stated clearly. For the purpose of our debate, we need to establish those first principles. Police forces all over the world, and specifically in the UK, carry out duties on behalf of the community to protect it and keep order within it in a way that private citizens cannot. They often go into dangerous situations on our behalf and put themselves at risk for the protection of individuals and property and for the maintenance of good order. Because of the service that they render the community, it is incumbent on us to ensure that they have whatever equipment or support are necessary for them to protect not only the community but themselves. If any justification for that is necessary, we have only to look at the Patten report—which is the reason for the Bill and the clause. Paragraph 9.4 on page 52 of the report lists the weapons used against the police: stones, bricks, bottles, knives, spears, hatchets, firearms of all kinds, including automatic assault rifles and hand grenades, blast bombs, pipe bombs, coffee jar bombs, petrol bombs, Chinese mortars, explosive darts and catapults. Given that we ask police officers to enter such situations on our behalf, or that of the people of Northern Ireland, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down agrees that they should be given reasonable means to protect themselves and the wider community.
<P>
I well understand the desire of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down to give the responsibility for issuing guidance to the police on the deployment and use of public order equipment to the Policing Board rather than the Secretary of State. However, I cannot agree with that. If I may say so—it is becoming almost tedious to keep saying it—the hon. Member for Beaconsfield made the point very well. We should again turn to the Patten report, which makes the clear recommendation at paragraph 9.20 that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>guidance governing the deployment and use of PBRs should be soundly based in law, clearly expressed and readily available as public documents.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have gone further than that. We have made provision enabling the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the use and deployment of any equipment used in maintaining or restoring public order. I had hoped that because that development was consistent with Patten that my hon. Friend would welcome it. Perhaps he felt unable to do so because of the research project that he mentioned in moving the amendment and which Patten recommended in paragraph 9.15.
<P>
We agree with Patten that we would like to see the use of plastic baton rounds discontinued as soon as possible. But we also agree with Patten that at the moment, as in many countries, the only alternative to plastic baton rounds would be live ammunition. I am sure that my hon. Friend would not argue in favour of that. We are committed to carrying out a research programme on alternatives to plastic baton rounds, as recommended by Patten.
<P>
The terms of reference will be to find a less potentially lethal alternative to PBRs, while not reducing the capability of the police to protect the public and defend themselves when under attack. That research programme, which is supported by the police, will be launched in the near future. I am unable to give my hon. Friend a specific date for this but as soon as we have any more information on that my right hon. Friend the Minister will write to him. We recognise the urgency and we are not dragging our feet.
<P>
The Government believe that the responsibility for preparing and consulting on such guidance properly lies with the Secretary of State. There are always likely to be controversial issues both in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Members of the Committee will be aware that the Home Secretary has issued unified guidance to all police forces in England and Wales about the deployment and use by the police of plastic baton rounds. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that it is not something that happens regularly; it certainly would happen only in extreme circumstances. The guidance also applies in Northern Ireland. The Government have not left the matter to individual police authorities in England and Wales and we believe that this is properly a matter for us. The Bill puts the responsibility with the Government and that is where it should lie.
<P>
Finally, I invite my hon. Friend the Member for South Down to withdraw amendment No. 19 and not to press amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 22 on the basis that the Government will table amendments on Report making the board responsible for approving and issuing a code of ethics. I also, although not with the same confidence, ask him not to press amendments Nos. 24 to 27 on the basis of the explanation that I have given. Otherwise, I ask the Committee to resist the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> This has been an interesting and informative debate. I thank hon. Members for their participation. They have a sense of the importance of both these sectors. I had an exchange with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on several issues. I do not want to sound disrespectful, but his response is based on a philosophical or logical interpretation of what it means to use plastic baton rounds. I think that he said that they are used in circumstances in which the level of public disorder is such that that is justified. That may be so, but he may not have full knowledge about what happens in our community. He may not know about Norah McCabe, who was killed by a plastic bullet. Independent evidence shows that there was no public disturbance whatever, so there can be no justification for their use.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Julie Livingstone, a child of 13, was returning from buying milk when she was killed by a plastic bullet. It is accepted that she was not involved in public disorder or anything approximating to it. Many such incidents have taken place, which have caused my community to lose any confidence in the code, as it is called, and in the fact that plastic baton rounds are always used in circumstances in which their use can be ``justified.''
<P>
There is even disparity of opinion between the police services in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the use of plastic bullets. Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary stated clearly that plastic bullets were not to be used in the defence of property. The RUC disagrees with that, so there is no parity on the application of rules and regulations on the use of plastic bullets.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead made a most eloquent contribution on a high philosophical level, to which I shall not in any way attempt to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I want to correct a slight inaccuracy in the hon. Gentleman's description of the relationship between the use and deployment of PBRs in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland. The Association of Chief Police Officers produced revised guidelines on the police deployment of PBRs, which came into force on 1 August 1999. The guidelines in Northern Ireland now mirror those in England and Wales. I make that point for the sake of accuracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for correcting my description of the situation. I was referring to the important contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead. He developed the theme that ethics are personal and that a code of ethics should be that of the person. It should create a discipline for the individual, based on that perception. I think that I have understood my hon. Friend correctly, but his discourse was very philosophical. I hope that he will excuse me if I have misunderstood him. I dealt with the idea rather poorly in my opening remarks, when I said that that would be all right if we had a continuum of an experience that would lead to the development of an acceptable code of ethics.
<P>
We are coming out of 30 years of violence. Members of the existing police service will, by and large, continue working in the new police service. Those officers have undergone a whole raft of experiences and emotions. They have participated in many events, sometimes self-initiated, sometimes driven by circumstance. This is a difficult philosophical point. It is not possible to expect members of the police force, who have gone through that period, to be given a clean sheet to start afresh. They cannot be expected to cast entirely out of their minds those experiences and attitudes, and produce a code of ethics that can be personally applied. A different body or person must create the code of ethics.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> If, when the police service tries to transform itself, it cannot produce a code of ethics that is compelling to those of us who want the fresh start and the fresh inclusivity to work, I suggest that the board should have the power to gainsay the inadequate code. I was pleased that the Minister took up my suggestion. However, does my hon. Friend agree that it would be better if the code came from the police and they transcended history? That would be a remarkable achievement.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his further exposition, and I accept the logic of what he says. The Minister's comments took us down that road somewhat, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster made similar comments, so I shall respond to all, together.
<P>
If I understood correctly, the Minister said that an amendment would be tabled to allow the Chief Constable to draft the code of ethics first. That draft would be submitted to the Policing Board for approval, amendment and consultation, and the board would determine the code of ethics. I thank the Minister for that information, and on that basis, I shall be pleased to withdraw amendment No. 19 and not to press the consequential amendments. I look forward to seeing the Minister's amendment.
<P>
Some of the amendments concern the use of equipment. I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation, and he asked me, less confidently, not to press some amendments to a vote. The Minister gave me some reasons for that, as he gave some information about the research project. I take on board what he and other hon. Members said about dealing with acute public disorder and the Patten commission's recommendations about the research. If that research project is sufficiently comprehensive and reports soon, and if we have an opportunity to make firm representations about its result, I shall not press the amendments.
<P>
It is important that the code of ethics is seen by all to deliver a new service and a new attitude that all communities can wholeheartedly support. We are not point-scoring or trying to add a political dimension to the debate. We want a police and security service that will underpin the new political institutions and constitutional arrangements. That is in the interests of all of us, whether we are nationalist, Unionist or republican, or of extreme or no political persuasion. That is what the Social Democratic and Labour party is about. We have only one chance to ensure that this new creation and new ethos will deliver that which we have sought for so many years. That is fundamental to the continuance of the institutions that we so painfully established, which are now up and running in the north of Ireland. I thank the Minister for his response, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 25, line 13, after `State;', insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) the Ombudsman;
<P>
(cb) the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission;'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 245, in page 25, line 13, after `State', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 28, in clause 49, page 25, line 25, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) the Ombudsman; and
<P>
(e) the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> We have already debated this afternoon the relevant arguments about who should do what, and I recommend amendment No. 23 on that basis. I look forward to the Minister's response to it. Amendment No. 28 relates to clause 49. In view of our previous debate, I shall not press it further.
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> The clause appears to place a duty on the Chief Constable to issue a code of ethics that will lay down standards for members of the police force. The Government's intention appears to be that the provision is primarily a legislative tool for achieving a human rights agenda in the police. It is extremely important internally and externally to ensure that the arrangement is set up in the right way—the police and the general public should agree that human rights principles are at the core of the new policing arrangements. In view of the code's importance, there should be effective consultation inside and outside the police on its contents. Amendment No. 245 suggests that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission should be consulted.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 23 and 28 would introduce the commission in this context, as we propose, but they would also involve the ombudsman. We believe that that would not be an appropriate use of the ombudsman's position. I agree with the sentiment that lies behind the amendments, but we need a clear distinction between the ombudsman's role and the process that is involved in putting together the code of ethics. That is why amendment No. 245 refers only to the commission. As the hon. Member for South Down said, the relevant arguments have already been clearly stated. I hope that the Minister will agree to our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Amendment No. 23, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, would require the police ombudsman and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to be involved in the consultation process on the code of ethics.
<P>
Amendment No. 245, which was spoken to by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would require the Chief Constable to consult the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. For some reason, the hon. Gentleman felt that the ombudsman was unsuitable in that context.
<P>
I have been convinced by the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down on previous occasions and on this one. Apart from the fact that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire excluded a role for the ombudsman, I was also persuaded by his general argument. We agree that there should be a statutory obligation for both bodies to be consulted on the code. I therefore ask Committee members to agree amendment No. 23.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 was spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. It would require the police ombudsman and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to be consulted on guidance on the use of public order equipment. I accept that there is a good case for consulting the ombudsman on such guidance. That would allow the Secretary of State to seek the ombudsman's views on such experience as she may accumulate. I cannot see how it would not be useful for the Secretary of State to have that information. We therefore accept that the ombudsman should be included on the list of consultees. However, we do not accept that the Secretary of State should be required to consult the Human Rights Commission on such guidance.
<P>
That said, the list of consultees in clause 49 is not intended to be either exclusive or exhaustive. I am confident that the Human Rights Commission will have every opportunity to voice its opinion on such matters. It does so whenever it feels it appropriate and it is always listened to seriously. I am sure that if it has a particular point of view on this it will be heard with courtesy. If appropriate, we will take note of what it says. I do not believe, however, that it is necessary for it to be included on a statutory list of those who should be consulted because it will take the opportunity, as and when it arises, to voice its opinions.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 23. I hope that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will withdraw amendment No. 245.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment would fall. The question is whether the hon. Gentleman wants to press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I cannot withdraw it, as I did not move it. I shall not press it to a vote. Given what the Minister has said, that is fair enough, although I do not say that because I agree with his judgment about the ombudsman. Does he not agree that by including the ombudsman in that consultation process, for reasons that I understand, he begins to reduce the arm's length distance that must exist between the policy making of the ombudsman and the police service? All sorts of other danger would arise if a closer relationship developed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> No. It would depend on what function we were asking the ombudsman to carry out. We are not saying that it is the responsibility of the ombudsman to draft the code or to provide guidance. By including the ombudsman, we are seeking to take advantage of the cumulative experience that she will gain. We would be negligent if we cut ourselves off from that information and advice. It is a good argument. It does not prejudice the position of the ombudsman who at any one time might investigate individual cases. We are talking about general principles that she may have developed as a result of investigating individual cases that may be relevant to the code.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Is not the Minister exaggerating what he describes as the cumulative experience of the ombudsman? When the Chief Constable issues the code of ethics, the ombudsperson will not have any cumulative experience whatsoever. It strikes me that drawing the ombudsperson into this issue imposes her point of view and, if the Chief Constable disagrees with it for operational reasons, it will create conflict.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is not necessarily the case. Any advice that is rejected could lead to conflict, but not necessarily. The hon. Gentleman assumes, by definition, that any advice that is given will be in conflict. The Secretary of State or the Chief Constable might find her advice in the light of the experience that she has had, or not had as the hon. Gentleman puts it, helpful. The ombudsman herself has nevertheless asked to be consulted. We are trying to be as open and transparent as possible. When someone who holds such an important position asks to be consulted, it would be rather mean-spirited of us to say that under no circumstances should she be included. I return to the comments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire: I presume that if she felt that her integrity or independence would be compromised she would not have made such a request.
<P>
The issue should not detain the Committee, nor should it generate a great deal of conflict and disharmony. I therefore ask my hon. Friend not to press amendment No. 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Malins; I was distracted for a moment. I am not familiar with the rubrics, but I assumed that I had answered the debate earlier. The Minister has accepted amendment No. 23, and I said that I would not press amendment No. 28 except as amended by the Minister—but I am not sure how it will happen. Can we adopt half an amendment? I ask the Minister to release me from the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We accept the principle of half of the amendment, and will introduce an amendment to reflect that on Report.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 48, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Dowd.]

Adjourned accordingly at twenty-three minutes to Seven o'clock till Tuesday 4 July at half-past Ten o'clock.
