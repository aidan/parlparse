<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I have three announcements. First, hon. Members may remove their jackets if they wish. I remind the Committee that it is customary to await the Chairman's consent before doing that. Secondly, there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Thirdly, I remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to select starred amendments.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application for registration</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): The Opposition have given some thought to the list of elections in subsection (2) of the clause. It is fair to say that differences of opinion will occur within parties about whether the Bill should include local government elections. If parties are to be registered, and if the Committee is determined to stamp out the abuses of recent years, the prospect of such abuses causing difficulty in local government elections must be taken seriously. In spite of our concerns, we are, on balance, prepared to agree with the Government that local government elections should be included within the ambit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support. He rightly said that clause 2(2) sets out relevant elections, which are parliamentary elections, elections to the European Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the new Northern Ireland Assembly, local government elections and local elections in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman made a good point. The balance of argument must be in favour of the inclusion of local government. In some respects it is far easier to cause confusion in local elections than in general elections. By and large, the media draw attention to difficulties and confusions at constituency level. The same media scrutiny does not occur, however, in local government elections and at ward level. It is sensible to include local government, bearing in mind that the overall objective of the Bill is to protect the electorate from abuse that is intended to mislead it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I agree with the Minister. The clause has implications for the arrangements in schedule 2, about which he and I have exchanged views and correspondence. I am grateful for the letter that he sent me. The provisions must ensure practical arrangements for certification of the nomination of candidates using registered parties' names.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised that issue at the end of Tuesday's sitting. I have written to him, and the Committee will debate schedule 2 at the appropriate time. I should not want to over-test your patience on that point, Mr. Gale. Although the hon. Gentleman has legitimate concerns, they are covered by the way in which schedule 2 is drafted. I am content for now for clause 2 in its entirety to stand part of the Bill because it is an important part of the procedure that the Bill introduces.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grant of applications</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 1, line 27, leave out `a' and insert `any'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 16 in clause 6, page 2, line 31, leave out `a' and insert `any'.
<P>
No. 17, in clause 18, page 5, line 30, leave out `a' and insert `any'.
<P>
No. 14, in schedule 1, page 8, line 10, leave out from `specify' to end of line 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`one or more names to be the party's registered name or names'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr Greenway:</B> They key amendment in the group is amendment No. 14. Schedule 1, paragraph 2 refers to ``the party's registered name'' and therefore implies that only one name may be registered. An alternative is allowed only if it is in Welsh. We have no quibble with that, and we shall discuss later whether other languages might be appropriate. We are, however, concerned that the registration of a single name of a maximum of six words is too restrictive. There are strong arguments for the opportunity to register more than one name. In the light of that, amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 would be necessary to replace the words ``a registered name'' by ``any registered name'' for the obvious reason.
<P>
In amendment No. 14, we seek to make it clear that more than one name could be registered. It is important to consider the registration of more than one name for historical reasons. My party is generally known as the Conservative party and Unionist party, but my experience is that it is usual practice to put only the name of the Conservative party on ballot papers. On occasions, in local government elections, I have registered as the official Conservative candidate to avoid the sharp practice that others have experienced and to which the Minister referred. We are, however, also known as the Tory party, which is a quite separate name from the Conservative party or the Conservative and Unionist party.
<P>
The Labour party also has other names, such as the New Labour party; the names socialist and co-operative have also frequently been used. I cannot speak for the Labour party as to which name it might want to register, but it, too, might have concerns and reasons for registering more than one name. I am not sure what to suggest for Liberal Democrats because they may want to preserve the word ``Liberal'' for themselves. Liberal party candidates have, however, stood in elections; it is fair to say that some have done so on a bona fide ticket, but others have not.
<P>
Members of the Committee agree that they want to prevent confusion and sharp practice from undermining the legitimate prospects of any candidate who stands for a party at any of the elections included in clause 2. I will not labour the point, but it should be possible to register historic names. They are, however, not provided for in the proposal to register just one name. Also, it is not right to leave it solely to the registrar to make decisions about people who seek to register a name that is connected historically with a party that has already been registered but is not included within its name.
<P>
To take a domestic example, if we were allowed to register the name of the Conservative and Unionist party, but not that of the Tory party, it is conceivable that someone else could register the name of the Tory party. Under clause 3(1)(a), the registrar would presumably have the opportunity to say, ``Ah, that is likely to confuse electors and I will not therefore allow the name to be registered.'' That could also give rise to difficulties over some of the other words that I have mentioned, such as socialist and co-operative. It behoves Parliament to give the registrar clearer guidelines.
<P>
The registrar has the power to refuse to register certain names so as to deal with any sharp practice involving parties that seek to register names with which they have not been historically associated and thereby sabotage the opportunities of existing parties. In going down the unique road of registering political parties, our general concern is that the registration process should allow parties to register with the registrar all those names with which the electorate has historically associated them. Will the Minister explain why he thinks that registering one name only would meet that requirement? We do not think that it does, and urge him to consider alternatives that would allow more than one name to be registered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): Can the definition of a party to be registered include more than one name? I imagine that the Conservative party would be registered in the name of the Conservative and Unionist party, and that that would obviate the problem that the amendment seeks to address. It is clearly true that many parties have names that include more than one word--Conservative and Unionist and Liberal Democrat are two examples that are represented in the Room. Separate registration of the two halves of the name would be an odd procedure, and it would affect the special status of Welsh as a statutory language. Plaid Cymru should be allowed to register itself as such, as well as by an English name.
<P>
The Bill contains a clause that allows a returning officer to rule out any names that might mislead. That clause would prevent other parties from using the names Conservative, Unionist or Tory in a way that is designed to mislead voters. The amendment could affect the position in Northern Ireland. If the Conservative and Unionist party is allowed to register both parts of its name separately, will not that affect the right of Unionist parties in Northern Ireland to use ``Unionist'' as a common word? Would not the clause remove the possibility of using that word, and put it in the category of other words--such as ``independent'' and ``residents''--that cannot be appropriated by one party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I understand why the amendments have been tabled. One of the Bill's main aims is to prevent candidates using misleading descriptions on the ballot paper. One way of achieving that would be to allow parties to register as many names as they want, so that other parties could not appropriate those descriptions. That is the aim of the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) has demonstrated, the Bill achieves the same aim, but in a different and, I believe, better way.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
First, there is no requirement in the Bill that candidates of a political party must use its registered name as their description on the ballot paper. They are free to use a variant of that name, provided only that, if the description is likely to lead voters to associate the candidate with a registered party, the nominating officer of that party must certify that the candidate is entitled to use that description. That was the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. The nominating officer of a party plays a crucial role, and is there to protect that registered party's interests.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Canning Town):</B> Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware that in my constituency in 1994, Conservative candidates for local government elections traded on the ballot paper under the name ``Conservatives Against Labour's Ethnic Policies''. That was challenged by my predecessor in what used to be called Newham, South, Mr. Nigel Spearing. He was told by the Conservative party that local associations were autonomous and could call themselves what they wanted to. The declaration for those local elections, drafted for the Commission for Racial Equality, was signed by the right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech, not an intervention. If he wishes to make a speech, and tries to catch my eye, he may be successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I know of occasions in my constituency when people have used misleading descriptions. Some have described themselves in their literature as Labour, followed by ``Ind'', in very small print and in brackets, with the intention of indicating some kind of independence.
<P>
Such difficulties are common. I shall not refer to what might have happened in Tower Hamlets at times, as my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town has made his point. However, I hope that parties would not play games that are designed to mislead electors. Certainly, the Bill makes it no longer possible for a party's chairman or general secretary to say, ``That's got nothing to do with us, our local associations have that antonomy.'' Registered parties will have to account for what they do at national level, through a nominating officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> I am a little worried about the Minister's use of the word ``hope'' in that context. That was exactly the formula that Jim Callaghan used when descriptions were allowed on ballot papers. Someone stood as a Labour candidate against a Labour candidate, and Callaghan said that he did not expect people to be that dishonest. If fact, it happened, and that is why we are here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is exactly why we have introduced the Bill. My point, before the hon. Gentleman's intervention, was simply that a registered political party's nominating officer would have to account for it if the party engaged in such subterfuge. The Bill provides for direct accountability and is, in that sense, an improvement. I apologise if my clumsy observations misled the Committee, but the Government's intention is clear. There should be accountability and, most importantly, the public should not be misled by the descriptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The Minister said that the responsible officer of the nominated party would be held to account, but that would probably be after the event--after the damage had been done. The interval between the challenge and close of nominations and the election period is probably too short to find a legal remedy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We shall discuss the timetable on another occasion--indeed, there are amendments on that matter, which will need to be debated. Perhaps it would help the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the Committee if I explain how I see the sytem working.
<P>
If a candidate of the Conservative party, for example--assuming that it registered under that name--wanted to describe himself as a Scottish Conservative on the ballot paper, the party's nominating officer would, if the candidate was a legitimate and bona fide Conservative, presumably give his consent. If, however, the candidate was not a member of the Conservative party, consent would not be forthcoming. The important point is that the returning officer would be able to reject the description as being likely to lead voters to associate the candidate with the registered party--in this case, the Conservative party. Thus, candidates must justify their descriptions before their nominations are accepted. It must be clear that there is no attempt to confuse or muddy the waters by trying to associate a candidate with the Conservative party when he or she clearly has nothing to do with it. That is the effect of schedule 2(2), about which I know the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) is concerned. We will discuss it further when we debate that schedule.
<P>
The test is appropriate. If the description is not likely to lead voters to associate a candidate with a registered party, it should not be prohibited. No one would wish to prohibit descriptions when there was clearly no attempt to confuse. Of course, a candidate's description might inadvertently lead to confusion, but it is the effect that is relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) made the important point that some Liberal party candidates are bona fide, while others are there to confuse. If the Minister does not accept the amendment the legislation will place the returning officer in a difficult position, as he must determine whether a particular candidate is bona fide and the genuine article or there to confuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We can debate that when dealing with other parts of the Bill. We should not expect a judgment to be made about someone's motives; the judgment should be on whether a description is likely to confuse the electorate or mislead them into thinking that candidate X or candidate Y is possibly a Conservative, Liberal Democrat or Labour candidate. It is the effect of the description that is key.
<P>
The issue is not difficult. All members of the Committee are anoraks when it comes to this country's electoral system, if nothing else. We must all submit ourselves to the electorate from time to time--that has happened more frequently in some cases than in others. We understand the system. There is currently little or no guidance on dealing with such situations by, for instance, going to law. There is only the common sense of the returning officer.
<P>
We have all wanted to take action on occasions because of a clear attempt to confuse the electorate. The framework will help to prevent such confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want the Minister to answer a direct question so that it is on the record. The amendment would reduce potential confusion by allowing the registration of more than one name; we have been sidetracked into considering whether returning officers' powers or guidelines in schedule 2 will be sufficient to solve that problem. If, however, the word Tory were not registered and a candidate calling himself the Scottish Tory candidate tried to stand in an election to the Scottish Parliament, no certificate would be required because the Scottish Tory party would not have been registered.
<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that every returning officer would reject such a nomination on the ground that schedule 2 gives him adequate powers to do so? We are not clear whether that is the case. If the word Tory was registered with the registrar, it would be absolutely clear because there could be no Tory nomination without a valid certificate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The provisions are sufficiently robust to protect all reasonable variations of a party's name, including the word Tory, especially, because it is a word that is commonly used to refer to the Conservative party.
<P>
It would be more difficult for the Liberal Democrats to prevent someone using the word Whig in a description, because, other than those of us who have read history--[Interruption.] I have obviously amused hon. Members. Perhaps they are concerned about someone who is follicly challenged. The term Whig is no longer associated with the Liberal Democrat party; the term went out with the 19th century. The name Tory, however, is clearly associated with the Conservative party and would be recognised as such. Returning officers and the registrar would, I think, act accordingly.
<P>
The Bill's provisions to deal with misleading descriptions are preferable to those in the amendment because the Bill enables an objective test--is the description likely to mislead?--to be applied. The amendment would allow existing political parties to register an unlimited number of aliases which would make it more difficult to police the register.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, for example, there are many Unionist parties representing strands of unionism. Voters do not seem to have difficulty with that as there is a clear difference between the parties, which reflect differences in the Unionist community. Those parties have a legitimate place in Northern Ireland politics and in the electoral process which is about to be played out. Such is the sophistication of the Northern Ireland electorate that they will have to state preferences between Unionist candidates and pro-change candidates, which are not necessarily the same thing, by selecting from an alternative vote list. In such circumstances, we can leave it to the electorate to know their preferred choice.
<P>
Voters do not seem to have difficulty in distinguishing the Labour party from the Socialist Labour party, although there have been problems with the term New Labour, as my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) said earlier. At the general election last year, a Socialist Labour party candidate stood against me. I am pleased to say that he did not attract much support; my constituents seemed to have no difficulty in distinguishing between us. The situation was helped by the fact that he attacked me as a capitalist lackey throughout the election. Although voters did not recognise that description of me, they had no difficulty distinguishing between the Labour candidate and the Socialist Labour candidate.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat and Liberal party candidates seem capable of distinguishing themselves in the voter's mind. I recognise that the existence of a party such as the Liberal party poses a difficulty for the Liberal Democrat party. On another occasion in 1992, both brands of liberalism stood against me, although neither did very well. The Liberal Democrat vote reflected the fact that they were the main party of liberalism. Although the Liberal candidates attracted some votes in a very local area, they did not do well.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I return to what was said earlier about the Conservative and Tory parties--people often refer to the Conservative party as Tories. They also often and consistently refer to the Liberal Democrats as Liberals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I realise that. Indeed, some of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues in the House and in local Government often refer to themselves a Liberals, as distinct from Liberal Democrats; it is a habit that they have acquired over a long period in some cases. I simply reiterate that the Liberal party represents a distinctive strand in the tradition from which the hon. Gentleman comes and does not seem to have dififculty establishing that fact. Nor does the Liberal Democrat party have difficulty distinguishing itself where it is active and seeks to be elected. In those circumstances, nothing is necessarily or intrinsically misleading about someone being a Liberal candidate. Accordingly, it would not be sensible to accept the amendment. In the light of that explanation and of the interventions, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will feel able to withdraw the amendment. The system is sufficiently robust as it stands to enable all our concerns to met in any election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall try to sum up briefly. In response to the hon. Member for Battersea, I should have made the point about the Welsh language. If a party can register more than one name, if follows that one of them could be in Welsh; if there is any doubt about that, an amendment could be drafted to accommodate such a possibility. Later, we shall discuss whether other gaelic languages might be included, and the same reasoning would apply.
<P>
It would be for the benefit of the Committee and of the House as a whole if hon. Members were allowed the opportunity to reflect on the Minister's answer, not least because some of the minor parties that the Bill affects and which are not represented on the Committee will have views and will want to discuss the matter on Report.
<P>
Given the Minister's answer, a great deal will rest on the registrar's common sense. I am not suggesting that we should not take that for granted; we should. Equally, much will rest on the returning officers, the powers that they are given under schedule 2 and the guidance that we will try to persuade the Minister to include in the Bill.
<P>
I am left with more of a concern for the Liberal Democrat party than I am for my own. Given the Minister's answer, what would happen if it was allowed to register as the Liberal Democrat party, but the tiny disaffected rump of the Liberal movement of old, which occasionally puts up people as Liberal candidates, decided not to register the Liberal party? A person who entered a nomination saying that he wished to stand as the Liberal candidate would place in an invidious position the returning officer who must decide about accepting that nomination.
<P>
If the Liberal Democratic party were able to register under both that name and the old Liberal party name, its supporters and former supporters could then fight with the registrar through the appeals process, and through the public advertising, the necessity of which we shall attempt to persuade the Minister later. That would be better than leaving the matter entirely to the returning officer, as history shows that different constituencies will give different answers to the same question.
<P>
I am satisfied that we have aired the matter, but not that the Minister's solution is entirely correct. I shall not press the amendment to a vote, as hon. Members can take the matter up again on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Perhaps I can clear up the point that arose in the hon. Gentleman's earlier spirited defence of the Liberal Democrats. Let us take the example of a candidate who has been submitted under the Liberal name. Regardless of whether that candidate belonged to the Liberal Democratic party or to the rather smaller Liberal party, which is not represented in the House, the registrar would rule out the candidacy on the grounds that the use of the word Liberal in that context must be misleading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell (Colchester):</B> There would be no problem if every returning officer took that approach. However, the hon. Member for Ryedale was spot on: inconsistencies will occur. I urge the Minister to consider the confusions and inconsistencies that are bound to result from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not accept that they will, as the system that we have described is sufficiently robust. Difficulties will arise when different parties already have different names, but both will be protected as long as they both register. A party that does not register will not have that protection for its name.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats support the Bill, so I assume that they will register and so be protected. Names associated with them will also be protected. The difficult that I have described would arise only if the Liberal party registered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> There is also the question of under what name the Liberal Democrats will register. The title Liberal Democratic was adopted some time ago as the name by which party members wished to be known, but the full title is still the Social and Liberal Democratic party. The registrar would have to consider long and hard whether it would be right for a party that no longer refers to itself as social democratic to adopt those words for its title.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> One of the points that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made quite strongly on Second Reading was that the registrar should take the history of parties into account. If any confusion arose, the Liberal Democratic party would have to establish the direct lineage and ownership of the word Liberal. The use of that word as a party title stretches back to the time of Gladstone, and possibly before. The difficulties that concern the hon. Gentleman will not arise, although I realise why we are all so skittish about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The Minister has conceded that the term Tory can confuse, and that it would therefore be rejected. Any fair-minded person would accept that there is a big difference between the word Tory and the word Conservative on a ballot paper. I accept that confusion could arise, but is would probably be on a minor scale. However, the confusion would be compounded if a ballot paper listed the Liberal party and political opponents of the Liberal Democrats referred to the Liberal Democrats as Liberals. One cannot have it one way but not the other. Perhaps that issue, more than any other, highlights the difficulties that are involved in the registration of political parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There are two reasons for the legislation. First, there is a growing body of evidence that people seek to confuse the electorate by using misleading descriptions--the hon. Gentleman was a victim of that. In the most recent local government election in my constituency, candidates variously described themselves as Old Labour, Real Labour and plain Labour. I do not think that the electorate had any difficulty in that instance, but difficulty and confusion has been caused on other occasions. Secondly, the advent of the new regional list system for the election of Members of the European Parliament necessitates a registration process.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, for reasons that arise from his own experience, raises concerns that have already been addressed. When the system is established the registrar will take account of the history of the parties that are registered and of the ways in which people might try to circumvent that by using misleading descriptions. In cases in which they are clearly doing so, we will find that the system is as good as any, given the difficulties that are involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 2, line 9, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) In considering whether an application under section 2 should be granted, the registrar shall have particular regard to the inclusion in any proposed registered name of any word or phrase which has historically or traditionally been associated with a registered political party.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: Government amendment No. 31.
<P>
No. 29, in page 2, line 12, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) The registrar shall not refuse an application by a party under section 2 by reference to subsection (1)(a) above solely on the grounds that the party's proposed registered name contains one or more of the following words (or derivatives of them), namely--

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> The amendments logically follow the earlier contribution by the hon. Member for Ryedale. The Minister referred to us as anoraks. I am not concerned about that, but about people who will use every possible device and scheme to try to circumvent the system so as to mislead the electorate. The Bill as it stands is better than nothing, but can it be improved?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reflect on the points that have been made, which I shall now take further. My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay was described as a victim. He was not the victim--the victims were the people of Devon who were deceived into voting for a candidate for whom they did not wish to vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman means not that he was a victim but that he had a lucky escape.

<P>

<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I could not possibly comment on that.
<P>
The object of the Bill is to try to prevent the electorate from being deceived, and that is the principle that underlies amendments Nos. 38 and 42. The key phrase in those amendments refers to the historic and traditional associations of the party to be registered. Loopholes have already been identified by the hon. Member for Ryedale. The Committee should ensure that those loopholes are closed. The provisions concerning the registrar and the returning officer, who are linked, should be framed as tightly as possible to ensure that schemers and deceivers have less room for manoeuvre when they submit nomination papers.
<P>
If the Committee were considering the matter in isolation, more problems might be perceived than actually exist. Fortunately, the logos that will go with the registered parties names will, we hope, resolve our worst fears.
<P>
The Committee will consider logos later. However, some people may come up with alternative but similar logos, in the same way in which similar names are invented. That argument was made in another debate. I urge the Minister to take on board the sincerity of amendments Nos. 38 and 42 and the thinking behind them, and to include them in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It might be for the Committee's convenience for me to express my views now on amendment No. 29.
<P>
I may have missed something, but it seems that the clause is the only one that gives guidance to the registrar about what he should accept or reject, although schedule 1 deals with one or two relevant points.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 seeks to probe, but it is also slightly more serious, as the Opposition want the guidance to be strengthened. Exclusivity is one aspect of that, and the Committee has, in a sense, already touched on it.
<P>
A difference of view has emerged between the Government and other parties. I spoke in support of the Liberal Democrat position, while the Minister contradicted it. There is a valid prospect that people who register--or do not register, which is the greater danger--will use the word Liberal and argue that there is a long-standing precedent. They could argue that such a precedent comes from the several elections since the Liberal Democratic party emerged from the old SDP-Liberal alliance, in which candidates stood as Liberals. A considerable number of candidates will stand as Liberals in local elections. The registrar should not be left with that headache; the Committee should try to solve the problem for him.
<P>
One way in which we could do that is to specify words that parties cannot claim to be exclusively their own, and not just allow more than one name to be registered. Amendment No. 29 makes some suggestions, although I do not claim that the list is exhaustive. Another way in which the matter could be dealt with, which could be considered on Report, would be for the Bill to require guidance by regulation to be given to the registrar. It must stand to reason that no one party could claim the sole use of words such as national, Britain, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, democratic, independent or new because its title includes one of them. If the Labour party were to decide that they wished to register as the New Labour party, ``New'' might have to be exclusive, although it might not remove the possibility of a New Liberal Democrat party in future--who can say?
<P>
The guidance to the registrar in clause 3 is not comprehensive enough. Subsection (a) covers a registered name that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be likely to result in the party's being confused by voters with a party which is already registered''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not best English grammar that I have seen in a Bill. I contemplated tabling an amendment to alter it, but perhaps the Government will revisit it themselves. The registrar needs more guidance than that. Other guidance in clause 3 provides that the registrar can refuse a registered name if it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``includes any word or expression prohibited by order made by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is meant by that, and what other words has the Minister in mind? It may be simply a cautionary addition, should situations arise that were not covered by one of the other provisions.
<P>
Paragraph (f) says the opposite of what we are trying to say. It concentrates on words that are not permitted at all. We want to know whether certain words should be exclusive. One approach would be to give the registrar some guidance on words that should not be exclusive. Our amendment is not exhaustive, but the issue is part of the previous debate. The comments by the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) support what we said in the previous short debate. The combination of his amendment and ours might need to be thought through, but the two amendments would improve the Bill and make it easier for the registrar to deal with registrations.
<P>
Problems will not arise when the Bill becomes law and those parties that have one or more members elected to the House immediately register in the first round. Problems will arise in future, when the disaffected go off and try to register under another name with a view to standing in elections and scuppering the chances of an individual whom they have decided is no longer the flavour of the month. That happens in political parties and it is the nature of voluntary organisations. People take their bat home and act against the interests of the majority. We want to know whether the Minister thinks that the registrar should have more guidance than the Bill provides.
<P>
Mr. Howarth
<P>
: Amendment No. 31 clarifies clause 3(2), which provides for exceptions from the order-making powers under clause 3(1)(f) prohibiting any words that would be unsuitable for the name of a registered party, such as ``royal'' or ``princess''. Those powers also enable generic terms such as ``independent'' or ``residents association'' to be prohibited on the grounds that it would be unfair for one party to register a generic term and thus prevent others from describing themselves as independent, for example, on the ballot paper.
<P>
The exception under clause 3(2) will allow prohibited words or expressions to be used in certain circumstances, for example, by allowing the prohibited word if it is qualified by a geographical description. The result would be that if the word independent were prohibited, the registrar would be able to allow a party to register its name as the Independent Isle of Wight party; if Royal and residents association were both prohibited, the exception would enable a local party to register as the ``Royal Berkshire Residents Association party''. The amendment would not alter the purpose of the proposal, but it would give better effect to clause 3(2). It is a drafting amendment to improve the wording of that subsection by substituting the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where it is qualified by some other word or expression prescribed, or of a kind prescribed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the much more straightforward phrase ``in specified circumstances''. I trust that the Committee will accept that it is merely a drafting amendment which would improve the Bill's clarity.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rydedale spoke to amendment No. 29, which is unnecessary. It would prevent the refusal of a name solely on the grounds that it contained the words listed, but it would not require the registrar to accept a name because it contained, for example, the word ``new'', a point to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
There will be no difficulty in using the other words listed in the amendment as part of a registered name unless the name so produced would be confused with that of a party already on the register. I hope that no one would quarrel with the New Bypass for Eatwell party or with the Democratic British Youth party, although they contain elements of names commonly used elsewhere.
<P>
	Assuming that my party and the opposition parties take advantage of the eligibility to register in the first transitional stage in clause 16, the registrar would not be likely to grant a subsequent application to register New Labour, Democratic Liberal or Conservative Party of Britain, for example.
<P>
	The amendment is unnecessary; it would cast doubt on the proper operation of the registration scheme. It would imply that once the party had used a particular word in its name, no other party could do so and that would be wrong. The list does not include Unionist, which we discussed earlier and is certain to appear in the names of several parties. If accepted, the amendment might cast doubt on the legitimacy of any word being used if it is already used by another party. On that basis, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
	I shall try to respond to the specific point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale. The Committee may wish to know that it is the Home Secretary's intention to use the order-making power in clause 3(1)(f) as modified by clause 3(2) to protect the word ``Independent''. It will not be possible for the registered name of a party to include that word unless it is qualified by some other word or description other than the name of a registered political party. That will leave individual candidates in certain constituencies free to use the term Independent or Independent Labour, which is as it should be, as the hon. Gentleman would agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Amendments Nos. 38 and 42, tabled by the Liberal Democrat Members are also unnecessary, as the matter is covered in clause 18(1)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin (West Dorset):</B> Does the Minister mean that a bona fide independent standing in his own stead in a parliamentary election will not have access to broadcasting because he will not be registered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is the case if he is not registered. That is the position that the register will create.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister consider the matter further? Does he really intend that a bona fide independent should not have access to local media during a parliamentary election? Would not that be an injustice?

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was referring to party political broadcasts. Different rules apply to the local coverage of elections. Under broadcasting rules, a party needs to stand in at least 50 constituencies to get party political broadcasts. Coverage of a local constituency election would, however, be a different matter.
<P>
To return to amendment No. 38, there is already provision to register the same or similar names under the first or second transitional stages of registration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Does the Minister agree that amendment No. 29, which was moved by the hon. Member for Ryedale, might make the situation worse for the parties that he mentioned, which are not represented in the Committee? The list of names in the amendment would enable another party to register as the Scottish National party--both words are in the list--or as Plaid Cymru, which means Wales party. The amendment would make it difficult for the registrar to refuse such an application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and the hon. Member for Ryedale are having that debate; for the moment, I am content to reply to the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The provision in the Bill will allow existing parties with similar names for which there is a clear historical precedent to register their existing names during the first or second transitional stage. Our intention is that that will provide for the Liberal party to register as well as the Liberal Democratic party. For that matter, it will allow arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour party to register in addition to the Labour party. I am not trying to imply that there is the same relationship between the Liberal Democratic party and the Liberal party as there is between the Labour party and the Socialist Labour party; I merely use those examples to illustrate the point.
<P>
Any established political party will be able to register during the first or second transitional stage. Once the transitional stages are over, it will be open to any party that has not registered to do so, together with any newly formed parties. Any new party's name will, however, be handled on a first-come-first-served basis.
<P>
The provision in clause 3(1)(a) is already wide enough to deal with an application for new registration. It allows the registrar to refuse an application to register a party's name if it is likely to result in the party being confused by voters with a party that is already registered. That will be for the registrar to decide when an application is made. I would expect him to refuse to register a party that called itself the Tory party because voters would be likely to confuse it with the Conservative party. The term Tory is commonly associated with the Conservative party. If someone tried to register a party as the Paddy Ashdown party, I would equally expect the registrar to refuse the application because voters would be likely to confuse it with the Liberal Democrat party. It might be a different matter if Paddy Ashdown himself tried to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I agree with what the Minister has just said, but I do not think that he has grasped the point that we made. People will not register the Paddy Ashdown party; they will seek to be nominated as candidates of the Paddy Ashdown party. In that case, the returning officer, not the registrar, is left with the problem of deciding whether to accept the nomination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> With respect, it is not I who have failed to grasp what we are seeking to achieve, but the hon. Gentleman. In the current circumstances, in which people use misleading descriptions, returning officers are in some difficulty. Little help is available to them in deciding what to do because there is no legislation. That leaves them in the position of having to make decisions. Usually--this is my experience and, I am sure, that of all members of the Committee--they are cautious. There is no clear steer in legislation and returning officers tend, within reason, to let anything go on the grounds that that is the best way to exercise their democratic mandate. Through the Bill, Parliament is saying that there have to be limits. Judgments must be made to protect the integrity of political parties.
<P>
The difficulty for the Liberal Democrats is not for the Government or the registrar to sort out. It is that another party exists to which most of its members originally belonged. The Liberal Democratic party evolved from the Liberal party, after a complicated bit of history involving the Social Democratic and Labour party. I do not want to go through that history, but it is not for Parliament to sort out a difficulty that will remain a potential problem for the Liberal Democrats. The fact is that the Liberal party exists and I imagine that it will choose to register at some stage.
<P>
There is nothing to be done about that, but the important issue is that the Bill would prevent the party that calls itself Liberal going on to mislead. That will help returning officers, but we do not want to prevent an existing party from continuing to exist and putting forward candidates. It would not be right for us to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I still have a vigorous if small Liberal party in my constituency. It puts up an occasional candidate in local elections, and did so in the general election. The Liberal Democrats do the same. That has been the practice since 1986, when the merger with the SDP took place, and those who chose to carried on the tradition of the old Liberal party.
<P>
Given that the word Liberal is common to both parties, will the Minister specify what the members of the Liberal party would have to do that they have not done so far that would give rise to the possibility of being thought misleading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am loth to speculate about that, save to say that that possibility might arise if Liberal party members tried to describe their party in such a way as to confuse its identity with that of the Liberal Democratic party in voters' minds. Ultimately, that has to be the test that is applied. It is one thing for Liberal party members honestly and openly to describe themselves as belonging to the Liberal party, which already exists and whose programme differs from that of the Liberal Democrats, and another to describe themselves in such a way as to mislead voters into believing that they might be Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Is the Minister saying that the problem is one of size? The Liberal party predates the Liberal Democratic party, as we know. At present, the Liberal Democratic party locally is bigger than the Liberal party, but that might change. Should not the onus be on the Liberal Democrats to ensure that they do nothing to cause voters to confuse them with the Liberals, who predate them?
<P>
I do not want to cause you, Mr. Gale, to lose patience, but one might wonder whether the Liberals should revert to being the Whigs. Such historical matters are of great interest to all hon. Members, but does it really matter who predates whom in this context?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The registrar has to take account of the history of the two parties involved. It may be difficult to prove which predates the other and which is the natural inheritor of the tradition. I said to the hon. Member for Colchester that my understanding is that it is probable that there is a direct lineage, albeit through various highways and byways, between his party and the party of Gladstone. However, other people might interpret history differently and I do not want to be too prescriptive. The ultimate test is whether an election candidate of a person seeking to register does so--mischievously or innocently--in such a way as to cause confusion among the electorate.
<P>
I know that Opposition members are concerned about the use of logos, and we shall discuss those concerns later in the Committee's proceedings. It is open to all parties to use party logos, and I urge them to do so. All parties have a logo that clearly identifies them, and they will be able to register it. That is advantageous, because it will help to clarify on the ballot paper the difference between, for instance, a Liberal Democrat and a member of the Liberal party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> It is perfectly obvious from the way in which Members of Parliament describe Liberal Democrats on the Floor of the House that 95 per cent. of the party's opponents in the House confuse the Liberal Democrats with another party that is not represented in the Room. That makes it clear to me who the successors of the Liberal party are. The Bill is going down the wrong track in relation to the argument about confusion between a Tory and a Conservative or between a Liberal and a Liberal Democrat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am afraid that I cannot accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The Minister does not want to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It is not that I do not want to; it is not the Government's role effectively to seek to outlaw a party that happens to call itself the Liberal party. It may suit the hon. Gentleman's purposes for us to do that, but it would not be proper. The Liberal party does not have a base in the House of Commons, although it is represented in some areas of local government. I hold no brief for the Liberals: I am not entirely sure what they stand for on many issues. However, it is not a function of the Bill to seek to outlaw them. They have some claim on the term Liberal, because it forms part of the names of their party. That creates difficulties, but not to the extent that has been suggested by the hon. Member for Torbay.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) has Liberal party councillors in her constituency. She will confirm, by her silent affirmation, that they have a rather distinctive approach to politics--in fact, everybody in Liverpool has a distinctive approach to politics. Most of Liverpool's electorate are clearly aware of the distinction between the Liberals and the Liberal Democrats and the fact that they stand for entirely different things. The good voters of Liverpool seem to be far better at sorting that out than I could ever be.
<P>
The registrar and the returning officers will have sufficient powers to resolve the issues that the hon. Member for Torbay has raised in amendments Nos. 38 and 42. I do not pretend that every possible circumstance can be covered, but it would not be right to use the Bill to try and choke off legitimate parties from standing with a name that may potentially cause a small degree of confusion. The Liberals have not deliberately established themselves under a misleading name. They see themselves as a separate strand of liberalism, and it is legitimate for them to continue on that basis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I was sorely tempted to intervene several times as my party's name was taken in vain, but I deliberately did not do so because I wanted a full debate to take place. Government and Opposition Members have made the case perfectly if they genuinely feel that there is no confusion between Liberals and Liberal Democrats. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay has demonstrated that Liberal Democrats are frequently not given their full title in Parliament and are referred to as Liberals. My debut in Hansard was not my maiden speech but the words ``Liberal Democrats'', which I used to correct the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who referred to the Liberals several times in an Adjournment debate early in the new Parliament. He kept referring to Liberals and I kept saying Liberal Democrats. Eventually the hon. Gentleman responded to my intervention and the words ``Liberal Democrats'' thus appeared next to my name, and became my maiden speech.
<P>
If Members of Parliament, by design or innocence--let us assume that it is not deliberate--are confused and the Liberal Democrats are the anoraks, as the Minister suggested, it is a fair bet that a good number of folk outside Parliament are also confused. My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay pointed out that while we all know of the infamous Literal Democrat who caused a different result to be declared for the Devon Euro seat and who polled circa 10,000 votes, a Liberal candidate also stood, and achieved 14,000 votes, while the Liberal Democrat achieved 73,000. There may be suspicion that some of those Literal Democrat and Liberal supporters would have voted for the Liberal Democrat candidate, had they not been confused.
<P>
The purpose of our proposals is to give more guidance and support to the registrar and to the returning officer, and attempt to plug the loopholes that are already being flagged up. If they are flagged up in Committee, hon. Members can rest assured that people whose sole purpose in life appears to be to use the system to confuse and deceive will find ways through them.
<P>
We are trying to improve the Bill. I am disappointed that the Minister will not take on board the spirit of what is being said. I shall not press the amendment to a vote, but I hope that he and Labour Members will take on board the sincerity of our argument. We are trying to improve a good Bill--we are saying not that it is bad, but that it could be improved immeasurably if only the Minister would take into account our serious points.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 31, in page 2, line 11, leave out from `prohibition' to end of line 12 and insert `in specified circumstances'.--[Mr. George Howarth.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 12, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) On receipt of an application under section 2 the registrar shall cause details of it to be published as a notice in such national newspapers as appear to him to be appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (4) A notice under subsection (3) shall state that objections to the application may be submitted to the registrar within 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice appears.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (5) The registrar shall not determine an application until the relevant period of 28 days specified in a notice under subsection (3) has expired.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment suggests a period for advertising before the decision is made. My question is, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I think that I understand the concerns behind the amendment, although the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) chose not to articulate them. It would, however, add only unnecessary bureaucracy to the registration process. In addition, the setting aside of an additional 28 days while the registrar awaits any objections to the application would increase the time taken to register a political party.
<P>
I do not believe that the registrar would miss an application to register a specific party name that might be confused with the name of an existing registered party. Clause 18(1)(b) already provides a second transitional stage as a means of allowing competing claims to party names to be determined. In any event, if there is doubt about an application, the registrar can refer it to the Speaker's Committee established under clause 10 for advice.
<P>
In determining an application for registration, the registrar will need to consider whether the proposed name is likely to result in voters confusing the party with one that is already registered. He will also consider whether it is likely to result in voters confusing the party in the first or second transitional phases with another party that has submitted a first or second stage application that he intends to grant. It would not help the registrar in taking a decision to be required to invite objections; it would simply cause a delay.
<P>
There is no need for the amendment to draw attention to a bogus application for registration. anyone who makes a false statement to the registrar, for example, pretending to be the leader of a particular party, would be guilty of an offence under clause 19, and any registration made by the registrar on the basis of a false application would be treated as a nullity.
<P>
There will be much interest in which political parties apply for registration, but it must be for the registrar to decide whether an application is granted. If a political party believed that the registrar had taken an unreasonable decision in registering another party, the registrar's action could be challenged in the courts by seeking a judicial review, although that would not be most common course of action. The matter would probably be resolved before it needed to go to court. I do not accept that it would help the registrar exercise his judgement by inviting objections to every application and being required to wait a further 28 days. With those assurances and my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister merely touched on the matter that concerns us at the end of his contribution. It seems evident that if there is no period for advertisement and the registrar consequently cannot consider a legitimate complaint because he is not aware of it, the scope for judicial review on the grounds of an unreasonable decision increases. I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will consider whether he intends to create circumstances that maximise the chances of a much greater delay, through judicial review, than would have been instituted by the more open process which this or another amendment might have provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset for agreeing to seek leave to withdraw the amendment. I believe that the system as drafted provides sufficient checks and balances to allay the hon. Gentleman's anxieties before a case goes to judicial review, except in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
When there is scope for confusion, the ability to refer the matter to a Speaker's Committee exists and that would be the most likely way to resolve any difficulty. The scope for complaint exists anyway; it is automatic. If the registrar thought that there was room for doubt, there is a mechanism, through the Speaker's Committee, to resolve the matter. I think it more likely than not that that is the route that he would take to resolve any difficulties. The process will work because it is sensible and because parties can be assured that proper safeguards exist.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 28, in schedule 1, page 8, line 37, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `6A. A person named in an application as a party's registered leader, nominating officer or other specified officer must not be a person who holds any of those offices, or their equivalent, in any registered party.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I did not detain the Committee in the previous amendment because, alas, I shall be lengthy, although I hope not prolix, in speaking to this amendment.
<P>
We move up a gear at this stage because amendment No. 26 and others in the group take us to the heart of a constitutional issue that will plague this country for the next few decades if the matter is not tackled. The amendments are not the only way of addressing the issue but they are a highly suitable means of tackling it. It is of the utmost importance that the problem is solved rapidly, rather than with sufficient delay for it to create terrible problems.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister acknowledged the scope for a serious problem with an additional member system in the case of an alter ego party. He reminded the House that the Under-Secretary of State, the noble Lord Williams of Mostyn gave an assurance that the Labour party would not engage in alter ego party creation. The importance of that is clear.
<P>
[Mr. Nigel Waterson in the Chair]In an additional member election, if a particular party secured a large proportion of the popular vote in the first-past-the-post section it may obtain a proportionately large part--or theoretically, even a disproportionately large part--of the representation in the relevant body, be it the Scottish Parliament or, if such a system were adopted here, in the House of Commons. But it might also try to exploit the additional member arrangements by forming an alter ego party which attracted a significant following in the list arrangement and, by means of that ruse, thereby added to its already significant presence in the Scottish Parliament or the House of Commons or elsewhere a further tranche of representation.
<P>
We are, of course, entirely willing to credit the statement by Lord Williams of Mostyn that the Labour party does not intend to engage in that ploy, but perhaps I may quote my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler), the shadow Home Secretary. He stated, in the same debate:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The question is, what can be done to prevent such a situation from arising. I am aware of the assurance given by a Minister in another place, but the question is not simply what is the Government's intention or even what is the Labour party's intention. We are making law.''--[Official Report, 4 June 1998; Vol. 313, c. 526.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]We are not discussing whether the political parties that are currently represented in this Committee, in the House or in the country as a whole intend to make use of this loophole. We are debating whether the law can be said to be proper and whether the whole constitutional arrangement being introduced by the Government in many parts of the kingdom can be said to be a proper constitutional arrangement when its entire import can be defeated by a ruse.
<P>
It is worth detaining the Committee to consider this issue because it takes us to the heart of the use and abuse of the alternative member arrangement. It also goes to the heart of what it is to be a policitcal party and what makes a party the same political party or a different one.
<P>
Under any form of proportional representation, particularly the alternative member arrangement, parties entering an election may have perfectly bona fide intentions to make common cause and coalesce into a Government after the election. It is, for example, perfectly imaginable that the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party might genuinely enter into a pre-election pact--either public or private--with the intention of emerging from the election each with a sufficient number of representatives together to form a Government. Clearly, it is no part of the Bill's purpose to prevent such an arrangement. Some of us have grave reservations about systems that allow for such possibilities and encourage such forms of government, but we entirely acknowledge that it is no part of the proper purpose of the Bill to prevent such genuine arrangements.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> How would the hon. Gentleman define the pact--private, public or otherwise--which existed between the Conservatives with their small majority and the Unionists before the previous general election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is another good example of an arrangement that others might find controversial but which it is not the purpose--nor would it be a proper purpose--of the Bill to prevent. It should not stop parties with different traditions, such as the Liberal Democrats and Labour or the Conservatives and the official Unionists, deciding before, during or after an election to combine to form a Government under certain circumstances.
<P>
The problem is that the distincition between two bona fide parties making such a pact, implicit or explicit, overt or covert, before or during an election, and a party forming an alter ego party--with which it must have a pact, as that second party is an expression of itself--is an extraordinarily difficult distinction for the electorate to make.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall offer one possible example. Let us imagine that the Labour party enters an election under the alternative member arrangements. Guided by the opinion polls, it expects to do well in the first-past-the-post section of the election. It does not think that it can form a suitable pact to form a Government with another bona fide party with a separate tradition. It believes that on its own it will not achieve more than 50 per cent. representation on the first-past-the-post basis.
<P>
Under those circumstances, the incentive to create an alter ego party would be much greater than we have discussed so far. It would not be a matter or winning a seat but of forming the Government, either in a devolved Parliament or for the country as a whole. The incentive to take legitimate and lawful action to form the Government when otherwise that would not be possible clearly would be very great.
<P>
In such circumstances, we cannot rely on the assurance that the Minister has given us on other questions. He has said that he hopes that the electoral registration officer and the returning officers will be sensible, but hope would not be sufficient in the scenario that I have described. At stake would be the fundamental ability of the constitution to deliver a Government that the people of the country want, according to the existing electoral arrangements. We must be clear that the great incentive to create an alter ego party will not influence the party in question, or any other, to desert the fine statements of intent given by Lord Williams of Mostyn.
<P>
What might such an alter ego party look like? Perhaps, in the example that I offered, it might be called the co-operative party. Such a party might have a link with Labour traditions. Its membership and leadership may be different from that of the Labour party, but its origins and presentation mean that it would be certain to do the Labour party's bidding after the election. The distinction between that and the well established pact between the Labour party and the Liberal Democratic party--or that between the Conservative party and the official Unionists--would be difficult to make. It would be very hard to determine whether the alter ego party were merely a ruse.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would give the registrar the opportunity to spend time to work out whether an alter ego party were being created. As I have described, that judgment would be a fine one, and difficult, but the registrar would be in a good position to make it, as he would have a good deal of information about the relevant parties.
<P>
I fear that the Minister will say that the amendment, and the consequential amendments, is inoperable because the registrar will not be able to make such a judgment. However, he should hesitate before he pursues that argument. If he is right, he is arguing that the assertions made by Conservative Members in the debates on devolution legislation--that the eventuality that I have set out could arise and may be exploited--have great force. If the Minister believes that the officer being established by the Bill, who will have the greatest possible opportunity to determine whether an alter ego party is being set up, is not capable of making that distinction, how can the great mass of the public, who are not in possession of similar information, be expected to do so? I hope that the Minister does not argue that the registrar will not be capable of making a distinction. If he does, he will undercut the case that his colleagues have made for introducing important constitutional changes in the electoral arrangements for at least the devolved Parliaments and possibly the Westminster Parliament.
<P>
If the Minister does not fall back on that argument, I am at a loss to imagine what argument he can use, although it is always dangerous to underestimate his eloquence and the vast army of brilliant officials behind him. If the amendment is operable--or, at least, could be if it were rephrased--and the registrar can make a distinction, I am at a loss to understand why it would not be beneficial to enable him to do so. It is clearly--I refer again to Lord Williams of Mostyn--not the Government's intention for alter ego parties to arise. If that is not their intention and if an operable amendment would prevent such parties from arising, it would be difficult to understand the logic of an argument that suggested that the amendment should not be accepted.
<P>
I am therefore thrown back to the final leg of the Minister's tracing of the logic. He may feel that the drafting of the amendments is imperfect. Unlike myself, my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale is a skilled parliamentarian and much better able to draft amendments. Even he would accept, however, that we may have made some mistakes in drafting the amendments. We hold no brief for the particular words in them, but the principles that underlie them are fundamental. I hope that the Minister recognises that we shall be entirely content for him to reject the amendments if he explains how the Government propose to achieve a similar effect elsewhere in the Bill or by rephrasing the amendments. If he rejects the logic altogether, we shall take every step that is available to us in parliamentary terms to raise the issue before the public because it constitutes the greatest detriment to a system that the Government have introduced for massively important elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Member for West Dorset has got his teeth into what he calls alter ego parties, although they may be better known as sham parties. The problem is probably imaginery and has so far existed only in the mind of a lecturer at Aberdeen university by the name of Michael Dyer, who has written a persuasive article in the journal Representation. In it, he discusses what could happen in a Scottish election that was held under the additional member system and how it would be in the Labour party's interests--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> May I ask whether the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) is associated with those comments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The problem has not existed in any country that operates the additional member system. Germany has operated it since the war and has never had the problem; New Zealand operated a similar system in its most recent election and did not come across the problem. I am not saying that nobody but Mr. Dyer imagines that the problem could arise, but that so far it has arisen only in theory in an article. The article suggested that it would be in the Labour party's interests in the particular circumstances of a Scottish parliamentary election to set up a sham party to manipulate the system in its favour.
<P>
If the problem did arise, there would be far better ways of dealing with it than the amendments. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said, they are not the only way in which the problem could be addressed. I can suggest at least three better ways in which it could be tackled or pre-empted. One would be to introduce a constituency threshold into the additional member system that will operate in the Scottish parliamentary elections. I am a little perplexed as to why a threshold has not been introduced because I thought that that was the intention. In that way, a party could qualify for additional seats only if it has already won a constituency seat. That proposal has been made many times in connection with an additional member system for parliamentary elections. Most people consider it vital to prevent the proliferation of small parties, not at present represented in Parliament, that could result from the move to an additional member system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I thoroughly echo the hon. Gentleman's preference for that arrangement, which was defeated by the Government. However, a party that has been successful in the first-past-the-post part of an election will have many constituency members. So a threshold will not prevent it from adding further grist to its mill by means of an alter ego party in the list section.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Yes, of course; the party that had won the constituency seats would have no problem, but presumably the alter ego party would not have won any such seats, so it would not qualify to receive additional seats.
<P>
Another option is to adopt the German system of a percentage threshold, in which no party qualifies for additional seats unless it reaches a 5 per cent. threshold. The same system is used in New Zealand, although I am not sure what the threshold there is.
<P>
A third option would be to have a single rather than a double vote. That would prevent people from splitting votes. In his article, Mr. Dyer states that it is a problem of two-vote additional member systems and that it disappears in one-vote systems. Early experience in the Scottish Parliament may convince the House that that rule should be introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I admit that the hon. Gentleman's logic was correct in relation to the earlier point, and mine was flawed. The three mechanisms that he has described were among those debated and already rejected. To call them possibilities flies in the face of the Government's preferences.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Electoral systems are a bit like taxation: all sorts of possibilities exist for people to find ways around whatever system is proposed. It is impractical to expect a legislature to cater for every possible attempt to evade or manipulate a system. In countries that have introduced new systems, it is normal to see how the system beds down and how parties and voters react to it and then, if necessary, to amend it. No voting system can be set in concrete for ever. The problem addressed by the amendment is probably completely imaginary, but any Government must be prepared to revise systems in the light of experience.
<P>
I want to emphasise how unusual are the circumstances described in the article that has given rise to the fear about sham parties. In Scotland, during the general election, my party won more than three-quarters of the seats with less than half the vote. That shows that, in an additional member system, with just over half the seats decided by a normal first-past-the-post system, one party can come close to having an overall majority even before the additional seats are allocated.
<P>
In those very unusual circumstances, there would be a temptation for that party to try to defeat the intention of a proportional system by pretending to be one party in the constituency section of the election and another in the additional member section. However, that is unlikely to occur at a UK level. It can occur only when one party is extremely predominant. There would be no incentive in Germany or New Zealand for a party to give in to the temptation that I described because it would not benefit from it in the way that the Labour party theoretically would have done in a Scottish parliamentary election if the result were exactly the same as that of the 1997 general election.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My final point is that while it is perfectly understandable that one should wish to prevent that unlikely event from occurring, the amendments come ill from a party that is committed to a system which creates enormous distortion. The amendments seek to prevent what already happens in all first-past-the-post elections--the possibility that one party may be grossly over-represented. The point of a proportional system is that only half the seats are elected by a first-past-the-post system. The disproportionality is thereby kept within limits and is compensated for in the other half of the ballot by the introduction of an element of overall proportionality. The hon. Member for West Dorset advocates for elections in the United Kingdom--and not doubt for elections in Scotland--the very system that creates the distortion. It is therefore strange for him to argue against it. He says that he has grave reservations about the additional member system. However, that system would prevent the enormously exaggerated effects that are created by the current system.
<P>
It is very unlikely that any party would succeed in persuading its own voters, or the registrar, to allow the degree of confusion that would arise from the existence of the type of sham party to which the hon. Member for West Dorset referred. The party would not receive the level of support that would be necessary to give it the benefits that it desired.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall try to answer some of the hon. Gentleman's points. He was right to draw the Committee's attention to the current situation in Scotland. Alas, as Labour Members will be all too painfully aware, circumstances have altered somewhat since the issues were first aired in relation to the devolution Bills. The present evidence suggests that the Scottish National party may be the winner of the largest share of the popular vote, and may win a large number of the first-past-the-post elections. I do not welcome that. Although I am distressed by the prospect of a Labour First Minister in Scotland, I am much more distressed by the prospect of a First Minister from the Scottish National party.
<P>
Circumstances could arise in which a National Party of Scotland were placed on the additional member list. I would not be surprised if the highly organised, extremely passionate and principled members of the Scottish National party believed it to be in the long-term interests of their country to rig the last election under a devolved arrangement so as to ensure that their party had a sufficient grip on the Scottish Parliament to be able to hold a referendum and move entirely outside the orbit of the United Kingdom. I am not claiming that they intend to do that, but it is by no means impossible. If I were in their position and held their profound convictions about independence, I might be tempted to do that. Even if one did not intend to abuse the system thereafter, it represents a one-off possibility of achieving the goal of hundreds of years. A National Party of Scotland might find a great deal of support among people who wished to support the Scottish National party, if those people were instructed to the effect that by voting for both parties they could maximise the chances of achieving their desired result.
<P>
Under those circumstances, the additional member system would not, as the hon. Member for Battersea has suggested, merely replicate what he regards as the disadvantages of the first-past-the-post system. First, arithmetically speaking, those disadvantages, as he sees them, would be intensified--the system would paradoxically become less proportional than first past the post. That depends on specific arithmetic, and I can show him cases in which it would obtain. Secondly, the Government's purpose--as I understand it--in introducing proportional representation for the Scottish Parliament would be thwarted. Part of that purpose was to avoid the possibility of the election being hijacked by people who did not form an overwhelming majority of the populace voting for the Scottish National party precisely in order to take Scotland out of the orbit of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I am speaking about a real live case. I grant that it may be exceptional, but it is of great importance to the evolution of the entire kingdom. There is a plausible reason for supposing that the abuse in question might occur. As the hon. Member for Battersea justly suggested, the Government have eschewed all the remedies that might have been used. We are left only with the remedy now being considered.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Battersea mentioned the possibility that the registrar would not allow the registration of a sham party because he would regard it as confusing. Having listened to the Minister, there is no question in my mind. The registrar would not be in a position to argue that the National Party of Scotland was in any way confusable with the Scottish National party--that is a naked fact, and I hope that the Minister will confirm it. For example, they would have different logos. The naming would be an attempt not to confuse the electorate, but to instruct it and to thwart the system.
<P>
Without the amendment, the Bill will not give the registrar a locus for making that judgment, which is all that the Opposition are seeking to do. I think that the hon. Member for Battersea would agree that in the scenario about which I have spoken, however unlikely he believes it to be, we would all want the registrar to have that locus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for West Dorset anticipated, I do not believe that amendments Nos. 26 and 27 would be workable in practice. They would require the registrar, in deciding whether a party is ``substantially the same'' as one already on the register, to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the applicant party's objectives, membership, officers or geographical base''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The registrar will not, however, have access to information on a party's objectives, membership or geographical base. Therefore, he would not be able to make any judgment about those factors, or even know when it might be desirable to seek the advice of the Speaker's Committee. The amendments would place a duty on the registrar that he would not be able to discharge. The hon. Gentleman is not providing the Committee with a solution, but is merely naming the problem. I shall speak about the nature of that problem in a moment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made an interesting point. The burden of his remarks was that he did not think that the problem described by the hon. Gentleman was likely to arise, and that if it did, it would not go unobserved. That was, broadly speaking, what he said.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the Co-operative party and of its relationship with the Labour party, and asked whether it could be taken to be an alter ego. I speak as a member of the Co-operative party of some years standing. It is a separate party, but it has a very clear relationship with the Labour party. For example, some of my hon. Friends stand as Labour and Co-operative party candidates. The party sends delegates to Labour party bodies and is represented at Labour party conferences. But--and this is the important point--the party also represents something very distinctive: the political voice of the co-operative movement, which has a long history stretching back to the times of the Rochdale pioneers and, beyond that, to Robert Owen and co-operative adventures in New Lanark in the early 19th century. What they represent is distinctive. The interesting thing about the Co-operative party is that it respects the tradition but it now has a more modern agenda. There is an extensive housing co-operative movement which prospered under the previous Labour and Conservative Governments and which I hope will prosper under mine. The Co-operative party also represents a growing credit union movement and modern co-operative retail and wholesale sectors. It is a distinctive party but it has a known and clear link with an established political party: the Labour party. Therefore, the problem that the hon. Member for West Dorset describes does not apply. The relationship is out in the open, known historically and well understood.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Minister accept that something would be decisively wrong if, for example in the Scottish elections, the Labour party, with the Co-operative party, were to gain collectively a massively disproportionate number of seats by virtue of an agreement between them that the Co-operative party would not put any candidates in the constituency lists, and the Labour party would not stand in the alternative member lists--the proportional section.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a hypothetical possibility which has already been ruled out, as my noble Friend the Lord Williams of Mostyn made clear. I want to use this opportunity, as the vast ranks of the public and the media are watching our proceedings, to suggest that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Colchester make similar statements on behalf of their parties. I hope that they will assure the Committee that they have no intention of developing a relationship or working with an alter ego party designed to exploit a future electoral system for Westminster or for Wales or Scotland. If the hon. Gentlemen were to give the Committee that assurance it would be helpful in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Every contribution by the Opposition has been designed to prevent what the Minister suggested from happening. I can give him my party's assurance. We are more worried about the Government. Could the Minister explain how, simultaneously, he can say that the Co-operative party is somewhat independent of the Labour party but a part of it, when he well knows that the Co-operative party refuses to allow members of parties other than the Labour party to become members? The Minister said that the Co-operative party represents a wide strand of opinion, and that it funds the Labour party, to a certain extent. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall not invite the Minister to follow that route. I appreciate that we are discussing complex issues but hon. Members must relate their remarks directly to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale. I would not dream of meandering down the path on which the hon. Member for Colchester is trying, somewhat seductively, to lead me. However, I must respond to the anxieties that were expressed by the hon. Member for West Dorset that, in effect, a registered party might seek to register again under a different name with the intention--let us not mince words--of fiddling the result of an election held under the additional member system.
<P>
Lord Jenkins's independent commission is deliberating on alternatives to the first-past-the-post system for Westminster, but no decision has been taken. It will ultimately be for the electorate to determine in a referendum whether they want any change at all. We cannot assume at this stage that an alternative member system--or any other system--will be in use for Westminster. Nevertheless, such systems are already being used in various elections where the possibilities that the hon. Member for West Dorset described could apply.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not share the hon. Gentleman's concern. As I said, my party has no intention of doing what he suggests and I cannot believe that any political party of any standing in this country would be so foolish as to try. If it did, it would seriously insult and underestimate the intelligence of the electorate. I concede one example of it, which is on the record book, but that took place almost by a chicanery of spelling. If, however, any party made systematic attempts, either in Scotland, Wales or throughout the United Kingdom, it would be impossible for the voters not to be made aware of it. There is this country's media, for one thing.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, who enjoyed a long and distinguished career in journalism, latterly with The Guardian, would be the first to support me in this. One could not seriously sustain a hidden John le Carre-style pact of that kind without the media picking up on it. It would be all too obvious. No one with any serious interest in this country's politics could easily be deceived into believing that such an arrangement did not exist when it clearly did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that the Minister is tilting at windmills. In the example that I gave, if the Scottish National party established a National Party of Scotland with the split-ticket intention, it would publicise it widely. Far from deceiving the public or making it covert, it would seek to emphasise that the right vote was the yes, yes vote. The Minister does not defeat our argument in the least by showing that the matter would be public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman's example runs counter to my point, but I do not think that that would help the Scottish National party. It would not achieve a clean sweep in any consitutency in any election. It is not likely to happen in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes. At the end of the day, anyone who was so Machiavellian as to try to enter into that kind of an arrangement would be punished. The British public do not like it. Such a tactic would not be rewarded in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests--far from it.
<P>
There is a different scenario, which I suppose is possible and might be legitimate. Parties that had an affinity but did not share exactly the same programme or policies might benefit because a clear swathe of the electorate thought, ``Well, if not this one, that one,'' but that would not be deceiving anyone. It would be a case of the electorate exercising its choice, not the parties trying to deceive and manipulate the electorate into making a different choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister says that a party behaving in such a way would be punished. That is to believe that the people voting for the SNP do not want to achieve and do not celebrate the achievement of a bizarre one-off effect. On the contrary, people vote for the SNP precisely because they have it in their sights to create the one-off situation of an independent Scotland. Thereafter, they may eschew the policy. Does the Minister agree that that is exactly their motive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> No. I tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman a moment ago, but I am not sure that he picked up the point so I shall repeat it. For the hon. Gentleman's example of the Scottish National party and a National Party for Scotland--or whatever title he chooses--to work, it would be necessary for the Scottish National party to make an almost clean sweep of constituency seats. In that way, the situation that the hon. Gentleman described--in which additional seats are picked up--could be brought into play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The arithmetic does not work that way. The Scottish National party might win enough first-past-the-post elections to give it representation that was roughly proportionate to its share of the popular vote. If it did not stand on the additional member lists but had the National Party of Scotland do that in its stead, it would end up with a disproportionately high share of the representation. That is a wholly plausible scenario; it is exactly the scenario that would emerge if the Scottish National party did what I am describing and got the number of seats that today's opinion polls suggest that it would get. We can hardly describe that as a dream.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> But it is. The hon. Gentleman is speculating about what might happen in certain sets of circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> What the hon. Gentleman describes is different from what I thought he was describing. I will rest on the reasonably safe and convincing argument that we can, to some degree, pursue a course that protects people from those who would try to mislead them--that is the Bill's purpose. It is not necessary or proper to go as far as the hon. Gentleman suggests because the problem will not occur without the media and electorate understanding that they are being manipulated.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset makes an interesting point, but we shall not confront it in practice. I shall read the report of our debate with interest to see whether I have misunderstood anything. Occasionally, the glances that pass between the hon. Gentleman and myself across the Committee lead me to believe that we have not understood each other as thoroughly as we would have liked. For today's purposes, however, I am not able to accept the amendment; it is not necessary and would not achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants. He may have suggested that he is willing to withdraw it. If he does not, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall be brief, because we have detained the Committee on the amendments long enough. I am grateful to the Minister for taking the matter so seriously. He has promised to reflect on the matter, and he and the Home Secretary may conclude that there is a problem. I hope that he will seek discussions with the Secretary of State for Scotland, who stands in severe danger of unwittingly creating an independent Scotland through the present mechanism.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will return in due course, on Report if not in Committee, with amendments that have a similar intent to those that are before us. We would welcome that and, in that spirit, I will withdraw the amendment. However should the Minister not table further amendments or pursue other actions, my hon. Friends and I will pursue the issue with great vigour during the Bill's later stages. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 14, leave out `home'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 4, in clause 6, page 3, line 7, leave out `home'.
<P>
No. 5, schedule 1, page 8, line 21, leave out `home'.
<P>
No. 6, schedule 1, page 8, line 27, leave out `home'.
<P>
No. 7, schedule 1, page 8, line 36, leave out `home'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We cannot understand why the Bill requires applications for the registration of a political party to include the home address of that party's leader. I hope that the Minister has a satisfactory explanation. At which of his several addresses would the Prime Minister choose to register?
<P>
Clause 4 states that the home addresses would not be made public, but that seems to be a safeguard against the consequences of an unneccessary and extraordinary requirement. I hope that the Minister has an explanation that has not occured to us, or that he will agree to rethink the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot accept the amendments. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, they would remove the requirement for a party's leader and nominating officer to supply their home addresses to the registrar. The hon. Gentleman may be surprised to learn that that requirement was put into the Bill to protect the Conservative party. The details are needed to assist in confirming the identity of the officers and to provide an address, other than that of the party headquarters, that the registrar could use if a party were in dispute with its leader or nominating officer--for example, when a split occurs.
<P>
I am worried about the differences in the Conservative party between its leader, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorkshire (Mr. Hague) and the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine). If that split were to worsen and the right hon. Member for Henley were able to wrest control of the Conservative party machine away from the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorkshire, the latter should have the ability to defend himself, and the possession of an address separate from that of Conservative party headquarters would help.
<P>
To be serious; one can imagine that divisions within a national, registered party could make it necessary for there to be communication between the leadership, which has a special role in the system, and the party's functionaries. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, clause 4 preserves the privacy of the party leader, the nominating officer and their families. It is not, as the hon. Gentleman said, merely an attempt to protect their privacy: the clause ensures that the home addresses will not be included in the register, which will be publicly available.

Dispute between leadership and bureaucracy can arise in any political party and could lead to a split. In such circumstances the registrar might have to deal with two different groups. That is not likely, but it may happen and good legislation should cover any eventuality. I give the hon. Gentleman the absolute assurance that the addresses of leading officials, or party leaders, will not be publicised. We understand why that would not be sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has failed miserably to explain why it is necessary to state the home addresses. I am grateful for his assurance that they will not be made public and I ask him to reflect on the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 2, line 27, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) The registrar may grant a request from a party to register different emblems in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider the following amendments: No. 9, in clause 6, page 2, line 32, leave out from beginning to `or'.
<P>
No. 11, in clause 18, page 5, leave out lines 36 to 41.
<P>
No. 12, in schedule 1, page 8, line 33, leave out `and emblems'.
<P>
No. 13, in schedule 2, page 9, line 34, leave out from beginning to end of page 10.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 34 to 37, and that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> The amendments propose that parties should be allowed, if they wish, to register different party emblems in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. There are emblems on the proposed ballot paper and it is possible that some United Kingdom parties may wish to stress different emblems in different parts of the kingdom.
<P>
I ask the Minister to consider the parties' previous emblems and logos. We referred earlier to our historical roots; all political parties have had different logos and emblems in their time. In addition to parties being allowed to choose different emblems in different parts of the kingdom, I ask the Minister to consider whether account should be taken of political parties' previous logos and emblems. I stress, for example, that the assets of the former Liberal party and the former Social Democratic party were transferred to the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats party is the successor to both parties, in their entirety, which includes the logos, emblems, typography and so on. It is not only today's emblems and logos that need safeguarding, but earlier ones, which are part of the complete story of the political parties. The Liberal Democrats are the sole successors to the Liberal party and the Social Democratic party.
<P>
Mr. Greenway
<P>
: I shall speak to our amendments. One of the few attractions of opposition is that one can speak on behalf of the party but also present what will be seen as an extremely personal view.
<P>
I am opposed to emblems. In this respect, the Bill is ghastly. For generations, we have successfully maintained democracy through elections without the need for emblems. The abuses that the Bill attempts to deal with are to do with names, not emblems.
<P>
The proposal to put emblems on ballot papers to persuade voters to vote for particular candidates is indicative of the current infatuation with image at the expense of serious political argument. It is gimmicky and tacky. It debases political parties and patronises the electorate. In a previous debate, the Minister talked about insulting voters' intelligence. That is precisely the phrase that I intended to use at this juncture. The inclusion of emblems will do no good for the cause of serious politics in this country. By all means let us allow the registration of a logo or emblem--that would be beneficial. However, I would prefer them to be kept off ballot papers.
<P>
I cannot see much in the Bill that would seriously restrict opportunities to register any number of emblems. I understand that only one is allowed, but what sort of emblem would be permissable? Could the British National party register a flag--the union flag or the cross of St. George? The Scottish National party already makes much use of the cross of St. Andrew. Is it a good idea? I suspect that it has not been thought through. The idea of emblems as a failsafe mechanism to avoid any prospect of confusion arising from names only fuels the argument that the Bill should do more about names by way of proposals such as those we debated earlier.
<P>
I have made my views abundantly clear. We are not against the registration of emblems. In terms of campaign material and posters, there might be some sense in it. We are, however, opposed to emblems on ballot papers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I want to put completely the opposite view from that of the hon. Member for Ryedale. In my view, clause 5 is the most important part of the Bill. If anything, we could make do with emblems and forget the registration of political parties because most of the problems that have been experienced by the electorate result from confusion on the ballot paper.
<P>
The use of emblems would be of significant help not only for those who come up against candidates with similar titles or descriptions, but for those with poor sight or literacy problems. Studies that were carried out after the recent local elections and reported in the papers showed that people with poor sight and people with literacy problems were among those who did not vote. Emblems would be very useful to them.
<P>
The use of emblems could also remove the need for further legislation, because they can be copyrighted. If there is any claim over the misuse of an emblem, the remedy is already in law--new legislation is not required. I support this part of the Bill, which is important and appropriate. It will help to end confusion and assist people who presently have difficulties with the ballot paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall refer to the amendments that stand in my name later: they are drafting amendments and there is no need for the Committee to be detained at any length.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale has an honest disagreement with us on this matter, and I do not think that we are going to have a meeting of minds. He is clearly something of a traditionalist in this respect.
<P>
There are good and practical grounds for the proposal. First, it is another device that will help to eliminate confusion. Secondly, and of equal importance, people who have difficulties with their sight and are unable to make out printed text may be able to make out the emblem or logo of a party.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay asked whether the British National party, for example, could register the Union Jack and use it as its logo on the ballot paper. The answer is that it could. However, the logo cannot exceed 2 sq. cm., and something as intricate as a complicated flag would be rather blurred in that small space.
<P>
I have some sympathy with amendment No. 39. The Bill will allow parties to use a description that denotes a constituent part of the United Kingdom--for example, Scottish Conservative or Welsh Liberal Democrat--but requires the emblem to be the same throughout the country. I have given some thought to the matter, and I have to say that it is unlikely that a workable amendment could be tabled, either by Liberal Democrat Members or by the Government, that would achieve the desired effect. A party can register its emblem in only one place--that is, Companies House in Cardiff. The Bill does not provide for the name or emblem to be registered anywhere else. If my hon. Members could come up with a fair and workable solution, I should be happy to look at it.

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that observation. We shall go away and put our thinking caps on.
<P>
I should like to give some reassurance to the hon. Member for Ryedale. It will not be compulsory for a candidate to display the emblem of his or her party, and many may conclude that it would be a positive advantage for Conservative candidates not to do so. He will not be forced to have his party's emblem on the ballot paper should he be reselected to fight the next election.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to the point about the historic pedigree of party logos: I hope that he will do so on another occasion. Logos change over time. I believe that the Conservative party may soon adopt a microphone in place of the toppling flame of liberty.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
