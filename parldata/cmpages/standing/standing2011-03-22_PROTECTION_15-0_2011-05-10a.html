                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Streeter and members of the Committee. The Committee has obviously
examined the clause, but I wish to press the Minister on several
matters that are still outstanding. Will she set out clearly why the
Government have decided to make such a change? The hon. Lady said in an
earlier debate that vulnerable adults are currently defined in relation
to their situation. For example, people are described as vulnerable
adults because they are receiving some form of health care, have a
disability or are particularly vulnerable because of their situation.
The clause now defines a vulnerable adult as someone for whom a
regulated activity is provided. I should be grateful if the Minister
would explain why she believes that will be helpful to the vetting and
barring scheme, and why she has decided to take that approachIs she
satisfied that the provisions are adequate? Will vulnerable adults
still receive the level of protection that they received under the
previous
scheme?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
is the Minister’s thinking about the number of people who will
be covered by the clause? We have debated gardeners and cooks, and she
talked about several million people being taken out of the previous
provisions as a result of the clause. Clearly, there are not

                           </div>millions of gardeners and cooks, so it would be helpful if she could
give other examples of activities that will no longer be covered under
the Bill. I have set out the chief points on which I need clarification

                              <span class="hs_CLMember">The
Minister for Equalities (Lynne Featherstone):<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000446">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> I look
forward to our proceedings this morning under your chairmanship, Mr
Streeter. The hon. Lady asked why we are making such a change. The
scope of the current vetting and barring scheme is defined by two
elements: first, by a person being a “vulnerable adult,”
and secondly, by an adult being in receipt of a “regulated
activity.” Our intention is to move from the position in which a
whole range of people are included in regulated activity, whom we
believe do not belong in such a position. Action on Elder Abuse stated
that society cannot reasonably expect any system or a combination of
systems to guarantee the safety and well-being of every child or adult
at risk, and we cannot expect a system in its totality to achieve that.
Matters become much less clear in respect of ancillary staff and more
general volunteers. I guess that shows the difference. For example,
personal care and relevant social care are very intimate. The risk is
not about where people are or whether they are in a home; it is about
the service that people receive and whether that might make them
vulnerable. Under the Bill, even if there is only one occasion on which
the exchange of care happens, it will be a regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
approach is more targeted and risk-based. In deciding on it, we
considered the varying nature of someone’s
vulnerability—as we have said, according to age, illness or
disability—and their capacity to make decisions. The approach
recognised that vulnerability may change over time and that some people
are more vulnerable in some situations. It also looked at social health
and social care services, as well as levels of supervision. It did not
come out of the blue from the Department of Health; it was an
evidence-based decision and a wide range of sources was drawn on in
deciding what were regulated
activities.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Among
many other publications, we drew on the 2007 “UK Study of Abuse
and Neglect of Older People”, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 code

                           </strong> I will come back to the hon. Lady on whether

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have never said that the previous Government were wrong to protect
vulnerable adults and children; we have simply made the assessment that
including 11 million people in a scheme in which the vast
majority did not need to be included was disproportionate, put people
off volunteering and created conditions where some
people—particularly men—were scared to hug a child if
they fell over. It reached ridiculous proportions, and the approach is
about trying to be proportionate about where the risks
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
who is in and who is out of the scheme, for adults it covers all
health, personal and social care workers—doctors, social workers
and home care workers who assist with independent living. The types of
workers who carry out regulated activities in relation to adults
include—apart from doctors, nurses and dentists, who are the
more obvious health care professionals, and the staff who work under
their direction or supervision, such as a health care assistant on a
hospital ward—care workers who provide personal care whether in
a health setting, a care home or day care service; care workers who
help an older, sick or disabled person with day-to-day management of
their money by helping with shopping or paying bills, for example;
anyone who makes financial or welfare decisions on behalf of another
person because, for example, they lack mental capacity; social workers
assessing the needs of social care services for older, disabled or sick
adults; and drivers and escorts who transport adults under arrangements
organised by service
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the previous scheme, all jobs in care homes are regulated, where the
work is carried out for the purpose of the home and there is any form
of contact with residents. That is changing under the Bill. Examples of
people who are being taken out of regulated activity are volunteers who
maintain the plants and the fish tank in the residents’ lounge,
the lift engineer, the plumber, the electrician, the hairdresser, the
window cleaner, the receptionist, volunteers who give their time to
provide activities such as music, crafts or flower arranging, and
inspectors. The changes will mean that there is a risk-based
calculation and the workers or volunteers who are most intimately
involved with residents—those providing the care—are in
regulated activity. I hope that explanation helps the hon.

approach set out by the Bill no longer labels people as vulnerable
adults, but defines the types of regulated activity
that are carried out in relation to an adult who, by reason of age,
illness and disability, needs those services. The vetting and barring
scheme will not cover those who are not carrying out regulated
activity. That includes, for example, prison and probation staff,
maintenance workers, cleaners in hospitals and care homes
and workers in sheltered housing. Together, clauses 64 and 65 create a
new approach to defining regulated activity in respect of an adult, as
we have discussed. It is about the nature of the activity, regardless
of the setting in which it is carried out. It is a much better approach
than attempting to define vulnerability or trying to label a person as
vulnerable. As we discussed last week, I am an adult; I become
vulnerable if I go into hospital or if I am incapacitated, but I am not
a “vulnerable adult.” There is a big distinction to be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000056">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We now move on to the barring part of the Bill.
This clause alters the test for barring an individual. It amends
schedule 3 to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which
regulates the barring arrangements. That includes the process of
information sharing between the Independent Safeguarding Authority and
the Secretary of State. Subsection (1) changes the conditions for
automatic barring. At present, anyone who has committed certain serious
offences will automatically be barred. In future, the person must have
committed the serious offence, and the ISA or the Secretary of State
must have reason to believe they have worked in, are currently working
in, or may work in, a regulated activity in future. It is of great
concern to many people that that automatic barring will effectively
stop.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) rewrites schedule 3, and deals with offences that may lead to an
automatic barring, where someone has the right to make representations.
These are offences which give rise to a presumption that they pose a
risk, but which can be rebutted through representations to the
Secretary of State. Again, the automatic barring will only occur when
the ISA has reason to believe that they have worked in the past, are
currently working, or may work in future, in a regulated activity.
Subsections (3) and (4) do the same, but for cases where individuals
have been referred to the ISA because of the risk of harm, or because
of their behaviour. Subsections (5) to (8) make the same changes for
those barred from working with vulnerable
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be grateful if the Minister could help me. I have been trying to
think why the Government would want to introduce this provision. Where
is the evidence that it is required? I have not been able to find any
evidence in any of the information that has been supplied. I want to
look at the example of someone convicted of child rape. At the moment,
they would automatically go on the barred list. As I understand it,
under these new provisions, they would only go on the barred list if
they had worked in regulated activity in the past, or they currently
did so, or may do so in future. As the clause is drafted, if the person
who had been convicted of child rape was a lorry driver, for example,
they would not automatically go on the barred list, although most of
the general public would think that that was a no-brainer—they
should automatically be on the list. What would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 565<a class="bkMark" name="Column565">&#160;</a>
                           </div>happen if that lorry driver decided—say five or 10 years down the
road—to take up driving a school coach with children on board?
Could the Minister look at that example? Obviously, the ISA has to
consider that this man is a lorry driver. If he has been a lorry driver
for 20 years, will the ISA just say, “Well, he has
never shown interest in driving people, so he is not going to be put on
the barred list”?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am very
concerned about this; I am not sure what the Government will gain from
enacting the clause. An appeals process is already built into the
provisions around barring. Therefore I do not understand why a person
should not be put on the barred list automatically, and appeal if they
so wish.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am also
concerned about how the ISA will make an assessment in cases like this.
If someone has used their position to abuse children, most people would
assume that that person might try to get as close as possible to
children in the future. Even if the abuse had not taken place during
the course of regulated activity—and if this clause passes, that
is the definition that will have to be looked at by the ISA—we
should surely presume that that person might attempt to get into
regulated activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the case
of offences that are so serious that someone is automatically barred,
could the Minister give me some idea about the cost of going through
this new procedure? Obviously, if someone is convicted of a serious
offence and the automatic next stage is to put them on the barring
list, that seems a very straightforward, cheap thing to do. If we have
to go through a process of weighing up evidence, considering what the
person has previously done, is currently doing or may do in the future,
there must be a cost to that. I could not see from the impact
assessment that any thought had been given to the potential financial
cost of dealing with the issue of barring in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would also like guidance from the Minister about how the ISA will
assess whether someone is likely to participate in a regulated activity
in the future. I do not understand how rational decisions can be made
about whether a person may wish to take up regulated activity. Who
knows what will happen in the future?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
like to know what happens when the ISA gets information that leads to
someone being barred—evidence that they wanted to participate in
regulated activity but were not currently doing so. What happens to
that intelligence? What concerns me is that we know how often
information can go astray. I would like to understand how the ISA will
hold on to information that, under the law being brought forward, it
will not have the right to hold—given that if a person is not in
regulated activity, I assume that they are of no interest to the ISA.
What happens if someone reports to the ISA genuine concerns about
somebody who is not in a regulated activity, but whose conduct should
result in their being barred? What does the ISA do with that
information, and how would that be dealt with in the future if that
person moved into regulated activity? How can we ensure that the
information is not lost?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The impact
assessment refers to the fact that between January 2009 and December
2010 there were 16,000 automatic bars, and states that there will be a
significant drop in the number of people placed on the barred list. Can
the hon. Lady give us an idea of the numbers she expects to be on the
barred list if the provisions are enacted?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000081">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am starting from the evidence in the impact
assessment, which refers to 16,000 people on the barred list. I have
set out my worries about changing a system that most people readily
accept offers a level of protection by ensuring that the names of those
who should be on the barred list are placed on it. I am concerned that
the forthcoming changes will mean that fewer people will be on the
barred list and that we will not have the level of protection that we
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000083">&#160;</a>

I want to hear from the Minister exactly how many people she thinks

significant, but it would be interesting to see, given the figures for
2009-10, where we will be if the proposal is enacted. The whole thrust
of what the Government are saying is that they want a more common-sense
approach and want the general public to be with them. They have it
wrong. The general public will not be with them on automatic
barring.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000084">&#160;</a>

have stressed that, unlike the Government, I am not hung up on numbers.
One of the threads in the Bill seems to be an intention to get numbers
down. I agree that the provision must be about ensuring that relevant
people are on the barred
list.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000086">&#160;</a>

Association of Chief Police Officers made it clear in its written
submission that it is worried about how the Independent Safeguarding
Authority will be aware of whether or not someone committing an
automatic bar offence satisfies any of the criteria and so should be

obviously deal with such issues day in, day out so I hope the Minister
will take their remarks seriously. ACPO also states that there might be

Remember, this is not regulated activity. The ISA could bar P on the
basis that, in the future, he might need a CRB check. P, however, is
not conducting a regulated activity, so the Sunday league team have no
way of knowing that he is barred, because nothing will show up on an
enhanced CRB check. That is why I was shaking my head

this. The other scenario is that the ISA does not bar P, on that basis
that he is not conducting a regulated activity and there is no reason
to think that he will in the future. The information would then be
passed on to the ISA, but because the police do not have any
information on P, an enhanced CRB check would continue to show that he

Play for Children has questioned the evidence for this particular

the Committee through it? It certainly is not anywhere in the papers

merit and claim on the UK as the ECHR. The person who has committed

argument is that people who fall into this category should be
permanently barred, whether or not they are seeking employment and
whether or not it is regulated. The evidence is that they will try to
get an opportunity to work with children. That assertion is backed up,
it says, by statistics that show the serial nature of child abuse, as
the approach of people who commit those offences is to get close to
children so that they can abuse them in various ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000102">&#160;</a>

that the Minister has had meetings with the General Social Care
Council, which is a regulating body for the social work profession that
has raised concerns about how the measure will work. Under the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, it is subject to duties to
refer information to the Independent Safeguarding Authority. It states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“potential for
an overlap arises because the ISA can bar an individual for either
causing ‘harm’ or demonstrating the potential to cause
‘harm’ to a vulnerable person. Harm is not defined in the
legislation and so the ISA has wide discretion in terms of who to
‘bar’. An individual whose professional incompetence has
caused harm or could have caused harm to a vulnerable person could be
removed from working with vulnerable adults, and children by the ISA. A
registered professional could be barred for example, for inappropriate
administration of medication by a nurse, poor administrative procedure
in a social work setting, or even misdiagnosis by a
doctor.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000387">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady and I am glad that I do not have to answer her concerns on
behalf of the Government. She has planted in me some concerns about the
tests, which are twofold. First, it seems that the hon. Lady is calling
for people to be barred from working with children on the basis of
suspicion. She might want to intervene to clarify whether that is the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is certainly not the case. When I went
through the list, I was very careful to say that my concerns were about
when there was a conviction for a serious offence or when a suspicion

                           <strong>Steve
Baker:</strong> Okay. The second point that the hon. Lady made was that
there had been a reported suspicion of inappropriate activity. That
concerns me deeply because it leaves open the possibility of malicious
allegations. If we find ourselves working with children, do we have to
be careful how we look at a child, in case we are reported as behaving
in a suspicious manner? It is a dangerous road to go down. For me the
test should be very simple: criminal conviction. If somebody was
criminally convicted of a serious offence against a child, I would be
concerned if they were not then barred. I would like to know the
circumstances in which somebody would not be barred.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000112">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North referred to the General Social
Care Council’s memorandum to the Committee, which raises a
number of concerns about which professional body has the
remit—who comes first and who is in final control of barring.
When a professional regulator removes an individual from the register,
an ISA bar is not required because the risk has been mitigated. There
are several sorts of circumstances, if the hon. Lady will let me
explain
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
action is taken by a professional regulator such as the General Social
Care Council to prevent an individual from working as a social worker,
it will not necessarily prevent them from seeking employment in social
care, as a care assistant in a children’s care home or as a
health care assistant in a hospital, even though a professional
judgment has been made about them. Therefore referral back to the ISA,
resulting in a bar, would prevent an unsuitable person from working
with children and vulnerable adults, but not necessarily from doing the
job about which the professional body was making its decision, because
that only controls the areas that function under that professional
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Professional
regulators can apply a range of sanctions, which may indeed mitigate
against risk, which is why the Government are proposing to amend the
duty to make referrals to the ISA to a power to make referrals, because
that will allow regulators such as the General Social Care Council and
others to make a judgment about whether their mitigating action against
risk is sufficient, or whether wider action is needed, such as a bar by
the ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In order to
make a barring decision for those who have not committed an
offence—the harm test—the ISA uses a decision-making
process, which includes  the use of structured judgment, to aid
its determination about whether an individual presents an unacceptable
risk of harm to children and/or vulnerable adults. The ISA
decision-making process and guidance is available on the website, if
the hon. Lady wishes to look at it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The current
arrangements for professional bodies making referrals to the ISA are
confusing. What can  the Government do about that confusion? As
I said, the guidance on referrals is available on the website
for  the avoidance of doubt. In addition, the ISA and officials
have had a number of meetings with professional regulators to iron out
practical arrangements and to exchange information. In fact, officials
are meeting on Monday, I think, to discuss these issues further. It
should be acknowledged that the Government and professional regulators
share the same intentions. They want to ensure that, between them, the
harm the hon. Lady is concerned about cannot happen and that the
appropriate level of action is taken by the professional body or the
ISA
bar.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000122">&#160;</a>

clearly. People might be barred for financial impropriety, for example,
so it is not necessarily for harm in that sense. The point that I guess
the hon. Lady wishes to make is this: if an organisation has volunteers
working in an unregulated activity and is aware that someone is barred,
it might, without any more information than that, including what the
bar is for, decide not to have that person, which would be wrong if the
bar is for an unconnected matter. For unregulated activities, it has
been decided that the barring information is not needed; that is
outside regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
on information flows, the bigger danger is that the same person can,
for example, go to the local park and harm children no one is watching.
However, if the activity is unsupervised, it will be regulated. We are
trying to transfer supervision and care, and to be proportionate about
the balance of the responsibility of the state in barring those who are
most dangerous and pose the greatest risk in situations where there are
opportunities for harm. That is the
differential.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
key messages from the debate is that for a long time, employers have
been able to refer information to the ISA on suspicion, and the ISA,
which is very experienced in making barring decisions, might or might
not have made a bar, according to its judgment. It has also been a way
in which employers have been able to offload their responsibility. They
could say, “I had my doubts. I don’t really want to
report the matter to the police because it is not nice to do that about
a teacher or employee we know.” There are reservations, and all
of us in politics know of situations when people want to move someone
on, but do not want to become involved, be seen to accuse or take the
matter to the police. It is important that such cases are taken
forward. That is the key: such information should go to the police.
That is a good message for the Committee to send
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000135">&#160;</a>

not the case that the Opposition expect action to be taken against
those who are cast with suspicion, but against whom others are
reluctant to inform the police authorities? Is it not important that we
remember that those who are committing offences and whom it is right to
bar from having connections with children are different from those
caught under the less secure system of people simply being

suspicions to the police. No one in the Committee would disagree with
that. However, it does not always happen in reality. In his evidence,
Sir Roger Singleton said that 50% of concerns about vulnerable adults
in care homes that led to dismissal or agreed resignations were not
referred to the police. That is why we are stressing the point; it is
all very well to say, “Of course, you should go to the
police”, but it does not always
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps that is what happened in the past,
but clearly we should be addressing the situation because it is not
acceptable. If 50% of incidents are not reported, it is a dreadful
indictment of the conditions in the care home, and its supervision and
ownership, that so many things could be going wrong and the matter not
be reported to the police. Such an establishment needs more
surveillance. When someone is employed or offers to volunteer, there is
the matter of previous references. They should show doubts and
suspicions. <em>[</em>

reference to pass them on. Such action needs tackling because we are
referring on bad
heads.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000139">&#160;</a>

We will encourage employers to bring examples to the attention of the

criminal justice purposes, including local intelligence. As my hon.

balance in terms of the responsibility lying between the state and the
employer or organisation. For far too long, there has been a change
around. Somehow, people could go through processes that freed them, in
employing people, of their actual responsibility for taking references,
supervising things and making sure that everything in their

the best, absolute protection to children and vulnerable

recent case that springs to mind is that of Vanessa George, which was
hideous. She worked for a long time in regulated activity and she had a
clear CRB check. The ultimate defence against anyone behaving in an
inappropriate way with children or vulnerable adults is the person on
the spot—the person who is there, who can see what is happening.
We can never say never under our scheme, nor could we do so under that
of the previous Government. We have worked out where the proportionate
line is drawn between the need to keep away someone who means harm,
where the greatest risk is, without putting obstacles in the way of
those who do not mean harm and who do not need that level of
prohibition.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000171">&#160;</a>

need to work out a structured process for determining whether a person

the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North made about how we work out

activity—for example, a teaching or nursing course may lead
someone to regulated activity in due course—the small unknown is
with the other information that will come from the employers, upon
referral, when that individual is seeking to work in regulated
activity. That information will not be in their previous history and we
do not know what will happen in the future. They may embark on those
activities at a future date, which is what the provision

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I have answered the vast majority of the hon. Lady’s
points. Clause 66, as she said, amends schedule 3 to the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. The clause will ensure that only
those who apply to engage in regulated activities with children or
adults are included in the barring regime, so as to prevent them from
undertaking such work. People who have never undertaken such work, or
never applied to undertake such work, will no longer fall within the
scope of the vetting and barring arrangements. This is for
clarification. It makes no sense to go through the process of barring
someone who has never engaged in, and who has no intention of engaging
in, regulated activity. If that individual were to be barred, or were a
bar to appear, it could hamper their employment chances in occupations
that do not give rise to safeguarding issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 66
amends how automatic barring works. Individuals who have committed the
most serious of crimes, who work or apply to work with vulnerable
groups, will still be automatically barred from working with those
groups. There are two types of automatic barring: one without the right
to make representations and one with the right to make representations.
The arrangements for the category of offences in respect of which an
individual may make representations to the ISA on their barring status
are changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(1) of clause 66 relates to the children’s barred list and
amends the provisions set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of
schedule 3 to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 for the
automatic barring of persons who meet the prescribed criteria. The
prescribed criteria are set out in Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006 (Prescribed Criteria and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations
2009 and refer to circumstances when individuals have been convicted or
cautioned for a serious criminal offence, which gives rise to a clear
indication of risk to vulnerable groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000182">&#160;</a>

therefore excludes from automatic barring persons who have not worked,
who are not working and who have no intention of working in regulated
activity. The changes still require the ISA to place on the barred
lists those persons who have committed serious offences and who are,
have been or might in the future be engaged in regulated

                           </span> I am trying to get my head round
the clause. There are times when I feel at ease with what the Minister
is saying and there are other times when I feel very awkward. If
someone has committed an offence such that a parent would reasonably
have concern about that person having access to their children in
regulated or unregulated activity, how does the clause reassure the
parent? The person has committed an offence, regardless of whether at
the time of the offence they had any intention of working with
children. Perhaps they had no intention of doing so and there was no
suspicion that they would want to do so. Can the parent be confident
that the person will be prevented from having access to
children?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000185">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In respect of unregulated activity, the
parent can have confidence in the school or care home in which the
person is helping or working in a supervised capacity. That is the
point. What we are talking about will come about not through the
barring information, but through the organisation’s procedures,
checking of references, supervision and attention to detail and through
its listening to what people say. It will not come about through people
seeing that there  is a
bar.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000186">&#160;</a>

understand why we keep returning to the point about the concerns of
parents about someone who may have been barred at some point being
anywhere near, in any circumstances, their child. That is what the hon.
Member for Eltham is talking about. My answer is that the Government
have made a decision about where and how that is best safeguarded
against in terms of appropriateness, because the knowledge about a bar
is not necessarily the safeguard that a parent needs. The enhanced CRB
check, the other checking procedures and the supervision thereof are
far more important on the day, in the circumstances. The people on the
spot know the geography, the circumstances, the level of supervision
and all those things. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman’s
point. It may not be the answer that he wants. Nevertheless, those are
the circumstances in terms of the decision between unregulated and
regulated

seems to be a loophole or gap in the Bill that suggests that if a

them to be placed on the barred register. What if several years later
they begin to work on a voluntary basis with

(2) amends paragraph 2 of schedule 3 to the 2006 Act, which governs
automatic bars with representations. Those bars are based on criminal
convictions or cautions that although not providing such a clear
indication of risk as the criteria falling under paragraph 1 of
schedule 3, are still serious and raise the presumption of a risk of
harm to vulnerable groups. Those offences are also set out in the 2009

                           </strong> The clause will abolish the notion of controlled
activity, about which we have previously had lengthy debates. I want
the Minister to address several issues. Is she satisfied that in
removing controlled activity, the same level of protection will be
offered to the most vulnerable adults and children, about whom the
Committee is
concerned?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have made much of their claim to halve the number of people
subject to vetting and barring. I am interested to know how many people
no longer subject to barring will be working with vulnerable adults.
There has been a big debate about those working with children, but the
vetting and barring clauses relating to vulnerable adults have not
attracted as much attention from the charities and organisations that
have commented on the clauses relating to
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am particularly interested in the split between how many people who
would have been considered to be in controlled activities with adults
the Minister expects will be removed from any of the vetting and
barring schemes. Similarly, for children, how many people were in the
previous scheme and how many will there be in the new scheme? Will she
take us through some examples, so that we can fully appreciate and
understand what the clause will
do?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to press the Minister on what steps she will take to ensure that
the community care and social care industry is fully aware of the
requirements under the new scheme. Having spent time looking at and
understanding controlled and regulated activity, is she concerned about
the confusion that might arise from the changes? At the beginning, we
talked about the complicated nature of the scheme and about ensuring
that it is as clear as possible to all interested parties. We need to
get this right, because all members of the Committee want to ensure
that there is a clear message about what the Bill will do to protect
vulnerable children and adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I believe that there will be the same level
of protection from harm in the assessment of greater risk. It is not
impossible that someone could be in a situation now that they could not
have been in before because it was regulated, but it will be either
supervised or, with adults, there will not be the personal care,
relevant social care or health care that dictates that something should
be regulated activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000225">&#160;</a>

rather than responsible behaviour by employees and
of giving the impression that the scheme could manage all risks out of

included administrative staff employed in a social services department

scale the scheme back to common-sense levels, so that only activities
that are defined as regulated activities fall under the new barring

controlled activity will not be subject to the

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause repeals sections 21 and 22 of the 2006 Act, which define
controlled activity in respect of children and vulnerable adults, as
well as section 23, which enabled regulations to be made to govern
steps that employers must take when considering whether to allow a
person to engage in controlled activity. As we have discussed in
relation to clauses 63 and 65, regulated activities are being
re-defined on the basis of risks to, and access provided to, children
or adults who need those services by reason of their age, illness or
disability. We do not think that a separate category, such as
controlled activity, to which barring does not apply, is necessary or
desirable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Abolishing
the concept of controlled activity will require all employers to
actively manage any risks inherent in those types of role, rather
than assume that the Government have already done
that for them, as was arguably the case under the previous
arrangements. Colin Reid of the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000242">&#160;</a>

of that risk management process will include employers and voluntary
organisations obtaining enhanced criminal record certificates in
respect of persons working with vulnerable groups but in a capacity
that does not constitute regulated activity. Employers will, therefore,
continue to have access to any criminal convictions and relevant
non-conviction information that will enable them to come to a view on
whether it would be appropriate to employ the person concerned in the
position in
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, an enhanced criminal record certificate will not tell the
employer or voluntary body whether a person is barred. Barring does not
apply in such cases, so we do not believe that it would be appropriate
or proportionate to disclose barring information in respect of
positions that fall outside regulated activity. Providing barring
information in such cases would have an adverse impact on job
applications and volunteers, because it could lead to an employer
refusing a job to someone when the fact that they were barred was not
relevant to the position in question—in the case of office work,
for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000244">&#160;</a>

that some of their activities would be stopped or cancelled; 56%

I have visited the ISA on two occasions because I was concerned about
this. I sat down with decision makers to look at examples of case files
because I wanted to understand properly how things are done. The ISA is
making very difficult, finely balanced judgments using lots of evidence
and experience. Decisions are not made by one person; lots of
moderation goes on, and there is a high level of checking and
supervision. The Committee needs to understand that when it considers
the ISA’s decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000256">&#160;</a>

My hon. Friend clearly makes the point I was attempting to make about
the ISA’s specialist knowledge, which will now not be

evidence to the Committee, Sir Roger Singleton talked about
parents’ views on ensuring that people who come into contact
with their children are suitable. There is a concern about music
teachers and tutors. If the ISA said that someone was a music teacher,
parents could have reassurance and could allow their child to go to
that person’s home for music lessons once a week, because they
would know that the ISA had said the person was suitable. There is a
concern that we have lost that ISA specialist knowledge, which
reassured parents and some of the voluntary groups. In his evidence,
Sir Roger Singleton said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000258">&#160;</a>

the same as being cleared. Monitoring gave a false sense of security
and I argue that it resulted in a reverse situation—people
abdicated their responsibility. The hon. Lady has quoted Sir Roger
Singleton, but it is worth reminding the Committee of what he said in
his evidence to us. On these changes to the scheme, he

                        <p class="tabbed">I argue,
therefore, that the measure has the opposite effect and that taking
away responsibility from the employer is more
dangerous. The ISA makes an overarching decision on barring and will
continue to do so—there is no change there. The ISA will not say
whether a person is suitable and would not have done so under the
previous scheme. There was never a mandatory requirement on personal
tutoring under the old scheme either. The ISA can still assess
information—convictions or otherwise —and bar
people under their risk-based process. No information was known about
92% of the people who were subject to monitoring, so monitoring 9
million people is disproportionate, given that such a high percentage
of them have nothing to be worried about.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000261">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
repeals sections 24 to 27 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006. Monitoring would have meant that updated information, such as new
convictions or cautions, would be collated and referred to the ISA so
that it could consider whether the registered person should be barred.
Individuals who seek to harm vulnerable people in our society will
still be prevented from taking on roles working with vulnerable groups
without the vast majority of law-abiding people who work with such
groups having to be continually monitored.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
protection of vulnerable groups is a shared responsibility and not
solely that of the Government, and employers or organisations should
not feel a protection that is not actually there. As I have said in
previous discussions, there is no better ultimate defence than the
person who is there, who knows the situation, knows what the person is
meant to be doing and knows the geography of the place in which they
are working.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000263">&#160;</a>

condone a system that assumes that the way to catch the guilty is to
monitor the innocent, using a big brother solution, just in case they
do something wrong. The clause abolishes monitoring requirements and
any other requirements relating to the proposed monitoring scheme. The
abolition of monitoring is an important component of the overall

police are expected to share information with the ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned about two changes, particularly those relating to the test
that the police must employ, which I shall raise with the Minister.
Subsection (1) alters the test for deciding whether to share
information from where any of the relevant paragraphs of schedule 3
“applies”, to “or appears to apply.” That
measure refers to cases in which the police or the Secretary of State
refer an issue to the ISA because of a conviction, or other relevant
information that has come to their attention.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000269">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The changes
made by clause 66, which we have discussed, mean that the police and
the Secretary of State are obliged to refer only when there is some
reason to believe that the person may engage in regulated activity,
which may not always be clear. We have discussed at length the problems
of the approach of looking at regulated activity and thinking whether
the person may decide to engage in it in the future. My view is that
the test has been weakened in that particular case. Will the Minister
comment on that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
a change to the test that the police office must employ when deciding
what information to share. At present, the police will share
information if they think that it might be relevant. Under the clause,
they will share information if they reasonably believe it to be
relevant. Will the Minister comment on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) replaces paragraph 20(2) of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006. Both paragraphs concern the Secretary of State’s duty to
share information with the ISA. However, while the original paragraph
had a more general obligation, the new one appears to limit the
obligation to one about convictions that lead to automatic barring.
Will the Minister comment on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister think that the changes set out in the clause will result
in the ISA receiving more or less information about people of concern?
I do not understand why the Minister wants to limit the Secretary of
State’s remit for sharing information with the ISA; perhaps she
will explain the thinking behind that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
why is it the role of the police to consider whether someone is likely
to conduct a regulated activity in the future? We have already
discussed the difficulty of doing that, and the specialist knowledge
and approach that the ISA have. We are expecting police officers also
to have that knowledge and approach. Will the Minister comment on how
she sees that happening and what discussions she has had with the
Association of Chief Police Officers to consider the special training
that might be required of police officers to fulfil the obligations of
the
clause?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000274">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 69(1)(a) inserts the words
“appears to apply” in paragraph 19 of schedule 3 to the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 1996 so that the ISA can require the
police to provide information such as convictions, cautions and other
relevant information when the police consider that the barring
provisions, whether they are automatic or discretionary, apply or
appear to apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
for the amendment is that we have amended the barring provisions in
schedule 3 for both automatic and discretionary bars. Under our
amendment, a person is barred only if there is a link to regulated
activity—if the person is engaged in such activity, has been so
in the past or is likely to be so in the future. It may not be
immediately apparent to the police whether the person does or does not
have that link, and it cannot be the police’s job to know that.
That is why there is a requirement to supply that information. What
they will know is whether the person has had any convictions, or
relevant police information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
also removes a reference, in paragraph 19 of schedule 3 to the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, to information resulting from
monitoring,

			Column number: 587<a class="bkMark" name="Column587">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and we have just abolished monitoring in the previous clause. The
amendment, therefore, is consequential on the key clause, which was
clause
66.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
69(1)(b) amends the test that the police apply when giving the ISA
police information. Whether that is a conviction or other police
information, the test at the moment is that the chief officer of police
must provide such information as he thinks might be relevant; the
clause changes that to such information as he “reasonably
believes” to be relevant. It is a higher bar. That mirrors the
change made under clause 79 to the relevance test for disclosing
information on enhanced CRB certificates, which we will come to when we
get to the CRB area later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
69(1)(c) is consequential on clause 69(2), which amends paragraph 20 of
schedule 3 to the 2006 Act. We are amending that paragraph because of
the changes made to the 2006 Act that repeal monitoring. The Secretary
of State will no longer be involved in monitoring under the 2006 Act,
and we are therefore amending the obligations to share information
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
obligation on the Secretary of State is to share information about
conviction and cautions of a prescribed description. That obligation
will kick in when an individual makes an application to the CRB for an
enhanced CRB certificate in connection with regulated activity, and the
CRB certificate shows an auto-bar offence. The CRB, which acts on
behalf of the Secretary of State, is under an obligation to pass the
information on to the ISA, and the proposal would make sure that the
obligation included an obligation to pass on details of the conviction,
such as the convicting court, the date of the conviction and the
sentence
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000280">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is an attempt to deal with the problem that we have
identified with information on barring. Under the Bill, employers or
voluntary organisations employing someone to work in regulated activity
will only find out that that individual is barred when they receive the
CRB certificate. The certificate is sent first to the
individual—a matter to which we shall return under later
clauses—who must share it with their employer. If an individual
was barred while already in employment, the employer will not find out
about it until another CRB check is carried
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000284">&#160;</a>

know the situation, and will not have to wait until a CRB check is
carried out and the individual shares details of the CRB certificate at
a later date. The NSPCC supports the amendment, because it would ensure
that basic information is known instantly about whether someone is
barred, and it would not mean that there would be a lengthy delay. It
would meet the Minister’s aim that information about those
within regulated activity held by employers is current, and those
employers will be fully aware that a barring decision had been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000285">&#160;</a>

Lady’s point. Clause 72 already imposes a duty on employers to
check whether a person is barred before committing that person to
engage in regulated activity. Clause 71 provides for the capacity for
employers to register an interest so that they will be informed if an
individual is barred. The Bill puts the onus on employers, rather than
relying on the bureaucratic system of monitoring circumstances.
Employers can make sure someone is not barred before they enter their
employment and will have the option to be continually updated on their
status.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000286">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I accept that we shall discuss such matters under
later clauses, but will the Minister confirm that such action will take
place only with the consent of the individual? I know that she is keen
to ensure that employers play the fullest part in monitoring and
checking that employees are doing what they should be doing and not
doing what they should not be doing but, if consent were not given by
the individual, the employer would not know that there had been a
barring decision. Is that
right?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000287">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall come to consent later, but an
employer who employs someone in regulated activity will commit an
offence if they knowingly employ someone who is barred. I therefore
assume and believe that that employer could register their interest and
be updated if someone were barred. It is highly unlikely that they
would not know in any circumstances that someone had committed an
offence that led to barring while in employment. An individual cannot
go into employment in regulated activity before the employer has found
out, because the employer will have a duty under clause 72 to ensure
that the individual is not barred before employment
commences.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000288">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to make sure that I fully understand this
point. I understand that the employer will be obliged to check whether
someone is barred. If an employer did so in the case of an individual
who was also a supervisor in a Sunday school—a regulated
activity—but information was subsequently passed to the ISA
stating that things had been happening in the Sunday school that should
not have been happening, and that resulted in the ISA taking the
decision to bar that individual while they were still employed in their
day job, how would the employer know that the ISA had made a barring
decision? What would happen if the employer had already checked, and
the check was clear, but several months later a decision was taken to
bar?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000289">&#160;</a>

point, because it certainly deserves an answer. If I cannot provide one
at this point I will come back to her at a later stage. In practice, it
is unlikely that an employer would not find out that an employee in
regulated activity had been barred, and if that happened the employee
would, of course, be committing a criminal offence. I understand the
point that the hon. Lady is making, but it would be an offence if that
employer did not bother to find out and did not know that they were
employing somebody who had been barred. Yes, the updating service on
barred status requires consent, but the offences of knowingly employing
a barred person and of engaging in regulated activity if barred will
already exist, so both would be committing an offence. The person who
is barred will commit an offence if they carry on working in regulated
activity. That will be against the law by the time the Bill is
introduced. If an individual refuses to give consent, either under
clause 71 or through an enhanced CRB certificate, it is up
to the employer to take appropriate action. Any employer who is a
regulated activity provider will be responsible enough to take
appropriate action. If someone refuses to give consent to check on
their status, that in itself should sound an
alarm.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000290">&#160;</a>

take responsibility for decisions about whom they employ and what
services are provided, and to make sure that people are safe and doing
the job that they should be doing. I am concerned about the fact that
an employer who has done everything correctly by checking the status of
an employee at the outset of their employment in regulated activity,
when they were clearly not barred, might find themselves in the
difficult position of not knowing if that employee is subsequently
barred because of the later provision in the Bill that an individual
has to give their consent. That is not very

                           </strong> We will come on to consent, but I am surprised
that there is an opportunity in the Bill for an employee to withhold
consent. I am sure that the Government have drafted the Bill as they
have to ensure that it is not compulsory for an employee to give their
consent, because that would lead to remedies in the

the ISA to review at its discretion someone’s inclusion on
either of the barred lists so long as the decision is not already
subject to review at that person’s request. In effect, that will
mean that the ISA will have the power to remove a person from the
barred lists if there is new information, a change in the
person’s circumstances or because the ISA discovers that it has
made an
error.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000321">&#160;</a>

we look back at the circumstances of the errors that the ISA has made
previously, it will remove someone from the barred lists in the
following types of cases: if Mr X is cautioned for an autobar offence
and barred, but his caution is rescinded—a change in
circumstance; if Mr X is convicted of an autobar offence and barred,
but his conviction is quashed on appeal; or if Mr X is barred following
a conviction before 12 October 2009 for an autobar offence, but it
transpires that the court had considered a disqualification order and
decided not to issue one. The ISA will also remove someone in the
following cases: Mr X is made subject to a disqualification order or
risk of serious harm order and barred, but the order is revoked; the
ISA bars Mr X for an autobar offence conviction or caution based on
police information, but the information is wrong and no autobar offence
was committed—he is found not guilty by reason of insanity, for
example; or the ISA bars Mr X based on police information, but Mr Y has
assumed Mr X’s identity—the ISA has got the wrong
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000322">&#160;</a>

not the same as reviews. There is a different implication. There are
approximately 12 appeals pending before the upper tribunal. I believe
that at present no appeals have been determined by the tribunal, but I
will confirm that in due course. It is only right that the ISA should
of its own volition be able to review cases at any time. If, for
example, the ISA discovers that someone was put on a list in error, it
should be able to review its barring decision and take relevant action.

                           </strong> The main Government amendments in this group
seek to strengthen the provisions in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups
Act 2006 in relation to the information that can be passed from the
Independent Safeguarding Authority to other organisations, such as the
police and probation services. Amendment 145 will enable the
Independent Safeguarding Authority to provide to the keeper of a
register—for example, the General Medical Council—any
relevant information that it considers appropriate, and not just
information relating to a barred
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
148 and 149 will change the basis on which barred list information is
provided to the police, and will extend the provision of such
information to the Prison Service and the probation service. At
present, the ISA “may” provide information to the police
in connection with certain aims, such as the detection or prevention of
crime. That was intended to enable the authority to provide information
to the police that it might have obtained from other sources, such as
employer referrals. For operational reasons, the police need to ensure
that barred list information is available when 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 592<a class="bkMark" name="Column592">&#160;</a>
                           </div>needed—for example, in investigating a potential offence, such as
someone working while barred. The provision will therefore be changed
to ensure that the ISA “must” provide such
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision will also be extended to the Prison Service and the probation
service for the purposes of public protection. Those services require
information on barred status and on the reasons for that barring in the
preparation of risk assessments, particularly when prisoners or those
under probation supervision are being considered for work placements in
the community that may provide access to children or vulnerable adults.
Those changes have been requested by the police and the Ministry of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000331">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Government
amendments 143 and 144 will remove the provision that would have
enabled the Ministry of Defence to carry out barred list checks on
training supervisors working for the armed forces in countries outside
England and Wales. The Ministry of Defence believes that the provision
is no longer necessary, because it is satisfied that the availability
of CRB checks will be sufficient in assessing the suitability of
individuals to act as training supervisors for recruits under 18. The
same changes will be made for training supervisors working in England
and Wales for the same reasons, namely that the Ministry of Defence is
satisfied that barred list information is not essential for its vetting
of personnel working with under-18s on the basis that enhanced criminal
record certificates will continue to be
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000332">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to address new clause 15, which
in some ways is similar to Government amendment 149. The
major difference is that the Government amendment will enable the
Secretary of State to issue guidance or regulation on when information
should be shared between the ISA and the police or between the ISA and
professional bodies, such as the military and the Prison
Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000334">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
new clause 15 focuses on the police and the giving of specific
guidance. Its rationale is to add more information to the police
database for the purposes of enhanced CRB checks. We have had extensive
debates in Committee about the importance of passing information to the
police for use in making CRB checks, and the new clause assists with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would give the ISA a duty to share information with the
police where the information is such that the chief executive of the
ISA feels that a criminal investigation is appropriate, where the
information is credible and reliable and suggests that an individual
poses a threat to vulnerable groups or where the information has led or
would lead to a person being barred if the ISA had reason to believe
that that individual might work in a regulated activity in future. It
would give the sharing of information some teeth. The evidence sessions
identified that 50% of problems in independent care homes and the care
sector are not reported to the police. That issue requires particular
attention.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000336">&#160;</a>

response to the Committee makes a point about access to real-time
information about barring. Will the Minister comment on that? The
example in ACPO’s evidence involved a uniformed police patrol
outside office hours checking the driver of a minibus containing
children. That officer would need to know there and then whether the
driver was barred from working with children in order to take the
necessary enforcement action and, more importantly, to ensure the
safety of the children by removing the barred individual from that
activity. Otherwise, there is a danger that the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Act 2006, as amended by the Bill, will become a toothless tiger.
Immediate, real-time information is required. Will she comment on
whether that would work within the provisions set out in her
amendments?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000337">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Vetting and
barring arrangements are almost identical in Northern Ireland,
following a decision by the then Secretary of State, the right hon.
Member for Neath (Mr Hain), to join the provisions for arrangements
under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, allowing the ISA to
take barring decisions on Northern Ireland cases and allowing the
vetting and barring scheme to be replicated in the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007. That is sensible.
There is great worth in having wider UK arrangements that remove
potential differences between nations on this important issue. It is
important to strengthen the provisions, as the Government’s
amendments would.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For many
years, Northern Ireland has pioneered developments in vetting
arrangements, having had first-hand experience of how inappropriate
people can access positions of trust, such as in the case of sex
offender Martin Huston in 1993. The abuse of trust inquiry into his
activities led to the strengthening of Northern Ireland’s
arrangements with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
Safety’s pre-employment consultancy service and, more lately,
led to the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults (Northern
Ireland) Order 2003.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I feel that
what we have done in Northern Ireland is clearly endorsed in the
measures proposed in the amendments. Research in 2008 by the four area
child protection committees and the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty in an Ipsos MORI opinion poll of 1,000 adults in Northern
Ireland found that 97% of parents supported the vetting of those who
worked with their children in voluntary and church- based activities.
There is clearly widespread support for that legislation and that
particular type of
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am mindful of parallel Northern Ireland amendments that will be tabled
shortly, and want to comment on a number of things, as developments in
the Bill will feature in our arrangements in Northern Ireland. The
Government have indicated that employers will be able 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 594<a class="bkMark" name="Column594">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to apply for CRB checks for posts that involve regular work with
children but which are none the less outside of regulated
activity—some hon. Members have referred to regulated and
unregulated activity. A supervised volunteer is an example of such a
post, and the Government have also indicated that barring information
will not be available for them. However, as Sir Roger
Singleton—oft-quoted today—pointed out in his evidence to
the Committee, policing information is not available in 20% of the ISA
barring cases. This could lead to a person barred from regulated
activity getting work in supervised settings and, when employers choose
to obtain a CRB check, could lead to the chance that the police are
unsighted in relation to any non-conviction data and unaware of any
bar. That could result in false assurances for employers; perhaps the
Minister will comment on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
barred list information is available for such checks in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland under respective regulations made under the Police
Act 1997. Those regulations have been approved by Parliament, and are
presumably compliant with the European convention on human rights. I
ask the Minister to reconsider that issue, and to look at whether it is
wise effectively to create a two-tier regime for enhanced criminal
record disclosures that ultimately limit probability. If the Government
intend to follow through on the proposals not to provide barred
information in non-regulated activity enhanced disclosures, it is
important that a number of things happen to ensure that gaps do not
appear between regulated activity and non-regulated activity enhanced
disclosures.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Employers
should always ensure that when they make referrals to ISA they involve
the police and social services when appropriate. That will ensure that
the reasons for an ultimate bar will be known to the police, and
possibly disclosed in a CRB certificate or, in the case of Northern
Ireland, an AccessNI certificate. I welcome the Government’s
intention, which is crucial, to ensure that better guidance is provided
to employers—guidance that will no doubt be replicated in
Northern Ireland by the Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety and the Department of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000345">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
support this group of Government amendments because they ensure that
ISA advises the police of relevant barring information that the police
might not themselves have. On most occasions, both social services and
the police should be aware of cases, but a feedback
loophole—sorry, loop; there seem to be loopholes in
everything—from ISA to police forces is important. There may be
occasions, albeit not often, when the police or social services are
unaware of barred individuals, and a minority of cases in which the
individual is barred from working with children but has children of his
own and some form of assessment may be required by social
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000346">&#160;</a>

about barred information not being available on those in unregulated

not want to repeat the entire conversation that I have already had to
explain the differential that Government Members believe exists with
unregulated activity. There is no need for the barring information; it
would be

			Column number: 595<a class="bkMark" name="Column595">&#160;</a>
                           </div>disproportionate for those working in unregulated activity. The
definition of unregulated activity has been carefully assessed and
evidenced in determining what is in and what is
out. We agree that there would be benefits in aligning the vetting and
barring schemes as they operate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
and the hon. Member for Strangford might be pleased to know
that yesterday I tabled amendments to that end, which we will debate in
due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the changes to the criminal records regime, the Northern Ireland
Administration have indicated that they do not wish to parallel the
changes to the Police Act 1997 made by chapter 2 of part 5. As this is
a devolved matter, it is appropriate that the decision is taken by the
Northern Ireland Government. Not all enhanced CRB certificates include
barred list information. That is the case at present, as well as under
our proposals. Enhanced CRB certificates can be requested for positions
that do not involve working with children or vulnerable adults, such as
Gambling Commission licences or immigration
advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000348">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North made a point about amendment
145. At the moment, under clause 73, the ISA can provide information to
a keeper of a register, such as the General Medical Council, on any
barred person. The amendment would allow the ISA to provide information
to a keeper of a register on any person, irrespective of whether they
are barred. Therefore, more information will flow. That is because,
even though the ISA did not bar the person, there might still be
information in the ISA’s possession that would be relevant to
the keeper of a register.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With regard
to real-time information, the ISA must provide barring information to
the police on request. At the moment, the police can ask for the barred
list, or for information about an individual who may or may not be on
the list. It is the police’s problem at the moment how to use
that information—that is, to get it to the bobby on the beat. As
the hon. Lady mentioned, the ISA would be open during normal working
hours, but outside those hours that link is not yet in place. I
understand that the police therefore intend to make the information
available in real time, but that is for the police to do. The role of
the ISA is to provide the police with the information: either the
barred list or the information that an individual is
barred.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000350">&#160;</a>

the case in future. That is something that the police need to work out.

response to inquiries from police and in making proactive disclosures
to the police, where the ISA judges that to be appropriate. As the hon.

to be
shared.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, Government amendment 149, as the hon. Lady said, would oblige
the ISA to respond to a relevant question from a chief officer of
police about whether or not a person is barred. Therefore, there is
already considerable information sharing between the ISA and the
police. However, the hon. Lady made some reasonable points. If she
would agree to withdraw proposed new clause 15, I will undertake to
reflect on the points that she has made. However, if we were to place
an additional duty on the ISA to refer certain matters to the police,
we would need to be very careful how we framed that duty. We do not
want to place unnecessary and unproductive requirements on either the
ISA to pass on information or on the police to consider such
information if that information is of little value—if it is not
of a substantive nature that would make it worth passing on. That might
deluge the police and the ISA with information that is not relevant to
the point that the hon. Lady wants covered. I cannot give any
undertaking to bring forward an amendment regarding this issue on on
Report, but I will certainly look at it, and I hope that the hon. Lady
will withdraw the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000354">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause replaces some of the provisions lost
when monitoring was scrapped, and sets out the introduction of the
right to find out whether someone is barred. As I read the clause,
however, not everybody can find out; it is not open to everybody. The
list of people who have the right to find out whether someone is barred
is limited by schedule 7 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006, as I read it; if I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will correct
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000359">&#160;</a>

of State will establish a register of people who have expressed an
interest in a person, and notify such a registered person if the person
in whom they are interested becomes barred. As I understand it, that is
subject to a fee. Who is paying it? At what level will it be set? In
the clause there is also the opportunity for registration to be
reviewed, and for it to be ceased if fees are not kept up to date.
Could the Minister comment further on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue that particularly concerns me is that of the register. Will there
be one register or two? How exactly will this work? When a provider
registers to be updated on a CRB check, will there be one list where
people will be told proactively, and another? I do not quite understand

                           </div>how this will work, so could the Minister explain the procedure? If
there are two lists, will different fees be paid? How will that work?
How is the individual meant to know the difference between the two
lists, if that is the case? I am struggling to understand the
practicalities of how this will operate, so it would be helpful if the
Minister could explain.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000361">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Would it not
be easier if the issue of barred status could be put on the enhanced
CRB check? Then it is clear for everyone to see. On the previous
amendment, we spoke about the problems with employers not being able to
know whether someone has been barred. In its evidence, Fair Play for
Children
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000362">&#160;</a>

71 would introduce new arrangements for informing bodies providing

                        </p>
                        <p>so
it seems that people think there are two

                        <p class="hs_brev">“reactive
and proactive. The reactive option would enable a regulated activity
provider to apply to the ISA to find out whether a particular person is
barred. Under the proactive option, the regulated activity provider
could register with the ISA to be automatically informed if a
particular person becomes barred. Both options would require the
consent of the
individual”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000407">&#160;</a>

goes back to the problem that I think the Government are creating,
whereby an individual employee could withhold consent and put the
employer or organisation in a very difficult position. I do not think
that they would have a remedy against that withholding of consent, and
it would place them in some difficulty. Fair Play for Children said
that

believe both the proactive and reactive options for informing bodies

useful if Ministers could set out how information exchange between

                           </strong> Clause 71 replaces previous requirements in
the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which provided for the ISA
to proactively notify employers, and others who registered an interest
in a person engaged in regulated activity—who was hence subject
to monitoring—that the person had become barred. As we have
discussed in the context of clause 68, that meant that a
person engaged in regulated activity had to register with the scheme
and consent to being continuously monitored. While that was
well-intentioned, the effects were disproportionate. Of course,
employers and voluntary organisations still need to know whether
someone is barred before employing them or engaging them in a position
that falls within regulated activity. We will come on to the duty that
they will be under.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000370">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 71
also introduces new section 30A to the 2006 Act, which provides
arrangements for an interested party to obtain information from the
Secretary of State, on application, indicating whether an individual is
barred from regulated activity. That is the nub of the question on the
change from proactive to reactive: the person has to register the
interest. We think that that is more proportionate than the huge
bureaucracy that would attend to the proactive provision of that
information. I cannot imagine the situation where any employer in a
school would not register to be updated on someone who has become
barred.<a class="bkMark" name="11051064000371">&#160;</a>
