<P>
(a) that he did not at that time, or (as the case may be) has  subsequently ceased to, meet any of the conditions  contained in the following provisions of the Contributions  and Benefits Act, namely   
<P>
(i) section 64 (attendance allowance),  
<P>
(ii) section 72(1) or (2) (care component of disability  living allowance), and

<P>
Question again proposed, That the clause be read a  Second time. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: I remind the Committee that we are  also considering Government amendment No. 334. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies (Grantham and Stamford):</B> When  we broke for lunch, I was saying that whether a legislative  measure promotes good conduct and encourages good  citizenship and social responsibility is perhaps the most  important test of its soundness and justification. The  proposal enshrined in new clause 12 undoubtedly fails  that test. People who have responded to communications  from the Benefits Agency which said, "We are terribly  sorry, but we think that your condition improved some  time ago, before the last review, and we would like some  money back"	, and people who have not argued the toss  and believed that the responsible thing to do was to pay  the money back, have lost the money and will not benefit  from the retrospectivity introduced by the new clause.  People who argued the toss, played for time and defended  their financial interests more selfishly will now be  relieved of liability retrospectively. That is quite wrong. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary said something that I thought  rather grated. It might just have been that he said  something in a facile way during the heat of debate, in  order to try to head me off, and that, on reflection, he does   not want to stand by his words. If that is his explanation, I  shall accept it, but if he really meant what he said, I am  concerned. He said that those people who have paid back  the amounts that have been claimed by the Benefits  Agency are those who can most afford to pay, whereas  those who have not paid back the money cannot afford to,  so there is justice in their being relieved. 
<P>
The assumption is that those who are most reluctant to  pay are also the poorest, that those who are most hesitant  in fulfilling their liabilities are the people who are most  deserving of help. That shows a failure of elementary  human insight, and I am deeply worried that there should  be such a failure on the part of a Minister responsible for,  among other things, the disabled, who are an especially  vulnerable group. In fact, the reverse is often the case. 
<P>
Those who are most aggressive in promoting and  defending their financial interests, and those who are most  unscrupulous in doing so and in avoiding their liabilities  and maximising their assets, are rarely to be found among  the poorer sections of society. There is no reason why  such people should be considered to be the most  deserving. In the perverse new Labour world in which we  live, that is the position created by the new clause, which  might just be based on a lack of proper analysis and  forethought, as is so much in the Bill. If it was carefully  worked out in advance, and if the Government were aware  of these aspects of the new clause when it was drafted,  then it shows a serious and disturbing failure of sensibility  and of political and moral judgment. 
<P>
There is another anomaly. The new clause creates an  informational anomaly something that, in my former  days in the City, was known as a false market, in which  some people have information, on the basis of which they  can deal successfully, and other people are denied the  same information. That is exactly the situation under the  new clause. Those people who knew in February, when  the accounting officer the Secretary of State sent his  instructions to the head of the Benefits Agency, that the  regime was about to change would have known that if  they resisted demands to repay excess benefits within the  terms of the definition then prevailing they would not  have to pay them. Those who did not know about that  communication would have paid in good faith and in the  belief that they were fulfilling a legal obligation. In fact,  that legal obligation could be removed by ignoring it. It  would be curious in any legal system if ignoring a demand  for payment avoided the legal obligation to pay, but that  is precisely what the Government are allowing in their  clumsy or ill-thought-out provision.    
<P>
There was an informational gap. Those who did not  have the information are not necessarily the most virtuous,  the poorest or the most deserving of sympathy and  taxpayers' largesse far from it. One might more  reasonably conclude that those who were up to the minute  in knowing about communications passing between the  accounting officer the Secretary of State and the head  of the Benefits Agency would have been the most  sophisticated recipients of the benefits, or the best  advised. They would have been in touch with people with  professional involvement in the matter. They would have  been close to Westminster geographically,   psychologically or mentally. The mass of the population  is not familiar with such matters and does not follow them  closely. Most people would have thought that they had a  continuing obligation to repay the money, but not that that  obligation could be extinguished by ignoring it. Such is  the peculiar irony of the Government's thoroughly  unjustified muddle it is a double injustice and a serious  injustice. 
<P>
What would we have done if we had been in power?  [Interruption.} I can anticipate the question. The  Minister of State is grinning, but he intended to ask  that question, and has done so in the past. Sometimes,  Mr. Malins, you and your colleague rule the question  in order, but I am not allowed to answer it because I  am ruled out of order, which is unfair. Perhaps, with  anticipation, I can deliver the answer. I would have set  a date perhaps 1 February or, more fairly, a date  further removed such as 1 December and said that all  claims to repay excess benefit before that date were  valid and all subsequent claims would be relieved; if  people in their honesty had repaid money to the state  subsequently, they would have got it back. We would  not penalise the honest and those who deal with the  state in good faith. That is how a fair Government  would have acted.

<P>

<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley):</B> That is precisely  what the Government have done, with the date being  26 February. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> But the Minister has already told me that  people who have repaid money will not receive a  refund  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman  misunderstands. The direction was made from 26 February.  The direction cannot undo what happened before that date,  which is what the hon. Gentleman perceives as an injustice.  We have set a firm date and the change will take place from  that date.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The trouble is that the date is the date of the  communication from the Secretary of State to the head of  the Benefits Agency. That is where the injustice arises. The  Minister told the Committee today that anyone who repaid  money to the Benefits Agency before 26 February I  suggested to him this morning that that was probably the  date and he has now agreed that it is cannot claim it back.  Anyone who repaid that money on 1 February, 15 January  or 15 December cannot claim it back, but demands made on  those who did not pay up and managed to gain time even  though the demands were made at the same time, in the  same way and on the same basis will be retrospectively  extinguished. That is an injustice. Those who dealt with the  state in good faith and with honesty will lose, while those  who acted in less than good faith and were more aggressive  in pursuit of their interests it is false and misleading to  suggest that there is an identity between that group and  those who are the most deserving will be rewarded. That  is absolutely wrong. 
<P>
A date should have been chosen that was sufficiently  far back to ensure that that injustice was eliminated. All  claimants accused of receiving excess benefits after that   date would be treated equally, which is not the case in  relation to 26 February. All claimants accused before that  date would be subject to the previous regime. There are  cases and always have been, I presume involving  people who genuinely do not have the means to pay. Such  people would say that they were bankrupt or that they  would be if the claim were enforced. The amounts would  therefore have to be written off, which would be part of  the continuation of the previous regime. There should not  be a nefarious, and crazy, distinction that works against  those who are honest and good enough to pay up on  demand and in favour of those who do not. 
<P>
The Minister did not want to take advice from me, but  might have taken advice from his hon. Friend the Member  for Blackpool, North  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood):</B>  And Fleetwood. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is very important it is where the fish  comes from. We heard this morning that the hon. Member  for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)  worked for the Inland Revenue earlier in her life. It is a fine  institution to work for it has fine standards, which are  much better than those of this Government. The position of  the Inland Revenue is that a taxpayer who pays it an excess  amount of money will receive a credit or have it set off  against another liability. If I calculate my tax in a way that  is not in my interest if I pay too much money or if I pay  too rapidly I will receive credit for it. If I delay and refuse  to pay money that is due, I will be penalised. That is a fair  system; it is the opposite of the system that the  Under-Secretary wants to introduce in new clause 12. 
<P>
People who pay up should be given credit, not be  penalised. If they are penalised, the principle of good  citizenship and fair dealing between the citizen and the  state is undermined. The citizen will therefore conclude  that if the state has a reasonable liability on him, it is in  his interest to resist it by fair means and foul for as  long as possible, given the cuckoo and crackpot values on  which the new Labour Government's policies are based.    
<P>
I find myself in a quandary. Conservative Members are  in favour of relieving liabilities to pay back excess  amounts of disability-related benefit received in periods  before the reclassification of an individual's entitlement.  That is a sensible principle. As I said on the Floor of the  House, it does not make the slightest sense, in reason or  fairness, to say to somebody whose condition may be  steadily improving, "You were probably improving before  the date of the review or your last medical examination.  We'll fix some arbitrary date perhaps 29 July last year  and we'll say that you improved from that point."	 That  does not make any sense. It is sensible to suggest that no  benefit should be repaid in respect of the period before  the review at which the entitlement was reassessed and  redetermined. We support that principle, and my instinct  is to vote for the new clause and to urge my hon. Friends  to do likewise. However, the Government have, either  through ill-will or incompetence, drafted that perfectly  sensible provision so that it contains unnecessary,  damaging and unjust proposals.  
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The true nature of the new clause emerged only after  my questioning this morning I had to intervene three  times to get a proper answer from the Under-Secretary. It  was not possible to anticipate this situation earlier, and  we are in a quandary that we must resolve. I propose to  do so by supporting the new clause because it will deliver  an objective that we seriously desire. However, I place  on the record, with the help of the Hansard writer, our  reservation about, and our feeling of revulsion at, the  Government's approach, which will penalise the most  honest people and reward those whose dealings may not  be dishonest but which are not marked by the same degree  of selflessness and social responsibility. My strictures  may have brought about private regret among Labour  Members, although machismo may prevent them from  acknowledging that in Committee. If so, our debate will  have been worth while, and I hope that we hear no more  of this nonsense. The Government's proposal is another  example of the moral perversity that appears far too  frequently in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> The Minister of State, Department of Social Security  (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B>  I beg to move, That the clause  be read a Second time. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following: Government new schedule 1  Contributions and Pensions Administration. 
<P>
Government Amendments Nos. 297 to 308. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The new clause will give effect to new  schedule 1. The amendments that you grouped with it,  Mr. Malins, deal with various issues relating to the Social   Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc) Act  1999. You will be familiar with that Act, Mr. Malins,  because you and Mr. McWilliam were the Chairman of  the Committee that considered that piece of legislation  some weeks ago. Several Committee members also sat on  that Committee. When that legislation reached its Report  stage, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the  Treasury explained that any corrections that it needed  would be made in amendments to the Bill that we are  considering. We have now reached that point. We have  identified a small number of technical errors and  omissions. Those minor points, which are immaterial to  the effect of the Act, are picked up in new schedule 1,  which has 32 paragraphs. 
<P>
The Government amendments will ensure that the  references and numbering are correct, that the transferred  functions are treated consistently and that all  consequential changes are picked up. None of those  corrections affects the exercise of the functions as at 1  April. 
<P>
I shall not discuss all 32 paragraphs in new schedule 1,  but Committee members may be interested in a couple of  points. First, paragraph 24 deals with a point that was  raised on Report by the hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford (Mr. Davies). He may well derive some  innocent, well-deserved pleasure from that fact. The  correction puts beyond all doubt the Inland Revenue's  ability to collect national insurance contribution debts in  the civil courts, on which the Bill's original wording  cast doubt.    
<P>
Secondly, paragraphs 7 and 8 of the new schedule make  it clear that the Inland Revenue can pass information held  mainly in relation to the contracting-out of the state  earnings-related pension scheme to the Benefits Agency  for social security and other purposes and, conversely,  that the Benefits Agency can pass information  particularly information on SERPS about social security  and other matters to the Revenue for contracting-out  purposes. That is not a new practice. In the past, specific  powers were not needed for that transfer because the  Department of Social Security could share information  within the Department. However, the provision is now  needed to regularise matters because the contracting-out  functions have transferred to the Revenue. 
<P>
Finally, paragraph 18 will extend slightly the power to  make regulations concerning decisions on contracting-out  matters. The original power permitted such regulations to  cover revision and supersession of such decisions, but not  first instance decisions. Paragraphs 18 makes it clear that  those regulations can cover general matters relating to  such decisions. 
<P>
I should be happy to answer any questions on new  schedule 1. The grouping is large, in part because, as we  have found on a couple of occasions, the amendments will  affect legislation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland  and therefore have to be replicated. They are almost  entirely technical and I hope that the Committee will  support them. 
<P>

Brought up, and read the First time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel (Newbury):</B> I beg to move, That the  clause be read a Second time. 
<P>
I am delighted to introduce the clause. Before  discussing it, I should say that my colleagues and I have  discussed whether the word, "whether"	 should replace the  word, "where"	 near the end of the clause. The two words  mean much the same thing in this context. The  Government may want to accept the clause, but may  prefer "whether"	 to "where"	. If so, I should be delighted  to accept an amendment to that effect on Report, provided  that the clause is incorporated into the Bill today, as I  hope that it will be. 
<P>
Following the Swaddling judgment, the Government  said that they would produce new proposals on the  habitual residence test which, as it was then conducted,  was deemed contrary to European law. I am happy to say  that such new proposals are formulated in the clause and  I hope that the Government will choose to adopt them.  Since the Swaddling judgment, the Government have  introduced new guidelines for adjudication officers on  how the tests should be put into practice. I shall bring  those to the Committee's attention to argue why they are  not sufficient. The new guidelines say that a claimant of  income-based jobseeker's allowance or income support of  any nationality who, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"1. was previously habitually resident in the UKand 
<P>
2. moved and lived in another country and 
<P>
3. returns to resume their previous residence 
<P>
is habitually resident immediately on arrival in the UK."	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 
<P>
That helps to overcome some of the problems with the  habitual residence test, but certainly not all of them. The  guidelines add: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In deciding the habitual residence question the AO should take  account of the length and continuity of the previous residence in the  UKand whether the claimant has sufficient links with that previous  residence to be regarded as picking up the pieces of their old life."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is still relevant to include the new clause, which goes  beyond the current guidelines because some groups of  people who clearly should receive benefit are still likely  to be refused benefit under the test. For example, those  people who might be likely to fail the habitual residence  test immediately on arrival, even after the change in the  guidelines, would include someone who left the country  as a young child and did not have the chance to establish  habitual residence, perhaps because he or she was taken  abroad by parents who then died, moved on or retired  back to this country when the child had grown up. 
<P>
If such a person returned to this country as an adult,  believing that he or she was a citizen of this country, and  was totally reliant on the state immediately after returning  here, it would seem reasonable, logical and fair that he or  she should be supported. One might think that the fact  that such people were not working in this country when  they were young should not be especially relevant to the  case because, according to natural justice, they should not  be excluded. However, it seems that, under the new  guidelines, such a person would be excluded. 
<P>
That is one example of a case where one might wish to  go beyond the current guidelines, but there are similar  cases for example, where people have grown up in this  country and had a period of habitual residence here when  they were young, but have moved away and sold their  houses. Their friends and family move away and they may  have nowhere in particular to return to, but having been  abroad for some time, and perhaps having met with some  misfortune and been made redundant in another part of  the world, they come back to this country an find that  because they cannot be said to be picking up the pieces  of their old lives, they fail the habitual residence test, even  under the new guidelines. 
<P>
So there are groups of people whom we would like to  include among those who have the rights to benefits, but  we cannot do so under the current guidelines even the  new guidelines produced since the Swaddling judgment.    
<P>
Some people might ask what is wrong with the habitual  residence test and why we need to change it to include  more people. There are clear reasons for that, which are  widely supported in all parts of the House, as I hope to  demonstrate. The habitual residence test was first  introduced on 1 August 1994 to overcome the problems  of what was known as benefit tourism, whereby people of  other nationalities might come to Britain hoping to take  advantage of our welfare system. Clearly, we do not want  people to take advantage of our system who have no right   to benefit from it. At the same time, the test seems to have  extended beyond that group and to have excluded from  benefits some people whom we would regard as  vulnerable, who should have the right to claim benefits in  this country and who should not have been excluded as a  result of the test. 
<P>
Interestingly, the Labour party opposed the change  when it was introduced. In fact, when it was introduced  in 1994, early-day motion 311 tabled by the  Under-Secretary, no less, called for the abolition of the  test. The early-day motion stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"That this House is deeply concerned about the effects of the  habitual residence test on both British citizens and those with right  of abode returning to the United Kingdom; notes that the test is  being used to prevent vulnerable people from claiming benefits, for  example, a young mother and her 10-month-old baby now residing  in York who had recently returned from Cyprus to live in the United  Kingdom; and calls upon the Government to abolish this test  immediately."	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That early-day motion was supported by Liberal  Democrat Members and Labour Members, and possibly  by some Conservatives too. The Minister of State was  among its supporters. Therefore, we have good support  for the abolition of the habitual residence test.

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar):</B> It looks like  the hon. Gentleman is on a winner here. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel: Indeed. I hope to find good support from  the Government for my proposal, as it is clearly in line  with proposals that they have made fairly recently. </B><P>
<P>
In a debate on the uprating regulations on 28 February  1995, another Labour Member, the hon. Member for  Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley), who was  previously also a Social Security Minister, said that the  test was a blunt instrument being used to correct a specific  problem. He commented that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government's proposals may take a sledgehammer to crack  a nut,"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I think that is absolutely right 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and the original objective of the habitual residence test may have  been achieved at the expense of the welfare of many British and  there nationals who have come to or returned to the United Kingdom  to settle."	 [Official Report, 28 February 12995; Vol. 255, c. 867.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Withington was right to say that.  It is interesting that two Ministers and one ex-Minister  seem to support the aim of the new clause. He went on to  say that the aim of preventing benefit tourism might be  laudable, but many vulnerable parties were being affected  by what he described as this "sledgehammer"	. 
<P>
The present Minister of State also recognised the  problem. He had two Adjournment debates on the subject.  In the second of those, on 29 April 1996, he said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it soon became obvious that, whatever its original intention, the test  was reaching well beyond the scope of benefit tourism."	 [Official  Report, 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 877.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He further commented: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The worst aspect of the test is that it often hits people who are  already facing a crisis."	 [Official Report, 29 April 1996; Vol. 276,  c. 878.]     
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is an important aspect of the test. As in one of my  earlier examples, someone might have returned from  abroad, having been made redundant and facing a difficult  period in his or her life, and might then be unable to  obtain any form of income. 
<P>
Another well known Labour Member, the hon. Member  for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), called for 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an early debate on the grievous effect of the Government's noxious  habitual residence test and its impact on British"	, 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
citizens, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and United Kingdom nationals"	. [Official Report, 15 February  1996; Vol. 271, c. 1167.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We therefore have good support all round on this matter. 
<P>
As well as being a blunt instrument a sledgehammer  being used to crack a nut the test is a poorly defined  instrument and as such it can often become an  administrative nightmare. The vagaries of interpretation  of the test have led to inconsistent application. The hon.  Member for Withington commented, in a debate after the  introduction of the test: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In practice, the test is proving arbitrary, subjective, complex and  unfair. As there is no definition of habitual residence, several  imprecise and, arguably, inappropriate criteria are used to establish  residence."	 [Official Report, 28 February 1995; Vol. 255, c. 868.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Social Security Advisory Committee was asked to  comment on the introduction of the test before it was  introduced. In the Secretary of State's response to its  review of the test regulations, it was reported as regarding  the test as subjective and difficult to apply with any  degree of accuracy. 
<P>
The test is a blunt and ill-defined instrument, but it is  its inherent unfairness that most prompts our call in the  new clause for its abolition. We reiterate the call that  many have made before us. The Government's own Social  Security Advisory Committee has opposed it, and the  National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux  highlighted its flaws and called for it to be opposed in its  1996 report. The Child Poverty Action Group supported  the case before the European courts and my noble Friend  Earl Russell supported it in the other place. In 1996, the  hon. Member for East Ham, the Minister of State, wound  up his second Adjournment debate on the test by  commenting 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I hope that the habitual residence test will be scrapped"	.  [Official Report, 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 880.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He has the opportunity to scrap it through the new  clause today. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) correctly identified, the matter is close to  my heart and that of my hon. Friend the  Under-Secretary, many Labour Members and others who  are listening to our debate. I commend him on the  thoroughness of his research and I am pleased that my  two Adjournment debates have resurfaced. 
<P>
It is because of the widespread concern that we set  up the review of the habitual residence test that is in  hand and why we are considering the scope for reform.  The hon. Gentleman correctly pinpointed one of the  major problems with the operation of the test its effect  on returning United Kingdom nationals. The figures for  the previous financial year show that more than half   57 per cent. of those affected by the habitual residence  test are United Kingdom nationals and that is the centre  of our concern in carrying out the review.    
<P>
Concern was expressed, not so much by the hon.  Gentleman but by others, that the review seems to have  taken rather longer than anticipated because of the need  to take account of all the relevant evidence, including the  outcome of the litigation and the case of Mr. Robin  Swaddling, which may have a significant impact on the  scope for reform. The outcome of that case has been  helpful. 
<P>
The European Court of Justice recently gave its  judgment and decided that consideration of an  "appreciable period"	 of residence in the United Kingdom  should not be a deciding factor in determining habitual  residence for people returning to this country to pick up  their previous ties. That helpfully deals with a large part  of the difficulty with the test to which we have drawn  attention. It is merely one factor among many in  determining whether someone is habitually resident and  its importance will vary according to the circumstances of  each case. 
<P>
Therefore, we have recently issued guidance to staff  administering the test to explain the position ahead of  introducing our recommendations for the future of the  test, which we shall do soon. I am sure that hon. Members  are looking forward to the results of those deliberations. 
<P>
I hope that it will not be too vain if I draw attention  briefly to something else that I said in my Adjournment  debates in 1996. The Committee knows that I have a  sympathetic nature and I said that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is easy to feel sympathy for the Secretary of State"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
who was then the right hon. Member for St. Albans and is  now the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"who had identified a problem that required a solution. Benefit  tourism certainly was not the largest fraud in the social security  system indeed, it had never satisfactorily been quantified but it  was an undesirable phenomenon."	 [Official Report, 29 April 1996;  Vol. 276, c. 877.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That difficulty remains. As the hon. Member for Newbury  said, None of us condones benefit tourism. People from  other parts of the European Union should not be able to  holiday in the UK at the expense of the Benefits Agency.  The tricky task is to ensure that such abuse is excluded  through regulation, without preventing those who should  have access to the benefits system from having such  access. Several such people were identified by the hon.  Member for Newbury when he moved the new clause. We  are continuing to take on that tricky task and I hope that  we will be able to make an announcement soon. 
<P>
Finally, I should point out that, as drafted, the clause is  technically defective and would not have the effect that  the hon. Member for Newbury seeks. On a more  substantive point, I am not sure that it is permissible in  EU law to refer, as the clause does, to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person...who has the right to live in Great Britain"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
EU law might view such a reference as discriminatory  against those who live in other EU countries. 
<P>
How do we ensure access to the benefits system for  those whom all of us would agree should have such  access, while preventing access by those who may be  holidaying in the UK? That is the nub of the problem with   which we are dealing and about which, as I said, we hope  to make an announcement soon. We support the wide  concerns that have been expressed about the way in which  the habitual residence test has operated. That test has been  improved through guidance issued recently and we shall  make a further announcement in due course. In the light  of such assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will  feel able to withdraw the new clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I thank the Minister for his response, but  I am afraid that it is not entirely satisfactory. He seems to  agree that the law needs to be changed and accepts that  the review has taken a long time. He also agreed that, if  some aspects of the new clause one of which I  mentioned during my opening remarks were tweaked, it  would comply with EU regulations. However, he failed  to give a good reason why such a clause should not be  incorporated into the Bill. Had he guaranteed that he  would insert such a clause on Report, I might have agreed  that it should not be inserted at this stage. 
<P>
If the Government were to incorporate the clause and,  where necessary, to tweak it on Report, the Committee's  wish effectively to reduce the habitual residence test  would be made clear. Therefore, I see no reason why the  clause should not be put to a vote.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</b> I feel embarrassed and inadequate. I have  no adjournment debate, early-day motions or given what  has happened previously decent researcher to refer to. I  want to probe the meaning of the disability income  guarantee, about which the Government have spoken on  a number of occasions during the Committee's  proceedings. It has been welcomed by many groups and  has quite a lot of power behind it as a result. I want to  clarify whether it will cover the groups that I would hope  the Government would recognised should be covered. <P>
<P>
The aim of the disability income guarantee is to provide  additional support to severely disabled people under the  age of 60 who are receiving a form of income support.  Defining what is meant by severely disabled people is one  of the difficulties. My understanding is that the  Government intend severely disabled to apply to those on  the higher rate care component within income support.  Typically, that will mean those who need and receive  some kind of support for care during the night. The  Government have used that as a measure of severe  disablement, although it excludes a number of groups. 
<P>
I intend to probe the Government's reasoning for  excluding those over 60 from receiving the disability  income guarantee. I know that the Government have  introduced measures for a minimum income guarantee for  pensioners in poverty, which is a welcome  acknowledgement of the difficulties that are felt acutely  by such pensioners. What is not clear is whether the  Government have acknowledged that pensioners in  poverty who are disabled have additional needs and   concerns. Those do not appear to have been covered by  the disability income guarantee. I would be grateful if the  Minister would consider how that group of individuals  can be helped. 
<P>
New clause 7 considers an additional group of  individuals who will not necessarily receive the disability  income guarantee. As I mentioned, the premium is paid  through income support, but only to those individuals who  are on the higher rate. Those under the age of 25 are paid  income support not at the higher but at the lower rate.  How can the disability income guarantee therefore benefit  those under the age of 25? The impression given is that  the guarantee is available to everyone under the age of  60. If the mechanism for triggering the guarantee is to be  believed, those under the age of 25 will not benefit. 
<P>
The guarantee does not appear to be available to a  couple of other groups of individuals. Will the Minister  clarity whether it will be available to those with some  form of lifetime savings? Do the Government have any  plans to consider what thresholds might apply? The  Government should consider that matter in the light of  previous debates about encouraging people to save. The  second group is composed of individuals whom most hon.  Members would describe as severely disabled, but who  are not receiving the higher rate that would trigger the  disability income guarantee. Some individuals who are  blind do not need care at night, which is the criteria for  receiving the severe care award, but are clearly severely  disabled and need some sort of support. There is a  loophole in the Government's proposals for the disability  income guarantee because such individuals will not  receive the support that they should. 
<P>
I am worried that the Government are portraying the  income guarantee as the answer to many of the concerns  that have been raised by members of the Committee. Time  and again, when we have queried the abolition of certain  benefits, Ministers have referred to the income guarantee.  When one examines the mechanics for achieving the  guarantee, one finds that those who are over 60, those  under 25 and those who are severely disabled but not on  the higher rate will not receive the support that Ministers  have implied they will receive. I should be grateful if the  Under-Secretary could confirm whether my assumptions  are accurate and say whether the Government are  prepared to reconsider such loopholes to ensure that the  guarantee is really a guarantee for those people, who need  support. These are probing new clauses, but we hope that  the Government will recognise that there are loopholes in  the income guarantee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> In introducing the new clauses, the hon.  Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) explained that he  was probing and trying to discover what the  Government's real intentions were in two regards.    
<P>
The new clauses intend to place on Government a  statutory requirement to consult organisations that  represent severely disabled people about the level of  benefits. In addition, the income support personal  allowance would be increased for severely disabled  people under 25 to the level for people aged 25 and over. 
<P>
The Government already consult organisations that  represent disabled people. Indeed, when the Prime  Minister launched our welfare reform programme, he   promised that there would be consultation and time for  discussion at every stage. We have kept that pledge. Last  year, we set up a new disability benefits forum, which we  discussed this morning. The forum was set up to seek  views on the Government's disability reform proposals,  including the new disability income guarantee. So we are  already making sure that, through the guarantee, we  provide benefits at a level that provides real support for  disabled people. 
<P>
The new guarantee will be introduced in April 2001  and will provide extra help and security for the poorest  disabled people with the highest care needs. It will  provide help through the income-related benefits to  severely disabled people and families with disabled  children who receive the highest rate care component of  DLA. About 145,000 adults and 30,000 families with  disabled children will benefit from the disability income  guarantee at a cost of about 60 million in its first year.  That is one of the reasons why our package of changes to  the disability benefits system will increase Government  costs in the year in which it is introduced. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester asked about people  with savings who do not qualify for income support.  Large numbers of disabled people wil benefit from the  disability income guarantee, but it is intended for the  poorest disabled people with the highest care needs. One  cannot say that those people who have savings such that  they do not qualify for income support are the poorest  disabled people. 
<P>
The extra support will be paid through a new higher  rate of disability premium. At April 1998 rates, it will be  worth an extra 5.75 a week for a single adult or child  and 8.30 for a couple. Indeed, the disability income  guarantee is one of those measures that would be lost to  disabled people as a result of the Conservative party's two  strictures: to retain the status quo for incapacity benefit  while, at the same time, not significantly increasing  expenditure on benefits for disabled people. The  Conservative party cannot have it both ways: it cannot  support those two strictures and hope to find 60 million  to introduce the disability income guarantee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We are not trying to have it both  ways we do not support any of those extensions of  means-tested benefits. We believe that such benefits are  fundamentally misconceived. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> In which case, I take back my suggestion.  The Conservative party clearly does not want to have it  both ways. The hon. Gentleman made it clear that it does  not support the introduction of the disability income  guarantee. 
<P>
The guarantee and other aspects of our welfare reform  programme show that the Government listen to the views  and concerns of disabled people. We have responded with  a range of measures that will make a real and tangible  difference to their lives. 
<P>
Our measures will provide more help to those who need  it most. Those people will be better able to live  independently and with dignity. Although the  Conservative party does not support the income disability  guarantee, that proposal has been widely welcomed.   However, we recognise that there has been some concern  about its impact on younger age groups. I shall respond  to that concern, which was brought to the Committee's  attention by the hon. Member for Winchester.    
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that younger people will  get the new premium, so long as they get a higher rate  care component of DLA. The overall weekly amount that  is payable will, of course, depend on their individual  circumstances, their age, whether they have a partner,  their savings and so on. That is always the case in an  income-related benefit. The premium the additional  5.75 for a single adult and 8.30 for a couple will apply  to people who are under the age of 25. 
<P>
Younger people have a lower rate of benefit because  the majority of them live in someone else's household and  have fewer financial responsibilities. That rate also  reflects the lower earnings expectations of younger  people. It would be wrong for benefit levels to offer an  alternative to seeking work or training, or an incentive to  leave home. We do not think that an increase in weekly  benefit along the lines suggested in the new clause would  be a sensible use of resources, particularly because we are  already giving that group significant additional support  through the guarantee. 
<P>
The fact that the disability income guarantee is aimed  at people who are under 60 does not mean that people  over pension age are being overlooked. We are committed  to tackling poverty among pensioners, and from this  month we are introducing a minimum income guarantee  for pensioners. In addition, as my right hon. Friend the  Chancellor announced in his Budget, the winter fuel  payment will be increased to 100 per year for all  pensioner households. We are responding positively to the  needs of the poorest pensioners in a way that makes the  new clause 6 redundant.

<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> The measures that the Minister outlined  appear to be for pensioners across the board. What  measures do the Government have for disabled  pensioners, who have specific needs in addition to those  of pensioners in poverty, which he discussed? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> They will be means-tested. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman must recognise that  the additional costs of disability, which disabled people  face, are recognised in the DLA, not in the minimum  income guarantee for pensioners or in the disability  income guarantee. Those two guarantees are paid through  income support. That is why the hon. Member for  Grantham and Stamford said, from a sedentary position,  that he will have no truck with improvements in  means-tested benefits and that he does not believe in the  means-tested safety net. I know that the Liberal  Democrats agree with the Government about the fact that  more help is needed for the poorest people, including the  poorest disabled people and pensioners. It is appropriate  to apply that help through the means-tested benefit from  which the poorest disabled people and the poorest  pensioners benefit. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Under-Secretary suggested that the  Liberal Democrats entirely agree with the Government on  this matter. I should have thought that the situation was   clear by now. We have long argued that the poorest  pensioners are those who are not on means-tested benefits.  For one reason or another, they do not receive income  support. They need a non-means-tested benefit increase,  and it is our policy to achieve that.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I certainly cannot speak for the Liberal  Democrats the hon. Gentleman made it clear that he has  reservations about applying the MIG for pensioners.  However, I can speak for the Government and for my  party. We believe that the benefits system needs to be  reformed to provide more support for the poorest  pensioners and the poorest disabled people. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Does the Under-Secretary accept that the  MIG does not get through to the poorest pensioners who  are not on income support, although they are below  income support income levels? <P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point avoids the  question, which is, how does one get benefits to the  poorest people? We are taking action to get benefits to  those people. The only answer that the hon. Gentleman  has is to provide an uprating in benefits to rich and poor  alike, but less money would go into the pockets of the  poor because the rich would get more. The Government  are firm in their view, which is that the living standards  of the poorest pensioners and the poorest disabled people  are too low. We are dealing with that problem. 
<P>
The final requirement of the new clauses that were  moved by the hon. Member for Winchester would be that  benefit levels were uprated in line with prices. However,  what could be more unnecessary and cumbersome than to  include in the Bill in primary legislation an obligation  to require the Government to do what we are already  doing? Indeed, we are going further. The Chancellor  announced that the MIG for pensioners will be uprated in  line, not with prices but with average earnings in April  2000. 
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair] </center></H4>
<P>
With that in mind we should remember that there is  no such requirement on other income-related benefits I  see no need for this extra legislative burden. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester suggested that new  clause 6 will also require the Government to set the level  of benefit for pensioners so that it combines the effect of  the disability income guarantee and the MIG. The  minimum income guarantee already provides for the  whole range of premiums to be paid in relation to age and  disability. Increasing benefit levels on the lines suggested  would not be a good use of resources, particularly, as both  guarantees already provide such significant additional  help. 
<P>
In conclusion, I do not believe that we need the new  clauses, and I urge the Committee to reject them.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> We tabled the new clauses to encourage  the Government to say more about the guarantee and we  have heard more about it. Despite the Under-Secretary's   various caveats, it will not necessarily cover pensioners,  those who are under 25, those with considerable savings  or those who fall into the category of people who need  help and support but who do not qualify for the higher  rate because they do not need night care support, although  they need some support and back-up. The  Under-Secretary failed to answer my questions about  those people and about the blind person who is severely  disabled but who does not qualify for the benefits that  would trigger the guarantee because he does not need  night care support, which appears to be the trigger in  those circumstances. 
<P>
In our debate we have probed and heard more from the  Under-Secretary. I think that I should take some comfort  from his remarks about the under-25s, although it remains  unclear whether they could access the income guarantee. 
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will put my mind at  rest on two matters. First, will someone who is under 25  be able to get the income guarantee? Secondly, do the  Government intend to exclude blind people who are not  on the higher rate? Is there a way to extend the guarantee  to severely disabled people who do not qualify for the  higher rate? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> On the first point, the Government regard  the higher rate care component as a passport to the  disability income guarantee. Those people who do not  qualify for the higher rate care component will not qualify  for the disability income guarantee. 
<P>
I can perhaps give a more helpful response to the hon.  Gentleman's second point and make it clear that adults  and children under 25 will qualify for the disability  income guarantee. That is a higher rate disability premium  paid through income support, which, at April 1998 prices,  provides 5.75 for a single adult or child and 8.30 for a  couple. That will be payable to those who qualify because  they are on the higher rate care component in addition to  the income support that they otherwise receive. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for  that clarification. I think that he is saying that only those  under-25s who are currently on the higher rate will be  able to access the income guarantee. I should be interested  to know how many under-25s are on the higher rate  because I suspect that it is not many. It could be a problem  for the under-25 group if very few fall into that category.  No doubt I can table a parliamentary question to establish  the figure. 
<P>
I shall move on to the second issue of the higher rate  being the trigger. I understand that, administratively, that  is the only effective way to do this, but does the Minister  acknowledge that there will be loopholes in the system?  Some people who are severely disabled do not receive the  higher rate because the sort of care that attracts the higher  rate is not what they need, but they still have severe  disabilities and specific requirements. 
<P>
Using the higher rate as the trigger for the income  guarantee is not necessarily the most effective method.  The Under-Secretary has not given me an assurance that  those who fall through the loophole will have some way  of accessing the guarantee. Clearly, we will not reach  complete agreement on this matter, but we do not wish to  press the new clause to a vote. 
<P>
<B>  The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to  withdraw the new motion? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> Yes. 
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn. 
<H4><center>New clause 8 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Tax deductible pension provisions </center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Inland Revenue notes in relation to pensions shall be applied  in such a way that no amount lost to a person's pension assets by  means of a pension sharing arrangement or order shall be taken into  account in such a way as to limit his entitlement to make tax  deductible pension provisions in the future.'. [Mr. Quentin  Davies.]    
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move, That the clause  be read a Second time. 
<P>
This is another matter of elementary fairness. The  purpose of new clause 8 is to ensure that the tax rules  applied to those who have suffered a pension split are  the same as those applied to people who have benefited  from one. 
<P>
In earlier debates, we expressed our reservations about  the course on which the Government have launched with  pension splitting. We said that if this new instrument was  to be available to the courts at all, it should be available  as a last resort. Unfortunately, we lost that argument. Our  concern is that if pension splitting is to form a regular  part of the criteria applied by the courts in the splitting  of assets and liabilities on divorce, it should be applied  even-handedly. We must not create a situation in which  the party who gains a share of someone else's pension on  divorce also benefits from a better tax regime, which  enables him or her to accumulate future pension assets on  more favourable terms, or to a greater extent, or on more  liberal criteria than the party who has lost a share of his  or her pension. 
<P>
I must insist on using the cumbersome term "him or  her"	 because, although we know that in most cases it  will be a quantitative fact it will be the man who will  lose a share of his pension and the woman who will gain  one, there will be many situations in which the woman  loses and her former husband gains part of the pension  that she has earned. 
<P>
The Opposition entirely reject sexist rhetoric. We reject  extreme feminism, as we would also reject its obverse if  it were articulated. However, it has not been articulated  during our debates. We are arguing for equal rights,  even-handedness and in short justice. 
<P>
Clearly, our arguments must have had some impact.  When we discussed the clauses on pension splitting, the  Government were not at all at ease, and came up with  what they described as a concession. I expect that the  Minister of State, who has in his hand a piece of paper,  is about to retail the same so-called concession which, as  I recall it, was that members of occupational pension  schemes who, as part of the pension split, lose part of  their entitlement to a pension, will be entitled to rebuild  their rights in the occupational pension scheme, provided   that they do so from a salary of not more than 22,000 a  year. That was the extraordinarily arbitrary figure given  by the Minister of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It was 22,650. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Oh, it was 22,650. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I also recall that the figure was  22,650, but we must get to the meat of the new clause,  which is the way in which the Inland Revenue deals with  the capital remaining after pension splitting. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed, Mr. McWilliam. On the one side,  we have the Bill's proposals, which the Government have  promised to modify by introducing this so-called  concession, which is limited to people on a salary of not  more than 22,650. You have a much better memory than  me, Mr. McWilliam, so you remembered the extra 650.  Had the extra sum been 654.62, I do not doubt that you  would have remembered that too. However, I regard the  precision implied by the figure of 22,650 as somewhat  spurious, for reasons that I shall give in a moment. 
<P>
That is one offer that the Government have put on the  table. I trust that I shall be allowed to contrast it with our  alternative proposal, which is contained in new clause 8.  New clause 8 would provide fairness: there would be no  such arbitrary limits, and the rules that apply to one party  would, by definition, be applied to the other. I sometimes  wonder as I did during our debate on new clause 12  whether the Government understand the meaning of the  word "fairness"	. Perhaps they do not, but we do. Fairness  is a principle that is enshrined in new clause 8 a clear  concept couched in straightforward language. 
<P>
In my view, there is no justification for imposing a  particular tax regime on one party and another regime on  the other. Perhaps the Government have decided to  impose on beneficiaries of splits a tax regime that is more  favourable than that imposed on losers because the  beneficiaries are likely to be women, and because doing  so will enable the kind of feminist rhetoric on which the  previous Secretary of State for Social Security was  particularly keen. If so, that is a disgraceful reason, which  we do not accept, for breaching the fundamental principle  of even-handedness. 
<P>
I do not accept the provision; nor do I accept the  so-called concession of the 22,650 limit, which the  Minister of State is doubtless about to repeat. That limit  is no solution because it remains discriminatory. If it were  222,547, or another figure, it would still be  discriminatory, because a limit would still have been set  on the extent to which a person who lost a share of his or  her pension was able to rebuild it. By way of contrast, the  person who gained by the split could, without limit, build  up other pension rights within existing Inland Revenue  rules. The beneficiary of a pension split could receive the  bonus of the pension split on top of the maximum pension  entitlement, whether from an existing or subsequently  acquired occupational or personal pension. That is  fundamentally unfair. The new clause would reject any  discrimination. It is not a matter of 22,650 or any other  figure. Even a multiple of 10 times that would not satisfy  me because it would be unjust and discriminatory.  
<P>
There is a practical reason for the choice of 22,650  being so insulting to people for whom the measure is  ostensibly designed. After an expensive divorce, it is a  major disaster if a significant share of a pension fund,  which may have been accumulated over many years by  hard work, is lost. The question is whether someone will  be able to rebuild it from future savings from income. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
We all know that the lower our income, the more  difficult it is to save from it. It is a fact of economic  theory that the propensity to save is a positive function of  income, but it is a fact of common sense that those with  more disposable income have a greater ability to save  from it. Those with a lower disposable income have little  left when they have met their immediate needs for  accommodation, food and so on, so they cannot save  much.    
<P>
It is particularly cruel for the Government to set a salary  limit up to which it will be possible to rebuild a pension  fund, when that limit happens to be close to the present  average income from full-time male employment in this  country. Only when people's incomes are above average  do they tend to be able to save more than the average  amount or even to save at all. Only people who are  earning more than average will ever be able to take  advantage of the opportunity to rebuild. 
<P>
The effect of the Government's so-called concession is  to tell people, "If your income is below 22,000, or  whatever it is, you will be able to rebuild, but if you have  a bit more money you will not be able to rebuild."	 That  is tantamount to saying, "If you are financially able to  rebuild, we shall prevent you from doing so, and if you  are financially unable to rebuild, you will be allowed to  do so."	 That is insulting to the intelligence  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have had a lot of "yous"	.  Although I could happily regale the Committee with my  financial position, that does not arise from the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, but I have  not been able to find an ingenious way of involving your  financial affairs. I am sure that they would be more  entertaining than the new clause. 
<P>
First, the Government's proposal is inherently unfair  because it is discriminatory. Secondly, it adds insult to  injury to tell people that the Government are arbitrarily  choosing a level of income below which it will be possible  for the loser of a pension split to rebuild a pension fund,  when it is such that they will almost certainly be unable  to take full advantage of that and many will be unable to  take any advantage of it. Most cruelly, those whose  incomes from time to time rise above the average male  level of 22,000 or thereabouts will not be able to rebuild  their pension at the precise moment when their incomes  are high because they will be disbarred by the limit. 
<P>
Thirdly, the proposal makes no financial sense if the  Government are sincere when they tell the public and  Parliament that they want to encourage greater savings,  especially in the form of pensions. Good social and   economic arguments exist for encouraging people to save  in such a long-term and therefore illiquid fashion, but those  arguments will be defeated by this provision. Therefore, it  makes no financial, moral or common sense. We should be  rid of it and replace it with one that does make sense. I urge  the Committee to vote for new clause 8. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Committee members will recall that  Conservative Members put forward two kinds of  proposals on pension sharing. The Gainsborough  amendment tried to restrict, minimise and if possible  stop, while the Beckenham amendment tried to make it  easier, more generous and more flexible. I deduced from  the new clause that the hon. Member for Beckenham  (Mrs. Lait) prevailed in the fierce strife among  Conservative Members on such matters. Having heard the  speech by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford,  I am not sure what is being proposed. 
<P>
The essential problem with the new clause is that it  would put people who had been through a divorce in a  more favourable tax position that other scheme members,  which would be fiercely resisted by the hon. Member for  Gaisnborough (Mr. Leigh) and the hon. Member for  Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) if they were here. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is why they are not.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman pre-empts my next  comment that may be why they are not in the Room. 
<P>
People who had been through a divorce would be able  to rebuild fully, even if that were to take the total  benefits including the portion given to the former  spouse beyond normal tax limits. As all Committee  members would acknowledge, that would be unfair. It  would add to Inland Revenue cost and lead to pressures  for the levelling up of tax reliefs or even the abolition of  the tax limits altogether. Some people would undoubtedly  present it as an incentive to divorce. It would lead to  pressure for the sharing of pensions by all married  couples, which would cost about 600 million a year. 
<P>
The original Government proposal last summer was  that the rebuilding of the member's lost pension rights  should be subject to the usual contribution limits for  occupational or personal pension schemes. In the case of  occupational pension schemes, it was proposed that  rebuilding should be permissible within the normal tax  approval benefit limit appropriate to the original pension,  taking into account the proportion given to the former  spouse. That would have left the divorced scheme  member with the same overall maximum benefit under  the tax rules as all other scheme members. That was a  fair proposal. 
<P>
Nevertheless, we listened carefully to the concerns  expressed, which led to the announcement that I made to  the Committee on 18 March. That proposal remains fair  to other occupational scheme members, as it puts divorced  members in much the same position as early leavers. It  will enable occupational scheme members other than  company directors whose pensions have been shared  and whose annual earnings do not exceed 25 per cent. of  the earnings cap at the time of divorce, to ignore the  pension share when calculating their maximum benefit  entitlement.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  suggested that the figure of 22,650 a year was spurious.  It is not; it is 25 per cent. of the earnings cap, which is  90,600 a year. We are therefore proposing that the same  treatment should apply as applies to people who leave  schemes early. I hope that that make sit clear where the  figure comes from. The effect of ignoring the pension  debit will be to provide more scope to pay additional  contributions to rebuild.    
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be that all  occupational pension scheme members would be free to  rebuild their pension towards the maximum permitted  within the 15 per cent. annual limit on employee  contributions. However, the Government's view is that it  is right to target the easement on those with modest  incomes. I make no apology for that. 
<H4><center>[Mr. Humfrey Malins in the Chair] </center></H4>
<P>
As drafted, the amendment does not appear to help  holders of personal pensions. If its purpose were to  remove the contribution limits for such people, or the  15 per cent. limit for employee contributions to  occupational pension schemes, the Government do not  think that it would be right to create special tax reliefs  for people whose pensions have been shared. That  would be unfair to other pension scheme members  including, for example, people who divorce but do not  share their pension, and it would have potentially large  Exchequer costs. I hope that, in the light of what I  have said, the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw  the new clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am afraid that we do not feel  able to withdraw the new clause. What the Government  have cooked up is not at all fair. It is monstrous that  someone who has been forced under the Bill to hand over  part of his or her pension should then be deemed still to  have it for the purpose of calculating the revenue limits. 
<P>
That is bad enough, but it is even worse that the  beneficiary of the pension someone who has gained  from another person's work record and pension rights  should then be allowed to receive it as a bonus, on top of  whatever other rights to an accumulated pension he or she  may have under the tax laws. I reject the argument that  the new clause would create an incentive for people to  divorce. The divorced couple should be treated as two  separate individuals, which is what they are. They were  separate individuals before they married and they should  be considered as such after they divorce. That is what  divorce means. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the  divorced couple would be treated more generously than if  they had remained married? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Clearly when people marry they take on  a package of rights, obligations and benefits, although that  package is being greatly altered. You would not like it,  Mr. Malins, if I started talking about what has happened,  for example, to the married man's allowance under the  Labour Government. 
<P>
None the less, there ought to be a balance of advantages  and disadvantages in the special regime of marriage into  which some of us have entered. It provides a package of   benefits and obligations. It provides benefits and, I have  to say, some disadvantages under the tax and benefit  systems. People know that when they marry. When they  divorce, they should no longer be considered married.  They are not considered married for any other purpose  and they should not be notionally considered married for  the purpose of their pension. They may find themselves  in the absurd situation suggested by the Minister, where  they are not only deemed married for the purpose of their  pension, but have already given away part of that pension  to a former spouse. 
<P>
The Minister suggests that divorced people should be  dealt with as though they were still married, otherwise it  would be unfair to people who are married. By definition,  if they are not married either because they have never  married, or because they have ceased to be married they  are single people and should be treated as such. 
<P>
Even if the Minister does not want that sensible and  logical principle to be enshrined in the Bill, one would  have hoped that he could have avoided discriminating  between the two parties in a pension split. If he wants to  impose a tax cost on people who divorce, he should at  least say that the cost should be borne equally by both  parties. It is unacceptable that the cost should be borne  by one party, while the advantages are taken away by  the other. 
<P>
Therefore, we cannot accept the Minister's invitation to  withdraw the new clause, It is essential that it, or  something like it, put into the Bill. I am prepared to accept  that a more technically efficient clause could be drafted,  given sufficient time and ingenuity. If that cannot happen  here in Committee, I trust that it will happen on Report  or in another place.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have spent two interesting months  debating what is an extremely important Bill, which  marks a turning point in the development of our welfare   system. I think that I speak for all Committee members  when I pay tribute to you, Mr. Malins, and to your  colleague, Mr. McWilliam, for your able and good  humoured chairmanship throughout our proceedings. This  is the second time this year that I have had the opportunity  so to thank you. On the first occasion, we reached the  corresponding stage in our proceedings after midnight and  I am pleased to say that we are not so late today. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank my hon. Friends for their able and committed  support. Opposition Committee members have sometimes  criticised them for being quiet, but their support has  certainly proved extremely effective and I am grateful for  the keen interest that they have shown, not only in  Committee but during informal discussions of the Bill.  I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for  Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) for the efficient way in  which he organised our sittings and ensured a good flow  of information through the usual channels. It was not  always clear whether some messages got much further  than the other side of the Gangway, but my hon. Friend  certainly did a splendid job and we are grateful to him. 
<BR>

<P>
I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister for  Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities  was able to join us again today. I am grateful to him and  my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social  Security for their persuasive arguments. 
<BR>

<P>
I am also grateful to Opposition Members. We always  enjoyed the vigorous contributions, theatrical cadences  and dramatically claimed revelations of the hon. Member  for Grantham and Stamford, which added welcome colour  to our proceedings. [
{**epHon. Members: "And to his cheeks."	]  That is a fair comment. I am also grateful to the hon.  Member for Brentwood and Ongar for his rather more  succinct contributions a quality that Labour Committee  members particularly appreciated. [Laughter.] His  approach, which was gentler and more probing, was no  less effective for that. 
<p6**} <P>
We are also grateful to the hon. Member for Newbury  and for Winchester for their focused and ifnormed  contributions, which reflected fairly concerns expressed  outside the House. My only disappointment is that, unlike  on a previous occasion, I am unable to congratulate the  hon. Member for Newbury for casting his vote in a  shrewd manner throughout our proceedings. Sadly, he  sometimes voted against the Government, but we are  nevertheless grateful for his contributions. 
<BR>

<P>
I want to thank the staff of the DSS and the DFEE,  who have worked extremely hard throughout. I also thank  parliamentary counsel, the Clerks, attendants, police  officers and Hansard, whose staff had to struggle with  our deliberations at certain points. I pay special tribute to  Alastair Campbell, to whom unexpectedly frequent  reference was made during Committee members's  speeches. 
<BR>
   
<P>
Finally, I thank you again, Mr. Malins, for guiding us  with a sure hand to a successful conclusion. 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friends and I would like to  associate ourselves with the deserved and generous tribute  that the Minister of State paid to you, Mr. Malins, and to  your colleague, Mr. McWilliam. I extend that tribute to  the deputies whom you and he occasionally called to your   Chair. The hon. Member for Colne Valley, for Chatham  and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw), for Blackpool, North and  Fleetwood and for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) presided over  our proceedings with great confidence and charm and  enabled us to make progress. As the Minister of State  said, it has been something of a marathon. We have had  eight weeks of constant work, with one week off for  Easter. If I had served any longer under the chairmanship  of Mr. McWilliam. I would have developed a nervous tick  whenever I felt myself about to use the second person  singular. I think I would have reached the point at which  I would be addressing my wife and children as one, we,  he, she or it. My experience on this Committee might  have had permanent repercussions for my family and  private life, although I think I have survived without that  happening. 
<BR>

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
You, Mr. Malins, and Mr. McWilliam have presided  over our proceedings with great good humour and the  necessary severity, although not too much to exclude a  certain amount of colour and a certain amount of fun. We  have covered fashions in the tie market, Cezanne, and  other more alluring subjects than the minimum fund  requirement or cash equivalent transfer values. I think that  you and Mr. McWilliam had a particular problem in  presiding over this Committee I do not refer to presiding  over myself, which I am sure is not at all difficult but a  great pleasure. In addition to members of the Committee,  two further personalities have played a part in our  proceedings Alastair Campbell, and the much more  delectable figure of Lisa, from whom I hope we shall hear  a great deal more in the future. 
<BR>
   
<P>
I would like to second what was said in praise of all of  those who have taken part in our proceedings. I should  like to begin with my hon. Friend the Member for  Brentwood and Ongar, who played an important part in  our proceedings and shared the burden of speaking for the  official Opposition. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member  for Newbury and the hon. Member for Winchester, who  made extremely well-researched and pertinent  contributions. As a result of Conservative Members being  less numerous in this Parliament than in the previous one,  my hon. Friends on the Back Benches, who have had to  play a large part in our proceedings than would often be  the case. I thank the two Whips the hon. Member for  Doncaster, North and my hon. friend the Member for  Beckenham so much of whose work is necessarily  invisible but contributes to the efficiency of our  proceedings. I also thank Back-Bench Labour Members  we have enjoyed their role more when they have been  participants than when they have been spectators, and I  hope that they have also enjoyed it. 
<BR>

<P>
I should like, not least, to thank the Minister of State,  the Under-Secretary and the Minister for Employment,  Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities. They have  come under a certain amount of fire from Opposition  Members, but perhaps to our disappointment they  have never lost their good humour and cool, nor their  natural courtesy, which we admire and for which we are  grateful. As a result, we have had some good debates. 
<BR>
 
<P>
I want to pay tribute to those who take part in our  proceedings without speaking the Clerk and his deputy,  and also the police. It is easy to be pro-police in this  House; indeed, it would be difficult and unforgivable not  to be, as we are served by policemen not too many  policewomen, sadly who display exemplary patience,  courtesy and judgment. I pay tribute to the Hansard  writers. No one perhaps not even you, Mr. Malins, or  Mr. McWilliam has had to pay such close attention to  what is happening and never miss a word. The stress is  considerable. The importance of their role in providing an  accurate record of debates is essential to parliamentary  life and I pay tribute to them. 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to join other hon. Members  in thanking all Committee members for participating in  our debates and particularly you, Mr. Malins, and  Mr. McWilliam, for chairing the Committee so ably.  I shall not take as long as the Minister and the hon.  Member for Grantham and Stamford in making my final  comments in the Committee because on one or two  occasions some of us have felt that speeches were perhaps  marginally longer than they needed to be. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank the Committee Clerks, who have been a great  help. My hon. Friend the Member for Winchester and I  have relatively new Members compared to some hon.  Members, although I have been in the House for six years.  We sometimes need more help from the Committee  Clerks than some other Committee members and I am  particularly grateful to the Clerks for having given us that  help so ably. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank members of the Hansard staff whom I have  annoyed on occasions by failing to give the correct  references when I quoted Labour Members. That caused  them extra difficulty. 
<BR>
   
<P>
I also thank the other members of staff who have  attended the Committee and helped us throughout. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester. It  is fair to say that we have proved ourselves a totally  united party throughout our proceedings, despite divisions  in both other parties. We have been particularly well  united on the few sad occasions when my hon. Friend has  not been in the Room, but even when we have both been  present, we have voted together throughout our  proceedings, whether in support of the Government or in  support of the Opposition. I am delighted to have such a  happy end to the Committee. 
<BR>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is my first opportunity to say a  few words to the Committee. I begin by saying that my  co-Chairman, John McWilliam, who associates himself  with my comments, has been a tremendous support and  guide to me in the first Committee that I have chaired. It  has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience because the  Committee has been good humoured. Where there is a  good humour, there is life. I thank everyone for that. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank the three Ministers who contributed great charm  and ability to our debates during the past eight or nine  weeks. I thank them sincerely for their contributions. 
<BR>

<P>
I thank the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen for their  contributions, which, of necessity, have sometimes had to  be lengthy. There was a time when the hon. Member for   Grantham and Stamford had a bad back. We were  sympathetic, but we were delighted that the affliction did  not extend to his voice. He was supported by the hon.  Member for Brentwood and Ongar, whose shirts and  braces provided an exciting view from the Chair. I thank  them for their important contributions to our proceedings. 
<BR>

<P>
I also thank the hon. Member for Newbury and his hon.  Friend the hon. Member for Winchester for their  attendance, contributions and thoughtful words during  the Committee. 
<BR>

<P>
Perhaps most important of all, I thank the Back  Benchers. Depending on which side of the Committee  they sit, the job of being Back Benchers in a Committee  can be difficult. On one side they are sometimes expected  to contribute substantially and, as I know to my cost, on  the Government side they are expected not to contribute  substantially, and sometimes not at all. It has been a  particular pleasure for John McWilliam and myself to  hear Back Benchers speak in the Committee who were  free from constraint and always made thoughtful,  interesting and well-received contributions. I thank them  all most warmly. 
<BR>
 
<P>
I thank the police and the Doorkeepers for their help  and efficiency, as well as the Hansard Committee  Sub-Editors and the transcribers for their very fine work. 
<BR>

<P>
My particular thanks go to our Clerk, Mr. Priestley,  who was supported by his colleague, Mr. Fox. It is not  possible for a Chairman to get through a Committee  without able assistance and the very fact that I have  survived is entirely due to the support and help of my  Clerk. There was only one slightly disappointing moment.  One evening, just before Easter, our Clerk's wife and  children found themselves watching him at work. As the  Committee knows, the Clerk comes to the fore when there  is a vote. Therefore, while his wife and family were  watching, it was almost essential that there should be a  Division for them to think that he had any job to do. I sat  here, mentally urging that there should be a vote. His wife  and family were here for one hour there was no vote.  They left wondering whether he had a job of work to do. 
<BR>

<P>
If I speak for much longer, I shall be accused of a  filibuster, so my sincere thanks again to everyone who has  taken part in this enjoyable and worthwhile Committee. 
<BR>

<P>
Question put and agreed to.
