<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000269"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Hood, would you allow me an opportunity to correct the
<i class="I">Official Report? </i>The record shows that I told the hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey that, since its
introduction, the two strikes measure has been applicable to 320 cases
a year, of which 190 have had the sanction applied. I now wish to make
it clear that 320 is the total number of cases to which the measure has
been applied since the legislation commenced in April 2002 and that the
sanction was applied in 190 cases.</div>

<a name="06113060000013"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
54</h4><a name="06113060000004"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Allocations
from Social
Fund</div><a name="06113060000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06113060000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06113060000270"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that point of
information. It is a lovely day in London, but not in my constituency
in the highlands. Sadly, not everybody in this United
Kingdom&#151;long may it remain so&#151;is benefiting from the
weather that we are enjoying here.</div>
<a name="06113060000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me probe the Minister for a
few more points of clarification. My understanding is that the purpose
of the clause is to allow him more flexibility with regard to the
allocation of moneys that can be used for social fund purposes and how
they can be distributed at national and regional level. Does the
measure also give flexibility as to the nature of grants and loans that
may be given from the social fund? If it does not, is that something
that he will look at
again?</div><a name="06113060000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
organisations have made representations to me about whether there might
be a case for making additional types of grant available through the
social fund, over and above those that are currently allowed. I am well
aware, as I am sure the Committee is, that the social fund is cash
limited; it is used for precise purposes. In particular, the Child
Poverty Action Group has proposed ideas such as using the social fund
for a child development grant, payable at key stages in a
child&#146;s life, and a health and safety grant. In the early years
of a child&#146;s life, that might be particularly useful for key
items in the home that are considered essential for a child&#146;s
health and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 566</div>safety, such as a cot or bedding, or for the repair and replacement of
gas and electrical
appliances.</div><a name="06113060000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
organisation has also proposed the idea of an opportunity grant or
allowance to assist claimants in getting back to work, recognising that
additional costs might be incurred in that process. That would
certainly be relevant to part 1 of the Bill. Currently, as the
Committee knows, such payments can be made as discretionary payments
through the adviser&#146;s discretionary fund. However, that is not
formally advertised or promoted, so it is not necessarily known to
claimants unless the adviser makes them aware of it. The additional
option of a specific grant within the social fund may be a way of
getting around that.</div>
<a name="06113060000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of my questions is
to elicit from the Minister whether the clause will give him the powers
to make it clear that additional sorts of grant may be allowable under
the social fund, and whether he has considered those
ideas.</div>
<a name="06113060000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06113060000271"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman
referred to representations that he received. Has anybody mentioned to
him an experience that I have encountered? A number of people in my
constituency who have made unsuccessful applications for a raft of
benefits have been told to go for the social fund. The result is that
the local office in my constituency is often almost inundated with
phone calls at certain times of day. An individual will often have to
try for literally two days before he gets a response on whether an
application may be successful.</div>
<a name="06113060000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000272"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point.
The experience that he described has been shared by some of my
constituents with regard to crisis loans. Both he and I were at the
recent meeting of the all-party group on citizens advice, where
Citizens Advice representatives reported that the experience was common
to people living in many constituencies. The Minister may therefore
wish to deal with the issue of timeliness. Given the nature of social
fund payments, which are sometimes for emergencies, especially in the
case of crisis loans, what steps are being taken to ensure that
telephone lines are answered as quickly as possible so that people do
not have the experience that the hon. Member for Caerphilly accurately
described?</div> <a name="06113060000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within the
social fund, what scope does the Minister have to allow additional
categories of grant or loan? If he has such powers, is he minded to use
them in a particular way, and if he does not, is he minded to take
them?</div>
<a name="06113060000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000273"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> We started in sunshine and, although there have
been storm clouds over my right shoulder from time to time, we end in
sunshine.</div> <a name="06113060000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
delighted to have this opportunity to respond to the debate on clause
54, having spent most of last evening reading the detail of clause
53.</div>
<a name="06113060000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><a name="06113060000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): On a point of
clarification, I thought I heard the Minister say
&#147;reading&#148;, but of course he meant to say
&#147;re-reading&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 567</div><a name="06113060000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000275"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Sorry, I should have said
&#147;writing&#148;.</div>
<a name="06113060000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We turn a little earlier than I
had hoped, therefore, to clause 54. The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is right that the clause provides for
flexibility in the allocation of funds for discretionary social fund
payments. The clause makes it clear that there can be a single
nationwide allocation from which loans may be made, so that expenditure
can be controlled and managed centrally. A national loans budget,
managed centrally, provides all loan applicants in Great Britain with
the same treatment. That is crucial to the fairness and transparency of
the budgeting loans scheme. In particular, it will ensure that all
eligible applicants in the same circumstances will have the same amount
of budgeting loan available to them wherever they live.</div>
<a name="06113060000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the specific
points that the hon. Gentleman raised, as he knows, the social fund
already provides regulated grants for easily identifiable life events
and situations such as maternity, funeral and cold weather
expenses&#151;be the cold weather in Inverness or elsewhere&#151;as
he fairly said. The case for further regulated grants needs to be
considered in the context of increasing personal responsibility without
encouraging worklessness. It is about getting the balance right. For
most people, the main route out of poverty is the opportunity to
work&#151;work that pays and which, if sustained, leads to a
career.</div> <a name="06113060000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman was fair in pointing out that the clause gives a degree of
flexibility within a national budget, which is how we want to allocate
funds in future.</div>
<a name="06113060000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000276"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Minister rightly referred to personal
responsibility, and people&#146;s responsibility to get back into
work, which is, after all, a major feature of the Bill. My point is
that the idea of additional forms of grant within the social fund to
aid that process is at least worth considering. Likewise, in Committee,
he has rightly often referred to the need to tackle child poverty. I
argue that it would be useful, if possible, to restructure the social
fund with perhaps more focus on that
objective.</div>
<a name="06113060000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000277"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course, the hon. Gentleman is right. He shares
our commitment to the eradication of child poverty, to which the Bill
is important. We look forward to his party signing up to the 2020
target before 2020.</div>
<a name="06113060000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raised the
specific matter of flexibility, and made a fair point. He reasonably
alighted on the fact that the clause contains the power to make
different types of grant, and we continue to consider improvements to
the social fund scheme, including possible reforms to the community
care grant scheme. We have said publicly, and I say again for the
record, that we are keen to discuss longer-term reform of the social
fund with interested parties, organisations and Members of this House
and the other place. The power in the clause is generally welcomed and
builds on the progress that we have made on the social fund in recent
years, such as lower interest-free loans and additional funding for the
next three years of &#163;210 million.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 568</div><a name="06113060000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, myself and the
Under-Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friends the
Members for Stirling and for Warwick and Leamington (Mr.
Plaskitt), are keen to have conversations with interested parties about
the longer-term reform of the social fund, and the clause plays an
important part in giving it
flexibility.</div><a name="06113060000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule
6</h4><a name="06113060000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Schedule
to be inserted in the Pneumonoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146;
Compensation) Act
1979</div><a name="06113060000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000278"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in
schedule 6, page 77, line 19, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_brev">&#145;1A A person is not a
relevant employer in relation to a person disabled by a disease to
which this Act applies if the disabled person has had no period of
employment with him which is a qualifying period of
employment.&#146;.</div>
<a name="06113060000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we have come to this
amendment a little earlier than I anticipated, but I and my hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham, East, are as one in our delight that we are
making such good
progress.</div><a name="06113060000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Pneumonoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) Act 1979 provides
for lump-sum payments to be made to people with certain dust-related
diseased caused by their work. To qualify for a payment, a person must
be unable to take civil action against their employer because that
employer is no longer in business. In the Act, that is called the
&#147;relevant employer condition.&#148; It became clear within
months of the Act coming into force that applying the relevant employer
condition meant that most claims would be rejected. The changes that we
are making to the 1979 Act will incorporate in legislation a more
practical version of the relevant employer condition than officials
have been applying since 1980. There will be five circumstances in
which an employer will not be regarded as a relevant employer,
therefore enabling a person to bring a claim. Without the amendment,
those relevant employer disregards that we wish to introduce will not
apply in cases in which all periods of employment with the employer
ended more than 20 years before the qualifying
date.</div><a name="06113060000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06113060000279"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): Plymouth ranks third
in the UK in terms of deaths from mesothelioma, and we believe that the
amendment is useful. The dockyard is a single employer, but there was
also a myriad of other employers, some of which have gone out of
business as the dockyard has declined. This change is very
important.</div><a name="06113060000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000280"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is correct, and we know about
Plymouth&#146;s traditional role in the shipbuilding industry.
Although I do not recall it, I lived in Plymouth much earlier in my
life, because my father worked in the shipyards. I believe that it is
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 569</div>furthest city in the UK from Glasgow&#151;which is an interesting and
relevant point. Things got so bad that we had to find the furthest
point from home.</div><a name="06113060000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend, along with many other right hon. and hon. Friends in the
Government, is determined to ensure that there is a fairer deal for
mesothelioma sufferers. The time that it takes to apply for, process
and receive a payment is still, on average, longer than the
post-diagnosis life expectancy for mesothelioma sufferers. No one can
tolerate that as the status quo. Certainly we in government do not, and
I do not think that it is a matter of party political
disagreement.</div> <a name="06113060000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay
tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone
(Mr. Clapham) for the points that he has raised and the
dogged determination that he has shown as chair of the all-party group
on coalfield communities and that the other members of that group have
shown. Technically, it is an all-party group, but I think that all
those I met who represent mining communities were Labour Members of
Parliament. However, there is consensus that we must go further in
supporting people with mesothelioma to get a fairer
deal.</div><a name="06113060000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In mesothelioma
cases, when all employment with the employer began not more than 15
years before the qualifying date, claims for payments of compensation
under the 1979 Act might be turned down in some cases in which an
extra-statutory payment is currently made. That is not acceptable to
the Government, and I do not believe that it would be acceptable to any
member of this
Committee.</div><a name="06113060000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick
up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth,
Devonport. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions announced in July this year a number of interim measures to
ensure faster compensation for those with mesothelioma, as well as his
intention to put in place a long-term solution to ensure that, wherever
possible, sufferers of mesothelioma receive compensation while alive.
He committed to consulting stakeholders on a long-term solution, and
the formal consultation period ended on 23 November. We are analysing
the responses and next March we will host a mesothelioma summit with
stakeholders to discuss the options for action. We have also asked
officials to carry out a review of the current industrial injuries
disablement benefit scheme, and intend to publish a consultation paper
early in
2007.</div><a name="06113060000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want
to make a wider point on the amendment. I have paid tribute previously
to the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend
the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire), and I am a close
friend of someone who was a colleague of ours, the former Member of
Parliament for Clydebank and Milngavie. He played a pivotal role in
previous Parliaments on the issue of mesothelioma, and again it is
appropriate for me to put on record his determination and the way in
which he kept this issue at the forefront of people&#146;s minds in
Parliament. Often in Parliament, we think that history began when we
arrived in this place. Sometimes we all suffer from that. As I said, we
have announced a review of the industrial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 570</div>injuries disablement benefit scheme, and of course there are related
issues involving mesothelioma and other
matters.</div><a name="06113060000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want
to put on record the continuing admiration of Labour Members for a
gentleman by the name of Jim Griffiths, who introduced the first
industrial injuries disablement benefit. I think that he was from
Carmarthen in
Wales.</div><a name="06113060000058"></a>

was Minister of National Insurance in Attlee&#146;s Government.
Today, workers throughout the country are still benefiting in a very
important way from his determination. It is appropriate, on the 60th
anniversary of the industrial injuries disablement benefit, that we
ensure that that legacy is kept contemporary by acknowledging the
changing nature of industrial injury. I am referring to differences to
do with gender, the changing of industry and the effect that that has
had on industrial
injuries.</div><a name="06113060000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000285"></a>Mr.

comments are received, certainly by Labour Members? He aptly referred
to Jim Griffiths, the MP for Llanelli and a miners&#146; leader
before the second world war, who experienced first hand the impact of
industrial disease on the community of which he was part. It is apt and
fitting that the Minister should have referred to him in the way that
he did. If it is introduced, this Bill will be a continuation of the
ethos to which pioneers of the labour movement such as Jim Griffiths
aspired. We warmly welcome the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="06113060000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

more poignantly, Jim went on to be the deputy leader of the Labour
party. I do not think that anyone in the Committee is currently seeking
that post, but there is poignancy there&#151;and a lesson, because
Jim ended up being deputy leader in opposition, a sober reminder for us
all.</div> <a name="06113060000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given all those

Alexander:</b> I want not to tour through Labour party
history, but to join the cross-party consensus on the importance of
this clause, and the previous clause and schedule, to the righting of
an injustice&#151;in the system for a substantial
period&#151;against those unfortunate enough to be victims of
mesothelioma.</div> <a name="06113060000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether the clause
will deal with something of particular concern to those campaigning on
this issue. I wish to add to the Minister&#146;s list the work of my
hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen), many of whose
constituents suffer from mesothelioma. I hope that the implications of
this clause are that compensation for the condition will be payable not
only to the workers who were exposed to the particles that cause the
horrendous disease, but to their wives, partners, civil partners and so
forth, who may, for example, have taken in the particles while washing
clothes or doing other household tasks.</div>
<a name="06113060000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister clarify
whether the coverage for partners, spouses and so forth will be on the
same basis as that for the workers themselves? What would happen if a
worker had already passed away, but their partner or spouse were
suffering from the condition, which could be attributable to their late
husband, wife or partner in respect of employment as defined under
schedule 6?</div> <a name="06113060000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those few remarks and in a spirit of welcoming what the Government seek
to do, I should be grateful if the Minister answered those brief
points.</div><a name="06113060000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000288"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman fairly draws the
Committee&#146;s attention to the work undertaken by the hon. Member
for Rochdale on this issue, along with many others in that part of the
country.</div><a name="06113060000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Untypically,
the hon. Gentleman has not fully grasped the specific detail of what we
are seeking to do, although not for any unreasonable purpose&#151;he
is not seeking to misconstrue the clause. I shall make a couple of
comments about his
request.</div><a name="06113060000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 58
amends the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) Act 1979,
to which I have already referred, so that civil partners, children of
civil partners, a person who is living with a sufferer as if they were
a civil partner and a person who is living with a sufferer as if they
were husband and wife are included within the meaning of
&#147;dependant&#148;. The clause makes the 1979 Act compatible
with the Civil Partnerships Act 2004, which came into force in December
2005, and was largely unforeseen when the 1979 Act was passed.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley, from

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000290"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We all do, as I was about to say.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 572</div><a name="06113060000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">This important proposal corrects
an anomaly in the 1979 Act in which provision for Scottish reputed
spouses&#151;a man and a woman living together as husband and
wife&#151;was omitted in error. If these changes are not made, there
is a risk of challenge to the 1979 Act because of discrimination on the
grounds of sexual orientation. Whether there is such a challenge or
not, the Government wish to bring the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers'
Compensation) Act up to date to fit in with the wider civil rights and
equality legislation that came into force last
year.</div><a name="06113060000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey mentioned the work of his
hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale, who works closely with my hon.
Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin). They are
parliamentary neighbours and both work hard on this issue.</div>
<a name="06113060000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey mentioned the case of someone who
contracts mesothelioma from a particle from a piece of clothing in a
household environment. For example, a wife&#151;it is almost always a
wife, but I am not trying to make a gender-specific point&#151;may
have contracted the disease by inhaling a particle from clothing as she
washed it or hang it out to dry. Clause 58 does not capture that but we
are looking at the issue in the context of a wider review of how we
treat mesothelioma generally, although that is not the purpose of the
clause. However, it is part of the considerations at the mesothelioma
summit and the work being carried out by the Industrial Injuries
Advisory Council. The clause does not, in itself, give legal effect in
respect of the specific concerns that the hon. Gentleman
raised.</div>
<a name="06113060000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06113060000291"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his remarks. I referred to exactly the issues that he raises
in my maiden speech, and we have moved on some distance since then.
Sadly, we have now lost the constituents to whom I referred then and
still time moves on. He acknowledged how speedy we must be in resolving
these matters, but I hope that he also realises that people need
resolution now. I accept what he says about the March time scale, but
the matter must be settled before more people are
lost.</div><a name="06113060000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000292"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, which is why
the Secretary of State announced interim measures in July and a
longer-term review, the consultation on which closed a week ago. Last
week, with my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone,
I met the entirely reputable and determined solicitors Thompsons, who
made similar points. I acknowledge that even the time scale of March
next year does not meet our collective impatience for an immediate
resolution of the issue, but we are determined to get it right, for all
our constituents who have lived with the disease or who, unbeknown to
them, have the disease gestating within
them.</div>
<a name="06113060000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000293"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I echo from the Opposition Benches the point
made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley. It is critical that the
matter is dealt with as quickly as possible. Will the Minister give us
any indication of the time scales? Does he envisage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 573</div>legislation going through this Session in which it will be appropriate
to include additional powers that are needed to address the point that
he raises? In that way, the legislation can be got through this Session
and we will not need another Queen&#146;s Speech before moving the
matter forward in the way referred to by the hon.
Lady.</div>
<a name="06113060000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000294"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We are determined to find a speedy remedy to this
issue in any way possible. That is why we amended the Compensation Bill
in the light of the Barker case, to right what we thought was a wrong
judgment. We cannot pre-empt&#151;the hon. Gentleman will accept that
this is a fair comment&#151;the outcome of the consultation that we
have had from July to November, but if the outcome is that legislation
would be needed, we will try to implement that speedily. There are,
however, other things that we can do with the insurance industry and
others to see whether a voluntary code would work.</div>
<a name="06113060000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point is that
sufferers and relatives of those who have died from mesothelioma and
related illnesses are right to be utterly impatient. At some point,
they would lose faith in a voluntary code and a set of voluntary
operations if we did not make such provisions work, so we are
determined to make them work. Those comments are not intended to
pre-empt in any way the outcome of the consultation and the
deliberations ahead of the summit next
March.</div><a name="06113060000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000295"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to raise one
or two points that fit appropriately under this clause. Schedule 7
makes minor amendments and amendments consequential to part 4. I would
like to use this opportunity, under your guidance, Mr. Hood,
to raise a related point, which is a matter that should have been
considered under this part and may well be considered in more detail in
another place, assuming that the Bill reaches that stage.</div>
<a name="06113060000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point relates to the remit
of the Social Security Advisory Committee, and hon. Members will be
aware that that is not dealt with under schedule 7. Under the Tax
Credits Act 2002, all functions in respect of child benefit and
guardian&#146;s allowance were transferred to what is now called Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, though they remain social
security benefits, as entitlement to them arises under the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which is amended by
schedule 7. I wish to put on record my point about the importance of
amending the Bill to extend the remit of the Social Security Advisory
Committee to cover guardian&#146;s allowance and child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 574</div>benefit. As the Committee will know, that was the case before the
administrative functions in respect of those benefits were transferred
to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs.</div>
<a name="06113060000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45 am</div>
<a name="06113060000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will be aware of
the important work done on this Bill by the Social Security Advisory
Committee, and those with more experience in the House than I will no
doubt be aware of its important work on many other pieces of
legislation. However, it seems a little odd&#151;to put it
minimally&#151;that its remit has not been extended to guardians
allowance and child benefit as a consequence, albeit it perhaps an
unforeseen one, of the Tax Credits Act
2002.</div><a name="06113060000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Work and
Pensions Committee has recommended that the Social Security Advisory
Committee has its statutory remit extended to legislation that arises
under the Tax Credits Act. I shall not go into great detail at the
moment, Mr. Hood, as I do not wish to try your patience at
this late stage in our proceedings. However, I hope that having brought
this to the Under-Secretary&#146;s attention, she will look again at
the matter and, perhaps, bring forward, or get her hon. Friend the
Minister of State to bring forward, further comment or consideration
when the Bill is considered in another
place.</div>
<a name="06113060000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000296"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is interesting to be asked about a schedule
that is not actually in the Bill, but perhaps I should clarify for the
Committee that those are matters for the Treasury. However, there are
informal arrangements between Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury and SSAC
whereby the latter considers guardians allowance and child benefit.
That was discussed at length during consideration of the Tax Credits
Act. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that that
discussion took place. Obviously, we will reflect further on his point,
although there have been significant discussions already.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000297"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> As the Committee will know, clause 65 gives
effect to schedule 8, which repeals existing legislation relating to
key parts of the Bill, not least part 1. It might seem like some time
ago that we discussed it, but the matters that I wish to bring to the
Committee&#146;s attention relate back to changes consequential on
part 1. The items repealed under schedule 8 include parts of existing
legislation relating to rates, structures and the entitlement tests for
incapacity benefit and income support. I hope, therefore, to draw a few
things to the Committee&#146;s attention&#151;I think that the
Under-Secretary will be responding to these points, for which I am very

<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 575</div>grateful, although, of course, I do not wish to undervalue the Minister
of State&#146;s extensive contributions to
proceedings.</div><a name="06113060000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that the clause gives effect to schedule 8, which repeals much of the
existing structure, we have an opportunity to gain a little more
clarification on some important points to claimants about the existing
structure that will be removed and the new structure that will replace
it. I hope that I have your leave, Mr. Hood, to proceed with
this point.</div> <a name="06113060000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Little
information is given in the Bill about the employment and support
allowance structure, except for the broad shape of the components. As
we know the employment and support allowance is expected to be above
the current incapacity benefit long-term rate. It is currently
&#163;78.50 per week. The support component is expected to be higher
than the work-related components. That raises some questions, and if we
are talking about repealing clear and detailed legislation, we need a
similarly clear and detailed understanding of the
consequences.</div> <a name="06113060000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
the relationship between the means-tested and the contributory strands?
What underpins the difference in the payments rates of the support
component and the work-related activity components? How many existing
claimants will receive more in incapacity benefit and income support
than their employment and support allowance entitlement? We have
debated some of these questions before, but we have not yet had
sufficiently clear answers. The Under-Secretary may not necessarily be
expecting to go back over some of this ground. On that basis and on the
grounds of fairness and reasonableness, which Labour Members know are
two of my favourite
characteristics&#151;</div><a name="06113060000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06113060000298"></a><b class="B">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000303"></a>John

<a name="06113060000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the last new clause on
the selection list so, with your indulgence, Mr. Hood, I
would like to say a number of &#147;thank yous&#148; to
organisations that have helped me during the proceedings. They are:
Macmillan Cancer Support, Citizens Advice, Citizens Advice Scotland,
the Royal National Institute of the Blind, the Child Poverty Action
Group, the Disability Alliance, Barnardo&#146;s, Action for Blind
People, Age Concern, Arthritis Care, Carers UK, Contact a Family,
L&#146;Arche UK, Leonard Cheshire, Mencap, Mind, the Motor Neurone
Disease Association, the National Autistic Society, the
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, RADAR&#151;the Royal Association
for Disability and Rehabilitation&#151;Rethink, the Royal National
Institute for Deaf People, Scope, Sense and, last but by no means
least, Skill and the TUC. It is important that those organisations,
which have helped and which deal with the kind of people whom it is
hoped the Bill will help, are mentioned.</div>
<a name="06113060000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is intended to
probe the Under-Secretary&#146;s thinking, and makes some serious and
genuine points that she needs to address. Under the arrangements set
out in part VIII of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, draft
regulations made within six months of the parent Act need not be
referred to the Social Security Advisory Commission, as per section
173(5) of that Act. The Secretary of State and Parliament are thus
denied the SSAC&#146;s expertise when considering such draft
regulations.</div> <a name="06113060000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
expertise of the SSAC has long been recognised, and was described by
Lady Justice Hale, as she was then, in the case of Howker in the Court
of Appeal as
follows:</div><a name="06113060000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Parliament
has determined that we should have a system of social security benefits
for those who are unable to provide for themselves. The broad outlines
are laid down in legislation but the scheme is necessarily extremely
complicated and requires frequent amendment to take account of social,
economic and (as in this case) legal change. The details have to be
contained in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 579</div>delegated legislation. But Parliament has also recognised the need for
both the Secretary of State and for Parliament to have independent and
expert social policy advice before making changes to the scheme. There
are complex questions involved, about the definition of need, about
equity between different groups, about the right kind of incentives,
all in the context of very large numbers of people and very large sums
of public money. In the context of a scheme whose fundamental purpose
is to relieve &#145;want&#146;, the need for independent and expert
advice is particularly clear when a change to the regulations might
deprive a large number of existing claimants of their
benefit&#148;.</div><a name="06113060000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for the long quotation, but it is important that the issue is
seen in the context of the Bill. Of necessity, many regulations are
made within six months of the parent Act coming into effect, mainly
because they are needed to bring the detail of the Act into effect.
However, the consequence of section 173(5) of the 1992 Act is that the
Secretary of State and then Parliament are often deprived of the
SSAC&#146;s expert views at a critical stage, namely when the new
benefits schemes are being set up.</div>
<a name="06113060000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor Hazel Genn&#146;s
report of the quinquennial review of the Social Security Advisory
Committee recommended that the rule be abolished. She noted that with
more regulations being made within the six-month window, the
SSAC&#146;s ability properly to influence the shape and direction of
the legislation was diminished. She recommended that the regulations
referred to the SSAC within the six-month window should be limited to
those identified at the Committee stage of the Bill as bringing about
significant change. In his response the Secretary of State accepted the
recommendation, but said that an amendment was needed to the Social
Security Administration Act 1992. The Bill provides an opportunity for
that, and the new clause would achieve
it.</div>
<a name="06113060000248"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06113060000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its 19th
report, the SSAC stated about the six month
rule:</div><a name="06113060000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
reported last year that we were still working with the Department on
the implementation of the recommended strengthening of our role in
relation to regulations laid within six months of an Act coming into
force. These regulations remain excluded from our statutory scrutiny,
but we are pleased to report that we have now reached an agreement with
the Department that will enable us to familiarise ourselves with new
legislation and, when we wish to do so, offer informal comments and
advice. As it happens, we shall have an opportunity to test these new
arrangements by reference to regulations made under powers contained in
the Welfare Reform Bill that is now before
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="06113060000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may
therefore be thought necessary to allow the arrangements to be worked
through before implementation through the new clause and the abolition
of the six month rule. That can be done by ensuring that the new clause
does not come into effect for a period of time. However, we should not
miss the legislative opportunity to put into effect the stated view of
the Secretary of State that the six month exclusion rule should be
removed.</div><a name="06113060000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I consider
new clause 15 to be necessary and the Court of Appeal and the Secretary
of State appear to agree, so why was the matter not dealt with in the
Bill? What are the present views of the Secretary of State on the state
of the six month
rule?</div><a name="06113060000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000304"></a>Danny

<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 580</div>Members, no matter how brief a period they have so far spent in the
House, are aware of the excellent work that the Social Security
Advisory Committee does. The new clause is important for the
availability of the committee&#146;s advice across the full range of
primary and secondary legislation. I hope that the Under-Secretary of
State will be able to give a positive response. As we are coming to the
close of the Committee&#146;s business, Mr. Hood, and it
is the first time I have served on a Public Bill Committee, I want to
mention how much I have enjoyed it. I look forward to the

Hunt</b>: May I also say that I have much enjoyed serving
under your chairmanship in the Committee, Mr. Hood, and that
I have greatly valued the constructive discussions that we have, for
the most part, had. I want briefly to speak in support of the new
clause; some of my remarks will be points that I thought I would make
on clause 59, but on reflection I think they are more relevant to the
new clause. The valuable work of the Social Security Advisory Committee
could be very helpful in clarifying some concerns that people have
about the wording of clause 59 in relation to the definition
of care
homes.</div><a name="06113060000163"></a>

<a name="06113060000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000307"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I will briefly conclude my comments. I support the
new clause because I hope that the Social Security Advisory
Committee&#146;s expertise could be useful in clarifying the fact
that people in supported accommodation should continue to receive
attendance allowance and disabled living allowance; I am sure that that
is the Government&#146;s intention.</div>
<a name="06113060000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000308"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow, North-West and Opposition Members about the value
of SSAC&#146;s advice to the Department. We have a very good
relationship with SSAC, and indeed my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State, as well as the Minister of State on this Committee, recently
met its chairman, Sir Richard Tilt, to talk about its role. We
certainly agree that SSAC&#146;s regular meetings with officials
about policy development, as well as its informal and formal scrutiny
of the majority of amended regulations before they are made into law,
has helped successive Governments&#151;SSAC has not just advised this
Government&#151;to make better rules for claiming
benefits.</div><a name="06113060000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I advise my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West that we initially
considered doing what he is suggesting in the new clause. However,
subsequent exchanges between ourselves and SSAC have meant that we have
agreed to maintain the status quo. Nevertheless, we have non-statutory
informal exchanges with SSAC, as he said. For example, in relation to
our deliberations in Committee, SSAC has already seen the green book on
regulations, which has been presented to the Committee and to wider
stakeholders.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 581</div><a name="06113060000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current remit means that it
is not necessary to refer for scrutiny draft regulations made under
powers recently enacted by Parliament. By &#147;recently&#148;, we
mean the long-established period of six months after the commencement
of the relevant powers. Referring such regulations to the committee for
further scrutiny seems to us unnecessary and bureaucratic. It would
threaten the speedy implementation of policy set out in the legislation
that was recently approved by Parliament&#151;and that, in itself,
cannot be right. That is why both the Government and SSAC have agreed
that the status quo is the best way forward, if the status quo can
indeed be a way forward.</div>
<a name="06113060000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Committee has
spent a long time scrutinising the Bill line by line, it would seem a
bit strange if we as parliamentarians were to pass it to an external
body to look at it again. To be frank, given the extensive
consultation, including the Green Paper and the record number of
respondents to it, in this particular instance I doubt whether anything
new could or would be
said.</div><a name="06113060000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000309"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary makes an interesting point.
The draft regulations before the Committee, in terms of supporting
evidence for the Bill, have been seen by SSAC and I understand that it
has commented on them. May I ask whether she is willing to deposit in
the Library of the House those comments on the draft regulations, so
that Parliament might also have the benefit of that
wisdom?</div><a name="06113060000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000310"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> My understanding&#151;I stand to be
corrected&#151;is that the relationship between SSAC and the
Department is one of confidentiality and SSAC&#146;s advice is given
in that context. Such advice is freely given, but it is of a
confidential nature. However, if there is anything that we feel we can
put into the public domain&#151;let us remember that that decision is
not just our responsibility, as SSAC has its own terms of engagement
with us, which are that its advice should be confidential&#151;I
obviously will pursue that. I hope that hon. Members understand that,
if the relationship between SSAC and the Department is to be productive
and fruitful, it needs to be maintained in that context of trust and
confidence. Of course, we have a similar relationship with the
Disability Employment Advisory
Committee.</div><a name="06113060000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
although I understand the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Glasgow, North-West, who has made a reasonable case for the new
clause, we think that the new clause is not appropriate. Parliament has
the opportunity to scrutinise legislation and we have scrutinised the
new clause in this Committee and do not see any need&#151;neither
does the SSAC&#151;to change the current situation. I ask him to
withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="06113060000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000311"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her comments. I will
take advisement on what she has said. At this time I will withdraw the
new clause, but I reserve the right to come back to it at a later stage
if the advice is that what she has said is not all together
factual.</div>

Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of order&#151;it is
debatable.</div><a name="06113060000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000314"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The fact that it is a point of order is debatable?
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="06113060000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000315"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have had a wonderful time in this Committee
and I am sure that we will end it in order. The question that I have
just proposed to report the Bill to the House is
debatable.</div><a name="06113060000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000316"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will allow the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
to go
first.</div><a name="06113060000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000317"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, whose generosity
has been a mark of this Committee. I also thank the Under-Secretary of
State and other hon. Members on the Government Benches. The Committee
has been a novel experience for me, Mr. Hood, and not just
because of serving under your excellent chairmanship. I speak for the
official Opposition in thanking you greatly for your courtesy and for
the excellent way in which you have regulated proceedings.
</div><a name="06113060000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until this Committee,
we have not always seen eye-to-eye with Government Front Benchers on
what is an extremely important public policy area. We all know that
welfare issues are rapidly going up the political agenda for all
parties, as has the language of social justice and of getting a better
deal for, yes, customers who are vulnerable people, but who do not want
to be seen as vulnerable. Those people have a contribution to make.
They want to work, to get over their disability and to make a
contribution for themselves, their families and indeed for the rest of
society and the local community.</div>
<a name="06113060000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a hugely important
area. Therefore, I was wondering how proceedings in Committee would go.
Our party was particularly keen to demonstrate that it has indeed
changed and that we have different ways of looking at some thorny
problems regarding the general area of social justice, which is at the
heart of the Bill. I have been particularly pleased that our spirit of
honest inquiry and our fresh approach have been met with courtesy and
respect by Ministers. It would have been easy for Government Members to
make a large number of points that the Conservative Opposition had got
this or that wrong, or that our views and change of stance were
ineffective or lacking in some way. During these proceedings, I have
been greatly heartened by the democratic process. We have had a
grown-up, interesting and technically impressive debate and we have
teased out quite a few issues that many people watching and reading the
proceedings have wanted to hear more about. In that spirit of optimism
and hope, I congratulate you, Mr. Hood, and the future
Opposition on the Government side.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 583</div><a name="06113060000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, and most importantly,
we must remember the huge debt we owe to Government officials, the
Clerks, <i class="I">Hansard</i> and all the parliamentary support staff and
advisers, without whom this act of democracy&#151;the scrutiny of the
Bill in Committee&#151;could not have taken place. They work at all
hours when we are not sitting. We have had a good few sessions of
democracy and I thank all
concerned.</div><a name="06113060000249"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000318"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> May I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
sentiments, particularly in respect of your wise council,
Mr. Hood, in chairing our debates? I should also make the
same remarks in relation to Mr. Amess, who is not with us
today but who has chaired several sittings during the preceding
months.</div><a name="06113060000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000319"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I had to give the hon. Gentleman something to
do.</div><a name="06113060000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000320"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> As a new Member of Parliament who has taken a
full part in these proceedings, I have been grateful for guidance from
you, Mr. Hood, and from Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="06113060000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
an interesting political side-effect of this Committee, although
perhaps I should not mention it. A newspaper article that I read the
other day used the phrase, &#147;new skin, same old reptile&#148;.
That would not be an appropriate description of the hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds. However, it has been interesting to see the old
Conservative party working hard to fit with the new veneer that is the
modern Conservative
party.</div><a name="06113060000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000321"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That is fighting talk&#151;outside now! The
hon. Gentleman is not as bright as these proceedings have
shown.</div><a name="06113060000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000322"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Those are churlish
remarks.</div><a name="06113060000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000323"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> You started
it.</div><a name="06113060000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000324"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I shall attempt to rescue the Committee
from
itself.</div><a name="06113060000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000325"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I wanted to say that there has been a
remarkable spirit of consensus. I concur with the hon. Member for Bury
St. Edmunds: we have had high-quality debates and useful exchanges. In
many cases, we have solicited from Ministers useful clarification that
has been important for the many organisations outside the House that
pay close attention to our proceedings. I am grateful for the support
of some of those, in terms of research and briefing, not least the
Disability Rights Commission, the Child Poverty Action Group, Citizens
Advice, Shelter and many other disability charities that the hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West listed under a previous new clause. I do
not intend to repeat that list&#151;merely to echo the compliments
that he passed to those worthwhile, important
organisations.</div><a name="06113060000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It only
remains for me to echo other hon. Members&#146; remarks in respect of
Government officials, the Clerks, and all the other servants of the
House, who have made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 584</div>our proceedings so procedurally flawless and allowed it to progress with
great smoothness. Of course, I thank <i class="I">Hansard</i> as well for the
transcriptions of our debates, which are also of great use to those
outside the
House.</div><a name="06113060000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000326"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I do not want to repeat comments made by my hon.
Friends and colleagues on the Opposition Benches, but it would
inappropriate for us to conclude these proceedings without thanking the
hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire for his silent contribution,
which has no doubt stood the Minister in good
stead.</div><a name="06113060000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should just
like to make a serious point, on which I hope that the Government will
reflect. Our proceedings have been good. This is an opportunity for the
Government to consider whether it would be possible to introduce more
radical welfare reform policies to the House during this Parliament.
There is widespread agreement on the need to simplify the benefits
system and to make further progress in the direction that the Bill
seeks to go, and I think that the Government would find that the
Opposition welcomed such moves, should they choose to do so. I hope
that they will reflect on that and I hope that the progress that we
have made on legislation in this Committee is the harbinger of even
more important legislation to
come.</div><a name="06113060000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000327"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We have five minutes, and I shall obviously do my
utmost to conclude my comments in that time. Were I not to do so, I
would not anticipate a busy 16th sitting.</div>
<a name="06113060000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you, Mr.
Hood, and Mr. Amess for the way in which you have overseen
the 15 sittings of the Committee. You each brought your own style to
the proceedings. As you will be aware, Mr. Hood,
Mr. Amess introduced a new initiative by successfully
filibustering from the Chair, enabling the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds to find his speaking
notes.</div><a name="06113060000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000328"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On a point of information, I have never lost my
speaking notes. It was another member of the Front Bench whose name I
cannot remember.</div>
<a name="06113060000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000329"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is of course correct&#151;it
was the hon. Member for South-West Surrey who lost them. I congratulate
you, Mr. Hood, on not attempting a similar filibuster this
morning when the hon. Member for South-West Surrey sought, not to find
speaking notes, but the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, who, in his
dual role as a Front Bencher and as the Opposition Whip, allowed
himself time out of the Committee when he was due to be addressing
us.</div><a name="06113060000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000330"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On a point of information, the consensus has
really broken down&#151;I was out of the Room by prior
agreement.</div>
<a name="06113060000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06113060000331"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> By prior agreement, I assume, with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s Whip, who, of course, is
himself.</div><a name="06113060000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">You have
allowed a wide-ranging debate, Mr. Hood, and the last few
moments have been typical of that. We have had the opportunity not only
to discuss Jim Griffiths, Winston Churchill, Karl Marx, Josef Stalin,
Bonnie Prince Charlie, St. Joseph, St. Luke and many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 585</div>other saints, but Slaithwaite Dave, Sheffield Dave, Derbyshire Dave,
Tunbridge Wells Tim, and all sorts of other characters&#151;real or
imagined.</div> <a name="06113060000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, the Minister with responsibility
for disabled people, who has done a fantastic job on local housing
allowance and other important parts of the Bill. There has already been
testimony to the interesting and fascinating nature of the debate,
though the debate was not interesting enough for the hon. Member for
Yeovil to attend very often. In the same way that the Under-Secretary
and I have offered to write to hon. Members, I wonder if he would be
kind enough to send us all a
photograph.</div><a name="06113060000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay
tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East, who has
served not just as the Whip but as the Vice-Chamberlain of Her
Majesty's Household. Not only has he ensured that we kept good time,
but he has enabled us to finish a whole sitting early. Members from all
sides played a full and active part in the Committee. I also thank my
hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Devonport, for Glasgow,
North-West, for Colne Valley, for North-East Derbyshire, for
Caerphilly, for Dumfries and Galloway and for Ochil and South
Perthshire. In an earlier sitting the hon. Member for South-West Surrey
confused my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire with
my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway, which reminds me
of the story of the former Labour Chancellor Hugh Dalton, whose image
was that of a &#147;Hail fellow, well met&#148; kind of man. He had
a great habit of walking up to people, slapping them on the back and
welcoming them as his best friend, and then calling them by the wrong
name. The hon. Gentleman probably considers himself more of a Timothy
Dalton than a Hugh Dalton. Nevertheless, I am sure that the analogy is
pertinent in many ways.</div>
<a name="06113060000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all those who ensured
that the Bill was well crafted. I thank the police, the officials, the
Bill team, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 586</div>the stakeholders who played such an important role in ensuring that we
were all well informed, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> staff, the attendants, the
Clerks and the many others who made the Bill possible. The Bill is
crucial, and it will help to change many people&#146;s lives. It will
change the nature of welfare and will transform opportunities for many
who have been denied such opportunities in the
past.</div><a name="06113060000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I know
that at the end of the Committee stage it is traditional to retire to
the bar, but even though it is St. Andrew&#146;s day, that is not an
invitation that I could extend with any confidence to my hon. Friends,
so perhaps I might encourage them to adjourn to the Tea Room instead.
With that, Mr. Hood, I thank you and Mr. Amess,
and all those who made our proceedings as interesting and productive as
they have been, and allowed them to be concluded in such good
time.</div><a name="06113060000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
twenty-five minutes past Ten o&#146;clock, </i><defanghtml_span class="SmallCaps">The
