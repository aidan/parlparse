and Referendums Bill</a></center></H3>

<H4><center>Schedule 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Control of donations to recognised third parties</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Tenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): It may be difficult for the Parliamentary Secretary to assure us that the schedule will operate satisfactorily, but I hope that he will do so. It contains some extremely detailed provisions about the control of donations to third parties. Last night, when I re-read it, it appeared to need no amendment, which is always a source of anxiety. Usually, when one fails to raise objections in Standing Committee about detailed legislation, one can be pretty sure that one has done something wrong. I did not want to let the schedule pass on the nod, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will say a word or two about it.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privay Council Office </B>(Mr. Paddy Tipping): The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has done his duty: he read the schedule late last night and is anxious about the fact that he cannot find anything in it to amend, so he rushed to the Committee Room and raised a blanket concern that will cover him for ever and a day.
<P>
The schedule mirrors the earlier schedule that dealt with the control that political parties have over donations. The hon. Gentleman may have covered the substantive ground already. He asked whether the schedule will work--we shall use our best endeavours to ensure that it will, and the matter will be reviewed by the Electoral Commission.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 10 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 89</center></H4>
<H4><center>Returns as to controlled expenditure</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I seek some clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of returns. The clause probably mirrors earlier provisions relating to political parties.
<P>
When we discussed controlled expenditure by third parties, I said that I was concerned about the difficulty that the Electoral Commission will have in policing the  provisions. My eye was caught by subsection (3)(a), which relates to invoices and receipts. The provisions relate to an organisation that is not a political party, but which has engaged in a form of political activity that we want to control to a lesser or greater extent. That will ensure that elections are seen to be fair, clean and upfront and to involve a degree of financial propriety. Those organisations are detached or semi-detached from the electoral process in not being either candidates or political parties. However, there will be a requirement that all invoices and receipts relating to payments should accompany the return. We know what the time limits are for those returns. Realistically, how will the Electoral Commission be able to police all the Bill's provisions? Clearly, third parties should make a return of their expenditure. The Electoral Commission should be satisfied that the limits set out in the Bill have not been exceeded, and that donations have not been received from sources that are not permissible.
<P>
We shall think about organisations when we discuss clause 90, and auditors' reports. For expenditure of less than £250,000, should the Electoral Commission have to police such a detailed return? A return on expenditure under £250,000 will not be accompanied by an auditor's report. It will therefore be incumbent on the Electoral Commission to rummage through the invoices and receipts to make sure that everything is correct. The Electoral Commission will be burdened with a lot of work and expense, and I wonder whether that is necessary if the Electoral Commission is satisfied that the organisation has conducted its affairs correctly. Clearly, if a subsequent investigation were to take place, because the Electoral Commission was not satisfied, in relation to a particular election, that the organisation's affairs had been conducted correctly, it could investigate and examine invoices and receipts and other evidence of payment.
<P>
Under clause 90, auditors will have to satisfy themselves about those organisations that incur significant expenditure in an election. In the case of those organisations that incur more than £10,000, but less than £250,000, do the initial requirements in relation to making a return to the Electoral Commission need to be as onerous?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It is important to recognise that third parties come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. The examples given by the Neill committee were Unison, which is a large trade union with a large turnover, and Tate and Lyle, which is company with a large turnover. In both of those examples, returns could easily be provided in the necessary detail. They would, of course, be recognised third parties, to which clause 89 relates.
<P>
Earlier in our proceedings, we discussed the de minimis provisions. The small person whom we discussed this morning, who might have a duplicator or printing press, might not reach the figure of £10,000 and therefore might not be subject to onerous responsibilities. One of the issues that we discussed this morning was that of an invoice for every good. The Committee appeared to be satisfied with a figure of £100. Therefore, the onus on a small organisation third party that does not have to register will be fairly minimal. The roles and responsibilities of the Electoral Commission are spelt out in part I, which will be debated on the Floor of the House on Monday. Clause 8(3)(a) allows the commission to act in a more proactive way and to provide, on request, a whole range of advice, including, under paragraph (iv), to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"recognised third parties within the meaning of Part VI".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) is asking me a more general question about whether the commission's regime will involve a heavy or a light touch. I hope that the commission will consider the big, important issues. I suspect that the returns that small registered third parties have to supply will be fairly low down on its the list of priorities, and that it will become involved only if complaints and allegations are made.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman with my comments about the de minimis provisions and the Electoral Commission's relatively light touch in respect of small third parties.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 89 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 90 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 91</center></H4>
<H4><center>Submission of returns</center></H4>
to the Commission
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> No amendments to the clause have been tabled.
<P>
However, I note that subsection (4) contains another criminalising provision, and ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have regard to that when he considers the points that we raised this morning. The provision is slightly different in its scope, because it places obligations on the responsible person, who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"commits an offence if he...fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) in relation to any return or report".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear from those provisions that the person has to deliver a report to the commission. While the reasonable excuse defence should not necessarily be inserted at the end of the clause, it should appear at some point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We are following a well-trod path. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's comments, and my earlier remarks, I think that the way forward is to add the words "without reasonable excuse" to clause 91(4), and we shall do so on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 91 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 92 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 93</center></H4>
<H4><center>Public inspection of returns</center></H4>
under section 89
<P>
 Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I rise to reiterate my earlier comments about public accessibility to returns that are made to the commission. I seek clarification on two matters. First, will facilities be made available for the inspection of all the records that are submitted to the commission in locations other than London? We hope that these returns will also be available electronically, so that people can access them from anywhere in the United Kingdom.
<P>
4.45 pm
<P>
My second point also echoes an earlier point that I made. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and I are not in favour of special provisions for Northern Ireland, I assume that donations in a donation report to a registered third party operating in Northern Ireland would be a matter of public record and that people who had made donations would be identifiable in the same way as if they had made donations to a political party on the mainland under previous clauses. Therefore, although we do not support an exemption for Northern Ireland, there appears to be an anomaly in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Returns will be available for inspection in places other than London. The intention is that the commission will also have offices in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and that members of the public will be able to inspect the returns there. The question of whether the returns will be electronically accessible will be an operational matter for the commission. I should be surprised if they were not, but, again, I cannot pre-empt the commission's decision.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asks us to return to the question of Northern Ireland. We had a lengthy debate on clause 63, which makes special provision for Northern Ireland. Third parties are not covered by any order that the Secretary of State makes about political parties in Northern Ireland. Donations would have to be declared to be open and transparent, but not in the detail that might involve a subsequent invasion of privacy. My recollection is that the amount, the date and the name of the person making the donation will be on the register. If I am wrong about that, I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 60, line 22, after 'on', insert 'either the first or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 80, in page 60, line 26, after 'form', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'including any form of electronic transmission'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I freely admit to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a small point in a big Bill, but it is a matter that is close to my heart, In a previous existence, I spent a good deal of time giving advice--I was about to say "training", but perhaps "advice" is a safer word--to those who thought that they might be agents in local government and other elections. The amount of time that I spent in those advice sessions and subsequent feedback sessions persuading people to make sure that they had imprints on their literature was  considerable, and the number of times that the advice--the training--was thought to be not sufficiently important to implement was spectacular.
<P>
Therefore, I was dismayed to find that the Bill requires that any literature that is sent out should have what I think is commonly called an imprint on the last page.  My amendment would require an imprint to appear on the front of the document or the last page because, in a number of cases, reference to the "face" of the document in the Representation of the People Act 1983 has been interpreted to mean the front or the back of the document. I did not want my training to go to waste, and I hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary might take pity on me and the hundreds of thousands of people who commission printing, and who have been trained resolutely to get their imprint on the face of the document. I hope that he will allow the precise wording to be retained or accept my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are also considering amendment No. 80, should he wish to make a point about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Indeed, I do. Amendment No. 80 is not based on advice that I received, which, on the whole, was technophobic. It would add to the clause the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'including any form of electronic transmission',
<P>
and would ensure that electronic transmission could not be used as an excuse for a document's failure to convey its origin clearly on the front. Of course, one could not convey that information on the back of an electronically produced document.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): On the first point that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) made, I am always glad when he stays in east Cheshire. That is where he belongs, but his training session should have included Liberal Democrats in west Cheshire. I noticed that error, and warned his colleagues of their omission.
<P>
We must consider the issue carefully, particularly given that all three parties place trifold leaflets in windows. The clause must make it clear that imprints must appear on documents that will be displayed in windows.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary may rightly feel that, according to case law, the word "published" should include matter published on the internet, but we need to be more specific. To the best of my knowledge, case law does not extend to straightforward e-mail. Given the significant impact that mass e-mailing will have on future elections, the principle behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove should be considered carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Amendment No. 80 would insert after the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In this section 'publish' means publish in any form"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'including any form of electronic transmission'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should point out that the clause's existing reference to "any form" means precisely that, so the amendment is unnecessary. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston takes a close interest in these matters--
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Too close.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend says that he takes too much interest. We are confident that the word "publish" has a sufficiently wide meaning to include electronic forms. However, he is night to take the matter further by saying that there are particular problems relating to the internet and videos. Promotional videos may be the coming thing if one wants to appear presidential, although I should be careful what I say. Having a video director and monitoring one's home activities could be a new technique. It has, I understand, already been used, so there is a need for more work to be done here. I do not accept amendment No. 80 because it is unnecessary in the sense that was intended, but we shall look again at the Bill and try to widen its scope.
<P>
I, too, have run training sessions and it is amazing how unsuccessful one can be. It is a good job that I was not on performance-related pay. I had the same experience as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. One of the things that one chisels into the ten commandments is that the imprint must go on. It is amazing how often that does not happen. I spent an enjoyable afternoon yesterday looking at some literature produced by the Liberal Democrats. This part of the Bill relates not only to electoral material, but to other material as well. I noticed that the Liberal Democrats' manifesto had the imprint on the back page, and was therefore within the law.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove reminded us that reference the "face" of the Bill appears in the Representation of the People Act 1983. I had forgotten that. I had also forgotten the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), which is that a trifold election leaflet often contains a request on one of the folds saying, "Please display this in your window." There has been controversy about whether the imprint should appear on that fold, because it is a poster as well as a leaflet with a traditional imprint.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that that was a small point within the scale of the Bill. In view of his hopeless view of training, and my sad lack of success--my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) will reassure me that we are approaching the end of our deliberations--I shall take an optimistic view of the matter. I shall not accept the amendment now,but I shall reflect on it and come back to it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> We have all been there, have we not, Mr. Maxton?
<P>
Following the assurances of the Parliamentary Secretary, however wobbly they may be, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> At the risk of singing a different tune at the end of our deliberations, perhaps I can get some clarification about the offence covered by clause 94(6)? My reading of that suggests that the Parliamentary Secretary is unlikely to tinker with the provision, as it appears to be an absolute offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983 as much as it does in the Bill--that is, if one printed or published something  in a way that contravened the provision, one would be guilty of an offence and would be unable to advance a defence of reasonable excuse. Will the Parliamentary Secretary clarify that before we move on, or will he write to me at a later date? I see no exemption in the Representation of the People Act; it is simply defined as an illegal practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I think that that is the case, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 94 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Sutcliffe.]<P>
