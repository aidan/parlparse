Amendment proposed [30 October]: No. 136, in page 12, leave out lines 10 to 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) below, subsection (1) above shall not make any finding of fact or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or on which is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further decision.<P>

<P>
	(3) Regulations shall provide a determination that a person is capable or incapable of work for the purpose of one relevant benefit shall be conclusive for the purpose of his entitlement to another relevant benefit.
<P>
	(4) For the purpose of subsection (3) above, ``relevant benefit'' shall have the same meaning as for section 9 above.'.--[Mr. Webb.]
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): Thank you, Mr. Gale, and welcome to the Committee. I am sure that, under your expert guidance, we shall make the progress that I know everyone wants to make in our deliberations on the Bill.
<P>
On amendment No. 136, clause 18 re-enacts section 60(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It ensures that, as now, decisions that are made by the Secretary of State will be final unless they are specifically revised or superseded under the provisions of clauses 10 or 11 or appealed under clause 13. It also allows regulations to be made to specify cases in which findings of fact or other determinations which are the component parts of a decision are to be made final for other purposes. We do not intend to regulate as yet for the majority of such findings and determinations to be final--only the incapacity for work test will be final for all benefits.
<P>
The amendment would prevent findings of fact, other than findings of incapacity for work, from being conclusive for the purposes of other decisions. I should explain that we intend to retain provisions in regulations that findings or determinations on incapacity for work--such as the all work test--should be conclusive for the purposes of subsequent decisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) raised concerns about different rules applying to claims for jobseeker's benefit and incapacity benefits, but I want to make it clear that the problems that he mentioned should not arise. If he becomes aware of specific cases in which they do, however, I would of course be happy for him to write to me with any information. I would then ensure that the matters were properly investigated.
<P>
Similarly, the hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the habitual residence test. Clearly, if someone fails the test, he will not be entitled to those provisions that relate to it at the point of the claim. That does not, however, apply to all benefits. Obviously, the person can make a fresh claim for benefits once he believes that he has established the right to abode in this country. Such a claim would be treated as a fresh claim and the decision on it would flow to other benefits. There should not be the confusion that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
There are, of course, other examples of findings or determinations that are made in one context, which it would be desirable to make final for other purposes. The information technology is, however, not in place to enable the necessary read-across between the different benefits and business areas with which the Department deals. At the moment, such a read-across could be achieved only with disproportionate effort on the part of the Department or the public. As technological developments occur, however, we expect to be able to read across far more often, which will enable us to collect information from customers only once.
<P>
A further effect of the amendment would be to limit the scope of finality to relevant benefits only. The Government would, in due course, prefer findings to be made final for the purpose of all relevant decisions. The Government want to build in flexibility and do not want such requirements to be included in the Bill. The amendment would prevent us from responding to technological advances and making further improvements for customers. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb (Northavon):</B> I am reassured by the Minister's saying that the absurdity which we discussed on Thursday--people being transferred from one benefit to another and finding that they fall between all stools--is being dealt with and that the proposed regulations will explicitly provide that incapacity for work should be treated as final. I still have concerns about the implications of some other decisions being made final, but they are insufficient to make me force a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Matters arising as respects decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 12, line 13, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 138, in page 12, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Regulations under subsection (1) above shall in particular authorise the Secretary of State to make a payment on account of a relevant benefit pending any decision referred to in that subsection and shall require him when he is considering whether to make such a payment to take account of the hardship that any person is likely to suffer if a payment is not made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(1B) In making the provision referred to in subsection 1A, regulations shall not circumscribe the circumstances in which a payment on account may be made (other than that a decision referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) above is pending), but that they may make provision requiring a claimant to agree to repay the payment in prescribed circumstances as a condition for the making of a payment.
<P>
	(c) In making such provision, regulations shall also provide that, where the Secretary of State declines to make a payment on account, a claimant may appeal to an appeal tribunal against the refusal and that such an appeal shall in prescribed circumstances be determined expeditiously.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The amendment goes closely with amendment No. 138; indeed, the point of it is to work in conjunction with amendment No. 138. The amendment deals with the opportunity, which we hope the Secretary of State will use wisely, to provide interim payments when an appeal is going on and payment of benefit might otherwise be held up. The Secretary of State should have regard to hardship in such cases. There may be appeals which the Secretary of State and everyone else can see are likely to succeed, perhaps not in full but to an extent, and in such cases, where there might otherwise be hardship, the Secretary of State should have the opportunity to make an interim hardship payment in advance of the final decision on the appeal.
<P>
The amendment allows for getting taxpayers' money back when appeals do not succeed. Worries about accepting the amendment because of what might happen if appeals are unsuccessful are therefore unnecessary. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the amendment provides for circumstances that are not otherwise allowed for in the Bill and removes a possible objection to it--that it could cause hardship in certain cases. It would be to the Government's benefit to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would ensure that regulations are made which set out the circumstances in which interim payments could be made where a decision of the Secretary of State, an appeal tribunal or a commissioner is pending. It provides for such payments to be recoverable and gives a right of appeal against a refusal to make an award. I understand the thinking behind the amendment, but can assure the Committee that it is not necessary. Section 5(1)(r) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 contains the power to make regulations with regard to the award of interim payments. We are not changing that legislation under the Bill.
<P>
Payments on account--interim payments, as they are otherwise known--can be paid before a final decision on benefit entitlement has been reached where the Secretary of State has reason to believe that there is, or may be, entitlement to the benefit in question. They are recoverable either from benefit, if eventually awarded, or from other income if benefit is not awarded. They are intended to provide an immediate source of income where entitlement is possible but there are delays in deciding exact entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Will the Minister clarify the extent to which that measure ensures that hardship is taken into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Decisions on entitlement to interim payments are taken after considering all the factors in a particular case. Hardship would be considered. However, if benefit is not paid through interim payments, there is recourse to hardship payments from other social security sources, so a person will not be denied all right to income.
<P>
Interim payments are intended to provide an immediate source of income where entitlement is possible but there are delays in deciding exact entitlement. There are currently no appeal rights against a refusal to make an interim payment, and we do not propose to introduce them; because the initial question is almost always resolved well before an appeal against such a refusal could be heard. In addition, the customer has the usual right of appeal against the decision on full benefit entitlement when that is taken.
<P>
I hope that, with the explanation, the hon. Gentleman will be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I must admit that I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister's response. He could help himself, the Government and any future Secretary of State if he accepted the amendment, particularly because it makes a point about hardship.
<P>
In referring to paragraph (c) of the amendment, which contains the possibility of appealing against the refusal of an interim payment, the Minister did not mention that the amendment states that any appeal should be determined expeditiously. The point of including those words in the amendment was to overcome the objection, which he has just made, that if an appeal were launched, it would not be heard until after the original determination and would therefore be pointless.
<P>
The Minister has not entirely answered the questions raised by the amendment, which would be to his benefit and that of the Bill, and I hope that he will reconsider it before Report. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The clause introduces the first of the Bill's provisions relating to the new arrangements for appeal, and brings together the functions of all the current tribunal jurisdictions under a new tribunal system. More specifically, the clause provides for the transfer of the functions of social security, medical, disability, child support and vaccine damage appeal tribunals to appeal tribunals constituted under clauses 6 to 8.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear on Second Reading that she will assume personal responsibility for the administration of appeals. She has made a commitment to set and publish demanding targets for administration and to report on the results. We have decided in principle to establish a new DSS executive agency to administer appeals. That will be the best way to meet out objectives of improving service and accountability for performance. Agency status would enable the service to operate at arm's length from Ministers. It would provide scope for greater accountability in terms of expenditure, performance and a better service for customers.
<P>
The Child Poverty Action Group and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux have told me that they consider that public confidence would be enhanced by the establishment of a new executive agency to administer appeals. I share their view.
<P>
Agency status would enable the Secretary of State to set objectives for the service and demanding targets for administration. The chief executive could be required to report regularly to Ministers to ensure the efficient running of the service. Importantly, the chief executive could be appointed accounting officer, directly responsible to Parliament for the expenditure and efficiency of the service.
<P>
Setting up a new agency would enable appeals administration to be properly focused, with no competing demands. It would provide the potential for a close working relationship with the judiciary which the Council on Tribunals considers essential to an effective and efficient service.
<P>
This approach is consistent with the trend in other appeal systems. For example, pensions appeal tribunals are administered by the Court Service Agency, and industrial tribunals and employment appeal tribunals are administered by the Employment Tribunals Service, which is an agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. For those reasons, we have it in mind to set up a new DSS executive agency for the sole purpose of administering appeals.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause is a key element in taking a new and more sensible approach to the constitution of appeal tribunals--to enable a new, unified appeals service to deal with the wide range of issues that arise under social security, child support and vaccine damage legislation. That new approach will not only ensure that the highest level of decision making is continued but will introduce a more streamlined system for constituting appeal tribunals under the ambit of one single, uniform piece of legislation.
<P>
I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I thank you, Mr. Gale, and welcome you to the chairmanship of the Committee.
<P>
We have not tabled amendments to the clause because the issue on which we want to press the Minister is the principle of the abolition of the present independent tribunals system. We have already heard that the clause will have the effect of setting up unified appeal tribunals, drawing together the various subjects currently covered by tribunals in different areas of social security legislation.
<P>
My main point is this: ``If it isn't broken, why try to fix it?'' We are talking about a modest saving of around &#163;50 million, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that in his reply. At the same time, there can be no doubt that the present system is held in high esteem--not only by users but by the various interest groups that represent them.
<P>
The Minister referred to the Child Poverty Action Group. However, its own briefing makes it clear that it is opposed on two grounds to the administration of appeals being made the responsibility of the Department of Social Security. First, it is worried about the system appearing to be less independent--an important point, since we all know the distinction between justice being done and justice being seen to be done. However well run and efficient the new system may be, some people will feel that it is less independent as a part of the machinery of government. Secondly, the CPAG believes that independence could be compromised because:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Administration can effect outcomes and because clerks have part judicial functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore not entirely accurate to suggest that CPAG is content with this thorough-going change.
<P>
The Royal National Institute for the Blind provides another example; it also makes the point that the current system is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``largely perceived to be fair''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many visually impaired appellants have reported how the tribunal made them feel at ease. It is important in any tribunal that ordinary folk who are drawn into a judicial or quasi-judicial process be made to feel at ease. All too often--as we know from magistrates and county courts in our constituencies--the man or woman on the street, who mercifully has little to do with the legal system, can feel threatened, intimidated and out of depth. Concluding on that point, the RNIB states that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``wary of attempts to undermine the strength of the current system which offers a fair and full hearing and for justice to be seen to be done''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an echo of one of the main reservations of the CPAG.
<P>
I should like to move on to one of the most serious reservations--in relation to terms and origin--expressed by the Law Society. We have received some excellent briefs already from that society and I have no reason to believe that that situation will not continue--[Hon. Members: ``Ah!'']--I have to make a nod in the direction of my trade union. The Law Society has serious reservations--its words are obviously carefully weighed--about the proposal to abolish the ITS, and, as the Society puts it,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to bring the administration of appeals . . . `in-house' to the DSS.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The society also refers to the projected savings of &#163;50 millions, and I have asked the Minister to comment on that.
<P>
The society states not only that there is little justification for the change, but that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``raises significant constitutional issues concerning the independence of the appellate system.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members can all agree, with the Law Society, that it is useful to have flexibility in the organisation and constitution of tribunals; they need to be made up of members with a range of expertise. The Law Society stresses--unusually for a body representing professional people; in this case, lawyers--the major role played at present by the lay members of such tribunals. Some tribunals raise complex legal issues, which are, perhaps, the most likely to be brought to appeal, but the society also refers to tribunals that achieve ``balanced down-to-earth decisions.'' Much of that can be attributed to the lay members' good sense and their experience of the real world.
<P>
The Law Society notes, however, that complex legislative provisions are often involved in the work of tribunals, and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``single decision makers could be influenced by their own pre-determined, perhaps even prejudiced views, thus undermining the whole appeals process.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I also want to draw the Committee's attention to the society's anxiety about a matter that we shall discuss in later sittings: a return to non-legal tribunal ``chairs'', or chairmen, as I insist on calling them. It quotes the Green Paper; a majority of respondents to the Green Paper stated that such a return would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an undesirable and retrograde step.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, the Committee was assured, in the honeyed words of the Minister, that there was no cause for fear. The CPAG, the Law Society, the RNIB, and no doubt many other organisations that have not been quoted today, need not worry. All is well because the Secretary of State will assume personal responsibility for the administration of the tribunals. But anyone with any knowledge of the working of busy Departments like this one must know that that is a hollow promise. Like anyone in such a position, the Secretary of State is a busy lady, with many competing commitments, and she will, all too often, be driven by the headlines of the day. It is all very well to say that there will be regular reporting to the Secretary of State, but I question how far any Secretary of State, of whatever party, can assume, as he puts it, ``personal responsibility'' for such tribunals. How is it possible for that to happen in the real world?
<P>
By way of a sub-point to my conclusion, the proposal for agency status carries forward a system of organisation and administration pioneered by successive Conservative Ministers. I have no quibble about that, but I question how the Secretary of State can assume personal responsibility--those were the Minister's words--for the tribunals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> My response will be brief, as some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) refer to other clauses of the Bill, which we shall debate shortly. They contain changes to the composition of tribunals and related matters, so I will comment only on the general point.
<P>
I will take the hon. Member for Eastbourne's comments on the proposal for agency status as a grudging welcome. The hon. Gentleman believes that it builds on the work of the previous Government. We will take that as a compliment, even so. We must make it clear, however, that we are dealing with the administration of the appeals system--for which the Secretary of State will be ultimately accountable--and not the judicial element of the appeal system, which will be independent and under the auspices of the Lord Chancellor's Department. The administrative and judicial elements should not be confused--judicial independence will not be affected by the new administrative arrangements that we are attempting to establish.
<P>
The clause aims to unify and simplify the complex system of different tribunals. It does not aim primarily to save money--although the running costs of the ITS this year are about &#163;56 million--but is designed to ensure that the system is efficient and that it provides value for money.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister says that the running costs are &#163;56 million, but I understood that the projected saving was &#163;50 million. Are net and gross savings being confused? I cannot imagine that almost all the running costs will be saved, as there must be costs involved in the new system. The Minister might not have the answer at his fingertips, and I would be happy to raise the issue later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The &#163;50 million does not relate only to this particular point; it relates to the whole of part I of the Bill. It is a result of comparing costings with expenditure under the Bill.
<P>
Putting money aside--although we cannot, of course, do that--our primary aim is to have a modern, streamlined system. We believe that the unification of the tribunal service--constituting administration by the new agency and judicial independence under the auspices of the Lord Chancellor's Department--will ensure that there is public confidence in the efficiency of the new system and in the maintenance of independent rights of appeal. We will discuss many of the detailed points later this morning, but I hope that the Committee will find these remarks reassuring.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 56 to 58, 89, 91 and 92.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I would like to speak first about the Government amendments within this group. They form a cohesive group, ensuring that we achieve the desired flexibility to make the best use of the people appointed to the two new panels. Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 relate to clauses 6 and 7, removing the geographical description of panels as ``England and Wales'' or ``Scotland'', which might unintentionally restrict the president's flexibility to draw members from either panel to form an appeal tribunal. Amendment No. 55 changes clause 8 to enable the president of appeal tribunals to draw members, as the need arises, from either or both of the panels constituted under clauses 6 and 7.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56 and 58 remove the definition of ``the appropriate panel'' from clause 8(5) and add a definition of ``the panels''. Amendment No. 57 amends the definition of ``expert'' so that an appeal tribunal may call experts from either panel.
<P>
In practice, appeal tribunals sitting in England and Wales will generally be made up of members of the panel appointed by the Lord Chancellor. Similarly, appeal tribunals sitting in Scotland will normally comprise people from the panel appointed by the Lord Advocate. However, there may be occasions when this may not be possible--for example, when an appeal calls for a particular specialism. A vaccine damage appeal in Scotland may need a tribunal to include a consultant with knowledge of the effects of particular vaccines. If the panel constituted by the Lord Advocate did not include such a consultant, a member of the panel constituted by the Lord Chancellor could be drawn to sit on the Scottish tribunal for that appeal. The amendments will enable the skills and expertise of panel members to be properly applied to appeals throughout Great Britain.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 89, 91 and 92 remove references to ``either panel'' or ``the appropriate panel'' from schedule 1. As amended, schedule 1 will provide for the president to arrange the training of people appointed to the panels and for clerks to summon members of the panels to serve on appeal tribunals.
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Amendment No. 117 has been grouped with the Government Amendments. Those amendments are largely unexceptionable, and although my amendment relates to the Bill as originally drafted, rather than as it is proposed to be amended, it makes sense to take them all together.
<P>
Amendment No. 117 proposes that appeal tribunals should consist--as at present--of three members, rather than the one, two or three provided for in the Bill. An amendment tabled by Conservative Members also demonstrates anxieties about the single member tribunal option. That anxiety is fundamental; it is important that we have a substantive discussion. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that.
<P>
Hon. Members' anxiety about single member tribunals is linked to the issues of legal qualification, experience of the local area and experience of disability. We object to the idea that a case should be heard by a single person tribunal, and have therefore tabled an amendment that proposes that the tribunal should always consist of three persons.
<P>
As the Minister pointed out, a single person is subject to prejudices and bias. We are anxious about a person's appeal against a social security decision, which is terribly important to the individual affected, being subject to the biases of a sole decision maker. When we raised that issue on Second Reading, we were told that sole decision makers are commonplace, for example in the courts. It was argued that sole decision makers were not a problem.
<P>
The analogy with the court soon breaks down, however: in a court, the decision maker is a legal specialist dealing with a legal issue that is a point of law. In the appeal tribunals proposed in the Bill, the sole decision maker will not necessarily be legally qualified, or have experience of disability, if the appellant is disabled. In principle, that person could be a lay person, with all the baggage that lay people bring to complex legal issues. In such cases, therefore, justice will not remotely be seen to be done.
<P>
At present, there is provision for wing members to go alongside the chairman. Those wing members must have experience of the local area and at least one of them must be of the same sex as the appellant. When the appellant turns up, therefore, there is someone of the same sex on the panel, there is someone who knows the area, and there are people who have some experience, especially in the case of disabled appellants, of which it means to be disabled.
<P>
The issue of the number of people on the panel brings together many different elements of the Bill. We are especially worried that a sifting process may take place before deciding how many people shall be on the tribunal, and that the option to have one or two members may be linked to the hopelessness or otherwise of the case. We believe that such a sifting process is problematic, and we shall return to that when we discuss schedule 1.
<P>
The Government appear to want single-member panels partly because hopeless cases can be sifted out and dealt with quickly. [Interruption.] We believe that that sifting process is fundamentally flawed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that hon. Members need to discuss aspects of the Bill, but three conversations appear to be going on at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Part of the thinking behind single-member tribunals is that they could deal with lower grade appeals, when officials who have considered the relevant papers decide that a case is not worth the trouble of a panel composed of two or three people.
<P>
Amendment No. 117 would allow people a fair hearing. Cases should not be prejudged by an official who can decide whether a case merits only a one-person tribunal or whether there should be ``two on this one''. Appellants should have a right to a three-person tribunal. Other amendments would ensure that tribunal personnel would be legally qualified and experienced, but amendment No. 117 would ensure that cases are not prejudged by a tribunal composed of a single member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): Like amendment No. 117, amendments Nos. 15 to 17 contend that panels should not consist of only one person. We agree with the hon. Member for Northavon that single-member panels do not serve the interests of natural justice and that they do not represent the best decision-making process.
<P>
Panels should be able to draw on the expertise and opinions of more than one person. Single-person panels will concentrate too much power in the hands of one person, and the question of who is chosen to be the single member of a panel will be discussed in connection with schedule 1 and clause 8.
<P>
The provision sets a dangerous precedent, which we would neither endorse or encourage in any Government. We hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter, given the cross-party agreement among Opposition Members that the amendments propose a better alternative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon):</B> I wish to make a brief point. I welcome the new scheme outlined in the Bill. I have 20 years' professional experience of dealing with such panels, and know that the present scheme sometimes means that a case is dealt with by the wrong people. However, I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister about the constitution of the panels under the new scheme.
<P>
Will there be separate lists of doctors, lawyers, people with disabilities and so on, so that it will be easy to know who's who when the panels are constituted? That would allow us to choose horses for courses, and ensure that the right people are involved in a particular case. Such lists would mean that the right experience and qualifications are available when, for example, legal or medical problems arise. They would also mean that the problem covered by clause 8(4), which would allow a panel in need of assistance to call in another member with the necessary expertise, could be avoided.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> If I may deal first with the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Surprise, surprise: and the answer is yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I welcome my hon. Friend's contribution to our proceedings. He has vast experience of such matters, and I am pleased that he has given an overall welcome to the Government's proposals to streamline the appeals system.
<P>
Clearly, it would be sensible to ensure that appropriate lists of expertise are available when the tribunals are being set up. The sensible use of technology--I do not want to anger the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)--would allow that expertise to be flagged up on computer lists for quick identification. I welcome that suggestion.
<P>
I listened carefully to Opposition Members' remarks in introducing their amendments, which would make a variety of changes to clause 8, affecting the constitution of appeals tribunals. It might be helpful if I were to outline how we envisage the new arrangements will work. I can reassure the Committee that our proposals will provide what we all want: an improved service for applicants in a system that retains its current reputation for fairness and integrity.
<P>
The single appeals jurisdiction that is established in clause 4 will need arrangements for each appeal to be flexible to enable different types of expertise to be properly focused on the relevant cases. The procedure for allocating cases among the differently constituted tribunals will be set out in regulations made under clause 8(3).
<P>
The current statutory requirements are major reasons for inefficiencies in the system. Tribunals must at present comprise three persons, including a legally qualified chairman, irrespective of the appeal before them. That is a waste of resources and often leads to unnecessary delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. Would he agree that, extending the principle that he mentioned, it is an unnecessary waste of resources for three magistrates to sit in the magistrates court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We are considering the entire range of appeals that arise in the context of the Bill. We know that those appeals can be of widely differing natures. Some concern simple matters of fact, such as whether a person qualifies for a benefit--purely on the facts, a benefit might be found not to be payable. Sometimes a person appeals about the amount of benefit, where Parliament has laid the amount down in law. In such simple cases, and exclusively in the context of social security legislation and appeals procedure, only one person would, in certain circumstances, be needed for the tribunal. That approach need not necessarily be extended to non-social security legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): On a point of information, in response to the point made by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), there is not merely one model of lay justice in the United Kingdom. In Scotland lay justices of the peace and magistrates often sit alone and dispense justice quite adequately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful for that information from my hon. Friend who has great expertise in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I should like to press for a further response from the Minister--who should be grateful to his Whip for bailing him out by getting the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun to use his Scottish legal expertise to feed him that line.
<P>
The Minister did not answer my direct question, which was--without looking at the civil servants--about whether he agrees with the principle in England of three magistrates sitting together, or should we reduce the number, because of the costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That is a matter not of principle, but of practice. I answered the question in relation to social security matters, which are the only ones before the Committee. We are not dealing with wider matters concerning the judiciary.
<P>
It is clear that not all cases before appeal tribunals need three people to deliver a fair hearing. We also think that not all of those people need to be legally trained--I gave the example of a simple statement of fact about a benefit level or about eligibility for a benefit.
<P>
Training will be the essential part of the condition to be a member of an appeal tribunal; the Lord Chancellor and the president will not allow anyone to serve on tribunals who is not competent and properly trained for the purpose of the appeals. That being so, the previous requirements are not necessary in all cases.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> None of us would dispute the fact that some cases are, on the face of it, straightforward and could therefore be dealt with by fewer people on the panel. We would, however, argue that other cases, although they may look straightforward, are actually found to be complicated when they come to appeal. I believe that all members of the Committee have seen the briefing of the Child Poverty Action Group, which cites the case of someone who wanted a funeral payment for a funeral outside the United Kingdom. Apparently, that was not allowed by the rules, so the case would have gone straight down the fast track either to a one-person tribunal or been sifted out altogether--possibly the latter. In fact, the decision was appealed, went to Europe and, according to the briefing, was overturned.
<P>
That might not have happened if cases were pre-sifted, a process that would lead either to no appeal or one-member appeal tribunals. Although justice is a little expensive and will sometimes stop the Department saving 25 per cent. of its running costs, is not it worth it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I sat in on a tribunal yesterday which also dealt with a claim for a funeral grant. The European Court's decision, that funeral expenses could be paid where a person was buried outside the previous jurisdiction, was conveyed to the appellant by three people. I do not believe that it needed three people to inform him of the new factual, legal position and his consequent entitlement to funeral expenses. It did not need a three-person appeal to convey those simple facts to the appellant, who was obviously delighted at the decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's response to the four amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I had not finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I apologise--I am disappointed by his opening remarks in answer to earlier probing. We look forward to his concluding remarks, in which I hope he will try to meet us at some point between the two positions.
<P>
It is not in the interests of individuals bringing their problems before a panel to be faced with one person. As the hon. Member for Northavon pointed out, and as I said earlier, a one-person panel leaves the system open to charges of coming into disrepute. Individuals who come before a panel will not necessarily have confidence in its decisions because it consists of one person only--despite the fact that they may be given advice at the time by other people. We think that there should be more than one person on the panel so as to reach the correct decisions.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will think again. Obviously, we will not press our amendments to a vote, although we may want to pursue them at a later stage. We will wait until we have concluded our discussions on the subject of panels under the different parts of the Bill to be debated later today. We will, however, reserve our position because we are concerned about the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Perhaps I should have quit while I was winning, if the Opposition spokesman does not intend to press the amendment.
<P>
When new information and facts emerge which may require further consideration or specialist advice, the hearing can be adjourned to enable that to happen. Having a one-person tribunal at that point does not rule out the opportunity of further consideration of the matter. On the presidency and the setting up of tribunals, I believe that there are areas of appeals that can be satisfactorily dealt with by a single person, properly trained--and recognised as such--by the Lord Chancellor's Department. There are cases that can be dealt with quickley and efficiently by one person. The example that I used is a very good one as it was used by the hon. Gentleman himself, and there are a number of others.
<P>
When it is appropriate to have two or three people, or when particular expertise or the presence of a legally qualified person is required, those factors will be taken into account when the appeals body is constituted. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention deliberately to fast track or, in the words of the hon. Member for Northavon, to downgrade those appeals just because only one person is sitting on a panel. We want to ensure that everyone is treated efficiently, fairly and equally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Could the Minister assure us about the example that he used? He spoke about an appeals body sitting simply to transmit information; he said that the transmission of information does not require more than one person. Is there a significant difference between a body which will take a decision and one which simply transmits information? Most of us probably accept that the sheer transmission of information does not necessarily need three people. But it seems that, as a point of fairness, more than one person might be needed if a decision has to be taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No, I am not saying that. In my example, the person had appealed against the disallowance of the funeral expenses, and the tribunal had to decide that that person was then entitled to that money because of the European Court ruling. The appeal had to be heard, a decision had to be taken, and the facts transmitted to the applicant. It may have seemed, from my description, that I was talking simply about passing on information, but a decision must still be taken on the appeal. Some decisions can be taken by one person. In this case, the decision was taken that the European Court ruling applied in this case and the decision was made to grant the money. From my observation, it did not need three people to take that decision.
<P>
With those concluding remarks, I hope that Liberal Members, like the Opposition, will not press their amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 3, line 31 at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) The panel shall also include sufficient numbers of women, people from ethnic minorities and people with disabilities to reflect the overall composition of appellants who appear before appeal tribunals.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Government will be able to accept the amendment to ensure that the panels that are drawn up, from which members of appeal tribunals will be taken, are reasonably representative of the people of the case concerned.
<P>
There is a potential move in the Bill towards more use of expertise. Although no one is necessarily against that, it may be at the expense of making the panels properly representative of those who may appear before such panels.
<P>
Amendment No. 139 refers in particular to three different types of people. First, it refers to women--sadly, it is still so often true that women are under-represented; secondly, to people from ethnic minorities and, thirdly, to people with some form of disability. It occurs to me that perhaps our amendment should include reference to people with ``experience of disabilities'' rather than merely to people who have disabilities. If the Government are happy to accept the amendment in principle, I shall be willing to withdraw it and bring it back later with that minor amendment: no doubt all members of the Committee agree that this corrected wording would be more sensible.
<P>
It is important that we have properly representative panels, not just the appeal bodies themselves. The appeal tribunal bodies consisting of three chosen people--sadly, in some instances there may be only one person--may not be properly representative unless the panels have a fair sprinkling of people from all the sections. The Government may also consider that sufficient numbers of men should be on the panel, but I suspect that that can be taken for granted.
<P>
The serious questions here are, first, what will make the appeal tribunals work and, secondly, what will make these people accept that they must deliver the right solution and see that justice is done? It could be argued that if we take the route of searching for ever greater expertise, we may be more likely to get the right people for appeal tribunals because such people are more likely to make sensible judgments and to produce the right result. But it is also true that if the panels--and the appeal tribunal bodies in particular--are unrepresentative, any result is less likely to be accepted as just and fair, because appellants to tribunals may not feel that they have been fairly judged by people in some ways similar to themselves. A woman facing a panel of men, or a person from an ethnic minority facing a panel drawn entirely from a different racial group, may feel that they have been judged unfairly; similarly, a person with a disability may think that the extent or significance of his disability has not been appreciated if a panel is drawn from people with no experience of that disability.
<P>
I accept that it will not always be practicable to draw up appeals tribunals from people totally representative of a given circumstance. But we want to ensure that, as often as possible, tribunals are made up of a reasonably representative sample of people, not only to achieve the right result but to reassure people appearing before them that they have been fairly judged, by their peers. It is a fairly fundamental point of the British justice system generally--there were comments earlier about how the system works in general--that people should feel that they have been judged by their peers--by people who are aware of what affects them and their lives--and that the result of their appeal has been entirely fair.
<P>
I wonder whether the Government are going a little too far towards relying purely on expertise rather than on giving people a fair hearing. Perhaps I may raise a related issue by way of example. Many local councils allow people a say for, and against, a planning application. Councils operating that system have found that, whether or not their judgments are right, they are much more easily accepted, whether people support or oppose an application. It is in the Government's and society's interests that members of bodies who make such judgments on their fellow men and women should be as acceptable as possible to those who are judged. That is a most important aspect of our system of justice. Our amendment could help bring that about. I hope that the Government will feel able to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has clearly identified, the amendment seeks to ensure that panel members represent the mix of appellants who appear before tribunals. As drafted, the amendment would not include the numbers of appellants who choose not to appeal before the tribunal but have their appeal decided on the papers. No consideration in the amendment is given to who takes those decisions--but that may be part of the point.
<P>
I have a great deal of sympathy for what the hon. Gentleman has described, but under the provisions of the clause it will be the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor to appoint suitably qualified people to deal with the cases that come before tribunals. Rather than amend the Bill to include instructions for the Lord Chancellor on how to work, I feel that it is best to continue to discuss with the Lord Chancellor's Department the way that these matters will be dealt with in practice. I want to assure the hon. Gentleman that in those discussions about the way that appeals panels are constituted the points that he raises will be properly taken into account.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Rather than amending the Bill to specify something that, as the hon. Gentleman recognised, may be hard to deliver in practice, we must ensure that as the new system evolves these matters are dealt with properly and are given full consideration. I hope that with that assurance, and knowing that those discussions will continue, he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances. From the tone of his remarks it would appear that he and I would agree on the important principle at stake, but I am not quite sure that he clarified fully how he would expect to extend the expertise while at the same time allowing the panels to be properly representative, particularly where he is thinking of having only one person or, if our further amendment is accepted, two people on the appeals tribunals. It seems to me that he will have a bit of difficulty there. I accept that his heart is in the right place on this, however, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 3, line 34, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, after consultation with interested parties,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 12, in clause 7, page 4, line 8, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consultation with interested parties.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The clause provides for the constitution of the panel of men and women to act as members of the appeals tribunal and is at the heart of the whole tribunal system. The clause itself invests the power of constitution in the hands of the Lord Chancellor, as has been mentioned in our previous debates. When one analyses the whole clause it soon becomes apparent that it is designed to grant the Lord Chancellor extremely wide-ranging powers.
<P>
Taken together, the five subsections of clause 6 make provision for the Lord Chancellor to constitute a panel of persons or person to act as members of appeals tribunals and to determine which persons he thinks fit to the job, which also cover which qualifications he decrees are appropriate to be a member of a panel, the number of persons appointed to that panel and the terms and conditions of their appointments. He can even remove anyone from the panel whom he considers to have misbehaved or to be incapable of doing the job.
<P>
I am sure that the whole Committee would agree that that represents a formidable array of powers. I should like to look a little more closely at the authority that the clause gives to the Lord Chancellor. Subsection (4) deals with the power of the Lord Chancellor to determine, with the consent of the Secretary of State,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The numbers of persons appointed to the panel, and the terms and conditions of those appointments''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have discussed this on previous amendments but these are very wide-ranging powers as we said at the time. We are concerned about the prospect that the panel, however unintentionally, may come to reflect too closely the ethos of the Government of the day, which could lead to the expected objectivity of that panel being jeopardised and compromised.
<P>
One of the overriding strengths of the system must be the independence of the panel. To safeguard that, there should be checks on the powers of the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State, hence amendment No. 8, and amendment No. 12 as it applies to Scotland. I accept that the Lord Chancellor is not without good sense; for example, earlier this month he showed his ability to protect his prerogatives when he told the Secretary of State for Social Security that there was no need to skewer the legal system to ensure that women judges presided over domestic violence cases, because the gender of the judge does not alter the quality of the decision. But the clause states that he must have the consent of the Secretary of State. We thus want to argue the case for an additional safeguard to be inserted at the end of line 34 in clause 6, subsection 4, which should state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The numbers of persons appointed to the panel, and the terms and conditions of their appointments, shall be determined by the Lord Chancellor with the consent of the Secretary of State''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we do not part company with the Government on that, but with the addition
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultation with interested parties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to promote a balanced panel, therefore we want the Government to be under an obligation to consult a wide range of groups so that people from as broad a spectrum as possible can be assigned to the panel.
<P>
It is important not to have a panel of clones; we want a panel of individuals. The amendment pushes forward the greater sense of openness and inclusiveness that the Government repeatedly say that they favour. We are in favour of both, in rhetoric and in reality, and it is important that the Government act to show that their words are not hollow. It is important for the Government's credibility and, more importantly, for the credibility of the panel that it is genuinely independent and not packed with Labour placemen.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Dear me!
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister may say that but we are all aware of what emanates from Millbank tower. It is important to enhance the Bill's strengths by enshrining in legislation the need for a statutory obligation to consult interested parties. I had hoped that the Minister would agree that that is an eminently reasonable and sensible way forward, because he must recognise that for citizens to have faith in the system they must believe that it is fair and not weighted against them in advance. To ensure that the system is fair, the appointments should be made not merely after the Lord Chancellor has received the consent of the Secretary of State but after the Lord Chancellor has consulted interested parties and received the Secretary of State's consent. That is appropriate; it is an effective way forward.
<P>
There are a host of interested parties with a wealth of experience and expertise that could have a positive and constructive input into the process to ensure that the appointments attract people of the highest calibre. Interested parties, for example, could include across-the-board areas of concern reflecting specialised views and ideas ranging from local authorities to charitable bodies such as Age Concern, Mencap, the citizens advice bureaux, the Child Poverty Action Group, the Council for Voluntary Services and members of many other organisations who understand at the sharp end the impact of legislation on citizens' lives. They have the greatest experience and expertise and thus can make a valid contribution to help to ensure that the appellants' interests are protected by having people appointed who have something beneficial to contribute, based on experience.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give lengthy and serious consideration to the amendments, which are designed to improve the Bill, not to detract from it. We are at one in wanting the most effective and efficient legislation on the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I think that I have heard it all now, when Conservative Members complain about the possibility of the Labour party packing bodies with its own people. An analysis of any public body over the past 18 years would undermine that argument at a stroke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I would like to put those comments in context because that allegation has been made over the past few years by, I suspect, the Minister without Portfolio, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), who believes that if one repeats enough something that is not based on fact, it will become accepted as fact.
<P>
Hon. Members ought to study the analysis of health trusts by the Department of Health. I assume that similarly constituted bodies were also analysed by the Department of Social Security. Hon. Members will be aware that when anyone puts forward his name for consideration, he is specifically asked whether he has any party political connections or engages in party political activities. If one analyses those applications, one finds, to the disappointment of Labour Members, that very few people have had active political experience or take part in political activities. If one breaks down those figures even further, the numbers of Conservative and Labour supporters are virtually the same, although in fairness, those who are Liberal Democrats--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A certain amount of political knockabout is the stuff of the House of Commons, but that was a long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I rest my case.
<P>
I am unable to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> It seemed to me, Mr. Gale, that it was unfortunate that you cut off the hon. Member for West Chelmsford just as he was about to say that the Liberal Democrats had been unfairly represented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I was not going to say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is all proportional.
<P>
I shall explain briefly how the complementary provisions of the Bill will work. The number of persons appointed to the panel and their terms and conditions are quite properly matters for the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate in Scotland to determine, with the agreement of the Secretary of State. In practice, there will be on-going discussion between the Secretary of State and the president of the appeals service about the volume of appeals. Similarly, the Secretary of State will discuss with the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate the numbers of persons needed on the panel to handle the cases, but not, I stress, the individuals who will be on the panel--that is the province of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate. Those discussions will be particularly important during the first year of the new arrangements, as they settle down to ensure smooth running between the administration and practice of appeals tribunals.
<P>
The president has a crucial role as head of the appeals tribunals, in the successful implementation of the new jurisdiction and in appeal arrangements. Primary legislation is not necessary to ensure continuing and effective liaison with him.
<P>
The Secretary of State is accountable for expenditure on remuneration of panel members and needs to ensure consistency in the terms and conditions offered to members of the two panels. We do not accept that there is a need for a formal statutory consultation on those matters. Judicial appointments are independent and in making them the Lord Chancellor is free from political and other pressures, which the hon. Member for West Chelmsford would clearly like to continue to be exerted. It is right for the Lord Chancellor to have those powers and the independence of tribunals will be enhanced by them, not by the amendment. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am very disappointed that the Minister fails to see the merits of the amendment. I still believe, notwithstanding what he has just said, that interested parties should have their views represented and an input into ensuring that the people appointed are of the highest quality and expertise. That proviso should be included in the Bill so that the legislation cannot be misused by this or a future Government.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is all well and good for the Minister to talk about the independence of the judiciary, which no one would dispute, and the fact that such bodies are, if I understood him, semi-judicial. But that takes us back to amendment No. 117, which was moved by the hon. Member for Northavon, and amendments Nos. 15 to 17. The Minister said then that the tribunals are not the same as magistrates courts, for example. He cannot have it both ways.
<P>
It disappoints me that this eminently reasonable amendment will not be accepted. We shall not push it to a Division, but we will consider the matter further--we think that the amendment provides the way forward. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 36, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) The Secretary of State shall with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor make regulations stating what constitutes incapacity or misbehaviour for the purposes of subsection (5) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 13, in clause 7, page 4, line 10, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) The Secretary of State shall with the concurrence of the Lord Advocate make regulations stating what constitutes incapacity or misbehaviour for the purposes of subsection (5) above.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I hope that we will be able to persuade the Minister to accept this eminently reasonable amendment or to move some way towards our view.
<P>
The amendment deals with the removal of members of the panel on the grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour. The powers given to the Lord Chancellor by sweeping statement in subsection (5) are audacious. I am not saying that they are totally unreasonable, but they are sweeping; they are uncompromising, but unexplained. No one would dispute the need for the Lord Chancellor to have the power to remove someone who is incapacitated or misbehaving. But the power virtually hands the Lord Chancellor a blank cheque to reshuffle his panel to remove an appointee who may be delivering decisions that are embarrassing the Government. That is why that sweeping power should be reconsidered. It would be remiss of the Opposition not to do so.
<P>
We want clarification because we are extremely concerned that the terminology of the subsection could be misused by a Government. To provide a check and balance, we tabled the amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor make regulations stating what consitutes incapacity or misbehaviour for the purposes of subsection (5) above.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be inappropriate for the subsection to be accepted before the Government have clarified what they mean by ``misbehaviour''. For example, everyone knows that to the Minister without Portfolio, cause for concern--misbehaviour--means forgetting to test the contents of a speech on a focus group before delivering it. Many others might not think that that constitutes misbehaviour, but he certainly would.
<P>
A panel member could be dismissed for failing to meet new Labour's quota of soundbites per decision--I imagine that that is close to the heart of the Minister and his colleagues--or for not delivering a decision that monitored the latest position of the Government. The Government must define what they mean by ``misbehaviour'' and elaborate on ``incapacity''. Is there a legal definition of both in other legislation or hidden elsewhere in the Bill? I should be grateful if the Minister clarified what checks and balances might be introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I obviously listened carefully to the points made by the hon. Gentleman when he moved the amendment. I cannot accept it as I am not persuaded that it is necessary or desirable to make regulations on the removal of panel members.
<P>
The Government are pledged to retain the right to an independent hearing of appeals, and we have strengthened the independence of the panel members with the powers in clauses 6 and 7, which provide for the Lord Chancellor and, in Scotland, the Lord Advocate to appoint all persons to the panels.
<P>
The amendments would allow the Secretary of State to prescribe circumstances in which a person may be removed. That is inconsistent with the other provisions in the Bill, which give her responsibility for neither the appointment, nor the dismissal of panel members. The Lord Chancellor or the Lord Advocate should have the right to terminate an appointment at any time if, in his opinion, a person whom he has appointed becomes unfit to perform the duties of the office by reason of incapacity or misbehaviour. Similar provisions are made in schedule 1 in respect of the president of appeal tribunals. I am sure that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford will be pleased to know that the provisions mirror the position in other jurisdictions, such as that of lay magistrates. It would not be appropriate for regulations such as those proposed by the hon. Gentleman to be made on judicial matters such as this. I hope, therefore, that he will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister tell the Committee the definition of misbehaviour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The definition of misbehaviour that the hon. Gentleman gave in regard to my hon. Friend the Minister without Portfolio is clearly bogus.
<P>
As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, misbehaviour is not defined in law. It is, therefore, up to the Lord Advocate or the Lord Chancellor to determine whether a person's actions constitute misbehaviour. Each case would have to be judged--one cannot define in advance precisely what would be determined. Obviously, if a person does not act in a way that the Lord Chancellor's Department thinks fit, he will be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am sorry, but I must press the Minister further. Despite all the waffle, he has not met the central point. The Committee's purpose is to discover what is behind a Bill, and Members of the Committee need to know what misbehaviour means. We do not want to hear some airy-fairy thing about what the Lord Chancellor's Department may feel is unfitting behaviour. The Minister should give us examples of such misbehaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman is well aware, people are dismissed from employment for what is considered in their workplace to be misbehaviour. That view is then tested and the person will argue the case. If a panel member were convicted of a criminal offence, that would be one example of misbehaviour. We are not, however, going to include in the Bill all the circumstances in which misbehaviour could be construed. It will be up to the good sense of the Lord Chancellor's Department or of the Lord Advocate to determine whether a person has misbehaved or whether he is not capable of undertaking his duties. Surely, that is the sensible way in which reasonable people would determine such matters. It would be inappropriate to prescribe the circumstances in primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I understand the Minister's point about prescribing and putting a straitjacket on the system. He has provided the helpful example of someone being convicted of a criminal offence in a court of law; no one would argue with that. He also mentioned the example of someone being sacked from their job. However, in that case, the person will have a contract of employment which states in detail the relevant disciplinary procedures and the circumstances in which those procedures will be triggered.
<P>
The Minister has provided one and a half examples, and I am asking him only what ``misbehaviour'' means; we must have a better flavour of that. The answer that the Lord Chancellor's Department will know best is not good enough. The powers are so wide ranging and across the board as to appear draconian. We must therefore have further clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has found a word around which he wants a wide-ranging debate. However, the example of misbehaviour that he provided was absurd, which reinforces the point that one cannot prescribe in regulations. If he believes that his example--not providing the requisite number of soundbites per day--constitutes misbehaviour, and that it should be written into the Bill, that shows how absurd the argument has become.
<P>
I provided an example to be helpful, but such matters are clearly for the Lord Chancellor's Department. I will write to the hon. Gentleman and provide him with more examples of what could be viewed as misbehaviour or incapacity. I am trying to be helpful. The example that the hon. Gentleman gave--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Oh, do not be silly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, his example is silly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As the Minister is revving up his word processor, will he also deal with the following two points? First, are we talking about misbehaviour outside a person's conduct within the tribunals system, or during the course of a hearing? Secondly, surely we can make an analogy or draw a distinction between misbehaviour as set out in the Bill and misconduct as defined under various arbitration Acts. Would that not be a useful starting point? It is clear that the Minister is struggling, so that might provide him with a useful peg on which to hang his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am not struggling, simply making the point that we are arguing inappropriately. When a person is appointed to a tribunal there will be a letter of appointment stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In addition, the Lord Chancellor reserves the right to suspend or terminate an appointment at any time if, in his opinion, the holder becomes unfit to perform the duties of the office by reason of incapacity, misbehaviour''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
about which I shall write further--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or any other cause, or there is any likelihood that public confidence in his impartiality will be impaired.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there is an agreement, in writing, about the Lord Chancellor's power to remove someone. It sets out the terms under which someone is accepted for membership of a panel. The details have not changed. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford argues that we are introducing new measures relating to misbehaviour. Can he tell the Committee why he feels that the powers have been used inappropriately in the past, and how definitions of misbehaviour have been used to remove panel members, thereby making it inappropriate for those definitions to flow through into current legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am sorry but the Minister misunderstood what I said. I was not suggesting that there should be regulations saying that if there are not enough soundbites per minute--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That was the example given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> No. I was saying that different people have different definitions of misbehaving. To the Minister without Portfolio, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), not supplying enough soundbites per minute is misbehaving. I was not saying that that should be defined as a form of misbehaviour in a regulation. The Minister has missed the point.
<P>
This is an important issue. All we are asking for is a broader definition of the meaning of ``misbehaviour''. The Bill baldly states that someone may be removed by the Lord Chancellor on grounds of misbehaviour. We merely want some examples of what that is. I accept that the Minister has kindly agreed to write--I imagine that he will write very quickly--and elaborate on that, but the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne and I are making is that we would like to have had that information before us during these discussions. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is an important matter.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are not arguing that people should not be dismissed on the grounds of misbehaviour or incapacity; the proposition is perfectly reasonable. We were just asking what misbehaviour means. I am sorry that the word has not been better defined, apart from the example we were given, of being convicted of a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The hon. Gentleman who is supposed to be sitting silently, because he is a Government Whip, says that we are talking nonsense. We are not. It is a pity if he regards our debates on the Bill in that light.
<P>
This is an important issue, not only for Opposition Members but also for interested parties outside. We need to know what ``misbehaviour'' means. Clearly, we are not going to make much progress with that today, so we shall await the Minister's letter with great interest. As he rightly pointed out, the issue comes up again later in the Bill and, depending on what his letter says, we may want to come back to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman accept, first, that the provision is not new? It is a re-enactment which applies widely in judicial appointments, including those of magistrates and judges. The implication of what he says is that somehow it has not been working satisfactorily because of the way in which misbehaviour has been defined. Will he give the Committee a single example of a definition of misbehaviour being inappropriately applied, so that we can have a flavour of the problem that he is suggesting is currently in the system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> As I said a few minutes ago, we are not suggesting that the thinking behind subsection (5) is wrong. We accept that the Lord Chancellor must have the powers to remove people on grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour, and we do not dispute the fact that this form of words has probably appeared a number of times in previous legislation, not necessarily in social security legislation alone. That is not my point.
<P>
The Committee is studying clause 6(5) of the Social Security Bill. We want to know what ``misbehaviour'' means. What powers are we giving the Lord Chancellor? What lies behind the word ``misbehaviour''? We were merely asking for an elaboration of that, and we shall await it in the Minister's letter. If the definition has been applied before, that is fine. We do not quibble with the Lord Chancellor's having that power, but we want to know exactly how far-reaching it is.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do I take it from that that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Yes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 53 and 90.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendments are purely technical. The first clarifies the meaning of the term ``the Chief Medical Officer'' used in subsection (2). It puts beyond doubt whom the Lord Chancellor is required to consult before appointing medical practitioners to the panel he sets up. The second is an amendment to clause 7. It gives the Chief Medical Officer in Scotland his correct title of Chief Medical Officer of the Scottish Office. The third amends schedule 1 to give the Chief Medical Officers in England, Scotland and Wales their correct titles. They are the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and the Chief Medical Officer of the Scottish Office; an appropriate reference to the Chief Medical Officer of the Welsh Office is also added.

<P>
The amendment provides for the Lord Advocate to consult the Lord President of the Court of Session before removing any person other than a medical practitioner from the panel of appeals tribunal members for Scotland on the grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour. The Lord Advocate has requested the amendment for two reasons. First, it is consistent with the requirement of clause 7(2)(a) for the Lord Advocate to consult the Lord President of the Court of Session before appointing persons other than medical practitioners to the panel. Secondly, the Lord Advocate considers that it provides an important safeguard for the panel members whom he appoints.
<P>
The amendment ensures that removal of persons other than medical practitioners appointed by the Lord Advocate is subject to proper consultation between those who have joint responsibility for such appointments. It reflects the special nature of the relationship between the Lord Advocate and the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland.

No. 144, in clause 14, page 8, line 8, at end insert 
<P>
`(c) if the Chairman of the tribunal was not legally qualified, either of the principal parties to the case expresses the view that the decision was so erroneous.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> After our discussions on clauses 6 and 7 about the pool of people from which tribunal members may be drawn, clause 8 requires us to debate the specific members of a tribunal.
<P>
Tribunals may consist of one, two or three members. Amendment No. 118 touches on some of the matters that were raised earlier, and would require that the sole member of a one-person tribunal, or the person chairing a tribunal consisting of two or three members, should have legal qualifications.
<P>
We have already briefly discussed the question of legal qualifications. The Government were not willing to rule out one-member tribunals, and that question is therefore especially acute. The Bill will make it possible for a single person to decide a social security appeal. Although the Minister has assured the Committee that that person will be a ``decent chap or chapess'', there is no requirement that he or she have legal qualifications.
<P>
That is wholly unsatisfactory. It appears that there will be a filter system: decisions about whether tribunals should have one, two or three members will be taken in what will amount to ``smoke-filled rooms'', and it is possible that the person who comprises a single-member tribunal will have no legal qualification.
<P>
During a hearing, especially an oral one, it may emerge that a legal point should have been made at an earlier stage. How is the sole person hearing the appeal supposed to cope with such a problem if he or she has no legal qualifications or experience?
<P>
Many hon. Members will have received a briefing from the social security lawyers. Their views may not be wholly dispassionate, given their interest in the matter, but they make the valid points that social security law is complex and rapidly changing, and that case law is especially important. How on earth is a tribunal whose sole member has no legal qualifications supposed to deal with the problems that might arise? The same question applies to two or three-person tribunals whose members have no legal qualifications.
<P>
No doubt the Minister will answer, ``Well, of course, we wouldn't dream of letting a case involving a legal matter get to an appeal tribunal that did not contain a legally qualified person,'' but there is no certainty that all the legal ramifications of a case can be known in advance. An examination of a case's documentation can give the impression that no legal issue is at stake, but inevitably such issues will arise when a case gets to an oral hearing, especially when such a hearing is inquisitorial and intended to find out more than what appears in the documentation. Therefore, as amendment No. 118 would require, there must be a legally qualified person on each panel.
<P>
The Government have shown some resistance to that proposal, so amendment No. 150 offers a very reluctant fall-back option. It proposes a new subsection (3A), which would make it a statutory requirement to have a legally qualified person on an appeal tribunal if it appeared that the appeal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may raise an issue of law.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be less satisfactory than a similar requirement in all cases, but at least it would go some way towards easing our disquiet.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 148 deals with the distinction between medical practitioners acting on behalf of the Secretary of State and making initial decisions about benefits, and medical practitioners acting as independent assessors on appeal tribunals. It is important to distinguish between those two roles, and so we suggest that a person who has adjudicated a decision in the previous 12 months--and who therefore has acted in effect as an agent of the Secretary of State--should not be able to turn up a week later as a tribunal's supposedly independent medical witness.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 119 and the second part of amendment No. 150, which relate to some of the arguments that I advanced earlier about the composition of panels. I said that panels should be drawn up so that there was reasonable representation, both from men and women and from people with disabilities--or at least with experience of disabilities. I was interested to hear the Minister's assurance that he would try to ensure, through various regulations, that panels were drawn up in that way.
<P>
The matter goes further than that, however. We are discussing not only the composition of the panels but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has pointed out, how the appeal tribunals themselves are taken from such panels. It is important that the Bill include a clause specifying that there should be, if possible, a woman on an appeal tribunal when a woman is to appear before the tribunal, and that there should be tribunal members with experience of disabilities when such issues are raised. We are all aware that when issues relating to disability are raised there will, almost inevitably, be difficult legal points. That is why amendment No. 150 refers to the need for legal representation, or the presence of a legally qualified person, on the appeal tribunal in such cases.
<P>
There are two main reasons for the appointment of a woman member of an appeal tribunal when a woman is to appear before it. The first is that it gives greater confidence to appellants in presenting their cases; they may feel that a woman member might understand some of the women's issues that might be raised, better than an all-male panel.
<P>
The second reason is that a woman member would bring additional expertise in women's issues to the appeal tribunal. The Government have referred to the need to raise expertise. Different forms of expertise are needed to decide on an appeal: there is legal expertise, as we have discussed in earlier amendments, and also expertise in many other fields. Liberal Democrat Members want to ensure that a particular form of expertise is included in appeal tribunals--that is, the expertise engendered in being a person of a particular sex, which gives experience of problems that are not experienced by people of the opposite sex.
<P>
It is important that the tribunal should include a member with experience of disabilities. As I said earlier, appellants with disabilities should feel that they have been judged by people with experience of their particular disability. Such people also bring an important form of expertise, of the type sought by the Government, to the tribunal in the discussion of questions relating to disability. Some of those questions are complex, and a tribunal member might need experience of particular types of disability to be a good judge of the issue under discussion.
<P>
I hope that, having agreed that there should be people with different forms of expertise on the panels, the Government will include a provision in the Bill that such people should be appointed to the appropriate tribunals.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendments would widen the scope of clause 14(3), and they propose a number of new subsections to clause 8 regarding the composition of appeal tribunals, the allocation of cases and the qualifications of tribunal members.
<P>
The proposed amendments to clause 8, taken together, would undermine one of the Government's key objectives--that of introducing an efficient and responsive appeals service, in which the expertise of tribunal members is focused on those cases that most need it.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 would require that people could not sit alone on an appeal tribunal, nor chair a tribunal, unless they held legal qualifications equivalent to the current full-time chairmen of the independent tribunal service. We do not accept that qualification requirements of tribunal members should be in primary legislation.
<P>
Clause 8 provides for the composition of tribunals to be prescribed in regulations. The regulations will set out the type of tribunal composition to hear particular types of appeal. For example, a tribunal hearing on an appeal against a vaccine damage payment will have to include a specialist with knowledge of the effects of the vaccines.
<P>
The proposed amendment seeks to re-enact the qualification requirement for the current full-time chairmen of tribunals. The number of persons to be appointed with legal qualifications will be a matter for the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate to determine, in consultation with the Secretary of State.
<P>
The amendment would also allow the president no discretion in selecting the chairman of a two or three-member tribunal. The chairman would always have to be a legally qualified person, regardless of whether that was appropriate to the issues raised in the appeal.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 seeks to widen the scope of subsection (3) of clause 14.
<P>
Clause 14 seeks to speed up the process when an appeal tribunal has made an error in law. At present there is a right of appeal against a tribunal decision to the social security commissioners. Clause 14 does not do away with that right, but it dispenses with the need for an appeal to go to the commissioners in some circumstances.
<P>
Clause 14 allows a person--which will usually be the chairman of the original appeal tribunal, the single person who made the original decisions or another suitably qualified member of the panel--to set aside the original decision when the tribunal has erred in law. The case then goes back to the original tribunal or to a differently constituted tribunal for determination. In addition, if that person considers that no error in law has been made, but the principal parties to the appeal agree that it has, the decision shall be set aside and the case referred back to a different tribunal. The principal parties here are usually the appellant and the Secretary of State. In the case of statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay, they are the employee and employer concerned.
<P>
The amendment seeks to ensure that, in the case of a tribunal whose chairman is not legally qualified, either of the principal parties can express the view that an error in law has occurred. The case must then be referred back, to a different tribunal for determination, allowing vexatious or frivolous appeals to clog up the system. Only one party has to say there was an error in law and the case is reheard automatically. That cannot be right.
<P>
I hope that, in the light of my explanation, hon. Members will agree that the amendment is unneccessary and could act against the efficient running of the appeals system. Amendment No. 119 seeks to ensure that tribunals with two or three members will include at least one member of the same sex as the appellant. We agree that this is desirable in principle. However, members of the Committee will not be surprised to hear me say that we believe that the place for such detailed matters relating to the constitution of the tribunals is in regulations. I assure the Committee that the principles behind the amendment will be considered in drafting the amendments that we intend to make. I gave that assurance earlier, and now give it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Did the Minister intend to say ``in drafting the amendments'', or ``in drafting the regulations''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am sorry: I meant ``in drafting the regulations''. If I said ``amendments'', that was an error and I apologise to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 148 seeks to reduce the possibility of any conflict of interest between the Secretary of State and appeal tribunals in the determination of medical questions. It would preclude a doctor from serving as a member of an appeal tribunal if he has assisted the Secretary of State in determining any medical question in the previous 12 months, whether or not the question was before the appeal tribunal on which he might serve.
<P>
The amendment as drafted is unworkable, as almost every doctor in the country will at some time have offered advice to the Secretary of State on a medical question, and would therefore be debarred from sitting on any tribunal. The new appeal service could not function on such a basis. The amendment seeks to address a more fundamental issue--how people appearing before a tribunal can be sure that they will be treated impartially. They may be worried that a doctor on a tribunal has been involved in their case in some way, and will not give them an unbiased hearing. I hope I can assure the Committee on this point.
<P>
Current regulations preclude a doctor from considering an appeal case in which he has had any involvement, either by providing treatment or by providing reports or information. Those regulations will be retained.
<P>
Tribunal members must be independent and impartial as a condition of their employment. Doctors who are appointed to tribunals act in a professional capacity, and the General Medical Council's guidance on ethics and conflicts of interest would always apply. There have been instances in which doctors who were due to sit on tribunals realise from the papers that they have been involved in that specific case. Those doctors notified the independent tribunal service and withdrew from the hearing, which was obviously then postponed. I am satisfied that doctors are well aware of their obligations, which are laid down by regulations and by the professional and ethical framework within which they work.
<P>
The general question of bias was considered by the social security commissioner in 1995. After exhaustive consideration of the role of doctors in the official adjudication system, the commissioner concluded that natural justice was not compromised by the presence on an appeal tribunal of a doctor who has also provided fee-paid assistance and advice to the Department. Nothing in the Bill changes that position.
<P>
Individual appellants may be worried that a tribunal member has had a previous involvement with them in relation to some aspect of social security. That involvement might have been in connection with a different benefit, but not related to the case before the appeal tribunal. Different benefits, however, have different rules. Medical advice offered in one context does not have to prejudice another matter. Commissioners have specifically addressed that point. In any case, when a doctor or an appellant believes that previous contact between them may affect the impartiality of a hearing, they should bring the matter to the tribunal service's attention.
<P>
Finally, I shall respond briefly to amendment No. 150 to clause 8, which seeks to set out in the Bill what the regulations on the composition of appeal tribunals should include. The regulations would define the qualifications of lawyers sitting on appeal tribunals, and the experience of disability experts who would sit on tribunals with at least one other person. A disability expert--other than a medical practitioner--will be required to hear any appeal that raises a disability question. Similarly, a lawyer with the same qualifications as the existing full-time chairmen would hear any appeal that appeared to raise a legal issue. In practice, most appellants will consider that their appeal raises a legal issue, whether it does or not. Most tribunals, therefore, would include a highly qualified lawyer, irrespective of whether their presence was necessary.
<P>
The amendment would substantially limit the scope for improving the service provided to customers. As I explained to the Committee when we debated clause 4, the current statutory requirement in relation to the composition of existing appeal tribunals has a number of disadvantages. It is inflexible, it is an inefficient use of resources, it makes hearings difficult to arrange, and it contributes to the delays of six months or more from which the system currently suffers. We are committed to introducing an efficient, effective and speedy appeals service. We believe that the amendment would limit flexibility, and would neither benefit the vast majority of our customers nor make the best use of the available resources.
<P>
As I explained in the note to members of the Committee on the composition of appeal tribunals--which I hope hon. Members have had the opportunity to read--the panels are likely to include people who currently sit on appeal tribunals, and who have special skills or experience in dealing with disabled people's needs in a voluntary capacity, or who are themselves disabled.
<P>
We aim to introduce an appeals service that is responsive to those that use it, and that makes better use of resources by focusing expertise on the cases that most need it. It is not necessary for the Bill to specify or differentiate between types of experts. I hope that my lengthy explanation of the Government's view of the amendments has not tired the Committee further, and that Opposition Members will now feel able to refrain from pressing their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We have received some reassurance from the Minister's response, especially from his citing of evidence from an investigation by the social security and child support commissioners, with respect to amendment No. 148. However, I return to the point that justice needs not only to be done but to be seen to be done. If medical practitioners act in two different roles, there is potential for a conflict of interest to be perceived. We are still concerned about the prospect of practitioners regularly and interchangeably fulfilling the two roles.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 150 and in response to the Minister's remarks about six-month delays, it is important to point out that, while we would all wish the appeals process to become swifter, many delays have nothing to do with whether there are three properly qualified people on the panel. I understand that in pilot projects, closer liaison between the Benefits Agency and the appeals service has drastically reduced waiting times for appeals. The Minister is wrong if he means to characterise those of us who want a rigorous and thorough appeals process as opposed to cutting delays. He is wrong to say that our approach would scupper the chance to reduce delays. There are other ways, which we think should be pursued, of reducing them.
<P>
The Minister referred to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``person with experience of disability''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in amendment No. 150 as a disability ``expert''. I suppose that in one sense such a person could be thought of as an expert, but we simply meant a person with some idea of what disability is like. That would not mean scouring the country for the greatest expert on a particular disability, just finding someone with a chance of getting inside the head of the appellant. That does not seem to be an especially onerous requirement for the tribunal system to fulfil.
<P>
In sum, the Minister has failed to deal with the fundamental issue of who decides whether legal qualifications are needed. In the system that he envisages, although a legally qualified person will be involved in some cases, that will not be so in others, because of a decision taken outside the room, without the appellant's being present, and on the basis of the papers alone, that legal expertise would not be needed. That strikes us as a denial of the appellant's right to have access to legal expertise, even where there is only a slim possibility of success. That issue cannot be prejudged outside the room.
<P>
For the reasons I have given, we are not prepared to withdraw the amendment. The issue is fundamental to the Bill.

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 4, line 24, after `tribunals', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
(d) guidance on the meaning of the term ``question of fact of special difficulty'' as used in subsections (4) and (5) below'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 31, in page 4, line 26, delete from `then' to `require' in line 27 and insert `the tribunal shall'.
<P>
No. 19, in page 4, line 33, leave out `member of either panel', and insert `person'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments are concerned with where experts are needed and where facts of special difficulty arise. We all know that this clause and the related ones are mainly about economy and reducing substantially the cost of the tribunal process. The clause is about low-cost, focused compositions of tribunals. It is particularly important to ensure that justice is not lost in the interests of efficiency and economy.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 focuses on the issue of what is a ``fact of special difficulty'' and calls for that to be defined in the Government's regulations. That is of particular importance in the context of a tribunal consisting of a single person. An appellant would have some protection at least if that single person, who may not be legally qualified, was guided by regulations that laid down where items may fall under such facts of special difficulty.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 makes an obvious point. If the tribunal feels that there is a matter, and hopefully has had guidance previously from regulations, which constitutes a fact of special difficulty and needs an expert, it surely must be obliged to call in an expert. The amendment therefore seeks to change the word ``may'' to ``shall''. There seems to be no logic in including the ability to call an expert if one is deemed unnecessary when, as the clause points out, there are specific regulations to the contrary.
<P>
Amendment No. 19, which is perhaps the most controversial, concerns what shall constitute an expert. The clause as drafted requires an expert to be a member of either panel. Our case is that an expert is an expert and then there may well be occasions where the best expert is not a member of either panel. The change in the drafting would certainly permit tribunals to use experts who are in the main members of panels but such narrowing excludes the ability to use someone who is better than a member of such a panel in whatever unique and particular circumstances may arise.
<P>
The overall context of the three amendments is also quite important. We have already focused on the fact that in effect the Secretary of State had virtual power to appoint the president. Schedule 1 makes it clear that the staff likewise will be appointed by the Secretary of State. Those powers reduce the concept of an independent tribunal. That may be justifiable in part in terms of efficiency, streamlining, cost-saving and so forth, but one must focus on the important areas which may require the rights of the applicant to be protected. I commend these amendments to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I rise only briefly to make a point that I made about similar wording earlier in the Bill. It concerns the bizarre wording which suggests that even where it is conceded that a question of fact on which there is ``special difficulty'' arises, it is conceivable that regulations preventing the tribunal from requiring one or more experts to provide assistance would be laid.
<P>
The Minister will recall a similar debate on an earlier clause relating to the ability of the Secretary of State to call in outside expert advice where special difficulty was apparent--the phrase was slightly different but the meaning was much the same. It seems quite bizarre now, as it did on the previous clause, that there is a possibility of regulations that would prevent a tribunal from seeking expert advice where there was special difficulty. Again, I feel sure that there has been a slip of the draftsman's word processor. Without reiterating the earlier arguments, I hope that on reflection the Minister will take my point, as he did earlier, and concede that the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless regulations otherwise provide''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is nonsense in this context; and that the other part of the amendment is quite sensible, in that where an tribunal finds itself in special difficulty, it should require one or more experts to provide assistance--otherwise it is difficult to see the point of the subsection. We assume that it was designed to help out a tribunal that is out of its depth, or thinks that it may be getting so, in which case it would be perfectly legitimate and desirable to seek outside help from experts.
<P>
If that was the intent of the clause, which I assume it must be, the amendments would merely deliver it and are preferable to the confused wording of the clause. The Minister is well aware of the arguments, which were debated during a recent sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 18, surprisingly, introduces a new regulation-making power, to which I thought the Opposition were strongly opposed. We do not think that it is necessary to provide for regulations on these issues. The power for tribunals to refer questions of special difficulty has existed for more than two decades. Current legislation does not provide a legal definition or guidance, nor the regulation-making powers to do so, and none has so far proved necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 would compel an appeal tribunal to require the assistance of one or more experts as defined in subsection (5) where the matter before the tribunal concerns a question of fact or special difficulty. It would remove the tribunal's discretion to decide whether it was appropriate to consult experts. It is proper for a tribunal to apply its own discretion in deciding whether the matter before it would benefit from expert assistance. If the Secretary of State defined in regulations what was ``special'', it could tie people's hands if it did not cover every possible eventuality on which members of the tribunal might feel it appropriate to call in expert evidence. It could also create confusion and a wasteful duplication of expertise. A tribunal member might already have the required expertise, in which case assistance from another expert would be unnecessary. In any case, what one tribunal might find difficult could be thought easy by another, if, for example, its members had considered a similar matter before. The hon. Gentleman has attempted to define special circumstances and apply them in each case, thus losing a tribunal's discretionary powers to decide from its own experience, knowledge and expertise whether it is appropriate to call in experts.
<P>
The amendments could even work to the detriment of the service. By requiring experts to advise on particular cases, the ability of tribunals to provide an efficient and responsive service may be reduced because of ensuing time delays if they believe that they already have the expertise that they require to deal with the case before them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Surely the Minister agrees with me that it is unlikely that the Government would introduce regulations which would stop tribunals seeking expert advise in these circumstances if they thought it appropriate. If the Minister agrees with that, as I think he must, and as he did on a previous clause, he must also agree with me that the words ``unless regulations otherwise provide'' should be taken out of the clause. Will the Minister consider their removal as a possible Government amendment?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> You are welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would allow an appeal tribunal to seek the assistance of any person who appears to the tribunal to have the knowledge or experience to assist it in determining a question of fact or of special difficulty. Under the provisions of clauses 6 and 7, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate will constitute panels of persons to act as members of appeal tribunals throughout Great Britain. The panels will consist of people with a wide range of skills needed to deal with the issues raised in social security, vaccine damage and child support appeals.
<P>
In the vast majority of cases, tribunal members will have the necessary expertise to decide an appeal. However, there may be occasions when issues are raised during the hearing which require expertise that the tribunal members do not possess. Given the wide range of skills and experience on the panels appointed by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate, that expertise would normally be found in other members of the panel. If, exceptionally, advice to assist the tribunal was not available from a panel member, the tribunal could call the expert as a witness. As a witness, an expert would be subject to cross-examination.
<P>
The majority of cases in which expert assistance will be needed will be in appeals raising medical issues. We have made special provision in clause 21 for examinations and reports from medical practitioners, who are not panel members, to assist the tribunal in deciding the appeal. For example, an appeal relating to an industrial disease might require a specialist's opinion and report on a blood condition. Such opinions and reports would be made available to the parties to the appeal and to the tribunal. They would assist the tribunal in dealing with the question of fact and would form part of the evidence to be considered by the tribunal members.
<P>
We have made that special provision in clause 21; on other issues tribunals could always call as a witness an expert in a particular field who is not on the panel. In view of that ability, because we want to retain flexibility and because there is already the power to ensure that experts can be used in that way, I hope that hon. Gentlemen will feel able to withdraw the amendment. I trust that I have covered all the points that they raised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister, but he has not entirely covered our points. On his last point, it seems to us unnecessary to have a contorted arrangement that excludes an expert who is not a member of a panel. It could perfectly well be the other way round, where experts will usually be members of a panel--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the proposal excludes the use of experts when appropriate and when the tribunal service believes that they would benefit the appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The present drafting requires that an expert will be a member of a panel who appears to the appeal tribunal to have greater relevant experience. If the expert has to be a member of either panel, one cannot, by definition, have an expert who is not a member of either panel. The Minister said that the problem could be solved by having witnesses who are not members of either panel, but would a witness have the same function as an expert? Perhaps we are playing with words.
<P>
I want to continue a little further with the two other points. The Minister said that there had been no previous requirement to give regulatory definition to what was a fact of special difficulty. We have not previously had tribunals of one person. The point that I sought to get at was that a claimant who does not really know the law and a tribunal consisting of one person who is not a liar will be all at sea if something complicated comes up. Some degree of regulatory guidance to accompany the new arrangements would be appropriate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne has made the next point. The latitude that the tribunal has with regard to whether it needs an expert is, as the Minister said, dealt with in the reference to where that appears to be the case. If it does not need one, it does not; if it does, why on earth should it not be obliged in the clause to have an expert? I invite a further response from the Minister.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 4, line 24, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Regulations made under subsection (3)(a) above shall provide that any person who brings an appeal under section 13 below shall have the right to object in writing to the composition of the appeal tribunal to a full-time chairman within such time before the appeal is heard as is prescribed and the full-time chairman shall then determine the composition.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment, which I hope will be readily apparent, is to give appellants the right to object to the composition of the appeal tribunal before which they are to appear. In our previous discussions, the Government were unwilling to introduce safeguards with regard to the gender balance, disability experience, legal experience, and almost any feature of the tribunal. It would, therefore, seem reasonable as an absolute stopgap to allow those who will appeal before a tribunal at least to object to what they get. Obviously, if the Minister's assurances about the regulations and the Government's good intentions are borne out in practice, that right will be exercised only rarely. It is however, an important right given the considerations that appellants might want to be taken into account in an appeal. They should at least be given the opportunity to express an opinion about the panel members who will pass judgment on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendment seeks to provide a right of objection for the appellant on the composition of the tribunal that will hear his case. Appellants would be required to write to a full-time chairman, within a prescribed time limit. A full-time chairman would then be required to consider the objection and determine the composition of the tribunal.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and, by introducing a formal process for considering objections, it would run contrary to the Government's stated aim of speeding up the appeal system. The extra work that would be generated would increase appeal delays. Telling appellants of a right to object is likely to encourage meritless objections to the constitution of the tribunal. It is also possible that objections would be routinely lodged against any panel member who were perceived to be unsympathetic to the appellant's viewpoint.
<P>
It is appropriate for the president to draw panel members to hear appeals, as clause 8(1) provides. The information that is provided to appellants would then tell them how their appeals will be handled, including what sort of person will hear which sorts of cases. It will always be open to appellants to suggest that certain types of expertise are necessary in their particular case. The key will be appellants giving all the relevant information as soon as possible, which will ensure that tribunals are appropriately constituted. We hope that exactly that information will be made available at an early stage--in discussion with advocates' groups and before the appeal is heard--and that the formation of appeals will address the issues that your amendment suggests should be dealt with through a formal appeal. We believe that that would be cumbersome--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale. I am certain that it is not.
<P>
If new information requiring specialist advice emerges at a hearing, it could be adjourned. That is no different from what happens now. I hope that, with those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances. I am beginning to develop a little nervous twitch which occurs when I hear the word ``meritless''. We have heard about meritless appeals; now we are hearing about meritless objections to tribunal members. Who is deciding what is meritless? One senses the return of the smoke-filled room.
<P>
The amendment would allow the full-time chairman to determine the composition of the tribunal when an appellant writes in. If the appeal was obviously flippant, the chairman could state that the points were not substantive and the appeal could continue without significant delay. However, if a substantive point is made, it should be taken into account.
<P>
The point is important but, given the number of Divisions this sitting, we shall not pursue it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I did not realise during our earlier discussions that we would repeat the arguments so quickly. I shall try not to convey an air of deja vu, but as we are approaching the lunch break I shall make a proposal to the Minister. It would expedite progress if, instead of preparing the promised letter on the definition of ``misbehaviour'' between now and 4.30 pm, he asked his able civil servants to come up with examples to enlighten us when we return.
<P>
I make that sensible proposition because, rather than waiting a day or two for the letter, it would be better if the Minister came up with the information today--it is as germane to the amendment as it was to previous ones. Given that he has said that this is not a new area of legislation, it should not be terribly difficult for civil servants to come up with helpful examples to guide us. [Interruption.] Does the Minister want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman wants to pursue triviality into the afternoon sitting. I have given an assurance that we will make progress on the matter, but I will not give an assurance that that can be done by 4.30 pm. In the light of that, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
