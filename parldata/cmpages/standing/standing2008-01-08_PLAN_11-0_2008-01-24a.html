Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley.
It was brought to my attention that I gave out some potentially
misleading information about the proposed harbours threshold in
Tuesday&#146;s debate on amendments Nos. 81 and
82.</div>
					<a name="08012464000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I referred in my
response to the analysis and modelling carried out by the Department
which supported the proposed thresholds. I now understand that, while
analysis was done through broad assessments before the proposed
thresholds were set, it did not include any formal modelling. Modelling
carries a specific technical meaning that does not apply in this
case.</div>
					<a name="08012464000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that clarification is helpful to the Committee, in the
interest of setting the record straight. I apologise if my comment
caused any misunderstanding. I have written to Sir John, the Clerk and
the hon. Members for Rochford and Southend, East and for
Beckenham.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Illsley. I previously raised the matter of the Welsh
framework clauses that are to be included in the Bill. I understand
from discussions via the usual channels that it is now proposed that
the new clauses will not be produced until towards the end of the
discussion of the Bill. My concern is that the new framework powers may
have an impact on other provisions that have already been discussed. I
seek your guidance Mr. Illsley, as to whether that is a
proper method of proceeding, given the impact it may well have had on
previous
discussions.</div>

regard to the Welsh clauses, I am advised that as there are no new
clauses on that matter yet, it is not a point of order for me. However,
I am sure that the Government will have noted what the hon. Member for
Clwyd, West said, and perhaps discussions through the usual channels
might elicit further information. Unfortunately, it is not a point of
order for
me.</div>

that, for the purposes of legislation, those authorities are already
covered under the councils that are included in the Bill. Our concern
was about two-tier areas, where county councils are also involved. That

amendments.</div>

							<a name="08012464000261"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Illsley, and back to our deliberations about various clauses, where
they will appear and the important issues under
consideration.</div>
					<a name="08012464000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would add &#147;adjacent land&#148; to the provisions of
the clause. We are talking not about loft conversions, but about fairly
major developments. It may be clearly understood by most that people
with an interest in property and land adjoining a development will be
consulted, but I am not sure that the clause is clear enough about who
should be involved in the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08012464000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that the provisions for people who have any of
the interests set out in the clause because of land that is directly
affected also apply to those who have an interest in neighbouring land.
Clearly, there will be differences in what counts as adjacent land. If
there is a large holding, adjacent land could be a considerable
distance away from the development or it could be relatively close. I
want to explore whether the ministerial team can justify not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>including the amendment, in the hope that anybody who will be affected
by such a development will have the opportunity to be fully involved in
the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08012464000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000262"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Welcome back, Mr. Illsley. You sound a
lot better than you did on
Tuesday.</div>
					<a name="08012464000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will add
some comments in support of the amendment. We have made it clear that
we are concerned that consultation is as wide and proper as possible.
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that anybody who could be
understood to have an interest in the development is consulted and can
make representations. On that basis, we support
it.</div>
					<a name="08012464000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000263"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I hope that I can give the sort of explanation
that has been asked for and that the hon. Members for North Cornwall
and for Beckenham will see that the amendment is not necessary to meet
their concerns.</div>
					<a name="08012464000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to clause 42 on the duty to consult the local community, clauses 37 to
39 set out a duty to consult people and bodies that would be affected
by a development. That includes local authorities and anybody who might
be entitled to a claim for compensation or for nuisance. Where a
development would have a material detrimental effect on adjacent land,
those with an interest will automatically be
consulted.</div>
					<a name="08012464000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Committee is aware, there is a broad power to prescribe statutory
consultees. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe will
be interested to know that we will specify statutory consultees for
certain sorts of infrastructure&#151;we had the same argument about
local transport authorities in our previous sitting.</div>
					<a name="08012464000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations will ensure
that those bodies that should be consulted will be consulted, although
we will not require consultation if they are unlikely to have an
interest. In drawing up the draft regulations, I will ensure that we
consider the points made by members of this Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012464000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for North
Cornwall and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy were concerned about whether
those living close to a development that could be detrimental would be
consulted. The answer is that under common law, people in possession of
property&#151;landowners or tenants&#151;are entitled to the quiet
enjoyment of their land. If someone interferes with that quiet
enjoyment by creating smells, sounds, pollution or any other hazard
that extends beyond the boundaries of the property on which that
activity is taking place, the affected party may be able to claim on
the grounds of nuisance.</div>
					<a name="08012464000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35(5)(c) provides that
such people should be consulted. Together with other provisions in the
Bill, it will capture the vast majority of people about whom the hon.
Member for North Cornwall is concerned. I hope that that reassures hon.
Members.</div>
					<a name="08012464000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000264"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply.
However, he has not reassured me. I am clear that the clause sets out
specific definitions of what constitutes a nuisance and he said that it
would capture the vast majority of people affected, but we need to
legislate for everyone.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000265"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I was conscious that we should not double back
over ground that we have already covered, but people living in the
vicinity who would not be statutory consultees will be included in the
pre-application consultation and be able to put their views to the
promoter, who will carry out the publicity. They will also have the
opportunity to put their views to the infrastructure planning
commission when it considers the application. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman understands and accepts that
point.</div>
					<a name="08012464000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000266"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> There are clear provisions in clause 39 for
people who have an interest in the land, but people who are not
resident in the area may also have an interest. The same provisions
should also apply to those who have adjacent land who may not be
directly aware of what is going on in the community, although they have
a long-standing interest because of ownership of adjacent land or other
rights to it.</div>
					<a name="08012464000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have felt it necessary to apply the provisions to those who
have a direct interest in the land affected, which implies that things
may be going on above and beyond the standard consultation. If that is
so, and extra effort is being made to ensure that pre-application
publicity reaches people who may not reside in the area but have an
interest in the land, I am concerned that the proposal is not extended
to people who have an interest in adjacent land. I am thinking of cases
of people or associations who own patches of land that they do not
visit very often, therefore they would not see notices or publicity in
the local paper. The Minister has not reassured me on those
matters.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I beg to move
amendment No. 62, in clause 40, page 19, line 35, leave out
&#145;28&#146; and insert &#145;56&#146;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>
					<a name="08012464000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a fairly straightforward
amendment, which does not need much explanation. The timetable for
consultation is clearly set out in the clause. Subsection (2)
states:</div>
					<a name="08012464000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
deadline notified under subsection (1) must not be earlier than the end
of the period of 28 days that begins with the day after the day on
which the person receives the consultation documents.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012464000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Knowing local government as I do, 28 days
is not exactly a lifetime, and this is very much a probing amendment to
get the Minister to reassure the Committee that normally we will be
looking at a longer period than that. I know it is difficult for him to
speculate on the matter, but my concern is that local government might
not be up to speed. Local authorities are often overworked and for all
I know the measure may mean a lot of extra work for them. I have
suggested 56 days, although it could have been longer or a figure in
the middle. I simply want to know what the Minister foresees will be
the median time when the notices will be
issued.</div>
					<a name="08012464000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000286"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I support the need to probe the Minister on the
matter. The hon. Gentleman makes a point about the speed at which local
government can move, but I am conscious that there are people for whom
a deadline of 28 days could be exceedingly difficult. It is not beyond
the wit of man or woman to work out that should it be a busy time on
the farm&#151;because so many of these infrastructure projects are
likely to be on farming land&#151;farmers will have other things that
they need to do rather than responding to an application that would
affect them.</div>
					<a name="08012464000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
elderly person whose land was affected could, as we know from our
constituency work, take a lot longer than the time specified to
respond. I have noticed personally that as people get older it takes
them a long time to consider a matter and get their heads around its
implications before they can take action by obtaining legal or other
professional advice. I am generally supportive of an extension on the
grounds that we want to ensure that the pre-application process is as
effective as possible&#151;a point I have made before&#151;and we
are coming to amendments that try to make it more effective. However,
if the process is constrained too tightly its effectiveness might be
lessened and there might be more cause for complaint, which could be
legal or in the form of a complaint at the inquiry. That would lead to
an inevitable delay, and the purpose of the Bill is to reduce those
delays. If the Minister could reassure us of his intentions on the
provision, I should be happy not to press the amendment, as, I am sure,
would the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000287"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I join hon. Members in raising the issue of time
constraints. As the hon. Lady has just said, we are dealing with
well-resourced and well-funded companies or public bodies that are
pursuing development and have recourse to legal and planning advice,
and although we might not want to talk in confrontational terms they
are up against local people and individuals who do not have such
advice. To expect those local people to fall in line with a tight time
scale of 28 days is asking a great deal.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>
					<a name="08012464000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Factors such as periods of
illness or the pre-consultation stage happening during the height of
the holiday season, when people could be away for two or three weeks,
could affect someone&#146;s ability to respond. If the whole point of
the pre-consultation stage is to ensure fairness, openness and that
everyone has a chance to have their say before moving into the formal
application, we ought to allow greater time to get  it
right.</div>
					<a name="08012464000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reflecting on
the evidence that we received before we began our clause-by-clause
deliberations, hon. Members will remember that the gentlemen who
represented National Grid and power transmission said that for them the
key was to know when an application would be decided. They need to know
the timetable so that they have some sense of hope that the application
would be resolved at some point. It does not necessarily have to be
done in five or nine months or whatever, so we do not have to focus too
much on driving forward the time scale; the important thing is that
people are aware that there is a time scale and will work to it. With
that in mind, I hope that the Minister will consider this and future
amendments that address the time scale and its impact on people who
have to live with the development for a long time, and ensure that they
can play a full part in the pre-application
consultation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000288"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Clearly, consultees need sufficient time to
respond to a promoter&#146;s consultation, but it is equally
important that there should be an expectation and requirement that they
give the advice or information that a promoter needs to develop their
proposals in a timely manner. It could be that someone preparing an
application would be dependent upon a statutory consultee, such as a
local authority, for specific information, so the principle of having a
specific time period to help concentrate the mind and ensure that
happens is important. For those who commented on the White Paper, the
belief that a time limit was important was almost universal.</div>
					<a name="08012464000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">For promoters and many
statutory consultees, the formal pre-application consultation is
unlikely to be either the start or end of involvement in the process.
In most cases, the promoter is likely to have been in touch to consult
them beforehand and will continue to do so during the process. After
the pre-application consultation period, any statutory consultee is
likely to continue to be involved in the process of considering an
application.</div>
					<a name="08012464000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
clear, the 28 day period is the statutory minimum, and I think that the
hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy understands that point well. It
is obvious to all members of the Committee that big infrastructure
projects will be more complex than other projects, and there may be a
strong case in such circumstances for a longer pre-application
consultation period. In such cases, the promoter may decide that it is
appropriate and in their interests as
well.</div>
					<a name="08012464000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the
commission has the power to give guidance about how to comply with the
consultation, and may decide in specific circumstances to advise a
longer consultation period if it believes that would be helpful.
Obviously, a promoter would want to take that into account, not least
because the commission will decide whether an application is fit for
consideration, so any advice the commission may give will be telling at
that point.</div>

Llwyd:
						</b> As always, the Minister has been helpful, and I am
sure that what he said has been noted. However, if an individual, for
whatever reason, had been absent for a good part of the 28 days, would
they be able to apply to the IPC or to someone, to say, &#147;Look,
due to extenuating circumstances I have not been able to take advice. I
have not been able to look at this properly. Can I, therefore, apply

						</b> Anyone in such broad potential circumstances might
not be in a position to argue, in their single case, for an extension
or alteration of what was set out as an appropriate time period for the
pre-application consultation. However, they would be able to make a
representation, if not to the promoter during the pre-application
process, directly to the commission, as part of the process that it
will undertake in its consideration of any application, which we will
look at

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000292"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Given that the Committee has agreed that there
should be an infrastructure planning commission, the provision for
consultation with the IPC prior to public consultation is to be
welcomed, and would seem to be good practice. It will be a big change
for many people, because we are probably all aware that many planning
departments and local authorities are so overwhelmed that they
positively discourage discussions before an application. In principle,
pre-consultation discussion between the promoter and the IPC is a good
idea.</div>
					<a name="08012464000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I would like the Minister to reassure us on one or two points. One is
the extent of the application. Would an applicant find themselves in
difficulty with the commission if it emerged later on that information
the applicant may inadvertently not have realised was needed was not
forthcoming? To get a positive response, any applicant would obviously
want to be as forthcoming as possible but, with the best will in the
world, there are times when new information appears. We have already
discussed the potential impact of that situation, and I am sure we will
refer to it
again.</div>
				
					<a name="08012464000225"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
					<a name="08012464000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect is whether, in having these discussions with the
commission, an applicant will be able to suggest that it would be
helpful if none of the information gets into the public domain while
they are still thinking about the application. In any well-managed
project, it is crucial that the information is managed properly. Any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>applicant will have serious experience of how that information should be
managed. They could make inquiries of the IPC that are exceedingly
sensitive. Such applicants would appreciate indications on the degree
of confidentiality there would be for any question that they ask the
IPC, however far-fetched and unlikely what they are talking about
proves to be.</div>
					<a name="08012464000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
applicant could be dealing with an area of new technology. We are not
expecting that an application for a nuclear power station will suggest
anything other than the tried and trusted technology. However, it is
not impossible that somebody might manage to create nuclear fusion.
Should there be a planning application for a nuclear fusion plant, it
would be revolutionary and there would be implications for it. As I
have said before, I am no scientist, but one can imagine that there
would be implications for such an application that nobody has got their
head around, other than those very bright people who can work out
nuclear fusion. If there were such a proposal, an applicant would have
to know that it would remain totally confidential at that
stage.</div>
					<a name="08012464000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given an
extreme example, but it is not difficult to envisage a situation in
which an applicant might wish to try out a new technology that would
have implications beyond those that anybody with an interest in the
land or any direct interest has thought about. It is that requirement
for confidentiality about which I want the Minister to reassure
us.</div>
					<a name="08012464000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000293"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady has set her concerns in such general
terms that it is quite difficult for me to say that we can legislate to
cover them. However, I will make two points in response. First, were
someone to invent a nuclear fusion process, I doubt that the first
people to hear about it would be members of the IPC in relation to a
particular application. Were a new technology developed in the nuclear
or the renewable sectors, there would be more of an issue over whether
the relevant national policy statement was sufficiently comprehensive
and up to date. Therefore, I think that the provisions of parts 1 and
2, in relation to national policy statements, are more relevant to her
concerns than the problem of
confidentiality.</div>
					<a name="08012464000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
this is a quite narrow clause. It is about the duty of promoters to
provide certain information to the commission in relation to the
pre-application consultation. It is much more narrowly drawn than the
general concern that the hon. Lady
raises.</div>
					<a name="08012464000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000294"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those points. I
understand the reason for the clause and do not think that we will vote
against it because it is necessary. However, the Minister is dismissing
my concerns too easily. I accept that if somebody were to come up with
workable nuclear fusion, it would be all over the front pages of even
the most popular newspapers. My inquiry was about the possible
consequences, were a revolutionary new technology to be developed. If
there was a nuclear fusion plant, the whole of the grid could be
affected. That would have serious implications. If an applicant went to
the IPC, he would want that to remain confidential.</div>
					<a name="08012464000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am speaking in broad terms.
Often it could be a very little thing. The implication of a development

<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>could have an impact that no one had considered because&#151;although
I cannot believe that this would happen&#151;the applicant had
discovered that the site contained some unique flora or fauna. My hon.
Friend the Member for Newbury mentioned the Newbury bypass on several
occasions. That road was held up on just that sort of basis and we have
seen it time and time again.. I can accept what the Minister is saying
in principle, but I seek an assurance that the IPC&#146;s code of
conduct will have serious controls over
confidentiality.</div>
					<a name="08012464000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000295"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I think I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s
concerns although I do not share them either in general terms or in
relation to the adequacy of the Bill<i class="I">.</i> We will shortly debate
aspects of clause 45(4), which allows the Secretary of State to make
regulations about whether information about a request by a promoter for
advice must or may be disclosed. I do not entirely share the hon.
Lady&#146;s concern because the developer will have to make public
such information as is needed to undertake a proper consultation and to
allow the public and others with an interest to understand fully and
come to a view of the nature of the application. The IPC will want to
ensure that that happens. I understand what she is saying about
confidentiality for the developer, but he will have to disclose the
range of relevant information so that people can understand what is
likely to be proposed. I should have thought that the hon. Lady and the
Committee would wish to see us insist on that as we try to do in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012464000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000296"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am sorry that this is turning into a bit of
dialogue. I will try to draw it to a conclusion. A developer would wish
to be in control of the information process. He would not wish to be
driven by the inadvertent disclosure of information by the IPC before
he wanted it to come into the public domain. That is where the
confidentiality is. I am assuming that a developer will go to the IPC
before he goes to public consultation, so the IPC will have prior
information. But it is surely not for the IPC to publish such
information. It should remain in the control of the developer. If the
IPC is not under a strict regime of confidentiality, that information
stream would be affected. That is why I am so concerned to have
assurances from the Minister that the IPC would be bound by
confidentiality.</div>
					<a name="08012464000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000297"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I have no interest in keeping this dialogue going
unnecessarily and if it helps the hon. Lady, I will reflect on what she
said. But at the pre-application stage the promoter has responsibility
for the materials that are produced. It is his responsibility to ensure
that the consultation is thorough and properly conducted. The
commission has the role of offering advice on that, which promoters
would want to follow. It is not the commission&#146;s responsibility
to produce information on the consultation. That is rightly the
promoter&#146;s responsibility. I will reflect further on what the
hon. Lady said about confidentiality and if there is a serious concern
we will return to it
later.</div>

						</b> I am pleased to hear that attendance at our
Committee sittings is having a beneficial effect on your health,
Mr.
Illsley.</div>
					<a name="08012464000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
previous amendments, I raised the issue of the Secretary of State
rather than the commission being responsible for the ultimate decision
on applications for national infrastructure projects, which the
Government may have thought was contrary to their intentions. However,
these amendments go very much with the grain of what they
intend.</div>
					<a name="08012464000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
Town Planning Institute has been helpful to me in drafting the
amendments and helping me to understand their general intention, which
is to enhance the Bill to ensure that communities have a genuine
opportunity to identify the impact of proposals at the earliest
possible stage, to comment on them and to raise concerns about siting
and design. It is relatively easy to make changes to projects at an
early stage; any adverse impact identified by the community can be laid
down very clearly at that point and the applicants must respond
formally to it.</div>
					<a name="08012464000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 326 relates to
the pre-application stage. Pre-application consultation is essential;
issues that may result in a fight at a later stage, with the two sides
hardly listening to each other, can be dealt with in time to reach a
compromise before things go any further. That would improve the entire
process.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08012464000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Communities
should have the opportunity to identify issues at the earliest stage.
The applicant must respond to those concerns formally, and if
mitigation is not possible, explain why. Despite the importance that
many planning authorities now attach to pre-consultation on ordinary
planning applications, all too often those processes are neither
effective nor real, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>we as individual MPs have seen. They are sometimes little more than a
sham. Although the community raises concerns, the applicant might
hardly attempt to respond in any meaningful way and sometimes ignores
them by talking about anything other than those concerns when
responding to the planning committee. The amendments, therefore, would
require the applicant to respond to such concerns in a proper way. They
would not, of course, have to agree with those concerns, but they would
have to answer
them.</div>

Llwyd:
						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument

explain one thing. Subsection (3)(b) of new clause 8 states
that</div>
					<a name="08012464000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;mitigating action
would be unreasonable due to disproportionate cost, adverse collateral
effects on other interests or because it would be otherwise not in the
public interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012464000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
event that the mitigating action is not taken, does the application
fail?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000304"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> No. In the end, the issues of whether the applicant
has taken reasonable steps to mitigate and why an applicant does not
feel that mitigation is possible because of cost or other reasons are
matters for the commission to take on board and determine. In the
amendments, we are trying to structure the concerns of the community
and the responses to those concerns and make the applicant respond
formally to them by saying either that they can be mitigated, or if
they cannot, why not. Of course, the commission will have that
information to enable it to make a better decision and can, in the end,
do so with conditions, such as deciding that mitigation is necessary,
despite what the applicant has said.</div>
					<a name="08012464000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads us
to amendments Nos. 327 and 328, which are linked together
appropriately. The process of identifying the issues from the community
and the applicant&#146;s response with regard to mitigation or
non-mitigation continues beyond the initial pre-application
consultation into the commission&#146;s hearings. That process
continues in the commission&#146;s initial consideration, as laid out
in clause 80, and then in the first meetings at which the commission
brings the applicant and the main objectors together.</div>
					<a name="08012464000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">At those stages, the process of
identifying the impact that the community is concerned about and
deciding for or against mitigation for the applicant are considered as
part of the commission&#146;s initial view and the initial hearing
that it holds. Having had the first meetings and the formal hearings,
that process takes those issues through into the later processes of the
commission&#146;s consideration.</div>
					<a name="08012464000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might have views
about the appropriateness of that process and the wording of the
amendments, but they are an attempt to ensure that communities see that
there is less value in simply waiting and using objections as
obstructions later in the process, and that there is every benefit in
raising objections at the earliest possible stage, when concerns over
details can be dealt with more easily and when the applicant is likely
to be more responsive in dealing with those concerns. That also means
that there is less benefit in simply trying to obstruct, rather than
engage with, those opposed, and that applies to the applicant as well.
There is much more benefit in trying to engage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>with the community and address concerns, rather than trying to ignore
them and hope that somehow they will go away, be pushed to one side or
not be properly focused on.</div>
					<a name="08012464000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful to target
and focus not only at the pre-application stage, but in the remaining
stages of the commission&#146;s initial consideration and at the
formal hearings themselves. With the amendments and the new clause, I
am trying to lay down a process that has two fundamental objectives:
one is to make the Government&#146;s approach more effective and
focused on the issues of real concern, and the other is to improve the
perception, and the reality, that the community is involved. Any
concerns that the community has should not simply be pushed to one side
and ignored, but given proper attention and a proper
response.</div>

							<a name="08012464000305"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> This group of proposals is exceedingly important. I
congratulate the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe for getting to
the Clerks before we did on this issue. Unless the Minister comes up
with a miracle, I will be pressing the amendments that I tabled. We
think, as does the hon. Gentleman, that if we are to make any new
system work, the duty to consult must be widened to include the duty to
mitigate.</div>
					<a name="08012464000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
best developers already seek to mitigate. I referred earlier to the
Kent Wildlife Trust&#146;s negotiation on a grid application. It
managed to achieve the realignment of cable routes, to have the work
timed to avoid the impacts on internationally important populations of
migratory birds and protect breeding marsh harriers. It received a
commitment to enhance the works to encourage biodiversity. It achieved
those things because of its ability to negotiate with a responsible
applicant before the
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08012464000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My thinking
on this area is influenced by a case in which a bottleneck was to be
relieved on our overcrowded railways when Eurostar came through my
constituency. There was a need to unblock the bottleneck at a point
where the railway crossed a busy road with a station immediately on the
other
side.</div>

							<a name="08012464000307"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for identifying
the famous Shortlands, because I will be describing it in great detail.
This case is a model of how such projects should be dealt with. Not
only was there the busy road and the bridge with the station on the far
side, we had green open space, some social housing, some detached
houses and blocks of flats. There was just about every aspect that
would concern a local
population.</div>
					<a name="08012464000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">What was
so impressive was that before the application was put in for the
underpass that was required, consultants were brought in by
Railtrack&#151;rather than Network Rail. Well done to Railtrack for
having had the foresight to do that. Before the application was put in,
the consultants knew all the trees, animals, and flora and fauna in the
open space.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000309"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Indeed, they probably christened many of them. The
consultants had also worked out exactly when the work needed to be
done, what impact it would have on the local residents and how to
mitigate that impact. For instance, as the social housing was closest
to where the heaviest work would take place, and by and large, railways
are mended at weekends, the residents were offered money to go away for
those weekends. For example, the developers would say, &#147;We will
pay for you to go away in weeks two, five, nine and 12.&#148; The
work was actually so fascinating that very few people took up the offer
to go away and instead watched what was going
on.</div>
					<a name="08012464000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The residents of
the blocks of flats were asked what could be done to mitigate the bad
impact. Most of the blocks decided that they wanted secure parking,
which is perhaps a reflection of the residents&#146; concerns. With
the owners of the detached houses, it was decided what needed to be
done, and remedies were put in place. The local council was the only
objector when it came to the planning inquiry, as it would have liked a
widened road at that stage. But, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd
Nant Conwy said, that is one of those areas where there could be no
agreement, so it went to the planning inquiry and was dealt with
speedily.</div>
					<a name="08012464000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dare I say
that the only delay occurred in the Department for Transport, which
also happened to be led by the then Deputy Prime Minister, and we were
all agog at the speed with which he made his decision on that planning
application. If it can be done in such a complex situation, I do not
see why it cannot be done for every planning application. I am sure
that that is what the Minister is hoping the responsible developers
working on infrastructure projects will do, but unless he can reassure
me that precisely that high quality of mitigation and resolution of
problems before they get to a planning inquiry is covered by the term
&#147;consultation&#148;, I will be keen for my hon. Friends to
support the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08012464000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000310"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I am fascinated by the topographical detail of my
hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, but would she not accept that there
is a close analogy between how effective consultation can work, and
ineffective consultation cannot, in the transfer of social housing to
new landlords? Where the council does its work well and everyone is
consulted, often those transfers go through because people&#146;s
fears have been allayed, but where that is not done effectively, a no
vote is often provoked. The irony is that a no vote is often to the
detriment of the tenants
themselves.</div>
					<a name="08012464000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000311"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I could not agree more. This may not contribute
towards getting the discussion back into order, but my constituents
were also the beneficiaries of social housing transfer early on:
Broomleigh housing association is streets ahead of many associations in
the service that it delivers to its residents. That shows how good
consultation can
work.</div>
					<a name="08012464000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
on the subject of the planning applications that we are discussing, we
want not only to consult but to resolve problems, so that the number of
objections to the applications can be limited, and the whole process
speeded up. In a sense, I think that the Department has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>missed a trick by wishing to go down the quango route, rather than
improving the way that the current system can be made to
work.</div>
					<a name="08012464000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
implicit concern is that, where a statutory agency is the applicant, as
I understand it, it is already somewhat constrained in how it can
negotiate on compensation when it needs to buy up land property, as is
the case for the Highways Agency. A closer look at that area is also
needed. Obviously, the private sector can do deals, but it is more
difficult for statutory or regulated organisations to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012464000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the
result of not only wide, good, willing consultation but mitigation is
that the front-end loading cost probably equals the back-end costs
involved in application, challenge, judicial review, and all the other
lengthy costs that have so dragged out our planning system. Within the
system as it stands, if we could get that form of consultation and
mitigation in place, the system would automatically speed up. That is
why I support our amendments so
strongly.</div>
					<a name="08012464000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
hon. Members understand that we feel very strongly that the Minister
should accept the amendments and that we will invite the Committee to
vote on all of them so we can at least try to get the Government to
understand what we need in the planning system&#151;whether or not we
change
it.</div>

							<a name="08012464000312"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I very much welcome the fact that hon. Members
have tabled the amendments and new clause 8. I congratulate the hon.
Lady on finding something positive to say about that popular
Conservative legacy to the nation&#151;Railtrack. She did well to
think of something.</div>
					<a name="08012464000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause and amendments get to the heart of the process of
pre-application consultation. There have obviously been many areas of
disagreement, and further matters of disagreement will arise about how
that should operate and be improved. However, there has been agreement
that the process of pre-application consultation is a positive aspect
of the Bill and will ensure that the handling of such important
planning applications is conducted more efficiently and effectively.
Therefore, it is even more important to ensure that the process is
absolutely right and that, acting on the Minister&#146;s assurances
that the process will be effective and will reach everybody in the
community, problems identified by the local community are taken on
board by the developer. Even if there cannot be an agreed resolution,
at least that has been stated up front. The new clause and amendments
would be particularly useful additions and I hope that the Minister
accepts them. If he does not, I will certainly add my support to that
of other hon. Members in seeking to make him do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012464000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000313"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I add my strong support to the amendments. It is
sensible, it will add considerably to the streamlining of the process,
and it will give great reassurance to residents who might be affected
by large-scale developments. My hon. Friend mentioned a positive
experience that was local to her. I would like to mention an example in
my constituency which was determined only this week: an application for
the inevitable wind farm. As the Committee has probably gathered, there
are a lot of applications for wind farms in my constituency. This 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>one was for a large wind farm&#151;not quite as large as those that
would be determined under the new procedure, but nevertheless a
significant development. In that case, there was grave concern about
the potential impact of the development on flooding. A flood risk
assessment was not done and the proposal was that flooding should be
dealt with when granting planning permission by inserting a suitable
condition to the extent that the developer should take all necessary
steps to address the flood
risk.</div>
					<a name="08012464000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was clearly and understandably completely unacceptable to local
residents. Considerable reassurance would have been given to local
residents if, as is proposed by the new clause, the developer was under
a positive obligation to address the concerns of local residents about
flood impact and if applicants had to state to the planning committee
what they intended to do to address those concerns&#151;for example,
in terms of flood impact assessments and the necessary works resulting
from those. As my hon. Friend said, that would have given considerable
reassurance to local residents, speeded up the procedure and taken an
important element of local opposition out of the equation.</div>
					<a name="08012464000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In discussing
the new clause, I feel that my hon. Friend and I have illustrated
opposite sides of the coin. The net effect of both of our experiences
is that if a developer can address local concerns at an early stage and
can show to the planning authority what proposals he is making for
addressing those concerns, we will have not only considerably more
contented residents but a faster and more streamlined application
procedure. I hope that the Minister will accept the new
clause.</div>

Press coming on.</div>
					<a name="08012464000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe was absolutely right
when he said that the pre-application stage in our proposals and the
Bill is essential. He made a good general argument for that new stage
when he said that it should discourage objections being used at later
stages simply to obstruct progress in the consideration of any
application and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>should encourage those with concerns or objections to raise them earlier
in the process, when there may be more of an opportunity to consider
them.</div>
					<a name="08012464000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 44 is
therefore important because it requires promoters to have regard to
responses to the consultation. It is backed by clause 32, which
requires that an application must also be accompanied by a consultation
report which, among other things, shows how the promoter has taken into
account the points and the results of the consultation. It is precisely
to deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s worry that promoters may not
respond to concerns that have been raised in a proper way that clauses
44 and 32 are in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012464000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Showing how a
promoter has taken into account the results of the consultation would
include any changes the applicant has made to mitigate the effects
of  the original proposal. The hon. Lady, in the
example  of Shortlands&#151;backed to the hilt by the hon.
Gentleman&#151;and in the example of the Kent Wildlife Trust
demonstrated the value in the pre-application duty to consult, but she
did not make the case for the duty to mitigate or for a prescriptive
requirement to report on all the identified impacts to be on the face
of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012464000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">

Healey:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>But I am not convinced by
it.</div>
					<a name="08012464000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">To reinforce the
combined operation of clauses 44 and 32, there is also the duty for the
promoter to have regard to any guidance that he may be given about
pre-application consultation by the Secretary of State or the
commission. Moreover, the commission must ultimately be satisfied that
the pre-application consultation has been done properly before it
accepts any application from a promoter. There is a power to guide and
advise. There is also a pretty substantial point at which the
commission may decide that the promoter has not done the job properly
and so declines the application.</div>
					<a name="08012464000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reinforces the measure
with a strong incentive for the promoter to take the pre-application
process seriously and to get it right within the framework. As my hon.
Friend rightly said, it is the role of the commission during the
inquiry to consider the application in light both of the national
statements and of any potential local impacts, including appropriate
mitigation of those impacts that the promoter may be proposing to take
as part of the application. As he said, this is the proper role for the
infrastructure planning commission in its decision-taking role over an
application. Where local impacts should be mitigated, the commission
can set out the actions to be taken by a promoter as part of any
subsequent consent order.</div>

application to application. I know that he was not with the Committee

					<a name="08012464000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the combination of the
two clauses in this Bill, together with the capacity for the commission

the duties for consultation, but avoids being over-prescriptive in the

							<a name="08012464000324"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> May I go back to what my hon. Friend thinks is the
requirement of the legislation as it stands, particularly the second
part of clause 44? It talks about the applicant having to have regard
to any relevant responses. Does that mean that at that stage the
applicant will have to go through the responses from any objectors from
the community in general and reply in detail as to how they will
mitigate those objections, or explain why no mitigation is necessary?
Is there likely to be further ministerial guidance&#151;he mentioned
that when we were talking about the commission&#151;once the
legislation is passed to flesh out and enhance what is on the face of
the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="08012464000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000325"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s second
question is yes. There is also likely to be, I suspect, guidance from
the commission, although that will be a matter for the
commission.</div>
					<a name="08012464000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
my hon. Friend&#146;s first question is that there is the duty to
consult in the pre-application phase; there is the duty to take into
account in the way that it is done any advice and guidance that may be
issued by the Secretary of State or the commission; and there is the
duty, as part of the application itself, to demonstrate, through a
report on the consultation, not just that the consultation has been
undertaken, but how the promoter has taken into account the points that
have been raised and the results of the consultation. That may include
any changes that the applicant has made to mitigate the effects of the
original proposal. However, it would not be right to include what the
hon. Lady argued for, which is a duty to
mitigate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000326"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I shall still press the amendment to a vote, because
while the Minister has done a valiant job in trying to explain that an
applicant will have to mitigate, it would be much clearer if that
requirement were in the Bill. I can foresee a situation in which there
is confusion between consultation and mitigation. Until the hon. Member
for Sheffield, Attercliffe intervened, I thought that the Minister was
going down that
road.</div>
					<a name="08012464000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
clause, any mitigation will potentially be decided at the inquiry stage
by the IPC, rather than having been agreed to and put in place before
the applicant comes to the IPC. Agreeing on mitigation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>before the inquiry would be infinitely more sensible. I am sure that
responsible applicants would not object to a process under which
mitigation must be put in place and signed off with the interested
parties and then reported to the inquiry. It would then not be an issue
for the inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08012464000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other area that strikes me and which the Minister did not address is
the position of statutory bodies, such as the Highways Agency, compared
with those in the private sector. As I understand it, such bodies are
considerably more constrained in mitigation because of rules on the
levels of compensation that they can pay. An awful lot of mitigation is
about adequate compensation being agreed between the promoter and the
individual who is affected. Many of the statutory organisations do not
have the flexibility that private sector organisations have in settling
such claims. Therefore, more problems will come before an inquiry than
is necessary because of the rules that bind statutory organisations. On
the grounds of best practice and of clarifying that consultation
includes mitigation, I will press the amendment to a
vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000327"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I thought that we were reaching a point at which
some agreement was possible on what my hon. Friend said. He indicated
that there will be further ministerial guidance on how the process will
operate. I do not want to put words in his mouth, but I understand him
to be saying that under clause 44(2) there is no duty on the applicant
to mitigate. However, when the applicant responds to the issues raised
by the community in the pre-application consultation, he will have to
explain where mitigation is thought to be appropriate and where
mitigation is not possible, necessary or desirable. That will be a
requirement on the applicant at that stage. That is the intention of
the clause and it will be fleshed out further in the guidance to come.
I am sure that the Minister will intervene if I am wrong. I understand
that an explanation of why mitigation is or is not appropriate is part
of clause 44(2), but that does not mean to say that there is not a duty
to
mitigate.</div>
					<a name="08012464000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000328"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> My difficulty is that if mitigation is agreed before
the inquiry, it can be reported that there is mitigation and that issue
will not be part of the inquiry. If the applicant has to say in what
cases there is a potential for mitigation, that will absorb the time of
the inquiry because it will open up the debate. If that can be closed
down before the inquiry starts because it has been legally resolved,
the inquiry will be speeded up. That is why mitigation is important in
planning law in general, not just in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012464000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000329"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> The hon. Lady was beginning to lose me. My
assumption was that anything that comes out of the pre-application
stage&#151;the consultation&#151;even if the applicant is saying,
&#147;Yes, I agree with the community&#146;s concerns and I will
mitigate,&#148; will be carried forward into the IPC&#146;s
consideration of those matters. Of course it will. It will be taken on
board in the application, which will be amended accordingly  if
the applicant decides to mitigate. That seems to  be a
given.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000330"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The difference is this. If mitigation is agreed
before the inquiry stage, the applicant can report that the matter has
been resolved. It is therefore not an issue and will not delay the
inquiry. If, however, the applicant says, &#147;It is possible that
we can mitigate in the following few cases,&#148; it potentially
becomes an issue for the
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08012464000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000331"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> Yes, but I am not sure how pressing the amendment
to a Division improves that
situation.</div>
					<a name="08012464000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000332"></a>Mrs.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012464000333"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> My understanding, and why in the end I certainly
will not press my amendment to a vote, is that the Minister has said
that he understands that although there is no duty in the Bill to
mitigate, there will be a duty on the applicant to respond to concerns
and objections raised as part of the pre-application consultation, and
that will include both any indication of mitigation from the applicant
and any indications that the applicant chooses not to mitigate, cannot
mitigate or does not want to mitigate. As I understand it, that will be
part of the response and that duty will be fleshed out further in
guidance to come.</div>
					<a name="08012464000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
bring this exchange to a conclusion, let me say that I am reassured by
what the Minister said about the issues relating to mitigation and by
the fact that there is further guidance to come on these matters both
from Ministers and from the commission. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>
