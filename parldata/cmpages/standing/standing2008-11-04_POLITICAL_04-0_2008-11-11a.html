am</div><a name="08111177000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000386"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As I normally do, I welcome hon. Members to the
Committee, which is considering the Political Parties and Elections
Bill. This is the first time that we have sat in the traditional
situation of a Public Bill Committee, having previously acted as a
Select Committee to take evidence from distinguished
witnesses.</div><a name="08111177000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we begin consideration of the Bill, I have a few preliminary
announcements to make. I am always concerned about the comfort of hon.
Members. Although conditions might not be quite so typical of this time
of year, hon. Members may take off their jackets during Committee
sittings, if they so wish. Will all members of the Committee ensure
that electronic gadgets, such as mobile phones and pagers, are turned
off or switched to silent mode during our
proceedings?</div><a name="08111177000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also wish to inform the Committee that, in accordance with
Mr. Speaker&#146;s statement last Wednesday on
arrangements for today, 11 November, I shall interrupt proceedings at
precisely 11 o&#146;clock and invite hon. Members to observe two
minutes&#146;
silence.</div><a name="08111177000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
amendments were signed by hon. Members last night, making some of them
selectable today. A revised selection list is available in the room,
and it sets out the list of amendments that have been selected. Members
of the Committee signed some of those amendments late last night, so
that list is the one that should be
used.</div><a name="08111177000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall now proceed with clause by clause scrutiny of the Bill. In
accordance with the programme motion agreed by the Committee, we will
deal first with clause 4 and amendment No. 16, tabled by the hon.
Member for Epping Forest, who I am delighted to call to
speak.</div><a name="08111177000009"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
4</h4><a name="08111177000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Selection
of prospective Electoral Commissioners and Commission
chairman</div><a name="08111177000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000387"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 16, in
clause 4, page 3, line 24, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;in accordance with Commissioner
for Public Appointments&#146; Code of
Practice.&#146;.</div><a name="08111177000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you to the Chair, Sir Nicholas. The Committee looks forward to
the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship during what I am sure
will be constructive and positive consideration of this important Bill.
I wish to say at the outset that, as the clause is about the Electoral
Commission, now is an appropriate moment to pay tribute to all the work
that Sam Younger has done as its chairman. He is about to retire from
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>post, and I am sure that, through his sterling work over the past few
years, he has gained much respect for the
commission.</div><a name="08111177000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome most enthusiastically the appointment of Jenny Watson as the
new chairman. I gained experience of her excellent work when she was
chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission because, at that time, I
was shadow Minister for equality and worked with her. Indeed, Members
on both sides of the House have worked with the Equal Opportunities
Commission and enormous strides have been taken in that area of policy
in recent years. I am sure that, equally, Jenny Watson will bring to
the Electoral Commission enthusiasm, ability and respect for her
work.</div><a name="08111177000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 16 is simple and it would merely clarify the situation. The
amendment suggests an addition to clause 4. The clause says
that</div><a name="08111177000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;each
person whose appointment is proposed in the motion has been selected in
accordance with a procedure put in place and overseen by the
Speaker&#146;s
Committee&#148;</div><a name="08111177000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
we ought to add after that the
words</div><a name="08111177000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
accordance with Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code of
Practice.&#148;</div><a name="08111177000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as clarifying the current situation, the amendment would entrench
it in law, which would be
right.</div><a name="08111177000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission has said that it supports the principle of
amendment No. 16, which would require the process of appointing all
electoral commissioners to be in accordance with the public
appointments code of practice. To date, the principles of the code have
been observed in all appointments of electoral commissioners, but there
is no requirement in law for that code of practice to be
observed.</div><a name="08111177000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill would be improved and clarified by the amendment. Over the next
few weeks of consideration, we shall seek to clarify the Bill in many
cases, and this is a simple one. As we discussed in the evidence
sessions last week, there are many areas in which the Bill is not
clear, and law that is not clear is not good law. We have here a simple
example in which matters could be
clarified.</div><a name="08111177000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000388"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I join the hon. Lady in welcoming you to the
Chair, Sir Nicholas. In the weeks ahead, I am sure that we shall all
benefit from your deft and wise guidance through proceedings on this
important
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also join the hon. Lady in paying tribute to the work of Sam Younger at
the Electoral Commission. He had a distinguished career in the BBC,
which he followed by making an important contribution to the work of a
significant body in our public life. I pay tribute to him as he
retires.</div><a name="08111177000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again I join the hon. Lady, this time in welcoming Jenny Watson to the
chair of the commission. I am sure that she will follow her
distinguished predecessor in an appropriate
manner.</div><a name="08111177000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly,
after joining the hon. Lady in so much, I must begin proceedings by
resisting her amendment, although I welcome the spirit in which she
moved it, and our side of the Committee welcomes probing amendments and
the opportunity to clarify still further our intentions in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would alter the clause that covers the selection of
prospective electoral commissioners and specify that appointments must
be in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments code 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>of practice. Each person whose appointment is proposed in a motion for
appointment as an electoral commissioner has to be selected in
accordance with a procedure put in place and overseen by the
Speaker&#146;s Committee. The practical effect of the amendment would
be to impose an obligation on the Speaker&#146;s Committee
to select electoral commissioners, including nominated commissioners,
through open competition, in line with the Office of the Commissioner
for Public Appointments
guidelines.</div><a name="08111177000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
electoral commissioner appointments are not OCPA regulated, I agree
that the process must command public confidence&#151;clearly, we can
all agree on that. The individuals selected should be those who have
demonstrated that they best match the skills, knowledge, practical
experience and personal qualities required for the appointment in
question.</div><a name="08111177000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previous
electoral commissioners have always been selected on the basis of open
competition. We note that the Committee on Standards in Public Life has
recommended that commissioners with political backgrounds should,
similarly, be selected by open competition, but in respect of these
particular commissioners, we believe that party leaders are in the best
position to judge those within their parties who would be best placed
to assist the commission to become more politically aware. That is why
we have included the provisions that will enable the leaders of the
qualifying parties to put forward names for consideration as nominated
commissioners. From the names put forward, the Speaker&#146;s
Committee will select the best candidates on
merit.</div><a name="08111177000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Lady is not suggesting that the leaders of political
parties are automatically disqualified, by virtue of their office, from
selecting the candidates best suited to fill those
appointments.</div><a name="08111177000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000389"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> No, I am not suggesting that. I agree with the
Minister.</div><a name="08111177000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000390"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I also hope she
agrees that, in securing public confidence, which I absolutely agree is
fundamental to the work of the commission, what is important is not so
much how the commissioners are selected, but how they do their job. It
is crucial that they do their job without bias or partisanship and in
accordance with their remit. I have every confidence in the leaders of
all the qualifying political parties in selecting candidates in line
with those criteria. I hope that the hon. Lady, having heard the
assurances and secured agreement on the fundamental principles, feels
able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000391"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I, too, welcome you to the Chair
for this phase of our deliberations, Sir Nicholas, and I join
the hon. Lady and the Minister in paying tribute to the work of Sam
Younger, who has been an excellent chair of the Electoral Commission. I
wish him well in his future choice of career, and also welcome Jenny
Watson to this challenging
post.</div><a name="08111177000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Lady said, the Electoral Commission supports the amendment in
principle. It is worth bearing it in mind that clause 4 regulates the
appointment of all commissioners, not just the political commissioners
dealt with under clause 5, and it would be useful to add the provision
to the law in general.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="08111177000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that there could be a difficulty in how the amendment would apply
to the political commissioners; looking at the detail of the code, it
might not be entirely appropriate to how that particular set of
appointments will work. Nevertheless, when he challenged the hon. Lady
on whether party leaders were suitable people to make such
appointments, the opposite of his point applied. If they are suitable
people, it is not entirely inappropriate that they should in some way
be bound by the
code.</div><a name="08111177000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000392"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> On a point of clarification, it is not the party
leaders who will make the appointments, but the Speaker&#146;s
Committee. The party leaders will put forward names for selection by
the Speaker&#146;s
Committee.</div><a name="08111177000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000393"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification, but as I understand it the code will apply to the entire
process of appointment, which will include nomination by the party
leaders. The question still arises as to the extent to which the code
is appropriate to be applied to that stage of the
process&#151;nomination as opposed to final
appointment.</div><a name="08111177000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister accepts the principle that the ideas that lie behind the
code&#151;the perfectly simple ones of transparency and open
competition&#151;he should be prepared to accept, for a later stage,
a different version of the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment. As it stands,
the amendment rather baldly uses the term &#147;in accordance&#148;
with the code, but if it said &#147;in accordance with the principles
of the code&#148;, and perhaps &#147;subject to any necessary
adjustments for the purposes of clause 5&#148;, which is about
political commissioners, that would still get the essential point
across while meeting the hon. Lady&#146;s objective, which is that
there should be some statutory mention of the code in the
legislation.</div><a name="08111177000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly support the principle of the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment,
and I urge the Minister to be more
forthcoming.</div><a name="08111177000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000394"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As I hope to demonstrate throughout consideration
of the Bill, we are open to suggestions from all parts of the House. I
will certainly reflect on some of the points made by the hon.
Gentleman, and perhaps I might clarify precisely what he is driving at
in conversation after the
sitting.</div><a name="08111177000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this stage, I would be anxious about changing my position on the
amendment for the reasons that I have outlined. Party leaders have an
important role to play for the new type of electoral commissioner, so
we are inclined to keep the position as it is. If the hon. Gentleman
can find a way to resolve all the different issues together, we shall
be happy to listen to suggestions later. However, at the moment, I ask
the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="08111177000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000395"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s
undertakings, as I have to the agreement and support of the hon. Member
for Cambridge, for which I am grateful. We said that the code of
practice ought to be observed if not to the letter, then certainly in
principle. I understand the Minister&#146;s argument, but I do not
see why the amendment cannot be accepted.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div><a name="08111177000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing one of the many areas in which the Bill&#146;s clarity
could be so improved, but it is one of the minor areas. Over the next
few days, there will be far greater matters in relation to which the
Bill&#146;s clarity needs to be improved, so I would rather leave the
Committee time to consider the far more difficult issues that we shall
face later in our proceedings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,

Bill.</div><a name="08111177000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000396"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): It is a great pleasure to
be a member of the Committee under your chairmanship, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="08111177000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to say a word about Sam Younger. He has been a tremendous chairman
of the Electoral Commission in difficult circumstances, as the first
man in the job. He has worked tirelessly and extremely hard to do his
best, and to work together with all political parties. I have worked on
an informal group that he created at which he made every effort to
listen to the views of political parties. Other members of that
informal consultative group, one of whom I see in Committee, have
helped the Electoral Commission a good
deal.</div><a name="08111177000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sam
Younger deserves a great deal of thanks from the entire political
community for having steadied what could have easily been a difficult
ship. We wish him well in what he does in future, and wish him success,
too.</div><a name="08111177000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to clarify a point and ask the Minister whether I have understood
clause 4 correctly. Under subsection (2), the Speaker has to
agree that a motion be made, but the rest of the clause is framed in
terms of action by the Speaker&#146;s Committee. Will the Minister
clarify whether that means in law that the Speaker has a veto over the
decisions of the Speaker&#146;s Committee in respect of the clause?
Depending on the answer that I receive, I might take this
further.</div><a name="08111177000052"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000397"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> It would help me to understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns if he said exactly what he meant by
&#147;a veto&#148;. The clause states that the Speaker
agrees</div><a name="08111177000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the motion may be
made&#148;,</div><a name="08111177000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
the motion is the subject of consultation, and so on. If the hon.
Gentleman means that the agreement of the Speaker is necessary for the
motion to proceed, yes, it does mean that he has a veto&#151;that is
my understanding of the clause&#151;but not
otherwise.</div><a name="08111177000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000398"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am somewhat concerned because, in the past, there
have been stories about differences of view on the Speaker&#146;s
Committee, members of which&#151;indeed, a majority&#151;have not
been in agreement with the Speaker about action that should be taken on
supervision of the Electoral Commission. I am concerned lest we find
ourselves building into law the potential for further difficulties of
that
type.</div><a name="08111177000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues are obviously sensitive, and not ones that I intend to develop
further, unless absolutely forced to do so. The Minister will already
be aware of some of the instances that I have referred to, or to which
I am alluding indirectly, not least those that concerned the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>reappointment of Sam Younger. It is important that we clarify the issue.
Will the Minister look at the drafting and consider whether, on Report,
he might frame the clause in terms of the Speaker&#146;s Committee,
rather than the
Speaker?</div><a name="08111177000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000399"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those
remarks and, as always with anything he suggests, I shall consider them
extremely carefully&#151;I bow to his great experience in such
matters. He has given a great deal of thought to the whole area, so
anything he suggests we take seriously. However, I am slightly
concerned about some of the implications of what he
said.</div><a name="08111177000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is inevitable, and in the nature of any Committee, that there will be
disagreements. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is referring to
exactly, but I am not surprised to hear that different members of the
Committee, including the Speaker himself, have different views about
how to proceed. However, the hon. Gentleman will be well aware that we
in the House elect a Speaker to act as Chair of proceedings, and we
have to have faith and trust in his judgment. That is why we elect
him.</div><a name="08111177000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every
day, the Speaker has to make judgments with which not every Member will
agree. It seems right and proper that, broadly, he should continue to
fulfil that role here. As the hon. Gentleman spoke, I could not, on the

it.</div><a name="08111177000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000402"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I shall do so, and spare my remarks on the
principle of the clause until later. Although it is not obvious on
reading, the amendment would amend the clause, which would in turn
amend a small part of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000. The effect of the amendment would be to prevent someone who
had been named as a donor to a political party within the preceding
five years from becoming a commissioner proposed by any party. Set out
in section 3 of the 2000 Act&#151;the section to be
amended by clause 5, which we are considering&#151;are clearly stated
rules about who can and cannot become a politically
appointed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>commissioner. It seems logical that, if somebody has been a donor to a
political party within the past five years, they should not hold the
office of
commissioner.</div><a name="08111177000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
supporting amendment No. 15, the Electoral Commission suggested that,
if donors to political parties were to be prevented in such a way from
being nominated for appointment as a commissioner, such practice should
include people who have appeared as lenders on the register of loans to
parties. That is an omission. I am sorry that I did not include such a
provision in the amendment because, if we are considering the principle
of donors, lenders also come within that principle. However, that does
not alter the principle of my
proposal.</div><a name="08111177000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): My hon. Friend makes
a point, but has she considered this one? When donations are given by
trade unions to political parties, that might not be known by the
individuals concerned. For example, the other day, the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) said that he had been recognised as
a donor, although he had never knowingly been a donor. What would
happen if he were made a commissioner under such
circumstances?</div><a name="08111177000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000404"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that important
issue. He has illustrated for the first time, but not, I suspect, for
the last during our consideration of the Bill, what I shall politely
call the grey area around trade union donations to political parties,
who the people are who give the money, why they do so and what it
means. My hon. Friend rightly suggests that we should consider that.
When drafting the amendment, it was too complicated to include
donations through trade unions, but that is an area we shall consider
in greater detail later in our
proceedings.</div><a name="08111177000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000405"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): The hon. Lady has had
an interesting exchange with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. From
time to time, trade unions make mistakes, as all organisations do, but
she is on to something interesting. She describes this as a grey area
for trade unions. What about the very dark, black area of the
unincorporated association? How should we decide the remit of the
principle that she is trying to establish in relation to those shadowy
donors who take part in the Midlands Industrial Council and the various
golf clubs, which are major donors to the Conservative party? She is on
to a good point and I congratulate her on spotting
it.</div><a name="08111177000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000406"></a>Mrs.

We could get into an artistic argument about shades of grey and black.
I do not accept that, on one side of the argument, things are grey and
that, on the other, they are murky black. There are areas that are not
quite clear on all sides of the argument, which is why we have to
clarify the Bill. However, we are considering amendment No. 15 and now
is not the correct time to consider shades of black or grey in the area
to which he
referred.</div><a name="08111177000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I am trying to do with the amendment is tighten up the criteria for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000409"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Again, the principle behind the amendment is well
worth supporting. As the hon. Lady said, there may be some defects in
the drafting, but I would urge the Minister to take on board her
points. The objective of the amendment is to remove from the list of
permitted political commissioners those who have given donations to
political parties, treating them as they would be treated at present.
The principle behind the amendment is a good idea, because one of the
main functions of the commission is to regulate donors. Although there
are times for making sure that those who are regulated are represented
on regulatory bodies, with the particular sensitivities surrounding the
area of large donations it would not be a good idea, or add to public
confidence in the commission, if the electoral commissioners were to
have among their number major donors to political
parties.</div><a name="08111177000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some reservations about the detail of what is proposed in the
amendment. The hon. Lady referred to lenders not currently being
covered in the amendment. There is also the question about the extent
of donation that should, in effect, disqualify someone. Minor
donations, although registrable, might not be of an extent or scope
that would bring the general principle into play. Nevertheless, the
principle is worth considering. A slight difficulty with the amendment
is that one of its effects would be to make it more likely that a
political commissioner would be an activist or a former employee of a
political party, as opposed to a volunteer. In general, volunteers are
more likely to be donors than party officials or party professionals.
That might be seen to be a move in the wrong direction, because we want
to encourage voluntary effort in politics. Nevertheless, it is not a
knockdown objection to the amendment. In bringing more political
experience to bear in the commission, we are trying precisely to bring
in the experience of people who have been more on the inside of
politics so that the commission gets the benefit of poachers who are
being persuaded to turn gamekeepers. Although that is a disadvantage of
the amendment, it is not a knockdown objection to it.</div>
<a name="08111177000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to join in the previous conversation about trade union donations, but I
urge hon. Members who are interested in that topic to consider new
clause 11. I hope that the Committee will have enough time
to discuss that important proposal in
detail.</div><a name="08111177000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000410"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The debate has illustrated the complexity of the
issue. I want to help the Committee to find a way through it, and the
easiest way to do so is simply to resist the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000411"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):
Elaborate.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div><a name="08111177000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000412"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am being invited by the hon. Gentleman to
elaborate, and I shall be delighted to do so. As we have discovered,
the area is complex. It might help the Committee if I set out our
understanding of the effect of the amendment. It seeks to alter the
section that disapplies the political restrictions for nominated
commissioners. The Committee will be aware that the Bill disapplies for
nominated commissioners the restrictions that prevent a person from
being appointed as an electoral commissioner if he or she is a member
of a registered party or has at any time in the past 10 years been an
officer, an employee, held an elected office or been named as a donor
in the register of donations. The practical effect of the amendment, as
the hon. Lady set out, is to prevent any person who has been named as a
donor in the register of donations, reported under chapters III or V of
part IV of the 2000 Act, from being appointed as a nominated
commissioner. That seems illogical. We cannot see a logical reason to
leave such a restriction in place for nominated commissioners, while
waiving it in respect of the other restrictions. Nominated
commissioners, by definition, will be affiliated to a political party,
and we can see no reason, as such, why they should be barred from
appointment because of any previous donations they have made to their
party or, indeed, any other
party.</div><a name="08111177000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth pointing out to the Committee that, were the amendment to be
accepted, it would have the effect of excluding politicians who had
made a declarable donation. Given what I think is broad agreement that
it is desirable to have electoral commissioners with political
experience, I hope that the Committee accepts that we might potentially
be knocking out a whole swathe of otherwise highly qualified candidates
for that role. Having reflected on the matter, I hope that it will
resist the amendment if the hon. Lady presses it to a
Division.</div>
<a name="08111177000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all such
matters, it will of course be for the Speaker&#146;s Committee, a
body for which each member of the Committee has the utmost respect, to
ensure that there are no likely conflicts of interest before a
nominated commissioner is appointed. I have every confidence that they
will be able to do the job well.</div>
<a name="08111177000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000413"></a>David
Howarth:</b> What the Minister says about the effect of the
amendment is correct. It would exclude practising politicians who are
also donors. However, it would not exclude all of them. A big field of
candidates would still be left. Laying aside the particular wording of
the amendment, does he agree that it would not be a good thing for
public confidence in the commission were commissioners even to be
proposed who were very major donors to political parties? That would
look as though the parties were putting forward people who had given
lots of money to the party in circumstances that would not be looked on
very favourably by the
public.</div><a name="08111177000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000414"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course, I understand the concerns expressed by
the hon. Gentleman, but we must be careful how we approach the subject.
It is not axiomatically a bad thing for people to make donations to
political parties, even very large donations. If people are public
spirited and want to give money to a political party of their choice, I
do not see anything wrong in that. We all in the House agree on the
various considerations&#151;no undue favours sought or undue
advancement&#151;and that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>a donation should be given purely to a political party that best
espouses the values that the donor wants to see embodied in our public
life. What is crucial is that the donation should be transparent and
that no favour or advancement should be secured as a result. That is
the crucial
principle.</div><a name="08111177000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am slightly anxious about the underlying assumption of what the hon.
Gentleman is saying, because this is an important issue. We should not
proceed on the basis that everyone who gives a donation to a political
party&#151;whichever political party it is&#151;is automatically
doing it out of some malign motive. Many donors do it in advancement of
their beliefs, ideals and values&#151;that goes for donors of all
political
parties.</div><a name="08111177000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000415"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I agree with the Minister wholeheartedly about
donors to political parties giving money in support of their values,
rather than to advance their individual positions. Nevertheless, there
is a big difference between a small donation&#151;we all want to
encourage a situation in which political parties are funded by a large
number of small donations, instead of a small number of large
donations&#151;and an extensive, large donation in the context of
someone receiving a public appointment, which is what we are
discussing. The connection is much closer in such circumstances than it
is in
general.</div><a name="08111177000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000416"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Again, of course I understand the spirit in which
the hon. Gentleman has intervened. None of us wants to see the practice
of democratic politics tarnished as it has, sadly, all too often been
in the past. We can all agree with that, of course. We have to be
extremely careful. Underlying his point&#151;I thought he was going
to make a slightly different point&#151;is that it is not just a
matter of the facts, but the perception of the facts. If he were to
make that point, I would happily agree with him on that
too.</div><a name="08111177000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to look at what process is in place. The process will be
transparent and subject to the Speaker&#146;s Committee&#151;in
which I hope everyone on our Committee has
confidence&#151;which will be in a position to evaluate case by case
precisely the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed. It would
be rash to try to draw blanket prescriptions; we should leave it to the
Speaker&#146;s Committee. I am sure that, in making the appointments,
the Committee members will read in <i class="I">Hansard</i> what the hon.
Gentleman and I have said and take those concerns into
account.</div><a name="08111177000090"></a>

What is important is that we have faith in the process, which is

a process in place and everyone accepts that it is working reasonably
well at the moment. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to have faith in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000419"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> The Minister says that he hopes that the
Speaker&#146;s Committee will take the trouble to read the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> that we are creating now. In that spirit, perhaps he
could go a little further. I found the argument of the hon. Member for
Cambridge wholly convincing and I think that the Minister did, too, but
he is slightly stymied just now. He is not quite sure of all the facts
necessary to decide which way he should take policy. Perhaps I am
mistaken in
that.</div><a name="08111177000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000420"></a>Mr.

are.</div><a name="08111177000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000421"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am mistaken in that. Does the Minister agree that
there is a donation the size of which will lead to the impression of
the possibility of undue influence being exercised as a consequence of
that donation, and does he think that that should have some bearing on
a Speaker&#146;s Committee decision on whether to appoint someone,
particularly with reference to, for example, a former trade union
leader whose trade union has made very large donations to the Labour
party, or with reference to a very large individual donor to the
Liberal party or the Conservative
party?</div><a name="08111177000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000422"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As always, I have followed with great care what the
hon. Gentleman said. May I say that I did not &#147;hope&#148; that
the Speaker&#146;s Committee would read the <i class="I">Hansard</i>? I have
every confidence that it will read the <i class="I">Hansard</i> and take it into
careful consideration as it makes its decisions with all the care and
deliberation that it usually brings to these matters. The hon.
Gentleman was making a rather logical point until he raised the
question of leaders of trade unions. With that, he is getting into very
different territory. If he thinks about it for a moment, he will see
that the leader of a large trade union whose union had made a large
donation corporately to the Labour party was in a very different
position from the large individual donor. I hope that he will reflect
on that before we set any more red herrings going in that
area.</div><a name="08111177000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me address the substance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks. He was
saying&#151;I am sure that he will correct me if I have mistaken his
drift&#151;that hypothetically the donation could be so large that it
would give rise among the public to a perception that undue influence
was being gained as a result of the size of the donation. The hon.
Gentleman is nodding. Logically, of course that could be the case. I
cannot speculate, but it would be rash to rule out the possibility of
such a perception taking root. Of course it
would.</div><a name="08111177000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000423"></a>Mr.

right.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="08111177000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000424"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all due respect, that does not follow. I
should say, for the benefit of the much-quoted <i class="I">Hansard</i>, that the
hon. Gentleman, from a sedentary position, suggested that the hon.
Member for Cambridge was right. I suggested that that was not a logical
conclusion to draw. The hon. Member for Cambridge said that we should
draw a line that would automatically exclude large donors, whatever the
size of the donation. I said that it would be rash to make that
assumption. What I am saying and what I have said before is that we
should approach these issues case by case. I have every confidence that
the Speaker&#146;s Committee will be able to make those judgments. At
some point, we have to have confidence that it will be as concerned as
everyone on this Committee that public perceptions of that type should
not take root. We know that in this area there is a problem with public
perceptions of the probity of our political life. The Bill is designed
to address many of those concerns, and the Government will do
everything that we can to address all the concerns. We have to have
confidence that the Speaker&#146;s Committee shares the concerns and
will address
them.</div><a name="08111177000100"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000427"></a>Mr.

Mr. X to give a gift of &#163;50,000 and find himself
operating this new position in relation to the Electoral Commission and
for Mr. Y to give &#163;50,000 and not be so occupied? The
same amount of money is being given and there is nothing else in public
that distinguishes
them.</div><a name="08111177000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000428"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course there will be all sorts of specific
circumstances, and I do not want to speculate on what they might be.
The tax status of a large donor might be brought into play, for
example. That is a matter for the Speaker&#146;s Committee. At some
point, we have to decide as a Committee whether we want to draw a
line&#151;as suggested by the hon. Member for Cambridge&#151;and
say, &#147;Above this level of donation, such donors should not be
included in the criteria for eligibility as an electoral
commissioner.&#148; I am anxious about the exclusion of donors, as a
matter of principle. They may well be people of considerable political
experience. I am sure that we can all think of examples of large-scale
donors who play active roles in the management of their political
parties, and who regard themselves as people of great political
judgment and
experience.</div><a name="08111177000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Speaker&#146;s Committee needs to look at such matters and make a
judgment about whether public perception, among other things, would be
such as to tarnish that appointment. I am suggesting that matters
should be handled on a case-by-case basis. All the evidence suggests
that the Speaker&#146;s Committee commands the respect of the House
and the wider public, and that it proceeds with due impartiality and
without bias. I am not aware of an allegation of partiality or bias on
the part of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, and it is a working
assumption that it will proceed on that basis. To draw hard and fast
rules would be unfair to the majority of donors who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>contribute donations to all political parties out of public spirit. We
should want to encourage them to continue doing
so.</div>

command public respect. Does the right hon. Gentleman
agree?</div><a name="08111177000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the right hon. Gentleman find it curious that he is opposed to the idea
of drawing a line or imposing a cap on the donation that might lead
eventually to the ineligibility of someone from one of the
appointments, when all three major parties support, in principle, a
donations cap in order to restore public confidence more generally in
the issue of donations to political
parties?</div><a name="08111177000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000433"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As always, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
his succinct contribution to the debate. Of course, most members of the
public are not intimately familiar with the workings of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee, but we can assume that our democracy is
sufficiently transparent that, if there were significant concerns, they
would have percolated into the wider sphere. However, we are not very
far apart on that
point.</div><a name="08111177000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are areas in the Bill and in other such issues where we accept that
there should be donation caps. That is a matter of fact, but we are
talking about the selection of electoral commissioners who will be
expected to bring their experience&#151;not their
partisanship&#151;to the exercise. They will be judged, as I said
earlier, not by how they are selected, but by how they behave when they
are selected. That is the key. If they behave in a partisan way, and
the selection process is seen to be flawed as a result, the Government
will, of course, consider the matter
again.</div><a name="08111177000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
behoves us all to keep a careful eye on how all legislation,
particularly in this area that is so important to our democracy, works.
If it turns out to be flawed, it needs to be changed but, at the
moment, we have no evidence that it will turn out so. A lot of evidence
suggests that it will work perfectly well and achieve all the goals
that the hon. Member for Cambridge and the Committee want to
accomplish. I see no member of the Committee rising to speak, so I
invite the hon. Member for Epping Forest to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000434"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am glad that we have debated the amendment
because it has brought out some important issues. I share the
Minister&#146;s confidence that the Speaker&#146;s Committee will
take note of our deliberations this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>morning. Nobody wants to have to say in a few years&#146; time,
&#147;We told you so.&#148; In a few years&#146; time, rules may
be reversed if matters go wrong. We hope that they do not. I have every
confidence in the Speaker&#146;s Committee. We have aired points of
concern, and it is important that they should go on the
record.</div>
<a name="08111177000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agreed 100
per cent. with the Minister when he said that people who donate to
political parties are acting honourably. They are contributing to
democracy in the same way that people who donate to charities are
contributing to good causes. The workings of democracy in our country
are a good cause. Giving money to political parties is an honourable
and respectable thing to do, and should be encouraged. Some of my best
friends give donations to political parties. We should be encouraging
such donations and not allowing certain elements of the media to
denigrate those who donate. My point has been made. This was an
interesting probing amendment and, with the leave of the Committee, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw
it.</div><a name="08111177000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000437"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> It is a pleasure, Sir Nicholas, to serve under
your chairmanship in this august Committee, and I look forward to the
rest of the sittings that we will share together. The amendments are
pretty straightforward and self-explanatory. I seek proper recognition
from the Bill and the Electoral Commission that we are now in a
multi-legislature, multi-party democracy throughout the United Kingdom.
The amendment is about more than just this Parliament. We now have four
legislatures in the United Kingdom and five parties in power. We have
the majority Government in the House of Commons, the minority Scottish
Nationalist party Government in Scotland, and coalitions in Wales and
Northern Ireland. All of them have to be served by the Electoral
Commission and all of them have to be properly recognised by this Bill.
However, the Bill does not do that. It is Westminster-centric as usual
and that has been recognised by the written submissions from electoral
commissioners among others. If the Bill was just about this House, it
would be absolutely fine. We have seven Members out of a total of 659.
All the minority parties put together number some 28 Members of this
House. To get one commissioner out of that number is very fair and
generous; it is a very good deal. However, we are not in that
situation.</div><a name="08111177000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000438"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Are there not 646 Members
of the House of Commons?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="08111177000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000439"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b><b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman is probably right. I
apologise for my ignorance. Numbers have never been my strong point, as
hon. Members will probably recognise in the course of these
proceedings. Nevertheless, the point is still the same. We would be
very fortunate to get one commissioner for this one House of Commons,
but this is about more than that. It is about all the legislatures
throughout the United Kingdom, in which case, it is totally
unsatisfactory.</div>
<a name="08111177000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at the situation in Scotland. The Electoral Commission has a
responsibility for Scotland. In Scotland, the SNP is not a minority
party. We are the largest party in Scotland by votes and by seats, and
we are the Government in Scotland. To have the Government in Scotland
effectively excluded from electoral regulations for Scottish elections
is absurd and bizarre and clearly not fair. How can that be right? It
would be like saying to this House, &#147;We can have an Electoral
Commission and a proper regulation of elections, but let us exclude the
Labour party.&#148; That would be totally unacceptable, just as it is
for the Scottish National party to be excluded from electoral
regulation for the Scottish
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08111177000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08111177000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us look at what is happening in Scotland just now. Over the past few
months, there has been a polarisation of support between the Labour
party and the Scottish National party. Those are the two largest
parties in Scotland. Two smaller parties make a significant political
representation to the Scottish Parliament&#151;the Liberals and the
Conservatives. The Liberals lost their deposit in the last two
by-elections and secured less than 3 per cent. of the vote. The
Conservatives held on to one of their deposits by the skin of their
teeth. They are no longer becoming small parties in Scotland, they are
becoming fringe parties. However, those two fringe parties will have a
seat on the Electoral Commission and will make regulations concerning
elections to the Scottish Parliament, when the party of government will
not. How can that be fair and right? That point must be addressed, and
I am looking forward to the Minister&#146;s response on how it will
be achieved.</div>
<a name="08111177000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the
fourth commissioner be decided? All registered parties in this House
with two or more Members are seemingly to nominate two representatives
each. They will go to the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which will
decide. The hon. Member for Chichester asked whether the public know
who is on the Speaker&#146;s Committee. As a Member of Parliament, I
have no idea who is on it. I know who the Speaker is and that he will
look after Back-Bench Members of political parties in the House, but I
have no idea who is on the Committee other than Mr. Speaker
himself. I presume that there will not be a minority party Member on
the Speaker&#146;s Committee&#151;I would put any amount of money
on it&#151;so what will it know about those parties when it makes a
decision?</div>
<a name="08111177000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that the Speaker&#146;s Committee will look at the largest minority
party and decide to give it the job. The largest minority party in the
House is the Democratic Unionist party, which has nine Members. Second
largest is the Scottish National party with seven Members, the Social
Democratic and Labour party has three and Plaid Cymru has three. If the
Speaker&#146;s Committee decides to give the job to the largest
minority party, we would have the ridiculous situation of the
Democratic Unionist party in the Electoral Commission looking after the
interests of the Scottish National party.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000440"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I do not remember exactly what was said, but why
would it be wrong for the Democratic Unionists to look after Scottish
National party affairs, but right for the Scottish Nationalists to look
after Democratic Unionist party
affairs?</div>
<a name="08111177000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000441"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. I will explain clearly why there is a difficulty for the
Scottish National party. No other party in the House of Commons would
be less appropriate to look after the Scottish National party than the
DUP. We are a party of independence. We are a nationalist party. We
want our nation to become a normal, independent nation like any other
in the world. The Democratic Unionist party is probably the most
Unionist party in the House, yet it would sit on the Electoral
Commission looking after the interests of the most nationalist
party.</div>

time.</div>
<a name="08111177000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000444"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Can he
clarify whether he believes that the democratic process itself, which
is what the Electoral Commission and its commissioners is there to
protect and enhance, is different for a nationalist party, a right-wing
party, a left-wing party or a middle-of-the road, sitting-on-the-fence
party? The democratic process is the democratic process. It really does
not matter which part of the political spectrum someone belongs to.
What matters is that democracy works and it is therefore totally
irrelevant for these purposes which political party a
person belongs to.</div>
<a name="08111177000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000445"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> Here is my challenge to the hon. Lady. How about
the Conservative party giving up its place on the Electoral Commission
and giving it to the Labour party. Would she be happy with that? I
suggest not, yet she expects the Scottish National party to have no
representation on the commission and to be looked after by a political
party that operates contrary to its political interests. Would the hon.
Lady give up her seat to the Labour party?</div>
<a name="08111177000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000446"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am certainly not saying that we would wish to do
such a thing in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, if
four very senior and well respected people were nominated as
commissioners, and if none were a member of the Conservative party, the
commission would not work any the worse. We are looking for political
commissioners with experience of the democratic and electoral process,
not particular party views. Political experience matters far more. I
hold some people in the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and even
the Scottish National party in greater respect than I do some people in
the Conservative
party.</div><a name="08111177000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000447"></a>Hon.
Members:</b>
Names.</div><a name="08111177000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000448"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I, too, would be very interested to hear
names.</div>
<a name="08111177000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention&#151;or should I say
speech?&#151;and I noted that her colleagues looked with wry interest
when she said that she would be prepared to give up the Conservative
nomination to the Electoral Commission to somebody from another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>party. In light of that kind suggestion, we could suggest somebody from
the Scottish National party to fill her party&#146;s
nomination.</div>
<a name="08111177000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad,
however, that the hon. Lady has opened up this debate. If the four
commissioners are to be truly non-political and non-partisan, I would
be happy, but given some of the noes that I am hearing from
Conservative colleagues, that might not be the case. I suggest that
nominations for the party political commissioners will be truly and
wholly party
political.</div><a name="08111177000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments would deal with that matter fairly and squarely by ensuring
that any registered political party with more than two Members in this
House would have a political commissioner on the commission. In one
blow, that would deal with all the outstanding issues. Every
significant party in all United Kingdom legislatures would be
represented on the commission. The Scottish National party, the SDLP
and the Democratic Unionist party would, therefore, have a say on the
commission about electoral regulation within their own legislatures and
Parliaments. Surely that is fair and
transparent.</div><a name="08111177000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will tell me that that would mean a majority of political
commissioners on the Electoral Commission, which I accept. However, I
would prefer that to excluding certain parties. If that solution is not
accepted by the Committee, I would suggest that we have no political
commissioners at all, which again would be preferable to excluding some
parties, which would mean that some legislatures are demoted and would
lose an interest in the
commission.</div><a name="08111177000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
options are on the table: to ensure that all political parties with a
significant political presence in all United Kingdom legislatures are
properly represented on the Electoral Commission or none at all. The
suggestion in the Bill is the worst of all worlds. Regardless of what
the hon. Lady might say about the nomination process, the three big
parties have their nominated appointee on the commission, and one will
remain for all the minority parties. I have no idea how that will be
decided. It will be left to the Speaker&#146;s Committee, but I do
not even know who is on that Committee and I have no idea how it will
decide who that fourth commissioner will go to. I suspect that it will
automatically select the largest minority party&#151;the
DUP&#151;which would be unacceptable to the SNP, just as an SNP
commissioner would presumably be unacceptable to the DUP.</div>
<a name="08111177000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">No process is
in place for sorting that out. It is a total mess. I ask the Minister
to consider sincerely my genuine plea to resolve this problem. I want
him to recognise that we are in a multi-legislature United Kingdom. How
will he address this problem? Is it acceptable that the Governments of
Scotland, Northern Ireland, and perhaps a coalition in Wales, do not
have a place at the top table of the Electoral Commission? I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s
remarks.</div><a name="08111177000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000449"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the
amendments because it allows us to discuss this important issue. There
are three reasons why we on the Conservative Benches oppose his
amendments. First, it is totally impractical to have the number of
commissioners that would be required if his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>amendment became part of the Bill. An important principle about the
commissioners with political experience is that they should be in a
minority on the Commission.</div>
<a name="08111177000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an
interesting evidence session we had last week, Sir Hayden Phillips
responded to the hon. Gentleman by describing the characteristics of a
successful regulator. He also said:</div>
<a name="08111177000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that this will help the Electoral Commission, and will help
political parties to feel more comfortable with the Electoral
Commission. Those four people will be in a minority, and will never be
a majority.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Political Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>4 November
2008; c. 34,
Q83.]</div><a name="08111177000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee accepted that it is an important principle that the four
politically appointed commissioners are in a minority on the
Commission. If that number is changed to accommodate all parties with
some representation in the House, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, the
number of political commissioners would rise to perhaps eight or,
sometimes, nine. If there were to be a minority on the Commission,
there would have to be 20 or more commissioners, which we all know
would not work. A committee that is too large becomes unwieldy and
cannot do the work that it sets out to do. Therefore, on practical
grounds, the number four is right and we support the Government on that
point. It is simply impractical to say that that number should be
increased.</div><a name="08111177000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman forgets two important points. The first is that
commissioners with direct political experience are to be appointed in
order to bring their wisdom and experience of democracy, elections and
the political process to the Commission. The commissioners are not
there to represent the views of particular political parties and it is
therefore quite wrong to say that, in being appointed, their political
allegiance would be their most important characteristic. I challenge
the vocabulary used by the hon. Gentleman when he says that a certain
person might be appointed who would be</div>
<a name="08111177000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;looking after
the interests of the Scottish National
party&#148;.</div><a name="08111177000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
commissioner should not be there to look after the interests of a
particular party or group; the role of the commissioner is to oversee
the democratic process itself. The idea behind having four
commissioners from different areas of the political spectrum is simply
to balance that out and it is quite right to do so. To suggest that a
particular person, who would have been appointed for his or her
seniority, wisdom or experience, would represent the interests of any
political party is quite
wrong.</div><a name="08111177000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
should, of course, be someone who has experience of government, someone
who has experience of opposition and someone who has had experience of
neither for over a century. There should also be someone who has
experience of a minority party. The experience of a minority party is
as a minority party, rather than of a particular party with a
particular political ethos or principle. That is really important, so I
vehemently oppose what the hon. Gentleman is proposing in the
amendments.</div><a name="08111177000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
and almost more important than anything else, the hon. Gentleman
forgets that the devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom derive
their power and authority from Parliament&#151;the Westminster
Parliament. Therefore, his argument that the provisions are
Westminster-centric is wrong and not at all well founded. The fact that
the devolved legislatures derive their power from Parliament means that
it is Parliament that should make decisions such as today&#146;s. It
is absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>correct for this Parliament and this Committee, representing Parliament,
to decide on four, well balanced electoral commissioners with political
experience.</div><a name="08111177000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08111177000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000450"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire
has brought up a serious difficulty in the Bill. We need to take it
seriously and think what the solutions might be. His solution is not
the right one, and his list of possible solutions is not exhaustive,
but the problem is a real one. This country now has multiple
legislatures. Parliament is still sovereign and supreme, but in reality
we are seeing the development of different political systems in
Scotland and Wales, and there has always&#151;for a long
time&#151;been a different political system in Northern Ireland. We
need to take into account those developments in deciding what to do
about electoral law. Not only is the party system in Scotland
different, but the electoral systems are different as well, not just
for the Scottish Parliament, but also for Scottish local
government&#151;the same system as is generally used in Northern
Ireland, but not in England, although it  should
be.</div><a name="08111177000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with what the hon. Gentleman put forward as his solution to
this new situation is that it is too United Kingdom-centric. He is
trying to solve the problem within the scope of United Kingdom
institutions. I do not think that that can be done, at least in the way
that he has proposed. The hon. Member for Epping Forest is quite right
that what the hon. Gentleman is putting forward is a system&#151;he
pointed this out himself, in his speech&#151;that would lead to a
majority of political commissioners. For all the reasons that the hon.
Lady and the Electoral Commission itself mentioned, that is an
unacceptable
solution.</div><a name="08111177000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we look at the detail of what the hon. Gentleman put forward, he is
removing the choice of commissioners from any other body&#151;the
parties would directly nominate one person, and that person would then
become a commissioner. The hon. Lady is right that that is not the view
of a commissioner that the Bill proposes. The Bill&#146;s view is of
the commissioner as a person who, to use the European jargon, knows a
particular political party best but nevertheless acts as a commissioner
in the interests of the commission as a whole, and who is not there as
a representative of a particular party. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments would change that and make the commissioners the
representatives of
parties.</div><a name="08111177000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000451"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> May I ask the hon. Gentleman the same question
that I put to the hon. Member for Epping Forest? If the political
nominations to the commission are apolitical, would the hon. Gentleman
be happy for the Liberals to waive their right to nominate a political
commissioner and give it to another party in the
House?</div><a name="08111177000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000452"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not think that it is a matter of being
political or apolitical&#151;by definition, they are political
commissioners&#151;but they are not there to act as delegates of the
party or at the party&#146;s insistence. They are there in a similar
way to European Commissioners, who are selected on the basis that they
know a particularly country best and that their experience reflects
where they come from. They are not there to vote for the interests of a
particular party or country.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div><a name="08111177000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that arises is what to do about the problem, given that the solution
that has been put forward is not acceptable. The solution of not having
political commissioners would not be acceptable either, because at the
heart of the clause is the importance of having a good dose of
practical political experience on the commission and ensuring that it
does not act in an ivory-tower way. That seems to exhaust the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s suggestions&#151;either his solution or no
political commissioners, and that is it. I do not think that that is
it. He has raised an issue of greater importance: the degree to which
we devolve electoral
law.</div><a name="08111177000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Party
funding is a UK-level question, because as we heard in an evidence
session, parties are constantly campaigning and raising money for a
range of different elections, from local elections to devolved
Parliament elections, UK elections and European elections. It is not
really possible to separate the money being raised for those different
campaigns and elections, because the same money is raised for the
entire range of elections. The regulation of donations and party
funding is therefore a UK-level matter, but that is not the case with
electoral administration. It is different in the different parts of the
UK, precisely because the electoral systems are so different. We should
seriously consider further devolution in that
area.</div><a name="08111177000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is already devolution on boundaries. There is a separate Boundary
Commission for the Scottish Parliament and for local government in
Scotland. Although it would be complicated and difficult to introduce
into this part of the Bill properly devolved institutions for electoral
administration, that is where the solution to the problem
lies.</div><a name="08111177000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000453"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Is it not the case that the Electoral Commission
conducted a thorough and well respected inquiry into the conduct of the
last Scottish parliamentary elections and that, as it is presently
constituted, it was perfectly competent in doing so and produced an
excellent
report?</div><a name="08111177000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000454"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I would not demur from the hon. Lady&#146;s
view of the report&#146;s content, but I am talking about how to
solve the institutional political problem that the hon. Gentleman has
rightly brought to our attention. We have to solve it at the level of
institutions, not by altering the detail of the Electoral Commission
appointments provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000455"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have had a fascinating debate, and I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire for raising the
matter. I shall start by saying straight away that of course I
recognise that we are in a multi-party, multi-legislature UK. This
Government brought in devolution, and we are extremely proud of it. It
has made for a much more vibrant and healthy democracy within the
context of a United Kingdom. I am sure that he finds that final phrase
unpalatable, but there it is. We are proud of devolution, and he is
absolutely right that his party plays an important part in the new,
vibrant democracy. I thank him for recognising that only the Labour
party can now speak for the whole UK. That is generous of him, and we
acknowledge
it.</div><a name="08111177000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I throw some light on something that has baffled many members of the
Committee, including the hon. Member for Chichester, and let the entire
Committee know what the Speaker&#146;s Committee consists of? It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>consists, with one exception, of hon. Members. They are the hon. Members
for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers) and for North Down (Lady Hermon), my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord
Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local
Government&#151;he is there ex officio, as I believe is the Lord
Chancellor&#151;the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins),
the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), my right
hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) and
the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter). I am
sure that the Committee would agree that that is a most distinguished
gathering of parliamentarians, who can be trusted to do their job with
great distinction and
impartiality.</div><a name="08111177000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an interesting debate. I have to say, I agree with almost
every single word that the hon. Member for Epping Forest said. At the
heart of this issue lies an important debate about the future of the
United Kingdom, although I am sure you will forbid me from straying too
far into that territory, Sir Nicholas. I am sure that there will be
many occasions on which we shall return to that subject, but we shall
not discuss it at length today.</div>
<a name="08111177000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
stress a couple of things before I address the detail of the
amendment. First, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest said quite
clearly, at the heart of the proposition made by the hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire is the idea that somehow the
so-called political commissioners&#151;we prefer the term nominated
commissioners&#151;will act as partisans on behalf of their
party.</div>
<a name="08111177000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000456"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> It is the same question that I have put to all
the political parties here: if the Minister is satisfied that that is
the case, will the Labour party therefore waive its right to have a
political commissioner, and perhaps open it up to other parties in the
House?</div>
<a name="08111177000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000457"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman is an eloquent and skilled
debater. I had anticipated him asking me that question, and I shall
answer it in a moment if he will bear with me. It is a good question,
but there is a good answer too. The short answer is no, however I will
provide a more detailed explanation in just a moment, if I
may.</div>
<a name="08111177000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I was making is that underlying the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is the proposition that nominated commissioners will act in a
politically partisan way, and therefore it is unfair that they should
be excluded. That is absolutely not the case. I see him shaking his
head.</div><a name="08111177000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000458"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I did not say that at
all.</div>
<a name="08111177000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000459"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> That seems to be the underlying assumption, and
that therefore it is fair that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party and
other parties that are in a minority at Westminster should have due
representation on the commission. However, as the hon. Member for
Epping Forest said extremely clearly, nominated commissioners should be
selected on the basis of their experience. That is the basis on which
they will be selected and on which we expect them to discharge their
duties&#151;not in a politically partisan way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="08111177000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about why the parties that have the largest representation at
Westminster should have the position that they have in the Bill, the
answer follows on from the point that I just made. That is precisely
why we would not be prepared to relinquish our particular position to
other parties. The three largest parties at Westminster have&#151;I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree, because it is a matter of fact
not opinion&#151;the widest pool of political experience throughout
the United Kingdom on which to draw, including experience of all the
different electoral systems, as the hon. Member for Cambridge
said.</div>
<a name="08111177000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer is
not what the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire is suggesting,
which is to segment and fracture the overall view, so that there are
specialists in this particular area and this particular electoral
system. I may be caricaturing what he was trying to suggest, but that
would be the logical consequence of his contribution to the debate.
What is important is that we have a wide pool of experience upon which
to draw. The three largest parties at Westminster pre-eminently have
that wide experience of all the regions of the United Kingdom and all
the different electoral systems. They can bring that collective
experience to bear on all the issues that the Electoral Commission has
to address.</div>
<a name="08111177000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
fundamental difference of view on this issue. It is not that the
provision is Westminster-centric and the wrong perspective to adopt; it
is the only proper position to adopt in a United Kingdom. The hon.
Member for Epping Forest set this out well: the source and foundation
of power and authority in this country remains in the Westminster
Parliament, because that is the Parliament for the entire United
Kingdom. Of course, the devolved Administrations and legislatures have
an important part to play. They have brought great vibrancy to our
democracy and we are proud of what we have done to make that happen,
but the power is still devolved from Westminster and so the Bill is in
the form that it
is.</div><a name="08111177000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08111177000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been little discussion of the detail of the amendment, so I want to
address that. The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire will not
be surprised by what I am about to say, but, if he will forgive me, I
will say it anyway for the record.</div>
<a name="08111177000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 112 and 113 would remove the requirement to have a maximum of four
political commissioners and, in our view, thwart the purpose of the
clause, which is to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the
commission, both to those it regulates and to the general
public.</div><a name="08111177000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
clause 6 places the minimum and maximum number of commissioners at five
and 10 respectively, by not limiting the number of nominated
commissioners permitted it could, in theory, lead to those nominated
commissioners being in a majority on the board. I think that all
members of the Committee would agree that that would seriously
undermine the independence of the commission&#151;both its actual and
its perceived
independence.</div><a name="08111177000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Limiting
the number of nominated commissioners to four means that they will
always be in the minority, although they will still be able to bring to
the commission the political experience it needs&#151;the events of
the last few years show that that experience is needed&#151;to create
greater confidence among those it regulates.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="08111177000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
114 would compel parties to make nominations to the Speaker&#146;s
Committee. Under the Bill as drafted, parties will be free to make
nominations to the Speaker&#146;s Committee if they choose to do so.
The amendment would mean qualifying parties being obliged to put
forward to the commission a person to be considered for appointment. We
think that that is unreasonable and therefore cannot support
it.</div>
<a name="08111177000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 115, 116 and 117 would remove the need for three of the
commissioners to be from the largest parties in the United Kingdom
Parliament and the means for calculating parties&#146; relative size
for that purpose. As I have said, we believe that it is the right
balance to have commissioners from those parties in order to command
the widest range of political experience. That is a difficult judgment.
We must make a judgment about how to do it, and this is the judgment
that we have made, for the reasons that we have said. I accept that the
hon. Gentleman has a perfectly logical position, from his perspective,
in suggesting alternative arrangements; it is just that we do not agree
with
them.</div><a name="08111177000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that, to get that pool of political experience, it is right
that three of the commissioners should come from the three largest
parties and that the fourth commissioner should come from another
qualified party. The recruitment and selection process for all
commissioners will remain a matter for the Speaker&#146;s Committee.
Again, I am sure that it will look at the contributions made to the
debate on these amendments and take into account what the hon.
Gentleman has said, and indeed what the hon. Member for Cambridge has
said.</div><a name="08111177000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are important questions and they will be a subject for legitimate
debate in the future. Constitutional arrangements are never set in
stone. They evolve and develop, and this process is part of their
evolution and development. I am sure that we will continue to return to
these issues. In the meantime, however, I hope that the hon. Member for
Perth and North Perthshire will agree, in the light of all the
circumstances, to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000460"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I appreciate all Members taking part in what has
been an interesting and illuminating debate on the issues involved in
how we start to deal with the multiplicity of legislatures that we have
throughout the United Kingdom. I also appreciate the Minister&#146;s
attempt to look at those issues a little more clearly and perhaps to
come back with solutions. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for
Cambridge, who has again spoken about the need perhaps to devolve
further the powers of the Electoral Commission, which is a realistic
way forward that we might address in the
future.</div><a name="08111177000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the suggestion that nominations for political commissioners will
somehow exist almost in a vacuum&#151;without the parties that
nominate those people&#151;is preposterous and ridiculous. That is
why, other than the hon. Member for Epping Forest, who, much to the
chagrin of her colleagues, has been the only member of the Committee to
say that we need to be prepared to put the political nomination
aside&#151;</div><a name="08111177000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000461"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I really must clarify this point, or I might not
remain on the Committee much longer. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> I
will probably be forcibly removed. I did not say that the Conservative
party ought not to put forward someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>or that the place ought to be given up. I was merely illustrating, for
the purposes of our argument, the fact that a person&#146;s wisdom
and experience do not depend on his or her party
allegiance.</div><a name="08111177000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000462"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for clarifying
that. She sought to say that she would be happy to waive the right to a
Conservative nomination, but she now brings that into line with the
thoughts of everybody else in Committee, which I suspected anyway. I
always presumed that no political party would be prepared to give up
its right to nominate political commissioners, which confirms my strong
suspicions that party political interests are at play here. To pretend
otherwise is like living in cloud cuckoo land. Of course party
political interests are at play, otherwise there would not be party
political
commissioners.</div><a name="08111177000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000463"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am slightly surprised by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s cynicism. Given the passionate idealism that he
normally brings to the exposition of his cause, this really is a very
cynical view. If he reflects on a wide range of analogous bodies in our
public life, on which people with wide political experience serve, he
will see that those politicians from all political parties serve the
party interest without party bias, and have done so for many years and
will continue to do so. I hope that he withdraws his
remarks.</div><a name="08111177000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000464"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> Call me an old cynic, Sir Nicholas. I accept what
the Minister says. I know that people who are nominated from political
parties do a fantastic job in a number of bodies throughout the United
Kingdom, but it is naïve to suggest that there is not a small
element of party political interest&#151;there must be. No political
party would be prepared to give up its right to nominate a political
commissioner. We still do not have a solution for what we do with
minority parties. We still have not addressed how the Electoral
Commission will turn its attention to dealing with the devolved
Assemblies and Parliaments across the United Kingdom.</div>
<a name="08111177000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
111 would clarify and support what the Minister says. It proposes to
limit the rights of political commissioners to become involved in some
of the work of the
Commission.</div><a name="08111177000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000465"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We will consider amendment No. 111 at a
later stage, so it is not appropriate to raise the matter
now.</div><a name="08111177000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000466"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> Thank you, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="08111177000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000467"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I hesitate to return to this point, but it is so
fundamentally important. The hon. Gentleman is proceeding on a
completely wrong assumption. The Electoral Commission regulates the
electoral system itself. It is in the interests of every single
democratic political party in this country that the integrity of that
electoral system is paramount. That is the self-interest of every
nominated commissioner on the board, nothing else. It does not matter
what values we espouse, what policies we want to put into effect or
whether we are in Scotland or in the United Kingdom Parliament, the
integrity of the electoral system is of fundamental importance to every
single one of us. Every single one of us shares the same self-interest
in the transparency, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>incorruptibility and integrity of that system. I hope the hon. Gentleman
will shift the base of his argument away from how he has been
proceeding until now.</div>
<a name="08111177000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000468"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
intervention and I agree with practically every word he says, but may I
say to him, in all candidness, that there will be a whiff of suspicion
about the work of the Electoral Commission when it comes to the
Scottish elections? On the Electoral Commission, there will be
nominated political commissioners from the Conservative, Liberal and
Labour parties for the regulation of electoral law in elections to the
Scottish Parliament, but there will be no representative from the
largest political party in Scotland, which forms the Scottish
Government.</div><a name="08111177000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may go on and on about the fine group of people who have our
best interests at heart, but, for ever and a day, there will be a whiff
of suspicion that something is not quite right. All the other political
parties will get to nominate a political commissioner, but the party of
government in Scotland will not. That cannot be right. I cannot accept
that that is the way forward for
Scotland.</div><a name="08111177000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are coming to amendment No. 111, which will, I hope, clarify the role
of political commissioners. That is the opportunity for people to say
what the political commissioners can do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08111177000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"></i><b class="B"><a name="08111177000469"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000470"></a>The

amendment No. 108, in
clause 5, page 4, line 15, at

two persons to be considered for appointment as a nominated

and for the purposes of this subsection, as one of the three largest
nominating
parties.&#146;.</div><a name="08111177000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000471"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> When evidence was being given to the Committee last
week, it became clear that a situation could arise in which a political
party might fail to nominate possible commissioners. The amendment
would require the leader of a political party to make that nomination,
as the Bill suggests, although does not require, that they
do.</div><a name="08111177000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 108, the hon. Member for Cambridge has spotted the same
problem and has come up with a good and different solution. If, for
some reason, a political party failed or decided not to nominate a
commissioner, that could create a vacuum. The Bill will not work
efficiently if political parties do not co-operate.</div>
<a name="08111177000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it
is reasonable for the Government to assume that political parties and
their leaders will co-operate, that assumption cannot be relied on.
Suppose those party leaders, or the minority parties, decided not
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>co-operate for some reason. What if the hon. Member for Perth and North
Perthshire stirred up the minority parties to take a stance and not to
nominate? That is possible&#151;it would be a reasonable way to make
a political point. The Bill will work less efficiently if those
nominations are not made, and therefore they should be required by the
Bill. That is the purpose of the amendment.</div>
<a name="08111177000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000472"></a>David
Howarth:</b> As the hon. Lady says, the issue first came to
the attention of the Committee last Thursday when it was raised by the
Electoral Commission. I suspect that our efforts to meet that point
might not yet be technically perfect, but since the Programming
Sub-Committee gave us only a few hours in which to write the
amendments, this is the best we could come up with.</div>
<a name="08111177000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essential
issue is precisely that mentioned by the hon. Lady. The Electoral
Commission asked what would happen if a political party refused to make
the nominations to which it is entitled under the Bill. There could be
a range of answers. One solution could be for the party to lose its
commissioner, who would not be replaced by anyone else. Another
solution might be that another party, which stood above the party in
question in terms of the number of seats, would get to nominate an
extra commissioner, but that would raise questions about which party
would be so entitled.</div>
<a name="08111177000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made a
simple suggestion to the Government about how the situation might be
dealt with. It does not deal with every possibility, just some of them.
The amendment would mean that should one of the main three parties
refuse to nominate any commissioners, its right to nominate would go to
the next largest party. As the hon. Member for Perth and North
Perthshire noted, that would currently be the DUP, but under other
circumstances it could be a different party. We must come to a solution
on the issue&#151;perhaps not at this stage of the proceedings, but
later. The Government must respond to what the Electoral
Commission has
said.</div><a name="08111177000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08111177000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking
to amendment No. 105, the hon. Member for Epping Forest implied that
amendment No. 108 is an alternative to her suggestion. In fact, they
are complementary. My amendment would not do something that is
important in the first place, which is write into the Bill an
obligation on the main parties to make nominations. That is a defect in
my amendment, but the defect in her amendment is that she does not say
what would happen if those parties failed to fulfil the obligation that
she is rightly seeking to create. My suggestion is that the Government
take away both amendments, consider their joint effect and, if they do
not like the drafting&#151;we had only a few hours to draft
them&#151;return on Report with something that deals with the
problem.</div><a name="08111177000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000473"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> These are interesting amendments that would deal
with circumstances that are unlikely to occur. However, we should take
the opportunity to clarify some of the issues, and I am happy to do
so.</div><a name="08111177000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment No. 105, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest said, the heads
of the three largest qualifying parties would be required to nominate
two or more persons for appointment as a commissioner. The clause as
drafted will not impose a requirement, because that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>would be over-prescriptive. The hon. Lady suggested that the hon. Member
for Perth and North Perthshire might at some point want to make a
political point by not nominating, which is absolutely the case, but it
would be wrong of the Government to stop political parties making
political points. That is a matter for other political
parties.</div><a name="08111177000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the generous democratic spirit in which we generally operate, we would
not want to close off that option for other parties, so we believe that
it is best to leave the clause as it is. I hope that, on reflection,
the hon. Lady will be tempted to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111177000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000474"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the Minister for that perfectly reasonable
explanation. Just for clarity, how many nominations does he imagine or
predict that there will be? Is it likely that there will be eight
nominations, and therefore four people could be chosen from them, or if
one party did not nominate, would there be six and four could be chosen
from the six? I am sorry: this sounds a bit muddled because I am, to an
extent.</div><a name="08111177000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am genuinely asking for clarification of the practicality of the
process, because I might agree with the
Minister.</div><a name="08111177000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000475"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I hope that the position will become clearer when I
address amendment No. 108, which has been tabled by the hon. Member for
Cambridge. If it does not, I shall be happy to give way to allow the
hon. Lady to put her question to me
again.</div><a name="08111177000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Cambridge pointed out, amendment No. 108 would
amend proposed new  section 3A(4) to provide that if one of the
three largest parties did not exercise its option to nominate, the next
largest party at the time would be entitled to have one of its nominees
appointed as a commissioner, so long as it had made at least two
nominations.</div><a name="08111177000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of clause 5 is clear. If one of the three largest parties in
Parliament, calculated by reference to proposed new section 3A(7), does
not nominate two candidates for appointment as a nominated
commissioner, it will not be one of the three largest
&#147;nominating parties&#148; and therefore will not be entitled
to have a person whom its registered leader has put forward appointed
to the commission. In those circumstances, the registered leader of the
fourth largest party in Parliament will be entitled to have one of
their nominees appointed, so long as they have nominated two candidates
for appointment. Therefore, the amendment would just restate what is
already the effect of clause
5.</div><a name="08111177000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked about the number of nominations. There will be two
nominations per qualifying party so that if one party, by its own
choice, ceases to be a qualifying party, there will in effect be six
nominations for three places with at least one from smaller parties, if
they choose to
nominate.</div><a name="08111177000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
stress that we are dealing with what are likely to be extremely
hypothetical circumstances. There is general support for the principle
that there should be nominated commissioners who bring political
experience to the Electoral Commission&#151;that is a direct
read-across from the recommendation of the Committee on Standards in
Public Life. The hon. Lady has demonstrated her support for the
principle, and we would expect her party to nominate. We would expect
all parties to contribute to what is a fundamental pillar of our
democratic system. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>Unless someone wanted to make a political point, which would be
regrettable in the circumstances, we would expect there to be
sufficient nominations for the process to
continue.</div><a name="08111177000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000476"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation, which
is a possible description of how the Bill currently reads. His
explanation works by treating a nominating party as a party that has
gone through the process of nominating. It is slightly circular, but it
is certainly a possibility. The problem is that even the Electoral
Commission does not understand the Bill to mean that. Surely, at the
very least, the Government should be thinking about tabling a
clarifying amendment on
Report.</div><a name="08111177000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000477"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> In the spirit of earnest intellectual co-operation,
I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to clause 5(4), which
states:</div><a name="08111177000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (3) &#145;nominating party&#146; means a party whose
registered
leader&#151;</div><a name="08111177000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
has put forward two or more persons to be considered for appointment as
a nominated Commissioner, or...previously put
forward&#148;.</div><a name="08111177000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if he explained the confusion and said why matters
are not clear to him, although I know that none of us can answer for
the Electoral Commission&#146;s confusion on this matter, or indeed
any
other.</div><a name="08111177000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000478"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is a possible interpretation, but the
problem is that we will be able to tell whether a party is a nominating
party only when it has actually done it. That is a confusing way to
draft
anything.</div><a name="08111177000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000479"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, he says that I have given a possible interpretation. Will he
help me to understand his point by giving me another possible
explanation of the clause? I will be happy to deal with his concerns if
I can understand them a bit
better.</div><a name="08111177000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000480"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not want to be too technical, but let us
suppose that a party previously nominated two names for commissioner in
the first round of nominations. The person nominated by the party then
resigns, dies or retires, at which time the party refuses to nominate a
second time around. However, it then qualifies as a nominating party
because it put forward two or more persons for consideration on the
previous occasion. Thought has to be given ahead to the next round of
appointments to see where the confusion might
be.</div><a name="08111177000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000481"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am still confused. I draw the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s attention to clause 5(4)(b), which includes the
words</div><a name="08111177000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;previously
put forward persons one of whom was appointed as a nominated
Commissioner&#148;.</div><a name="08111177000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
that point, we are in the same hypothetical example as he has just
given. The provision continues with the
words</div><a name="08111177000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
is expected to continue to hold office.&#148;</div>
<a name="08111177000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all respect to
him, someone who is dead cannot reasonably be expected to continue to
hold office.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div><a name="08111177000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000482"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The problem with that interpretation is that the
linking word between subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) is
&#147;or&#148;, not &#147;and&#148;. If it were
&#147;and&#148;, the Minister would be right, but he is not right.
We are reaching the point at which I might ask permission to press the
amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="08111177000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000483"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
distinguished academic provenance in the law, and I am happy to talk to
parliamentary counsel about the matter to see whether we can deal with
it. I am also happy for him to press the amendment to a Division, but I
draw his attention to the fact that we think that the provision is
clear. If the view of parliamentary counsel is that it can be made
clearer, of course we will be happy to act accordingly and table an
amendment in due course. I undertake to seek the advice of
parliamentary counsel, who will, of course, have the benefit of his
advice.</div><a name="08111177000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000484"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that final
concession. I am conscious of the fact that if a vote were to be called
at this point, the amendment might well be carried. However, I am not
confident enough of my drafting, which was done in a few hours last
Thursday, to call a vote on whether to put the clause in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000485"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Might the hon. Gentleman not consider calling a
vote and getting the measure in the Bill? If his drafting is not quite
perfect, the Government will be forced to sort the matter out on
Report. Otherwise, we have no guarantee that we will ever sort this
out.</div><a name="08111177000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000486"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, that is a strong point. I am totally
convinced on it, so I think I should ask for a vote to be
called.</div><a name="08111177000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000487"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman is normally extremely courteous,
but I point out that I have given an undertaking to the Committee that
if parliamentary counsel think the matter can be clarified, it will be
clarified.</div><a name="08111177000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think there is any drafting defect. Obviously a vote is the
essence of democracy and I would not for a moment resist that, but I
have given an undertaking to the Committee, and by saying that we have
no guarantee that this will ever be sorted out, the hon. Gentleman is
slightly taking issue with what I have said. I hope he did not intend
to cast doubt on the assurance I have given the Committee. I would be
grateful to have his confirmation of that put on the
record.</div><a name="08111177000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000488"></a>David

matter.</div><a name="08111177000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000489"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have to tell the Committee that I am waiting
for the hon. Member for Epping Forest to reply to the debate. If the
hon. Member for Cambridge is indicating that he would like the Chair to
grant a Division on his amendment, I am certainly prepared to do so. Of
course, we could therefore have two Divisions. If the hon. Lady wishes
to press her amendment No. 105, she has the right to do so and that
would be the lead Division in this case.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="08111177000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000490"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Much as I would be inclined to press amendment No.
105 to a Division, I have to admit that because of the timetabling of
the Committee&#151;I am sure, Sir Nicholas, that you will recall the
exchange we had about starred amendments at the beginning of
Thursday&#146;s sitting&#151;the problem came to light only when
the electoral commissioner mentioned it when we took evidence on
Thursday afternoon, as the hon. Member for Cambridge rightly
said.</div><a name="08111177000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Practically
speaking, I had not hours but minutes to draft amendment No. 105. It is
important to bring this matter to the attention of the Committee so
that it can be debated, as indeed we have just done. As I have already
said, and as I am sure my hon. Friends and I will say many more times
in considering the Bill, many areas are not clear. Law that is not
clear is bad law. All we want to do is clarify the
matter.</div><a name="08111177000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept entirely what the Minister says about it being unlikely that the
circumstances we envisage might arise. Of course, I also
accept&#151;in the honourable way in which it was meant&#151;that
the Minister has undertaken to look at the issue and bring it back to
the House for consideration on Report. That is important for the sake
of clarity. However, I had only a few minutes to draft amendment No.
105 and I admit that the hon. Member for Cambridge is a better academic
lawyer than I am. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I thank my hon. Friends for
that vote of
confidence.</div><a name="08111177000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment No. 108 is rather more meaningful
than my amendment No. 105, so I intend to seek the Committee&#146;s
leave to withdraw my amendment, leaving amendment No. 108 for
consideration.</div><a name="08111177000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000491"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We are getting slightly confused about the
provenance of the amendments. It is our contention that the Bill is
extremely clear. All members of the Committee have had access to the
Bill and have, no doubt, read it with great care. Indeed, some of the
amendments show how carefully Opposition Members have read it, so I am
surprised that they have been deflected by a stray comment from the
Electoral Commission&#146;s evidence, which seems to have overturned
their own careful reading of the Bill. Until then, they were completely
satisfied by the clause, but now they suddenly think that something
might be wrong. With all respect to hon. Members who have mentioned the
shortness of the time that they had to draft something, they have had
plenty of time. The Bill was there and the measure was clear. Everybody
was clear about what the clause meant until the Electoral Commission
made that stray
comment.</div><a name="08111177000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000492"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I allowed a fairly lengthy intervention there so
that the Minister could clarify the Government&#146;s
position.</div><a name="08111177000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000493"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> With all due respect, the Minister forgets that the
whole purpose of the new procedure of taking evidence from outside
people is to assist Public Bill Committees at this stage of proceedings
in examining what is before them.</div>
<a name="08111177000239"></a>

Laing:</b><b class="B"> </b>Indeed. Not every member of this Committee
is a good enough academic lawyer and parliamentary draftsman to pick up
every possible defect in the Bill from their own reading of it. My
goodness, I would have got a first in law if I could do that, but I did
not. In any case, it is so long since I studied law that I have
forgotten an awful lot of what I learned about parliamentary
draftsmanship. The very purpose of having those learned people before
us in the Committee last week was so that we might benefit from their
wisdom and experience and therefore table amendments for discussion at
this stage. That is exactly what the hon. Member for Cambridge and I
have sought to do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw my amendment, and I
hope that amendment No. 108 will be considered

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000514"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 111, in
clause 5, page 4, line 21, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6A) A
nominated Commissioner may not participate, deliberate or adjudicate in
any enforcement action or procedure involving, whether directly or
otherwise, the party whose registered leader put forward the
Commissioner&#146;s
appointment.&#146;.</div><a name="08111177000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for the opportunity to debate amendment No. 111, which
would restrict nominated commissioners&#146; ability to participate
in certain proceedings of the Electoral Commission. It is important to
recognise and kick around the notion of what political commissioners
add to the work of the commission and what they could and should have
the responsibility to participate in.</div>
<a name="08111177000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an earlier
debate, I raised concerns about having commissioners from all political
parties. I can accept about 99 per cent. of what the Minister said
about good people who have the nation&#146;s best interests at heart 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>trying to do a good job in difficult circumstances to ensure that
electoral law is robust and something that we can all trust, but when
we get to the point of adding a party political dimension, even as
subtly as we seem to be doing with the party political commissioners,
we deserve and require safeguards on their involvement and activity.
The amendment would ensure that we secured and achieved
that.</div>
<a name="08111177000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">It looks
likely, after our earlier proceedings, that my party would have a
political commissioner. It is therefore incumbent on me to question
what the political commissioners might get up to in terms of the
Electoral Commission. My party and I will know because we will be
there, but we want to ensure that we can trust those people to do the
right thing with their contribution to the Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="08111177000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like a few safeguards to be put in place. We should ask the
political commissioners to exclude themselves from some of the
commission&#146;s workings, particularly when it comes to sanctions
against other political parties, for example. I do not think that that
would be right and appropriate. People in political placements,
commissioners or whatever they are called, may be good people who look
after the interests of the Electoral Commission and ensure that our
electoral system is robust, but is it right that they should take
decisions about other political parties and propose sanctions? That is
why I have tabled the amendment.</div>
<a name="08111177000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
careful and conscious about the role of political commissioners. I
would have liked to have gone further and debated amendments about
their role. There is a debate to be had about how much they should
participate in the work of the commission and what role they should
have, particularly when it comes to sanctioning other political parties
and ensuring that they are subject to inquiries. I would like to hear
the Minister&#146;s view on what safeguards or limits there should be
on the involvement and participation of political commissioners in the
general work of the commission.</div>
<a name="08111177000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000515"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I do not consider amendment No. 111 necessary, but
I do consider its principle absolutely correct. I am pleased that the
hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire introduced it so that we can
discuss it. One would hope that the deliberations of the Committee
might possibly be taken into consideration by those who run the
Electoral Commission or the Speaker&#146;s Committee and anyone else
concerned with the consequences of the Bill. The principle that he has
espoused is correct. I hope that the Minister will say that we do not
need to incorporate the amendment, but that its intent and principle
are
correct.</div><a name="08111177000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000516"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I support the amendment. This is not about the
other things that the commission does, but, when enforcement
proceedings are before the commission, it seems correct to say, clearly
and openly, that the people nominated by political parties should take
no part in consideration of sanctions against the party that nominated
them. That is not to cast aspersions on the fairness or competence of
those people, but to deal with the essential point that justice must be
seen to be done&#151;the appearance and the perceptions. It is
absolutely right for that to be put in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
only counter-argument is the old argument sometimes used by traffic
engineers against putting up particular road signs. A road sign that
says one should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>not do something might imply that one can do all sorts of other things.
That always seems to me to be a bad idea. Putting down this particular
marker does not have implications for anything else that should happen
in the commission&#151;it does not say that, in other circumstances,
it is permitted for commissioners to take part in proceedings that they
would be barred from by the ordinary rules of public law. It is
essential that this point about enforcement proceedings be part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08111177000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000517"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course we understand and are sympathetic to the
intention behind the amendment. No one wants any suggestion of
partiality, partisanship or bias to taint the work of the Electoral
Commission. However, we believe that the amendment could be
counter-productive. Any suggestion that those nominated commissioners
would act in any way other than wholly impartially will damage public
confidence in the Electoral Commission. If we create a two-tier
commission by saying that nominated commissioners can deal with this,
but not with that, we are, in essence, conceding the case that they may
act in a partisan and biased
way.</div><a name="08111177000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111177000518"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Are they not just
different, by being politically elected? The Minister is putting all
the commissioners into the same box but that simply does not reflect
real
life.</div><a name="08111177000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000519"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course they are different, in that they have
wide political experience, which need not be elected experience,
although they may have that. The hon. Gentleman is right, but that is
not my point. Once they are members of the commission, they will be
expected to act in an impartial, non-partisan way and we have every
expectation that they will. To exclude them from certain areas, such as
enforcement, is to concede the case, implicitly at least, that in such
circumstances they may act so that their partisan bias overrides their
belief in the integrity of the electoral system. We simply do not
believe that to be the case. For all the reasons I set out earlier in
Committee, we think that party leaders will nominate people who will
act in the interests of the integrity of the system as a whole, not in
the interests of the particular political party that they served in the
past. All experience tells us that there are numerous people with
political experience who will act in precisely that way. After the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention, I shall come on to the question of the
appearance.</div><a name="08111177000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000520"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In a way it is a question of the appearance, but
it is also a question of what the courts will make of this. Is the
Minister absolutely confident that, in a judicial review of a decision
of the Electoral Commission on enforcement&#151;about a particular
party, where someone nominated by that party took part&#151;that the
commission would be immune from having its decision overturned? I
cannot see how he can
be.</div><a name="08111177000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08111177000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000521"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman is a distinguished enough lawyer
to know that I am not going to pre-judge the result of every court
case, but I hope that he will agree with me that the courts make
decisions based on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>the facts before them at the time; he nods assent. If that is the case,
what matters is not that a commissioner has been selected on the basis
of their political experience, but the way they have acted in a
particular case. What matters in this context is whether they have
acted in a way that indicates partisan bias that could override the
public interest and the integrity of the electoral system. What matters
is the behaviour of each commissioner in the case in question, not
their previous background or how they have been
selected.</div>
<a name="08111177000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08111177000522"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The point that the Minister is not taking into
account&#151;although he said he might address it in a
minute&#151;is that appearance is essential in all of that. A
fundamental principle in the Sussex Justices case is that justice
should not only be done, but be seen to be done, and that is the
problem that the commissioner will face on judicial review if the
Minister insists on his present line of
argument.</div>
<a name="08111177000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000523"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, I thought
that he was asking me how the courts would decide in a particular case,
and I thought that we agreed that the courts decide on the facts,
rather than on the appearance of the
facts&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Well, it is a fundamental principle
that justice should be seen to be done, and of course that is right. In
questions of judicial review, however, what matters is whether or not
the commissioners have acted with bias. We are confident that they will
not. If they do, they of course will be vulnerable to judicial
review.</div>
<a name="08111177000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000524"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Does the Minister agree that, if a matter of narrow
party political interest arose that would significantly affect a party
and was being considered by the Electoral Commission, it would not be
sufficient to prevent the one commissioner nominated by that political
party from taking part in proceedings and that, if bias is to be
assumed, all the commissioners nominated by political parties would
have to be prevented from taking part? If bias is to be assumed, and
that is a logical conclusion, there is no point in having those
commissioners. I would argue that there is a point in having the
commissioners and that we have to assume that there will not be bias
because that is the nature of the type of person who we, as a
legislature, envisage will take the role of commissioner having been
nominated by a political
party.</div><a name="08111177000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000525"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> When the hon. Lady began her intervention I thought
that she was about to disagree with me, but I think that by the time
she had finished she was agreeing with the point I was trying to make.
I will come exactly to the point about appearance. The hon. Member for
Cambridge is of course right: not only must we expect the Electoral
Commission to act without bias, but it must be seen to do so. The whole
point of the amendment is to create the impression that the nominated
commissioners cannot be trusted to act without bias, and that must be
counter-productive.</div>
<a name="08111177000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
point, as the hon. Lady said, of having the nominated commissioners is
to bring political experience. If we agree, as the Committee on
Standards in Public Life does, that we should have such commissioners
to improve the integrity of our public life and ensure that the
Electoral Commission can act as a regulator with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>the proper knowledge and experience to bring to bear on the difficult
decision it has to make, we must proceed on the assumption that those
nominated commissioners will act without bias. The amendment calls that
into question. Were it to be accepted, it would have the opposite
effect to that which it is designed to achieve. We hope that the
Committee will, after consideration, and while being completely
sympathetic to the aims behind the amendment, proceed on the assumption
that we can trust the nominated commissioners to act without bias, that
the amendment would cast doubt on that and that it should be
rejected.</div><a name="08111177000284"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000526"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This is an important point. A month ago the new
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 dealing with conflicts of interest
for directors came into force. The Minister may wish to look at them,
because conceptually, in corporate governance terms, until then it was
a matter for the board to make up its own mind, as he is saying.
Company law has now changed that attitude, and a procedure is now laid
down for dealing with conflicts, which is based on a mixture of
shareholders, the board and the articles. In corporate law, we have
moved away from the position that the Minister is advocating in the
Bill. He may want to look at how corporate life has moved on, because
it has implications for the Bill. We may not end up with exactly the
provisions that have been suggested, but there are procedures that
should be put in place.</div>
<a name="08111177000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000527"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
constructive and helpful suggestion and, of course, we must always be
prepared to learn from other experience, but, with all due respect,
this is a different area of public life. We cannot, as a Government or
a Committee, seek to micromanage the judgments of the commission on
often very complicated, difficult and important issues, and we do not
want to. Setting out a process for doing that, particularly in relation
to the amendment excluding commissioners, trying to decide whether we
have the whole commission for this or only part of it for that and
creating a two-tier structure would be counter-productive for the
reasons that I have stated. I hope that the Committee will resist the
amendment if it is pressed.</div>
<a name="08111177000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000528"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> The Minister has been pretty convincing this
morning, but he is on less steady ground in response to this amendment,
and I say that with great respect. We have to have it out there and
accept that there are two classes of commissioner: the standard
commissioners of the Electoral Commission and politically appointed
commissioners. We cannot get away from it&#151;there are two
different types and two different standards. To pretend otherwise is
naive on the Minister&#146;s behalf. The commission itself raised
doubts about
that.</div><a name="08111177000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
always have to remember that when something is reported on and when
conclusions are made, it is passed to the police. Those cases and
circumstances may become police investigations, so the charge of
political bias will be open to legal challenge. I am a former musician,
not a lawyer like some of the distinguished people here, but anything
that could be open to a legal challenge on that basis cannot be a good
thing and has to be dealt with. The Minister&#146;s response has not
convinced me. In very difficult situations and circumstances, political
commissioners taking a view on enforcement issues with other political
colleagues is not the way forward. I have great concerns and I shall
press the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div><a name="08111177000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000529"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> To be clear about the position, theoretically it
is, of course, possible that those nominated commissioners may have to
recuse themselves. I am not ruling it out or saying that they have to
be present at all points in all discussions on sensitive issues. That
is not the case. There may be such eventualities&#151;I cannot
speculate on what they might be now&#151;but it would be wrong to
rule out the theoretical possibility that they may all have to recuse
themselves for the sort of reasons that the hon. Gentleman advanced.
However, do we want to constrain the operation of the commission in the
way that he suggests, given that that may have precisely the opposite
effect to what the Committee, as a whole, wants to achieve with the
Bill with the inclusion of the nominated
commissioners?</div><a name="08111177000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111177000530"></a>Pete

clause 7 that members of the Committee have not really been in a
position to put forward in an amendment, but on which I would like the
Government to put their position on the record. Is it a good idea to
reduce from 10 years to five years the period of restrictions on
political activities for non-political commissioners? The Electoral
Commission&#146;s view seems to be that, although it is not
particularly in favour of political commissioners, if there are to be
political commissioners, there must be a very clear distinction between
the political and non-political ones. I would like the Government to
put on record their reply to the Electoral Commission&#146;s
point.</div><a name="08111177000331"></a>
