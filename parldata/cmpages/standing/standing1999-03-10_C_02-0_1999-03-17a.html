<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be  made. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume the adjourned  debate, hon. Members may find it helpful if I make a short  statement on procedure. As they will know, since last  week's debate a number of further amendments have been  tabled that relate to the matter under consideration. In  accordance with precedence, I have selected those  amendments and have grouped them with amendment  No. 4, which is the amendment technically before the  Committee. 
<P>
Therefore, with amendment No. 4 we shall take the  following amendments: No. 69, in page 2, line 2, leave  out from `organisation' to `him' in line 3 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`has concluded on the balance of evidence available to it that it  would have dismissed'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 62, in page 2, line 3, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`considered dismissing him' and insert `concluded that dismissal  was appropriate'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 66, in page 2, line 4, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(bb) that the organisation is in receipt of evidence which, if the  individual had not previously resigned or retired, would have been  sufficient, in the view of that organisation, to lead to dismissal;'.

<P>
No. 38, in page 2, line 11, at end insert`; or 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) that the individual has resigned or retired and, in a period not  exceeding five years from the date of that resignation or retirement,  information has come to light such that the organisation would have  dismissed him, or would have considered dismissing him, on such  grounds had he not resigned or retired.'.

<P>
Any hon. members who wish to seek a separate vote  on one or more of the grouped amendments should say so  during their contribution to the present debate. 
<P>
I shall call first the hon. Member for Denton and  Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who I understand was on his feet  when the debate was adjourned. Other hon. Members will  then be able to contribute, whether or not they have  already spoken. 
<P>
May I also say that any hon. Members who wish to  remove their jackets because of the weather may do so? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge):  On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. My understanding from  reading the report of the proceedings is that the Minister  was on his feet when the debate was adjourned. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish):  Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. Strictly  speaking, the Minister was on his feet in an intervention  to me. As I understand it, he had just finished his  intervention. That is why you asked me to speak,  Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that that clarifies the situation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> It is nice to see you, Mr. O'Brien, and I  am glad that you have allowed us to take our jackets off.  It is a pity you did not warn me beforehand: I might have  ironed the back of my shirt. 
<P>
It may be useful if I recap, because other amendments  are now grouped with amendment No. 4. Our fear was  that if an organisation were even fleetingly thinking of  taking action to put somebody on the list, it would have  no choice: it would have to do so. We wanted to persuade  my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley)  that the Bill should require a judgment to be made as to  whether the matter was serious before a name was put on  the provisional list, in order to deal with a situation in  which an individual is hauled up before a management  committee or a superior officer and told, "We're unhappy  about this. What are you going to do about it?"	, and the  individual says "I'll resign"	. In the past, such people have  resigned and everybody involved with the matter has  thought "That's nice. We've got it out of the way. We  don't need to do any more about it."	 There have been  occasions when the police should have been called in, but  they were not, because everybody felt that everything was  all right. 
<P>
When such an incident occurs the person must be put  on to the provisional list. However, we do not want a  person to say that he will resign, perhaps because he does  not want the publicity, even though the misdemeanour is  not serious. Therefore, as amendment No. 4 suggests, we  want a test that the misbehaviour was of some  significance. 
<P>
The second situation that we wanted to address is dealt  with in later amendments, and in my amendment No. 138  I think that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire  (Mr. Lansley) said that in that amendment I was walking  into the trap that I am now trying to avoid with  amendment No. 4, so I have redrafted it.    
<P>
What often happens is that someone appears to be  successful in his role of looking after children. He may  be promoted, perhaps to another authority, and move  somewhere else. Soon after that, the replacement who  starts to work with the original group of children may  begin to get an impression from the children that things  were happening that should not have happened. It may  take six months or more to establish that the person whom  everyone thought was doing a perfectly good job had been  abusing his position. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In view of the events that have  unfolded in the London borough of Lambeth during the  past 12 months or so, is the hon. Gentleman satisfied that  five years is long enough? Might events come to light  after a much longer period? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I thought long and hard about that matter.  Before responding to it, however, I want to develop my  remarks further. 
<P>
We need to be certain that the Bill will catch someone  who has been discovered committing wrongdoings long  after he has left his job, but I am worried about how far  back it is reasonable to go. I am also worried about false  memory syndrome. On occasion, it may be difficult to go  back very far. From my experience as a teacher, I know  that it is relatively easy to mount a defence against the  occasional false allegation that is made by a pupil if the  events are fairly clear to oneself and to one's colleagues.  However, when one goes back further than five years, it  is extremely difficult for justice to be done on either side. 
<P>
However, I fully admit that the five-year period is  arbitrary. I proposed it in a probing capacity, so to speak,  to establish whether the legislation would cover the  situation in which information came to light about  someone only after he had moved to another job. It is  important to get on the register that case and the case of  someone who resigns and who does not seek another job  in child care. 
<P>
I shall listen with interest to the speech of my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge, and I hope that the  Minister will explain how he interprets the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman  for reminding us of the discussion that we were having  last Wednesday. Since then, as you said, Mr. O'Brien, I  have tabled some amendments, as have my hon. Friend  the Member for South Cambridgeshire and the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish. 
<P>
With the possible exceptions of the Minister and the  hon. Member for Stourbridge, Committee members share  a consensus about the fact that we need to tighten up the  provisions and ensure that people who resign to avoid  dismissal in circumstances that give rise to suspicion fall  under the Bill's provisions. However, the Bill should not  be so widely drafted that an organisation has a statutory  obligation to report someone simply because at some  stage it considered the possibility of dismissing him. That  test, which would be far too wide, would be impossible  to police. 
<P>
Amendment No. 69 would tighten up the proposed test  by requiring an organisation to report someone if it  concluded 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on the balance of the evidence available to it that it would have  dismissed"
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
him. In other words, it requires an organisation to go  through the same process or one that is very similar  that it would have gone through if the individual had not  resigned. It will have to decide whether it would have  concluded, on the balance of the evidence available to it,  that it would have dismissed him had he not resigned. The  amendment deliberately contains the phrase: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on the balance of the evidence available to it"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It responds to an objection that was raised last week. If  someone has resigned and is not willing to co-operate  with the organisation that was his former employer,  additional evidence might not then become available. That  would be the choice of the individual if he were not  willing to submit evidence in his defence to the former  employer. That makes this a fair test of the situation in  which the resignation took place. My amendment No. 70  would bring amendment No. 38, tabled by the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish, which would introduce  a new paragraph, into line with my amendment to  paragraph (b) amendment No. 69. 
<P>
We are trying to ensure that we get the balance right.  No one wants people to be able to evade the process  simply by resigning and moving on when trouble is  brewing and they are aware that they are about to be  caught. It is entirely right to include a provision that will  catch people who would have been dismissed, but we  must ensure that it can be policed and that it is fair. We  must strike the right balance between catching those who  should be caught and included on the list, but not casting  the net so wide that the provision cannot be policed and  brings the Bill into disrepute. 
<P>
In your opening comments, Mr. O'Brien, you asked if  those who had tabled additional amendments to be  debated now, would say whether they wanted to press  them to a Division. I have an open mind at the moment.  There are three sets of amendments: one in the name of  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, one in the  name of my hon. Friend the Member for South  Cambridgeshire and one in my name. They all have the  same purpose. I suggest that the Committee listens to the  hon. Member for Shipley, to my hon. Friend, if he intends  to speak to his amendment, and them to the Minister's  reply on the way in which the amendments would work.  With your permission, Mr. O'Brien, I should like to gain  a sense of the Committee's opinion on which amendments  should be pressed to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I begin  with a question to my hon. Friend the Member for  Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) on which he  may wish to reflect and then tell us his view. His  amendments Nos. 69 and 70 would introduce a test based  on the balance of evidence in relation to someone who  has left an organisation, and suggest that a similar test be  applied to someone who had left a job up to five years  previously. 
<P>
I am a little hesitant about the test in amendment  No. 69, which is that, on the balance of evidence  available, an organisation would have dismissed the  person. The test in amendment No. 70 is that, on the  balance of the evidence available, it could have dismissed  the person. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I ask my hon. Friend to bear with me for  a moment. 
<P>
The difference is significant. Amendment No. 70 is the  better solution, and more in line with my amendment  No. 66. We had a useful discussion during our previous  sitting that prompted us all to reconsider the clause. Each  amendment has something to be said for it. I shall explain  why, having seen the other two amendments, I think that  amendment No. 66 might be preferable.    
<P>
Amendments Nos. 69 and 62 suggest that the former  employer of an individual who has resigned or retired  should go through a process that is similar to that he  would have undergone were the individual still in  employment, in order to determine whether dismissal  were appropriate. We are not working with those  circumstances. Once an individual has left employment,  an employer cannot undergo the same process that he  would have followed had the individual still been in  employment. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the subsection, provisions enable an  employer to make a notification to the Secretary of State  on the basis of a suspension. If evidence comes to light  that gives cause for concern, it may lead to the suspension  of an employee and to disciplinary proceedings. We are  looking for a set of circumstances the Minister rightly  guided us on this in an intervention last Wednesday in  which someone who might have committed some abuse  leaves employment before an employer instigates  disciplinary proceedings and undertakes a suspension. 
<P>
The comparable case is of someone who has resigned  or retired quickly, where there is prima facie evidence  not balancing evidence, because that would not have been  accumulated for suspension, but where suspension has  not occurred. In those circumstances, the employer is  unable to make a notification under subsection (2)(d). We  do not want the test to be whether an employer would  have dismissed an individual, but whether he would have  suspended an individual. 
<P>
Amendment No. 66 would allow an employer to judge  prima facie evidence alone, without the benefit of  additional evidence or submissions from the former  employee. We are not trying to create a set of  circumstances in which action may be taken once  disciplinary proceedings have finished, but to recreate  circumstances in which, if the employer's prima facie  evidence is proved, dismissal could ensue. That takes me  back to "could"	 rather than "would"	. 
<P>
<B>Mr Hammond:</B> I am intrigued by my hon. Friend's  argument, but must disappoint him by pointing out that  the "could"	 in amendment No. 70 is a typo; it should be  "would"	. I do not think that "could"	 is a strong enough  test. We are asking an employer whether he would have  dismissed that employee, had he not resigned, on the  balance of available evidence. I do not think that my hon.  Friend's argument is persuasive. Having decided that an  employee should be suspended, will an employer  subsequently have to go through the whole process of  deciding whether he should have been dismissed? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I understand what my hon. Friend is  saying, but if someone has resigned or retired before an  employer can instigate disciplinary proceedings, the  employer cannot go through the process of determining  whether he would have dismissed the employee because  the employee will not participate or provide  countervailing evidence. We should not rely on whether  the employer is in a position to undertake the conclusion  of disciplinary proceedings.    
<P>
The employer does not make the final decision. The  purpose of the subsection is to obtain notification from  employers of all those circumstances in which there is  evidence that abuse may have occurred. The Secretary of  State judges whether someone is added to the list. My  hon. Friend is right to say that a conclusion must be  reached on whether evidence is proof of a nature and  seriousness that justifies inclusion on the list, but that  judgment should be the Secretary of State's. The purpose  of the clause is to bring to the notice of the Secretary of  State all such possible circumstances. Where an individual  resigns or retires before an event comes to light and,  therefore, before suspension can take place, it should not  be the employer's job to reach a conclusion. Beyond  providing the Secretary of State with evidence, the  employer should have no further role. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hammond:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's  argument carefully but, unless I am mistaken, where a  reference is made under subsection (2)(d), the Secretary  of State must satisfy himself under subsection (5)(b)  that the organisation has dismissed, or confirmed the  transfer of, the individual on such grounds. In such a  circumstance, there would need to be a consequential  amendment requiring the organisation to confirm that it  would have so dismissed such an individual. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is testing me, but I do  not think that that is right. Under subsection (6)(b), the  Secretary of State may, I think, on the basis of evidence  presented by an employer who is unable to conclude  dismissal proceedings, decide that a person who has been  notified is unsuitable to work with children. It is difficult  to read the Bill carefully on one's feet, but I believe that  that is correct. 
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to make subject to  notification the circumstances described by the Minister.  Where such information comes to light, the employer  should not be required to provide evidence or reach a  conclusion on the appropriateness of a dismissal, but to  make an individual subject to notification. Where an  individual has left employment, it should be the  responsibility of the Secretary of State to reach a  conclusion. 
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I have been  wrestling with the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.  We have talked about employees who get offside when  things start get difficult. What about employers who,  rather than risking local scandal and bringing shame to  their communities, collude with their employees and let  them go without dealing with the problem? In trying to  tighten the law, are we chasing the wrong hare? In such  cases, we should tackle the employers, because it is they  who will have failed to adhere to the spirit of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has  made an important point, although it is not one at which  the amendment is directed, but the entire clause. The  clause will place a statutory obligation on employers to  make notifications in such circumstances. We should  return to the matter later to see whether, in terms of  enforcement, the provision continues robustly to deal  with that. 
<P>
I have explained the reasoning behind the amendment.  I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede  and Weybridge that it is too early to say which  amendment will be pressed, if necessary, to a Division.  However, I would prefer the debate to continue, so that  the validity of my arguments can be put to the test.    
<P>
<B>Ms Debra Shipley </B>(Stourbridge): Thank you,  Mr. O'Brien. I am pleased to serve under your  chairmanship, and I shall be seeking guidance on what is a  complicated but sincere argument. Valuable contributions  have already been made. I should like to address  amendment No. 4, which was moved by my hon. Friend  the Member for Denton and Reddish. We want to avoid a  situation where the employer is under an obligation to  refer in circumstances where dismissal was not a serious  option but a passing consideration. I have taken extensive  legal advice on that matter. By excluding referrals in the  second of the two cases, which I will outline in a moment,  referrals for a distinct class of cases would have been  excluded. That would be a massive loophole enabling  abusers to leave employment as soon as an allegation of  abuse is made against them and before the employer has  an opportunity to complete his investigation. 
<P>
I shall outline for the Committee what the clause does.  I cannot accept the amendment, and I fully understand the  Committee's desire to avoid a situation where the  employer is under an obligation to refer. Subsection (2)  deals with two distinct eventualities. First, it covers cases  where an individual would have been dismissed. An  individual who has engaged in misconduct that satisfies  the criteria of referral misconduct that harmed a child or  placed a child at risk of harm can be suspended or  moved while the employer investigates the matter. As a  result of the employer's investigation and possibly a  disciplinary hearing, the employer may be satisfied that  the individual is guilty of misconduct and should be  dismissed or moved to a non-childcare post. Before that  decision can be communicated, however, the individual  may resign or retire. Alternatively, the individual may  admit to the misconduct as soon as the allegation is raised,  and the employer may decide to dismiss. The individual  may retire or resign before the communication of the  employer's decision. In such cases, the employer can only  conclude that dismissal is appropriate because he has  completed his inquiry into the allegation. Those cases are  perhaps not problematic. 
<P>
Secondly, cases where an employer "would have  considered dismissing"	 are covered. In such cases, an  allegation has come to light that satisfies the criteria but  before the employer could complete his investigation, the  individual resigns or retires. Until the employer has  completed his investigation, he cannot conclude with any  certainty that the individual would have been dismissed.  Such a conclusion would be premature, and although the  employer should undertake all investigations that are open  to him, he may be unable to conclude his inquiries. 
<P>
For example, if an allegation of abuse were made by a  child, the employer would need to interview the child and  seek corroborating evidence from an independent source.  He should also attempt to obtain the individual's  comments on the allegations. In circumstances where the  employer has been able to obtain one side of the story  for example, where it has not been possible to obtain the  individual's comments it is difficult for him to conclude  that he should dismiss the individual. He could  realistically conclude only that he would have considered  dismissal a serious possibility or as within the range of  reasonable options.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady is coming right to the  point. The question is whether there might be  circumstances where an employer receives evidence that  causes him to consider dismissal, but the evidence is so  transparently inadequate or limited that it cannot be  regarded as sufficient grounds for dismissal. In such  circumstances, she proposes that an employer should be  under a statutory obligation to notify such a person to the  Secretary of State even though the employer may know  from a day's work that the evidence is simply not  sufficient to lead to dismissal. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I do not think that that is the case. The  legal advice that I have taken following the discussion  that we had last week suggests that "would have  considered"	 is a serious test. As a point of law, it is an  accepted test. 
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett: I am worried that the Committee spent a  good half an hour last week, and has spent almost half an  hour today, on this matter. It was hoped that the Bill  would be easy to understand. The substantial number of  voluntary organisations that will consult it are not going  to want to have to get a lawyer to interpret it for them.  Perhaps someone will write a best seller explaining it, but  I have always strongly believed that there is a big  advantage in legislation saying what it means very clearly.  My hon. friend has put forward good explanations she  referred to her legal advice but how is someone who  is not a lawyer clearly to understand what they read in  the Bill? </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> There is a precedent for this. The phrase  "would have considered"	 is also used in section 15 of the  Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. It is already  on the statute book and operating in law, and voluntary  organisations deal with it in an adequate and reasonable  manner. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish. The fact that a lack of clarity exists  in other legislation is not an argument for allowing it in  the Bill that we are now considering. The thrust of the  hon. Lady's argument is that the test should be whether  there is a prima facie case for consideration of dismissal.  That is what I have tried to capture in referring to the  balance of available evidence. I have not heard her say  explicitly that the ground of "would have considered  dismissing"	 requires a clear prima facie case for dismissal.  If I were satisfied that that is what the wording requires,  I would be happier about it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I have clearly outlined the two areas that  the clause addresses and how it does so. We should bear  in mind William Utting's 1997 report. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While it is understandable that some employers will be relieved  when a troublesome employee leaves or they manage to dismiss him  and will thankfully close the file, it does children no service for the  employer to fail to take all possible steps to prevent that person  getting another job working with children."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The clause addresses precisely that problem. The Utting  report has been a guiding light in defining the Bill's  objectives, as has the working group. 
<P>
I turn to the two amendments that were tabled by the  hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire and for  Runnymede and Weybridge, which deal with the time  aspect. I am worried about introducing a time element. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I believe that the hon. Lady is thinking  both of amendment No. 63 tabled by the hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish and the hon. Member for Taunton  (Jackie Ballard) and amendment No. 70 tabled by my hon.  friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, both  of which provide for a five-year limit.    
<P>
Before the hon. Lady moves on to another subject, I  should point out that the other parts of the clause provide  that employers must notify the Secretary of State if they  have received evidence of abuse that leads to the dismissal  or suspension of an employee. The hon. Lady's proposal  will create an anomaly whereby someone who leaves  employment could be referred to the Secretary of State on  the basis of evidence that falls short of that test. The  evidence required for an employer to have "considered  dismissing him"	 is substantially less than the evidence  that an employer would require to suspend employees or  to dismiss them after disciplinary proceedings. That  different test would not be appropriate just because  somebody has left employment very quickly. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I have to disagree with the hon.  Gentleman. The Bill's approach to those two different sets  of circumstances is important. We have to remember the  sort of people that the Bill is aimed to deal with, and the  way in which such people operate. They are likely to  move on, and they take advantage of the circumstances  that they encounter. Amendment No. 4 would exclude an  employer from considering referring an individual to the  Secretary of State  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We are not discussing amendment No. 4. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thought that we were, and that the hon.  Gentleman had referred me back to it did he not do that? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Lansley:</B> I am not arguing in favour of amendment  No. 4. I am arguing that the Committee should agree to  one of amendments Nos. 69, 62 and 66. I happen to prefer  amendment No. 66, but it is better to address those  amendments rather than amendment No. 4. I know that it  is the lead amendment, but the Committee has moved on. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his  clarification, which shows why I was a little surprised  when I thought that he was taking me back to amendment  No. 4. I was obviously wrong. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): Just now, the hon. Lady  said that the Committee must remember the type of  people in question and the way in which they operate.  Hon. Members on the Opposition Benches are trying to  argue, however, for the protection of people who do not  fall into that category. The debate keeps returning to one  point. Everyone wants to exclude certain people from  working with children. However, sometimes people are  accused, perhaps maliciously, of something that they have  not done. We do not want those people to be prevented  by such accusations from having a career in child care for  the rest of their lives. That is why we are seeking to set a  rather higher threshold than that which the hon. Lady  proposes. 
<P>
The clause states that a child-care organisation "shall"	  refer an employee. If employers think that sanctions will  apply if it is found out that they did not refer an employee  when the idea of dismissal passed through their minds,  the process will be triggered very early. Child-care  organisations will probably err on the side of caution, and  refer all sorts of people just in case, because they do not  want to be prosecuted later for not doing so. The  amendments seek to deal with that problem. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Lady that she  is making an intervention. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank the hon. lady for her intervention.  I should put her mind at rest. The safeguards built into  the Bill are a huge step forward on those currently in  place. Last week, hon. Members argued about the  independent tribunal, rights of appeal and other such  issues. All such procedures massively protect employees  from wrongful dismissal.    
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> Hon. Members have asked  how the words should be interpreted and what the  Government intend them to mean. I hope to reassure  the Committee. Once the Bill receives Royal Assent, the  Government will issue guidance to all of the organisations  covered. That guidance will explain the precise  circumstances in which we envisage the application of the  obligation to refer. I am sure that my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge will agree that we do not intend  to impose on child-care organisations obligations and  burdens that are unclear or unreasonable. For the very  good reasons that my hon. Friend explained, we are  satisfied that the clause does not impose such burdens.  Hon. Members have expressed many concerns about the  wording of the clause. We will specific and practical  guidance to child-care organisations once the Bill receives  Royal Assent. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for  his clarification on that point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I urge the hon. Lady not to go down  the path that the Minister has suggested. If it is clear from  the Bill that there is a need for further guidance in relation  to such a fundamental issue, that guidance should be in  the Bill. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that  guidance will be issued once the Bill has been enacted  with that inadequacy in it. 
<P>
Does not the hon. Lady think that any organisation  would be obliged to consider dismissing anyone against  whom allegations of an appropriately serious nature were  made, whether or not the allegations were proven at the  time? Thus, someone who was the subject of a malicious  allegation would fall within the clause. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> It is very difficult, because we are all  trying to work out something important. We must bear in  mind what we are trying to do, which is to protect  children. For the reasons that I have stated, "would have  considered"	 has specific legal weight. I do not agree that  the clause would be open to malicious intent in the way  that the hon. Gentleman suggests. Because of the way in  which it is structured, from the first referral, the Secretary  of State must address the information given, and will  reject the case if it is insufficient to place the person  temporarily on the list while further consideration of  permanent listing takes place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is unsatisfactory. Provisional listing  gives rise to particular consequences for an individual.  When malicious or transparently ill-founded allegations  are made, if an employer could quickly determine whether  they were sufficient to cause potential dismissal, that  would be quite a different matter from the employer being  obliged to consider dismissal on the basis of such  ill-founded allegations and to send the case to the  Secretary of State while the information was considered  and a provisional listing ensued.

<P>

<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The grounds for dismissal were clearly  described in our debate last week. I cannot accept the hon.  Gentleman's point. The necessary substantial safeguards  have been built into the Bill. 
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 70, which concerns the time  element. Sadly, experience shows substantial examples  have been put to me that abuse frequently takes years,  if not decades, to come to light. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The point about time is that under the  clause, as I read it, there is no provision to take into  account the fact that people may have left employment  some time before events come to light. We are suggesting  not that the time be limited to five years but that there  should be provision to ensure that someone who goes to  another job not as a result of resounding dismissal, as it  were is covered by the Bill. Five years may be  inappropriate we can argue about that but the  fundamental question is: will people who move on  through promotion be caught by the Bill as drafted? 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am addressing the amendment, which  contains a time element. If we are to protect children as  fully as possible by the Bill, we must not handicap  employers by imposing a set time limit on referral. That  is a slightly different case from the one that my hon.  Friend describes. 
<P>
Currently, the Department of Health index has no time  limit. Experience of recent cases of institutionalised abuse  shows that incidents frequently come to light only decades  after they take place the inquiry in Wales is an example  of that. The time element is inappropriate.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened to the hon. Lady's  arguments and accept what she says. Having reviewed the  matter, I can see that amendment No. 70 would restrict  the scope of subjection 2(b), which was certainly not the  intention. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has  put his finger on what we are trying, clearly very  inadequately, to achieve. We are trying to deal with a  number of potential situations. For example, it may be  discovered that a person who has not resigned or retired,  or who has been promoted or whose job has disappeared  through redundancy has abused children in a former  position. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a lacuna, because there is no way of dealing  with a person who has been promoted to a management  job that does not involve dealing with children and it is  discovered four years later that they have been a serial  abuser. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that  clarification. I need to seek the Chairman's guidance at  this point. I dealt with the amendment as it was drafted.  Hon. Members have drawn my attention to a valid issue,  and I do not know how to progress from here because that  is not covered by the amendment as it stands. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the hon. Lady will allow me, I  suggest that the only way to deal with the matter at this  stage is for us to look again at the phrasing of  amendments Nos. 70 and 63 and table an alternative  amendment on Report to deal with the issue. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is a matter of debate. If at  the end of the debate hon. Members feel that amendments  should be tabled on Report, there is no reason why that  should not be undertaken. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> Hon. Members have made valid points to  which I should like to return at a later stage, perhaps on  Report. That depends partly on how long today's sitting  lasts. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should like to contribute to the debate,  but I am not sure if my hon. Friend has concluded her  remarks. 
<P>
<B> Ms Shipley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Minister  I have finished. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I hope in the course of my remarks to  address some of the concerns about the Bill that  hon. Members have raised, which I fully understand. My  hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and the  hon. Members or South Cambridgeshire and for  Runnymede and Weybridge are genuinely trying to ensure  that the Bill that is enacted is good, sensible and sound,  and I am sure that their amendments were designed to try  to achieve that. 
<P>
Members of the Committee will not be surprised to  learn that I believe that this part of clause 2 achieves what  we all want to achieve that is, to ensure that the Bill  contains no obvious loopholes that will allow potential  abusers to gain employment in a child-care organisation  if there is evidence of their proclivities. At the same time,  it does not impose unreasonable, unworkable or unclear  burdens on child-care organisations in determining the  circumstances in which a person is to be referred to the  Secretary of State. 
<P>
The words "would have considered"	 dismissal in this  part of the Bill are not designed to weaken in any way  the standard that will apply in determining whether an  employer refers a person to the Secretary of State. As my  hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said, we have  tried to cover two specific situations. Having listened to  today's debate, I believe that that is now generally  appreciated. The words "would have considered"	 will  cover a situation in which the employer has been able to  come to a decision on whether to dismiss, but the  employee resigns or retires before the dismissal can be  effective. I believe that all hon. Members are satisfied  about that part of the clause. 
<P>
We expect the words "would have considered"	 to cover  a situation in which the employee resigns or retires before  the employer has come to a decision about dismissal,  otherwise dismissal would have been considered. My hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge made it clear that we  do not envisage that an employer who has fleetingly  considered dismissal but then discounted it in other  words, he has ruled it out as a serious option would  nevertheless somehow be required by the Bill to refer that  person's name to the Secretary of State. That is not how  we foresee this part of the bill working.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for  attempting to clarify that, but if an employer had a  disciplinary code which made it clear that when an  allegation was made, a disciplinary procedure that could  lead to dismissal had to be embarked on, would that not  fall within the scope of the phrase "would have  considered"	 dismissing him? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am in a difficult position, as is my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge. We cannot say with  certainty at this point whether that would be an  appropriate course of action in 100 per cent. of cases. It  would be inappropriate for a Minister or any other  member of the Committee to try to do that. 
<P>
We are trying to ensure that the Bill deals with what  we consider to be a serious potential loophole through  which people could slip if we were not careful. My hon.  Friend rightly pointed out that Sir William Utting's report  identified that concern. 
<P>
In answer to the question of the hon. Member for  Runnymede and Weybridge, my hon. Friend the Member  for Stourbridge was quite right to say that the wording of  clause 2(3) is clear: the Secretary of State has a  jurisdiction, too. We are talking about instances when a  person's name has been referred to the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State must be satisfied that it "may be  appropriate"	 for that person's name to be included on the  list. I emphasise that there is no automatic progression  that has not been fully appreciated by hon. Members. The  mere fact that someone has referred a name to the  Secretary of State under these provisions does not  automatically mean that the named person goes on to the  list. Subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State a  competence to be satisfied that it is appropriate for that  person's name to be added to the list. 
<P>
We think that the Bill's wording and the clarification  that we have tried to give to the Committee show that  the provisions will not cover a fleeting, temporary  consideration of dismissal, but the serious consideration  of it as an option. We have drawn on the wording of the  Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 to which my  hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge referred. That  Act has not caused the concerns or practical difficulties  to which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire and  my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish  referred. It is not the case, as the hon. Member for  Runnymede and Weybridge implied, that the 1998 Act is  somehow defective or has not been working properly, so  there is no reason why we should not borrow its wording.  It is working effectively and is not causing those  practical difficulties. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also  expressed concern about the guidance that we intend to  issue to child care organisations, implying that that was a  sign almost an admission that the legislation was  defective. That is not true, either. When enacting  legislation, it is quite normal to provide practical guidance  to those who will be affected by it. The Government do  not accept, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge does not, that the fact that we intend to issue  guidance to employers in any way suggests that we are  not happy with the Bill's wording. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept that issuing guidance is a  perfectly normal procedure, but I was questioning whether  guidance is sufficient on a key issue which many will see,  during the Bill's parliamentary scrutiny, as touching on  the liberty of individuals. I would have preferred to see  something written in the Bill. 
<P>
The Minister referred to the use of the wording of the  Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 and said that it  had not given rise to practical problems. How long has  that Act been in force and operating? Is it not a little early  to say that it has not given rise to practical problems? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not have the date of Royal Assent  on me, so I cannot answer that specific question.  However, we are not aware of the 1998 Act causing the  kind of concerns that the hon. Members for Runnymede  and Weybridge and for South Cambridgeshire said could  be caused by similar wording in the Bill.    
<P>
We are sure that the legislation is robust. We share the  concern of all Committee members not to trample on the  liberty of our citizens we do not want that to happen,  and the clause does not mean that it will. We do not  believe that its wording contains anything unreasonable  or unworkable. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the wording of the  1998 Act, which contains the words "would have  considered dismissing"	. The Act is, of course, on the  statute book, but the wording has been contained in  regulations since 1982. The Committee is discussing  wording with a clear meaning, which has worked without  the difficulties or concerns that have been referred to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> It has worked because people were being  put on the list without being told, so they were not  necessarily in a position to make a fuss. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> As I understand it, we are discussing  concerns about difficulties that the Bill might cause  employers in understanding their obligations to refer  names for inclusion in the list. Hon. Members have  expressed concerns about employers not understanding  the circumstances in which referral is appropriate. I am  trying to explain to my hon. Friend and to the Committee  that such difficulty is not an issue as far as employers  are concerned. The Government believe that the wording  is clear and that employers can be supported in  understanding the legislation by appropriate guidance,  which we will issue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I should like to ask about a point of  information. An employer could receive evidence on the  basis of which he decides that he would have considered  dismissing the employee in question. Such an employer  would then notify the Secretary of State in the manner  described by the Minister. From the moment of referral,  the Secretary of State would include the person on the list  on a provisional basis. We are considering people who  have left employment and who will often have moved on  to other employment. Does provisional inclusion on the  list under clause 7 mean that a subsequent employer is  legally obliged not to continue employing the person  concerned or to suspend that employment? Although the  Minister rests his argument on the Secretary of State's  determination, which is important in the long run, the  consequences bite from the moment of referral. That  means that we have to be very careful about the  circumstances in which referral occurs. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> As I understand it, the effects to which the  hon. Gentleman referred relate to employees' inclusion  on the list and not to the referral of their names. The  consequences flow from inclusion on the list. My hon.  Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish made a point  about the list of the Department for Education and  Employment. He implied that people were not informed  about inclusion on that list, but the Department does tell  people of their inclusion. It is the Department of Health  that does not currently operate that system, and the Bill  tries to change that. The scheme operated by the  Department for Education and Employment includes the  concept "would have considered dismissing"	, and it has  been in operation since 1982. Employees are informed  about their inclusion on the list, and employers and  employees are satisfied that the scheme is workable. It  does not cause the problems about which hon. Members  have spoken.    
<P>
I am trying to reassure the Committee. I am trying not  to muddy the waters or to confuse the issues but to clear  up the reasonable concerns expressed. Given experience  of the list operated by the Department for Education and  Employment, we believe that the Bill imposes a perfectly  workable and practical new duty on employers in dealing  with the category of cases in question. We do not believe  that it will cause the sort of difficulties that have been  described. We intend to clarify how we expect the  provisions to operate when the Bill receives Royal Assent,  to make absolutely sure that no ambiguities or grey areas  cause concern to employers. As my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge said, we can realise both our  main objectives to improve protection for children, by  ensuring that the Bill contains no unnecessary loopholes,  and to provide people with reasonable protection against  unnecessary or unfair inclusion in the list, which carries  the serious consequences at which the hon. Member for  South Cambridgeshire hinted. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard: I was trying to clarify the question that  the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked about  the impact of being referred to the Secretary of State. We  are all trying to reread the Bill while we discuss it.  Subsection </B>(3)(b) states that the Secretary of State shall, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"pending that determination, provisionally include the individual in  the list."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I interpreted that as meaning that once someone was  referred, pending determination of whether the referral  was correct or adequate, he or she would provisionally be  included in the list. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady has got that wrong.  Subsections (4), (5) and (6) specify the detailed  procedures that the Secretary of State must follow when  deciding whether to include someone permanently on the  list. Pending that decision about permanent inclusion, the  Secretary of State may include someone provisionally. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> How will the Secretary of State decide  to send back a referral on the grounds that it is frivolous  and does not need to be drawn to his attention rather than  to include that person on the list provisionally before  determining whether he or she should be permanently  included? What is the trigger for those two choices of  provisional inclusion or sending a referral back because it  is not adequate? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With respect to the hon. Lady, we are  moving beyond the terms of the amendments. Subsection  (3) specifies that if a name is referred to the Secretary of  State for inclusion in the list, the Secretary of State must  be satisfied that it is appropriate for that individual to be  included in the list under clause 1. If the Secretary of  State is satisfied that it is appropriate, that person will  provisionally be included in the list. The Secretary of  State will proceed with the procedures specified in  subsections (4), (5) and (6) in determining whether that  person should be permanently included in the list. A filter  is therefore provided. As I said earlier in response to the  hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, referral does not  mean automatic inclusion in the list. The Secretary of  State must be satisfied that inclusion is appropriate. 
<P>
I hope that I have reassured at least some hon. Members  about the anxieties that they expressed about the clause.  The wording has been used in relation to the teaching  profession for almost 17 years without creating the  problems to which hon. Members referred. We shall  support the Bill by providing proper guidance for  employers to clear up perceived ambiguities or loopholes.    
<P>
Given the Secretary of State's competence and  jurisdiction, we can operate the provisions appropriately  to ensure that scurrilous, irrelevant and inappropriate  considerations such as those to which hon. Members have  referred that might underpin a referral to the list can be  excluded. We have no interest in maintaining a list that is  not accurate, effective or fit for its purpose. If we were to  include people on the list inappropriately, without proper  checks and safeguards, the list would ultimately not be  effective as we would like. 
<P>
For all those reasons and many more we have, with  the help of my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge,  drafted the Bill in that particular way. As my hon. Friend  said, the Bill contains proper checks and balances. 
<P>
We are always prepared to consider all hon. Members'  arguments carefully. However, having heard the  arguments, we think, as my hon. Friend said, that the Bill  as drafted deals with those anxieties and strikes the right  balance between protecting children from abuse and  unnecessary, unclear, burdensome bureaucracies that  would compromise our citizens' civil liberties. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am in a little difficulty. I do not believe  that the amendments that I and Opposition Members have  tabled necessarily solve the problem, but I am not  convinced that my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge has got the matter right yet. When  considering such Bills, I do not like to say that we must  return to matters on Report, because I realise that time is  scarce on Report. However, the most appropriate thing to  do is to withdraw my amendment so that we do not vote  on it, and to hope that, informally, a satisfactory  amendment can be drafted. Perhaps the Minister could  consider the matter further and convince us, but at the  moment he has not convinced us. I understand the  difficulty facing my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge, but there needs to be more clarity in the Bill  rather than leaving the matter to be dealt with by  regulations. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I tend to agree with the hon.  Gentleman. I am conscious of the Minister's  recommendation to me last week not to think in terms  of tactics. I remind him that the School Standards and  Framework Bill to which he referred to earlier was  introduced by the Government and was unlikely to suffer  damage at the hands of hon. Members who concern  themselves with the liberty of the individual. 
<P>
As a private Member's Bill, this Bill will be more  vulnerable to such considerations. It was partly with a  view to protecting it from the concerns of people who  might be unhappy with its wording that we tabled the  amendments. However, I agree with the hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish that it would not be helpful to press  our admittedly imperfect amendments to a Division and  that the matter must be reconsidered on Report. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.    
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in  page 2, leave out lines 8 to 11. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following amendments: No. 10, in page 2, line 29,  leave out from `relevant' to end of line 32. 
<P>
No. 15, in page 2, leave out from beginning of line 41  to end of line 2 on page 3. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I merely want to ask the Minister  whether subsection (3) is really necessary. The clause  deals with an organisation that has suspended a person,  but before it can be considered whether the suspension  needs to be more permanent, the organisation must refer  the individual on. Let us assume that the police found a  youngster who had absconded from a children's home  over the weekend and that the excuse that the youngster  gave for his abscondence was that he was being abused.  He or she might furnish the police with a fairly graphic  account of what had happened, and the voluntary  organisation or the social services department would have  little or no alternative on the Monday morning but to  suspend the person against whom the allegations had  been made. 
<P>
Having suspended that individual, the organisation  might interview the rest of the staff at the children's home  and some of the children and it could take some time to  put together all the information. However, at the end of  10 days or a fortnight, it might be established that the  person could not possibly have committed the offences  that the youngster alleged had taken place. The person  may have had an absolute cast iron alibi. For the  organisation to have to notify the Secretary of State  simply because it had suspended the person rather than  reached a conclusion about what was alleged to have  happened is jumping the gun. We have already discussed  subsection (2)(b) and (c) and surely they cover such  circumstances.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wish to add my support for  amendment No. 5. In most circumstances, a serious  allegation would lead immediately to suspension without  any investigation having been made, albeit a brief  suspension. As the Minister has often reminded us,  subsection (3) provides a further test in that the Secretary  of State, after a referral, will consider whether it was  appropriate for the individual to be included in the list.  However, it is not good practice to create a situation in  which there is a statutory duty to refer someone in  circumstances when the Secretary of State would clearly  determine that it was not appropriate for that person to be  included in the list. It is entirely sensible to leave out  subsection (2)(d) to avoid the slightly absurd situation of  people being reported in the case of any suspension and  the Secretary of State having to exercise his judgment  when that would be far better done by the organisation at  the point when the decision is taken.    
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish for his comments, but I cannot accept  them. I do not want to repeat the arguments, but the  amendment would remove the power in the Bill that  allows employers to refer individuals to the list following  suspension, or provisionally transfer them to a position  not involving access to children. 
<P>
The provision allows the employer to provide an  early warning of concerns so that potential employers  are made aware of them. The individual may seek  alternative employment while under investigation.  Experience shows that abusers do that: they do not stay  put and think, "I want to keep my job"	. They move  on, and we must have some way of listing them. The  amendment would remove this provision. That is  disturbing. 
<P>
On balance, I think that it is appropriate to include this  information on the list. To do otherwise would allow  potentially dangerous individuals to obtain employment  that gave them access to children without a potential  employer being aware of the allegations as there is no  mechanism whereby a new employer can be informed of  the person's inclusion once employment has been taken  up. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but  have we not just had that discussion? We concluded that  however we do it perhaps under the Bill as drafted  we should ensure that if someone was suspended by an  employer, then resigned as a result of that suspension, and  tried to go somewhere else, the employer would make a  notification. The point that the hon. Member for Denton  and Reddish raises in the amendment is whether they  should be notified while suspended. What is the reason  for that? 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the phrase  "while suspended"	? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The purpose of the amendment is, as I  understand it, to take out subsection (2) (d) which requires  an employer to refer to the Secretary of State under clause  1 an employee who has been suspended or transferred  to another position. If the individual were to leave that  employment, subsection (2) (b) would come into play  because the employer could say that he would have  considered dismissing the person. Is referral on the  strength of a suspension, an appropriate act, and what  benefit derives from it? 
<P>
<B> Ms Shipley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that we are  going over ground that has already been debated. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We are trying to cover a situation in  which a suspended person seeks alternative employment  during a period of suspension without the employer being  aware of that fact. We want to ensure that the Bill covers  all the circumstances that could arise. I know that that is  complicated, but we are not dealing with cases in which  the employer knows that the employee has resigned or  retired. We are dealing with a case in which there is a  serious allegation: the person has been suspended and,  unbeknown to the employer, the suspended employee then  seeks alternative work in a child care position. It is  perfectly appropriate that in such circumstances, other  employers should be alert to that.    
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Minister. That  is my reading of the amendment that it would prevent  referral of employees who were transferred. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It would stop it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> Indeed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I understand the Minister's point, which  is a fair one. When the Secretary of State receives a  referral, he may well make a provisional listing. What will  be the consequences of that for the employer, who will  then be employing someone who is provisionally listed?  Clause 7(3) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) above  whether the individual is already employed by the child care  organisation."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The purport of that provision is that the employer shall  not employ someone who is on the list. I am thinking as  we proceed, but if I am right, suspension means that the  individual will no longer be employed in a child care  position. If the hon. Lady and the Minister are  comfortable with that, I will go along with it, but we need  to be clear that that is the position. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> That is my understanding of the position. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is clear under clause 7 that it will be  unlawful to employ someone in a child care position if  they are on the list, but it will not necessarily be unlawful  to continue to employ someone, provided that they are not  working in a child care position. A child care position is  defined in clause 12. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The amendment would not permit the  referral of the sort of cases that we have discussed; that is  an important provision, so I cannot accept the amendment. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett: I am much happier than I was during our  earlier debate. However, we have not solved the  problems in a sense, the Minister has made the situation  slightly worse. He is saying that the organisation will have  to decide to refer the matter to the Secretary of State, and  the Secretary of State will then have to decide whether  the person should be placed on the preliminary list. </B><P>
<P>
I should have thought that it would be difficult for the  Secretary of State to prejudge the organisation's decision  about whether to complete the suspension. The Secretary  of State will be asked to consider whether someone should  go on the provisional list without hearing all the evidence.  In fact, of course, as soon as the whole of the evidence is  heard, the preliminary arrangements will no longer apply. 
<P>
We need to return to the issue, sadly, on Report. On  that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6 in  page 2, leave out lines 15 to 18 and insert `refer the  matter for determination by the Tribunal.'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take  amendment No. 9, in page 2, leave out from beginning of  line 26 to end of line 11 on page 3. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> We move to the question of how  judgments should be made by the Secretary of State.  People concerned about civil liberties will not like the  idea of the Secretary of State making an arbitrary  decision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My hon. Friend said that the Secretary of  State will make arbitrary decisions. The Secretary of State  will take no arbitrary decisions whatsoever. The exercise  of the Secretary of State's competence under the Bill is  clearly laid out. The Secretary of State has a clear legal  obligation to follow those procedures to the letter, subject  to judicial review and the appeal tribunal. So there is no  suggestion of arbitrary decision-making.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I suggest that it will be arbitrary, because  the Secretary of State will have to decide on the basis of  the information available at that point, not the full  information that may emerge later. Some arbitrariness or  luck will be involved because of the information that is  available to the Secretary of State. It would be better to  start with a judicial process. The Minister was hinting  about opting for judicial review, but I do not think we  should keep encouraging people to do that. The  amendment seeks to incorporate the tribunal at the  beginning of the process. 
<P>
Before the Minister intervened, I was about to ask him  to explain to the Committee how he envisages that the  process will work. First, how much effort will the  Secretary of State put into reviewing the information  before someone is put on the provisional list? Secondly,  would the Secretary of State consider an appeal by an  individual who has been put on the provisional list? That  would be one of the best ways of safeguarding civil  liberties, because it would give the individual the right of  appeal at that very early stage. Finally, how quickly will  the Secretary of State process the matter so that people  who have been put on the permanent list get an  opportunity to appeal against their inclusion? The  Minister's response to those questions will help not only  with this amendment but with others that the Committee  has yet to discuss. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hammond:</B> I have to disagree with the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish about the amendment.  I understand the superficial attraction of taking a judicial,  rather than an administrative, approach. However, I  believe that in many of the cases that are referred to the  Secretary of State, the issues will be fairly cut and dried.  I also believe that many people who are referred to the  Secretary of State will wish to go quietly they will not  wish to suffer the ordeal of tribunal proceedings and  would prefer readily to admit that their conduct has been  inappropriate and that they should be placed on the list.  Indeed, I speculate that if the Secretary of State exercises  his discretion carefully, the great majority of people that  he places on the list will decide that they are better off  being included on the list, for their own sake and for that  of society. 
<P>
It is essential that adequate appeal mechanisms exist so  that people who want to contest the Secretary of State's  decision can do so. The Bill greatly improves the current  situation, which includes no appeal mechanisms at all. On  balance, having considered all the issues, I believe that it  is better to stay with an administrative procedure as long  as adequate and proper appeal mechanisms are in place. 
<P>
It is also worth noting that the amendment gives rise to  a technical problem, because the appeal tribunal as it is  constituted does not have the power under clause 4 to  include someone on the list it has the power only to  direct that they should be removed from it. If the  amendment were successful, further amendments to  clause 4 would have to be tabled to give the appeal  tribunal more power.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I know that some of my amendments are  not very well drafted, so I do not want to argue about  them. The best thing to do would be to let people go on  the list, but give them the right to appeal against  preliminary inclusion if they want to. The hon. Member  for Runnymede and Weybridge said that people who did  not want to make a fuss would have to make a fuss, and  it would have been better if I had taken that into account  in drafting the amendment. However, I believe that the  amendment as it stands is perfectly adequate for the  purposes of the debate.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am interested in the hon.  Gentleman's comments, because he appears to have said  that his intention would be better served by the creation  of a right of appeal against provisional inclusion on the  list. If I remember correctly, the Committee will consider  an amendment later that addresses that issue. He may  therefore want to reconsider whether to press the  amendment and whether it is better to debate a right of  appeal in respect of provisional inclusion in the list now.  I agree that the question of whether the amendment is  technically defective is largely irrelevant. It deals with the  issue of principle of whether a judicial or administrative  approach should initially apply. I have thought hard about  the matter and I understand the superficial attraction of  the judicial route. I have concluded, however, that the Bill  deals with the matter in the right way. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall be brief. I have some problems  with the amendments. My main problem is that my  support for them depends on what happens next. Liberal  Democrats were in the same position last week with other  amendments. The introduction of an ability to appeal  against inclusion on the provisional list and/or of a time  limit for such inclusion would make me feel much  happier. The Bill contains no time limit, and during that  time the person affected cannot work in a child care  organisation. 
<P>
Will the Government explain more fully the  administrative process that the Secretary of State will use?  I do not know how many people it is imagined will be  referred on to the list through the various routes. I do not  know whether the Bill's promoter, the hon. Member for  Shipley, envisages a figure, but if it is likely to be about  2,000 or 3,000 I mention those numbers off the top of  my head what process will the Secretary of State go  through before making a complete determination,  according to the steps set out in the Bill, about whether a  referral is realistic? 
<P>
The Minister told us in his intervention on the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish that the Secretary of  State will not make an arbitrary decision, and said that he  would have to follow various steps. He argued that the  judicial review and tribunal procedures are always open  to the appellant. Those procedures are not, however, open  to people on the provisional list. The tribunal procedure  is open only to people on the permanent list. The people  concerned have lost the ability to make a living doing  the work of their choice. They may have worked in their  profession for 20 years and it may be the only one that  they know. Their ability to resort to judicial review or to  tribunals without recourse to public funds will be severely  restricted. Telling us that those options are open is not the  complete answer to ensuring that such people can have  their day in court and their civil liberties taken seriously. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Denton  and Reddish asked for clarification of the procedures that  the Secretary of State will follow. I shall be pleased to  give some because the checks and balances provided by  the Bill and exercised by the Secretary of State are an  important aspect of the legislation that should be fully  understood. The Secretary of State has to determine a  reference in accordance with strict procedures laid down  in subsections (4) to (6) of the clause. People involved  will be provisionally included in the list. After considering  all relevant information before him, the Secretary of State  must confirm an individual's inclusion on the list if he is  of the opinion that the referring organisation reasonably  considered the individual to be guilty of misconduct,  whether or not in the course of employment, that harmed,  or placed at risk of harm, a child. He should also be of  the opinion that the individual is unsuitable to work with  children.    
<P>
The Bill contains a right of appeal to the tribunal, which  will investigate the facts and merits of the case. If the  tribunal is not satisfied either that the individual is guilty  of misconduct or that he is unsuitable for work with  children, it must allow the appeal and direct the removal  of his name from the list. Otherwise, it must confirm the  Secretary of State's decision. That procedure is clear, and  is a massive improvement on existing provisions  regarding civil liberties, as the hon. Member for Taunton  pointed out. It provides the right of appeal to an  independent tribunal if the individual is dissatisfied with  the decision, and, while the Secretary of State does not  himself carry out a fact-finding role, he will review the  reasonableness of the employer's findings. 
<P>
The Secretary of State fulfils an initial sifting role by  investigating a referral and concluding whether the person  is unsuitable to work with children. That role is wholly  compatible with similar administrative considerations  across government. For example, in the Benefits Agency  and the Department of Social Security, officials have  delegated authority to take initial decision on benefit  entitlement, with subsequent referral to an independent  tribunal in the case of dissatisfaction. Other examples  include the Home Office, where similar decisions are  made on immigration applications, which determine  individuals' rights to enter the country. So the procedure  set out in the Bill is standard administrative procedure,  not an exception. 
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett: In view of that response, I beg to ask  leave to withdraw the amendment. </B><P>
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page  2, line 16, leave out from `below' to end of line 18. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take  the following amendments: No. 71, in page 2, line 17,  leave out `pending that determination' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`until such determination of the reference in accordance with  subsection (5) or the expiry of a period of six months from the date  of such inclusion, whichever is the earlier'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 8, in page 2, line 18, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; but 
<P>
(c) not allow the provisional inclusion of the individual in the list  to continue for a period greater than six months.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 24, in clause 4, page 3, line 37, leave out  `(otherwise than provisionally)'.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> We have just heard how the  administrative process will work. That may be perfectly  all right, but how long will it take? What worries me in  particular is subsection (4) (b), because the cycle of asking  for observations may take a substantial length of time. 
<P>
Amendment No. 7 is probably not the best way  forward; it would be much better to introduce a time limit.  That could be done in various ways whether as a time  limit by which the Secretary of State must decide whether  someone should move from the provisional list to the  main list, or by which he must complete the first stage of  his consideration. My hon. friend the Member for  Stourbridge set out firmly the process that someone would  go through before being included. The question is: how  long will that process take? As the hon. Member for  Taunton pointed out, while the process continues,  someone will be being denied employment. The process  therefore needs to be speedy. 
<P>
Alternatively, my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge could agree that the right to appeal to a  tribunal could be introduced from the start, which would  allow individuals to choose to get the matter resolved  quickly if they felt that the accusations were totally  unjustified. If not, they might be happy for the process to  take some time, because that would provide certainty. 
<P>
The amendments are intended to probe how long the  bureaucratic process I do not use that term in a  pejorative sense will take. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the hon. Member for Denton and  Reddish said, amendment No. 7 is intended to eliminate  the concept of provisional inclusion. Earlier, in relation to  a different matter, the Minister explained very adequately  why it is necessary to have a mechanism immediately to  include someone on the list on a provisional basis in order  to achieve the Bill's fundamental objective to protect  children from people who are suspected of being a danger  to them. 
<P>
I entirely understand the concern of the hon. Member  for Denton and Reddish about the Bill as drafted As he  said, amendment No. 8 is a much better way of addressing  the problem than amendment No. 7. If I may be so bold  as to say so, my amendment No. 71 is an even better way  to do so. I say that with great respect to the hon.  Gentleman, but amendment No. 8 appears to be flawed.  I do not believe that the Bill gives the Secretary of State  the power to remove someone from the list having  correctly included him. Therefore, further amendments  would be required to give effect to the hon. Gentleman's  proposals. 
<P>
Amendment No. 71, which I tabled, would make  removal from the list after six months of provisional  inclusion automatic, rather than an act of the Secretary of  State in other words, a sunset provision, as I believe it  is now fashionable to call it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the  amendment would deal with an employee who  deliberately obstructs the course of an employer-led  inquiry into his alleged misconduct, to take the process  beyond the six-month period? As I understand the  amendment, such a person would automatically be  removed from the list, which does not seem sensible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We are seeking to place an obligation  on the Secretary of State to come to a decision within six  months for the reasons that have already been rehearsed.  Being on the list is a serious disability for someone whose  career involves working with children and, if that is to  be done through an administrative mechanism, it is not  unreasonable to suggest that the Secretary of State should  reach a decision in a reasonable time.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With respect, that is not the point. The  problem is not encouraging the Secretary of State to reach  a quick decision because the Secretary of State will  always reach a quick decision. The difficulty with  amendment No. 71 concerns employees subject to  misconduct allegations who delay matters, so that even  with the best will in the world, the Secretary of State  cannot comply with the six-month time limit. Such  employees will benefit because there is no prohibition or  check on his further employment. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the Minister's point but,  logically extended, it would mean that if an employee  refuses to co-operate, the process could be left  open-ended, which would not be a satisfactory solution. I  have not thought through the circumstances outlined by  the Minister, but I imagine that the Secretary of State  would have to take a view on the case and if he thought  that inclusion in the list was appropriate, he would take  the necessary steps. Then it would be open to the  employee who caused the obstruction to appeal to the  tribunal, as the process allows. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Under the Bill as drafted, there is no  incentive for the employee to delay proceedings. The  amendment would give the employee an incentive to  delay proceedings because, at the end of the six-month  period if he can string it out that long he would  automatically be taken off the list. In that situation, there  will be no substantial determination of the issue, and the  person would be free to abuse other children. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister makes a good point.  I am not approaching the matter in a partisan way. In a  moment, I shall discuss when the appeal mechanism kicks  in, which is germane to this issue. However, we are  worried that someone could be included in the list and be  disabled from obtaining employment in his or her chosen  and specialised field, possibly for a long time. The  Minister cited an example where the employee was at  fault in delaying the conclusion of proceedings, but it is  not impossible to imagine alternative circumstances in  which the employee is not at fault. For example, the  employer or a third-party accuser might delay proceedings  by not responding to the Secretary of State in the  appropriate way. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> My understanding of what the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish is trying to achieve is  that if an employee deliberately obstructs the procedure,  the Secretary of State should not be forced to remove him  from the list altogether; he could confirm his inclusion in  the list, which is probably what would happen if an  employee was being difficult. If the amendment is not  accepted, there will be no incentive for the Secretary of  State to get a move on and put someone on the  permanent list. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge earlier referred to  two similar processes at the Benefits Agency and the  Home Office, both of which give Members of Parliament  big case loads because of delays in the system.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady is  saying, but subsection (5)(a) deals adequately with the  issue. It says that the Secretary of State must make his  decision when he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has considered the information submitted with the reference, any  observations submitted to him and any other information which he  considers relevant". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If the parties do not submit information to the Secretary  of State, he will not necessarily be able to consider it, but  the subsection sets out clearly that, once the Secretary  of State has taken due consideration of the information  submitted to him, he can reach his decision and can then  include somebody on the list. 
<P>
The Minister may say that, in reality, six months is not  the appropriate period, and we might have to reconsider  whether six months is right, but there must be a time limit  in relation to the provision. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that  many of the instances of abuse that have come to light  are characterised by the abuser's ability to manipulate. An  abusive, manipulative person could easily exploit a time  element. I accept that slowness in various Government  Departments has been a problem, but we should not put  children at risk of harm, or cause them actual harm,  because we cannot administer matters departmentally. The  onus is on us to operate in a reasonable manner. A time  limit would seriously jeopardise children. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady that we all  want to ensure that children are not put at risk, but I do not  agree that even the most manipulative individual would be  able to exploit the loophole that she sees here. Once the  Secretary of State has considered the information and any  observations submitted to him, he is entitled to make his  decision. If the Secretary of State thought that an  individual was delaying the process by failing to submit  relevant information in a way that favoured him, I imagine  that the Secretary of State would reach his decision on the  basis of the information available to him. If that did not  include information that the individual might normally  have been expected to submit, but did not submit, the  Secretary of State would draw his own conclusions. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The hon. Gentleman argues in favour of  keeping the Bill as it is, because the onus is on the  Secretary of State to make decisions as fast as he can.  There is no reason for him to be slow in making decisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what he hon. Lady says, but I  do not agree with that point. 
<P>
I want to go on to amendment No. 24, because I think  that  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is complaining that  there is no requirement in the Bill about the time frame  in which a decision about permanent inclusion should be  taken. However, the hon. Gentleman will be aware of one  point and I shall provide him with more information on  the second one.    
<P>
There is a general obligation under administrative law  for those charged with decision-making responsibilities to  take decisions within a reasonable period of time. That is  already clearly established. It may also help the  Committee if I inform the hon. Gentleman that it currently  takes the Department between 12 and 16 weeks to decide  whether somebody should be permanently included on the  list. With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is not  an unreasonably long period of time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the Minister. A period of  12 to 16 weeks is reasonable and falls within the  six-month time limit that we seek to include in the Bill. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bennett:</B> We should invite the Minister to put 16  weeks in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has heard that  intervention and will draw his own conclusion. 
<P>
I was seeking to move on to amendment No. 24  because the underlying concern is that somebody may be  provisionally included in the list without any right to  appeal. Amendment No. 24 would provide an alternative  approach to that problem by allowing a right of appeal for  those provisionally included in the list. 
<P>
My initial reaction on reading the Bill before Second  Reading was that those provisionally included in the list  should have a right of appeal, but having thought about  the matter more carefully, I have reached the conclusion  that I do not favour having such a right of appeal, and I  shall rehearse the reasons why in a moment. I am sure  whether the Minister will tell us why it would not be  appropriate for such people to have a right of appeal. 
<P>
However, if there is to be no right of appeal I would  argue that there should not be it is essential to reassure  those who are concerned about civil liberties that a time  limit will be put on provisional inclusion in the list. The  mechanism that I have selected in amendment No. 71 an  automatic removal from the provisional list after a certain  period is the route that I would favour. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons why I do not favour having  a right of appeal for those provisionally included in the  list. First, I believe that the procedure will be more  effective and efficient if it is dealt with administratively  in the first instance. There is a strong argument for  allowing the process to run its course to enable the  Secretary of State to reach his decision. If a right of appeal  were granted to those provisionally included on the list,  an individual would almost be obliged to mount an appeal  as soon as he was provisionally included. Not to do so  would be taken as acquiesence in his inclusion in the list,  or almost as an admission of guilt. 
<P>
Appeals to the tribunal will inevitably be supported by  public funds. It would be an abuse of public funds if  people provisionally on the list who thought that they  were wrongly included were forced to embark  immediately on the appeal process. Given what the  Minister said about the time scale normally taken to  determine such matters 12 to 16 weeks it is  appropriate to create a mechanism that allows the normal  administrative process to run its course and for a right  of appeal to cut in when permanent inclusion on the list  takes place. 
<P>
The other side of that coin is that those concerned about  the possible infringement of civil liberties will think it an  essential requirement that, if there is to be a mechanism  for inclusion albeit provisional with no right of appeal,  it must be time limited. I urge the Committee to accept  amendment No. 71, which I intend to press to a Division,  and to reject amendment No. 24.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I have listened with care to the arguments  presented on this group of amendments so far.  I understand the point made by my hon. Friend the  Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on amendment  No. 24, and the difficulties associated with offering a right  of appeal against provisional inclusion. His arguments  against allowing appeals to the tribunal on provisional  inclusion are probably overwhelming.    
<P>
It is often best to consider a particular case, but for  obvious reasons, I shall not refer to any individual. As  the Minister has said, the Secretary of State should take  decisions within a reasonable time. That principle is  generally right for most legislation, and we should not  depart from it. Clearly the Secretary of State must act  reasonably, and people could go to court if he did not do  so. If all the information were available and the employer  had arrived at a conclusion but the Secretary of State  simply delayed taking a decision, there would be no  difficulty in going to court to appeal against  non-determination without cause. 
<P>
The solution is to find out why the procedure takes a  long time. If a determination takes a long time, because  either the employee the individual concerned or the  employer is dilatory, the protection will be provisional  inclusion in the list. Unless the Minister or the hon.  Member for Stourbridge tells me otherwise, I assume that  provisional inclusion has the same implications as  inclusion. It will protect children and give future  employers an opportunity to secure the protection of  children. We should therefore keep people on the list  unless there is a good reason why they should not be on  it. The conclusion of proceedings is the point at which it  should be safe for them to be removed from the list. 
<P>
The instance that I have in mind involves the fact that  the police not an employer, the Secretary of State or  an individual caused a delay of two years. the person  involved was, as it happens, the subject of false  allegations that stretched back over a long period. That  individual was quite properly suspended from  employment in a child care position, and probably had no  quarrel with the suspension. However, the suspension was  very long: it went way beyond six months. 
<P>
I am not sure what amendment No. 71 would do in  such a situation. After six months, the Secretary of State  cannot reasonably make a determination, because police  inquiries would be proceeding. The employer cannot  conclude whether someone should be dismissed, because  the police would not have assembled the evidence or sent  it to the Crown Prosecution Service. How can an  employer make a decision in that situation? The tribunal  could not make a determination, so that avenue is not  open. 
<P>
The only way in which to proceed would be for  someone to be included in the list. It would be perverse to  suggest cutting off provisional inclusion after six months  merely to gee everyone up a bit and to make the process  quicker. The Secretary of State would have to consider  including someone permanently in the list. If the  allegation later proved to be false, the Secretary of State  could use the powers in section 1(3) to remove from the  list someone who should not have been on it in the first  place. That is exactly when provisional inclusion should  apply and, I am afraid to say, it should be long-lived.  I do not see how an automatic cut-off would be  appropriate after any length of time. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hutton:</B> I was hoping that my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge would give a preliminary  response to some of the points that have been raised. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Perhaps I could speak first? I want to  make a further point rather than to withdraw the  amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Now that my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge has returned to the Committee Room, I shall  withhold my contribution until after she has spoken  [Interruption.] 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call Mr. Bennett. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> There seem to be two possible ways  forward to use a time limit and to give individuals the  right of appeal. Perhaps I should have thought about this  earlier, but it may be possible to combine those options.  Clause 4 states:    
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An individual who is included (otherwise than provisionally)"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 24 would delete the phrase "(otherwise  than provisionally)"	. We could reject that amendment and  amend the clause so that it states that an 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"individual who is included (otherwise than provisionally) or who  has been on the provisional list for 16 weeks"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
has the right of appeal. In that way, we could combine  the two approaches. We should not be forced down the  route that was suggested by the hon. Member for South  Cambridgeshire, who thought that people might appeal  simply because they were on the provisional list and  wanted to make a fuss. Equally, we should impose a time  limit, which would encourage the Secretary of State to  make progress. 
<P>
The Minister said that the Secretary of State will always  get on quickly. In relation to the social security complaints  that I hear, I am always told that the Department is getting  on as quickly as possible. However, that does not happen  for all sorts of reasons. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With great respect to my hon. Friend, it  does happen. I said that it takes between 12 and 16 weeks  to examine the cases, which is a perfectly reasonable and  respectable length of time. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> All that I am suggesting is a compromise  by which the right of appeal is extended to anyone who  has been on the provisional list for more than 16 weeks.  That would safeguard against someone being left on the  list indefinitely and unable to gain employment, without  a judgment having been made. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an  interesting point, but does he really think that a  provisional inclusion that is not determined within a  certain period should not necessarily become subject to  the right of appeal, but should be referred automatically  to the tribunal for decision? The tribunal has different  powers from the Secretary of State's. It can require  evidence or documents by way of discovery to be made  available to it. If a party is obstructing the Secretary of  State reaching a decision, the tribunal must become  involved in order to use its powers of discovery. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett: I am suggesting compromises which  would guarantee the civil rights of the individual by  preventing the matter dragging on indefinitely. One  compromise would be a time limit, and another would be  the immediate right of appeal to the tribunal. From what  has been said in the Committee, it seems that there are  snags with both approaches. If we combine them, we may  be able to give the individual the right of appeal if it  seems to him that the Secretary of State is taking too long  to make a determination.    </B><P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> As for the time that the Secretary of  State may take to make his determination, the Minister  referred us to the current period of 12 to 16 weeks. Does  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish agree that, if  the Bill is to be successful, many more people will be  referred than are referred now, and the likelihood of the  Department sticking to the same time limit will not be as  great as we are led to believe? We still have not had any  indication of the numbers, and that makes the position  difficult. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> One can argue that two ways. If the  Department has to deal with more people, it may become  quicker and procedures might improve. It is more safe to  work on the basis of never trusting bureaucracy. A time  limit would be far better. Let us compare the time that it  takes for cases to get to court in England with the time  that it takes in Scotland. The time limit in Scotland  concentrates people's minds. If we put into the Bill  something that would concentrate Secretaries of State's  minds, it would help. I hope that my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge appreciates and understands the  difficulties regarding civil liberties, and that she and the  Minister will examine how a time limit and an appeal can  be combined. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I dealt with the time limit when  responding to the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge. I have problems with such a proposal, bearing  in mind the abuse of children and how these people  manipulate situations. A time limit would constitute too  large a loophole through which they could pass. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> One of our worries is that the hon.  Lady keeps referring to "these people"	 and how they  manipulate situations. We know that there are people who  manipulate situations and we want to catch them, but we  are worried that some people who are caught will not be  "these people"	, but innocent people. It is to them that we  are directing our attention. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his  intervention. I obviously accept what he says. However,  the Bill takes a major step forward by providing the  substantial checks and balances of the consultancy index.    
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would remove subsection (3)(b),  which enables the Secretary of State provisionally to  include individuals in the list while he investigates the  matter with the referring body. I cannot accept the  removal of that provision. 
<P>
Clause 2(3) provides that if it appears from information  provided by an organisation that it might be appropriate  to include an individual on the list, the Secretary of State  must determine the reference in accordance with the strict  procedures laid down in subsections (4) to (6); and such  an individual is provisionally included on the list. 
<P>
If, after considering all the relevant information, the  Secretary of State is of the opinion that the referring  organisation reasonably considered the individual to be  guilty of misconduct that harmed a child or placed a child  at the risk of harm, whether or not it was in the course of  employment, or if the individual was unsuitable to work  with children, he must confirm the individual's inclusion  on the list. 
<P>
The individual has a right of appeal to the tribunal. The  tribunal has a fact-finding role and it may carry out an  investigation of the facts and the merits of any  application. If the tribunal is not satisfied that the  individual is guilty of the alleged misconduct or that he is  unsuitable to work with children, it must allow the appeal  and direct the removal of the individual's name from the  list; otherwise, the tribunal must confirm the Secretary of  State's decision. 
<P>
I have outlined the procedures several times before. On  balance, I believe that the amendment would seriously  affect the Bill's provisions, and I reject it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I have one or two observations to make.  I am pleased that the hon. Members for Runnymede and  Weybridge and for South Cambridgeshire accept that  extending the right of appeal to cover provisional  inclusion on the list would be problematic. The problem  would arise because we would have to consider precisely  what the appellate tribunal would be considering if it were  simply questioning the Secretary of State's decision  provisionally to include someone on the list. 
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire made a  good speech. He said that, because the question was  simply whether someone should be provisionally included  on the list, it would be difficult for the appeal tribunal to  conduct a thorough review of all the circumstances of a  case. With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish, that would not be possible, almost  by definition. What would be the purpose of an appeal  when the Secretary of State, also by definition, did not  have all the facts before him? Deciding whether someone  should be included on the list would remain a problem if  an appeal is being conducted at the same time. I shall say  a little more about that later. 
<P>
I am much more concerned with amendment No. 71,  tabled by he hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge. It would impose a time limit for provisional  inclusion on the list. However, the hon. Gentleman  exposed the problems of having a time limit. It is  suggested that the time limit should be six months. It is  possible that the time limit could provide an employee  with a practical incentive to delay the process to the point  where the Secretary of State would have no choice but to  remove that person from the list. That would create a  serious gap: it would continue to expose children to the  risk of abuse, and I am sure that no one wants that to  happen. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman implied that it might, in such a  case, be necessary to have a slightly longer time limit.  However, that exposes the weakness and difficulties of  the amendment. A short time limit is superficially  attractive, but it would provide people with an incentive  to obstruct the process, benefit from such a delay and  come off the list. The alternative would extend the limit  to the point where it became meaningless. We hope that  the Secretary of State would come to a decision much  sooner than suggested by those time limits.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister said that the effect of  the amendment would be that the Secretary of State might  have to remove someone from the list. Equally, in order  to protect children, he might have to include someone,  other than provisionally, in the list. That would allow  access to the appeal mechanism and the tribunal's powers  of discovery. 
<P>
 
<P>

<P>
I shall use this opportunity to raise the matter of  compensation and privilege with the Minister. If someone  has been included in the list provisionally, and he feels  that his inclusion has lasted a long time, will there be an  arrangement for compensation if he is subsequently found  to have been inappropriately included, and thereby  excluded from practising his profession perhaps for as  long as two years? 
<P>
Will referrals by organisations, and the Secretary of  State's decisions to include people in the list, be  privileged? I may be using the terminology loosely, but I  wonder whether there will be immunity from civil action  for defamation. Will the Minister explain what happens if  someone has been wrongly included in the list? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised several  points that go significantly beyond the terms of the  amendment, but I shall try to be helpful and respond as  best I can. I do not think that he is right about the  Secretary of State's ability to overcome problems with the  time limit by determining to include someone on the list  permanently. That decision must be taken in the context  of the procedures laid out in subsections (4), (5) and (6).  That cannot be pre-empted to avoid the time limit, as the  Secretary of State must act in accordance with the the  provisions in the Bill. There is a serious problem with the  time limit. If it is too short, people could see it as an  incentive to milk the system, and an opportunity to avoid  inclusion in the list permanently. Children would be at  risk of abuse, which is precisely what the Bill is trying  to avoid. 
<P>
If we went the other way and included a time limit of,  say, 18 months or two years, that would be too long  and meaningless. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish that we have no interest in delaying  decisions on provisional inclusion. There would be no  reason to do so. We have a good track record on making  speedy decisions, and we do not think that the way in  which we conduct our decision-making processes will  change because of what we are legislating for in the Bill.  I think that that concern was expressed by the hon.  Member for Taunton. 
<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge is saying about the difficulties with time  limits, but his remedy to the perceived deficiency in the  Bill would compound the problem. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bennett:</B> What about my suggestion that he right  of appeal should apply to people included provisionally  after, say, 16 weeks? Is that not a compromise that would  offer a safeguard? A person could not remain on the list  simply because the Department did not perform as well  as the Minister claims that it will. I have sat in these  Rooms too often listening to Ministers' promises that  have never been delivered. It would be much better to  include the provision in the Bill.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With all due respect to my hon. Friend,  there is a problem with his proposal. I am not disputing  that it would be a compromise to allow someone to appeal  because the Secretary of State had taken too long to reach  a decision. But, I am not sure that my hon. Friend's  suggestion would take us much further forward in  providing the protection that he is anxious should be in  the Bill. We would still have to determine the issues that  the tribunal had to consider. If there are difficulties such  as I have suggested, there could be delays and  obstructions within the system that were outside the  Secretary of State's control. I am not sure that the appeal  function described by my hon. Friend would be beneficial. 
<P>
There are clearly some issues that concern the  Committee. I understand that, and my hon. Friend The  Member for Stourbridge and I will reflect on them,  especially the appeal procedure and the role of the  tribunal. I am not holding out the prospect that we will  amend the Bill, but we shall consider the points that have  been raised, particularly on the appeal function. 
<P>
The proposals of the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge on time limits would not help afford  protection to children. We have been open and candid  with the Committee about the fact that we intend to  exercise out functions as quickly as possible. My hon.  Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish used the word  "arbitrary"	 earlier; imposing an arbitrary time limit would  make the situation worse, not better. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge  asked me two questions about compensation. There are  no provisions in the Bill to permit compensation to be  paid. The hon. Gentleman also asked me about privilege;  as long as referrals are made in good faith and are not  malicious, they will be covered by qualified privilege,  particularly actions for defamation. I hope that that  reassures the hon. Gentleman. For those reasons, and for  the reasons which my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge put convincingly to the Committee, we do not  believe the amendments would improve the Bill and hope  that the Committee will reject them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for explaining  that referrals made under the Bill would benefit from  qualified privilege. However, the possibility of a  Kafkaesque nightmare still exists, whereby someone is  provisionally included on the list and deprived of the right  to earn his livelihood perhaps for a period of two  years for reasons beyond the Secretary of State's  control. My hon. Friend the Member for South  Cambridgeshire gave the example of delays in producing  police evidence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton: The hon. Gentleman said that someone  could be deprived of his livelihood. That is not the case.  We are talking about restricting someone's opportunities  to work in a child care position we are not preventing  him or her from getting other employment during the  period of inclusion on the list. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is technically correct,  but as the hon. Member for Taunton said earlier, if the  person has had a 20-year career in child care and them  has to apply for jobs in other fields, he will be asked to  explain why he is changing career and will have to admit  that the has been provisionally included on the Secretary  of State's list. His chances of gaining employment will  not be high. 
<P>
The fundamental point at issue is that, while I agree  with the Minister that it would be unsatisfactory if an  automatic time limit resulted in the removal from the list  of people who should be on it, I disagree that subsections  4 and 5 provide that the Secretary of State would not  have the power to include such a person in the list. Under  subsection 5, if 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Secretary of State has considered the information submitted  with the reference, any observations submitted to him and any other  information which he considers relevant"	, 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
he will be in a position to make a determination. I hope  that the Minister will consider my argument that it is  unlikely that the Secretary of State would, after six  months, be precluded from taking a decision to include  someone on the list on the basis of the information that  he has available. In extremis, the information may be only  that supplied by the employer with the original reference,  if the employee has blocked all requests for his side of  the story. In those circumstances, it would not be  inappropriate for the Secretary of State to determine that  that person should be included on the list at that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that  someone should be permanently included on the list on  the basis of incomplete evidence if, for example, an  employer of someone in a child care position had not yet  come to a decision or if there were some delay in the  disciplinary procedure as to whether a person is guilty of  alleged misconduct? I understood him to be saying that  he would be happy for the Secretary of State to decide  permanently to include someone n the list, even if an  employer had not come to such a view about the  person's guilt.       
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond: The Minister raised the hypothetical  case of an employer who takes six months to decide  whether to dismiss someone. That would be no more  reasonable than the Secretary of State taking more than  six months to reach that decision. I want to avoid the  nightmare scenario that prevents a person from working  in his chosen profession, in which he has experience and  qualifications, because he has been put on a list by  administrative action, with no right of appeal and no way  to control or move the process forward. That is  unacceptable. </B><P>
{**fc
<p4**}There must be a time limit. If, at the end of the time  limit, the Secretary of State includes someone on the list,  that at least gives the individual an opportunity to appeal  to the tribunal, which has the power to direct his removal  from the list. The Bill grants the Secretary of State the  power to remove someone from the list if further evidence  comes to light and he realises that the person should not  be on the list. We cannot preclude someone from working,  possibly for a long time, without providing an appeal  mechanism. The individual must be able to use the civil  process to challenge the decision to include him on the  list. But there is no opportunity to redress the situation  and receive compensation for what is a significant  deprivation of rights and liberty.  <P>
I accept the Minister's comments at face value.  Although he did not hold out a promise, he said that he  would consider carefully what has been discussed today  and take into account the genuine concerns of Committee  members. I hope that he will accept our points. We do not  want to undermine the Bill but to get the balance right  between the protection of children and the protection of  innocent people who are wrongly accused. It will take  only one or two cataclysmic examples of wrongful and  lengthy inclusions on the provisional list for the Bill to  fall into disrepute. 
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 71 to a vote, but I  hope that the Minister or the hon. Member for Stourbridge  will respond to our concern on Report. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want the Committee to be in any  doubt about what I said. We are clear that the time limit  that has been proposed by the hon. Member for  Runnymede and Weybridge would be fundamentally  counterproductive. There is no prospect of the  Government amending the Bill to include a time limit.  I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge has strong views on that. 
<P>
I want to pick up the hon. Gentleman on one point. He  is labouring under a misconception. He said that the  problem of a time limit could be overcome if the Secretary  of State exercised the decision-making powers that are  contained in another part of the Bill. He referred to clause  2(5). But clause 2(6) makes it clear that the Secretary of  State can include someone on the list only if he is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of the opinion...that the organisation reasonably considered the  individual to be guilty of misconduct or incompetence".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is not possible to juxtapose that obligation on the  Secretary of State with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion  that the Secretary of State should be able to reach a  decision on permanent inclusion when an employer has  failed to make a decision about misconduct. It is not  possible for that to work. It would subvert the course of  the Bill and corrupt the decision-making process and the  system that the Secretary of State has to follow. 
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognised that there  is a problem with time limits. He implied that the  Secretary of State could avoid the problem by making a  decision permanently to include someone. That cannot  happen. 
<P>
We are very alert to the fact that people are concerned  about the appeal function I know that my hon. Friend  the Member for Stourbridge feels the same and we shall  reflect on what hon. Members have said today. I am not  holding out the prospect I am sure that my hon. Friend  would not want to do so of an amendment on the  appellant functions, but we shall certainly consider the  matter further.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I acknowledge what the Minister said  and the best way forward is for those of us who are  concerned to see what amendment the hon. Member for  Stourbridge introduces on Report. If we are not happy  then, we shall be able to table amendments to impose a  time limit if we believe that to be necessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I very much agree with that approach,  although we are stacking up three issues to which we may  return on Report. If amendments are tabled by my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge, they can be accepted  without much debate, but if they are tabled by other hon.  Members, there will be a tendency for them to be debated  for rather longer. My plea is that, although the promise  was to reconsider the matter, we should also consider  easing the passage of the Bill on to the statute book. 
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in  page 2, line 35, leave out `of the opinion' and insert  `satisfied'.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by reason of his misconduct'.

</UL></FONT>    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendment would introduce a  slightly stronger test. Requiring the Secretary of State to  be "satisfied"	 is slightly stronger than requiring him to be  "of the opinion"	. I hope that the amendment is  uncontroversial in making it clear that the Secretary of  State, as the Minister argued on the previous group of  amendments, must be "satisfied"	 before he comes to his  conclusion. 
<P>
I am a little concerned about amendment No. 12  because paragraph (b) would not work. I understand the  concept behind it, but it would not work in practice. It is  not by reason of the misconduct that it is necessary to  protect children from serious harm; it is by reason of the  misconduct that that person needs to be placed on the list.  I am not sure whether the amendment will be pressed, but  I want to flag the fact that it would not capture the essence  of banning the individual from working with children,  which is the underlying principle. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> My reason for not moving amendment  No. 11 was that I intended to support amendment No. 72.  My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge made a large  concession at our first sitting and it seemed reasonable to  accept that and not to move amendment No.11. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman  for his helpful clarification. 
<P>
Amendment No. 73 would stiffen the test slightly.  Instead of requiring the Secretary of State to be satisfied  that the organisation reasonably considered the individual  to be guilty, I want to tighten that test so that the Secretary  of State must be satisfied that the individual was guilty.  There is a possibility here, albeit remote, that the  Secretary of State will be satisfied that, at the time of  making the reference, the organisation reasonably  considered the individual to be guilty, but additional  evidence has subsequently come to his attention. We do  not intend to change the nature of the subsection, we  merely want to tighten it so that the Secretary of State's  satisfaction is the test, rather than his opinion about what  the organisation reasonably or unreasonably did or did  not do.    
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 74 is necessary because the  Secretary of State, in arriving at his decision, would surely  look at unsuitability as a result of the misconduct that has  given rise to the dismissal and the reference. I do not think  that those who drafted the Bill intended the Secretary of  State to consider unsuitability in a broader sense. The  group of amendments is intended to tighten and clarify  the subsection without, I hope, making any fundamental  changes to the intention behind it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I rise to oppose amendment No. 72. The  hon. Gentleman said that it was a relatively small  amendment, but it has consequences. Under the Bill the  Secretary of State will initially examine the quality of the  information submitted with a referral and will then decide  to proceed, or not to proceed if the case is clearly not  suitable for inclusion, or to seek further information from  the employer before considering whether a provisional  inclusion on the list would be appropriate. Thereafter,  observations must be sought from both parties. The  Secretary of State must include the name on the list only  if he is of the opinion that the employer has 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasonably considered the individual to be guilty of  misconduct...which harmed a child or placed a child at risk of  harm"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
as we defined last week  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and that the individual is unsuitable to work with children."	 
<P>
The amendment would impose a higher standard for  inclusion on the list and would require the Secretary of  State to be satisfied that the employer had reasonably  considered the individual to be guilty of misconduct. The  Secretary of State can satisfy himself of that only by  undertaking a full fact-finding investigation, which would  impose on him an inappropriate role that is not envisaged  by the Bill.

<P>

<B> Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Lady addressed amendment  No. 72 but not amendments Nos. 73 and 74. I accept that  amendment No. 72 imposes a higher standard, but it is  slightly troubling if the Bill says that we shall deprive a  person of his right to practise his career merely because  the Secretary of State is of the opinion that somebody else  reasonably considered something to have happened. It is  not asking too much that the Secretary of State should  satisfy himself that the person was guilty of the  misconduct. 
<P>
I am not a lawyer, but I should not have thought that  that would place too onerous a burden on the Secretary of  State. As we discussed at length this morning, an adequate  appeal mechanism is available to an individual following  the Secretary of State's decision. I am disappointed that  the hon. Lady has not been able to accept the  amendments, which address what will otherwise be  another principled objection to the drafting of the Bill on  Report from those concerned about civil liberties.
