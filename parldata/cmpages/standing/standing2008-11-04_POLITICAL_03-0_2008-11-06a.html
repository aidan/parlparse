<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000285"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I welcome our distinguished guests this
afternoon, I want to say a few words to the Committee. Before we begin
to take evidence, I would like to respond, briefly but fully, to a
point raised in Committee by Mr. Reid on Tuesday and again,
informally, this morning by Mr. Duddridge. Mr.
Reid drew attention to the short time between the end of the evidence
sessions and the deadline for the tabling of amendments for
Tuesday&#146;s sittings, and asked whether starred amendments might
be
selected.</div><a name="0811079000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
co-Chairmen and I appreciate that there is limited time before the rise
of the House this evening, but the decision to structure the
Committee&#146;s time in this way was taken by the Programming
Sub-Committee and I remind the Committee that it was done so after
considerable discussion. The programme motion was approved by this
Committee on Tuesday morning, when one of my co-Chairmen was in the
Chair. It was in the gift of the Committee to provide itself with a
bigger gap after the evidence sessions. The deadlines for the tabling
of amendments are there for the benefit of all Committee members, who
need sufficient time to consider the amendments before they are
debated.</div><a name="0811079000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also note that the issues discussed in the evidence sessions so far are
not entirely new. The views of the Electoral Commission, for example,
and two of our three distinguished academics have already been
submitted in written evidence to the Committee. In such circumstances,
and in line with existing practice in Public Bill Committees, I can
confirm that my fellow Chairmen and I do not intend to select starred
amendments. That is my statement; if Mr. Duddridge wishes to
rise on a point of order, I am happy for him to do so, but he should
remain seated, so that his voice can be picked up by the
microphone.</div><a name="0811079000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811079000286"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): On a point
of order, Sir Nicholas. I wish to remain seated. Notwithstanding what
you said, I ask you to look at the matter a second time. The Opposition
Front-Bench team found that there were significant new pieces of
information this morning&#151;tangible differences&#151;that were
not mentioned in the written submissions and of we were not aware
before. As the Whip, I shall not go into policy issues, but there are
significant changes&#151;that is the Opposition&#146;s position.
Furthermore, during the Programming Sub-Committee, if I may refer to
that, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>were given reassurances. While there was no commitment to take starred
amendments, an indication was given that the Committee would be able to
review the issue&#151;and on that basis we were happy to proceed. I
do not know whether there is another way forward, whereby we could
table starred amendments, then circulate them to the various parties on
Friday. They would still be starred amendments on a day on which the
House is not sitting, but we would be happy to circulate them
then.</div><a name="0811079000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are significant amendments that we want to table as a consequence of
evidence. This meeting does not break up until 3 o&#146;clock and we
do not know when the business of the House will be completed&#151;it
could even be completed very shortly after us, so that there would not
be time for us, physically, to go and table the
amendments.</div><a name="0811079000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000287"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I note what Mr. Duddridge says. I
remind him and other Committee members that they have until 6.30 pm to
table amendments. I have not received notice&#151;the Government, who
would be more in the know, have made no such indication&#151;that
today&#146;s business will finish early but, at the moment, I do not
anticipate that it will do so. I am certainly prepared to listen to any
representations made by the Opposition parties. I would be happy to
receive any evidence, perhaps in writing, as to where they believe the
evidence given this morning, perhaps by the Electoral Commission,
differed dramatically from the evidence that it submitted in writing.
My fellow Chairmen and I should certainly give the matter
consideration. However, I cannot promise that we shall change our
ruling and select starred amendments.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000288"></a>The</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Chairman:</b> Briefly, Mr.
Djanogly.</div><a name="0811079000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811079000289"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Further to that
point of order, Sir Nicholas. My understanding was that the point of
hearing the evidence in these sessions was to see whether we needed to
table amendments to the Bill as a result. According to your ruling, we
shall have a very short time this evening to go through
<i class="I">Hansard</i>&#151;if that has been produced by the time our
proceedings end. It would be of help if the Clerks could advise us
whether that would be the case, because we shall have to take
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, study it&#151;some complicated concepts and issues
were discussed this morning&#151;and review whether further
amendments need to be filed, all within a matter of hours. As my
colleague said, that would only be if the business of the House lasts
until 6.30 pm
today.</div><a name="0811079000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000290"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Two things. First, the Opposition could advise
the Chair as to what important amendments they believe need to be
tabled, based on the evidence given so far. Of course, next
week&#151;I am in the Chair on Tuesday morning&#151;the Committee
can make what progress it chooses. It could well be the case that the
areas covered by the amendments that the Opposition might wish to table
will not be taken on Tuesday morning. Therefore, to an extent, the
Opposition and the Committee as a whole are in control of their own
business in that
connection.</div><a name="0811079000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811079000291"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): Further to that point of
order, Sir Nicholas. I am very concerned about this, first, because it
was discussed informally before we met the first time. I received
clarification that, under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>new public Bill procedure, there would be scope for flexibility, to
enable the tabling of amendments in the light of evidence that was
submitted. I specifically discussed that, and was given the same
information that we have just received about what happened through the
usual channels, before the start of our formal
meetings.</div><a name="0811079000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if I may say so, it is a little unreasonable to ask us to provide
written evidence of where we think that we might need to table
amendments, bearing in mind that all the relevant people are sitting
here in front of you for the whole period, Sir Nicholas. We cannot even
be sure that the House will run until 6.30 pm; debate may close
earlier. Thirdly, to provide one example, you were in the Chair, Sir
Nicholas, when the Electoral Commission said that it would like to add
to the evidence. It produced a specific example relating to its
concerns about the appointment to the commission board, and the change
of the 10-year rule to five years. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
I am pleased that the Minister wishes to speak, but I do not wish to
prejudge whom the Chair might
call.</div>
<a name="0811079000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000292"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am going to call the Minister, then I will
stop taking points of order. We have distinguished witnesses here and
we must finish taking evidence from them by 2 o&#146;clock. If
necessary, we can continue the points of order then, but I prefer to
call the Minister first.</div>
<a name="0811079000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000293"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. In the spirit of
helpfulness with which Government Members have approached the matter,
we want amendments to be tabled as long as they are genuinely based on
new information. We want to be helpful and will be as accommodating as
possible on an informal basis, but only if there is genuinely new
information. I am always prepared to be enlightened, but so far the
discussion has been a recycling of familiar points on all sides. We
have a useful memorandum, and there are genuinely new points that need
to be considered. However, we will be as flexible as
possible.</div>
<a name="0811079000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000294"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I intend to make progress. Perhaps we need to
sit after 3 o&#146;clock, informally, to see whether we can resolve
the matter. I do not wish to embarrass our witnesses who, in some
cases, have come at great inconvenience to themselves. We should do
them the courtesy of listening to them at this stage, and we will find
another way to resolve the problem. The Minister has indicated that he
is prepared to be flexible, and the Chair wants to ensure that all
important matters are debated. I suggest that we make progress. If the
Whips on both sides of the Committee wish to come to the Chair during
the discussion over the next two hours, I would be happy to receive
representations.</div>
<a name="0811079000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811079000295"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): That procedure excludes me, and
I am the person who has the example.
</div><a name="0811079000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811079000296"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): He is a Liberal; he
cannot help it.</div>
<a name="0811079000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000297"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Howarth is being very
agreeable.</div>
<a name="0811079000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000298"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The specific example that the Minister should
consider came up this morning. The Electoral Commission said that there
is a problem about what will happen in clauses 4 to 7&#151;the
clauses we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>consider first on Tuesday&#151;should a political party fail or refuse
to appoint a commissioner. That is a brand new point and is not in any
of the written submissions. It is a technically difficult point to deal
with, but I do not think that we will be able to discuss it on Tuesday,
given the rules.</div>
<a name="0811079000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000299"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> That is exactly the point I raised. In a similar
area, the chief executive of the Electoral Commission said that for the
first time, he found difficulty with the switch from ten to 5 years for
the bar on party political affiliation before appointment to the
board.</div>
<a name="0811079000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000300"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have heard what has been said. I have
indicated that I wish to make progress and I intend to do so. I am sure
that Mr. Duddridge and Mr. Lucas can make
representations to the Chair as we perform our business this
afternoon.</div>
<a name="0811079000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">On behalf of

Mr.
Djanogly.</div>
<a name="0811079000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">157
1</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000302"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I hope that the
evidence session does not produce too much information that might
require amendments to the Bill. Gentlemen, I fear that you could have
done better in an earlier session. I would like to address the broader
issue. To date, we have been considering the nuts and bolts of the
Bill. I would like us to step back for a moment and consider the
Electoral Commission as a whole, which we have not yet
done.</div><a name="0811079000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has to be said that many hon. Members, certainly in the Conservative
party and perhaps in other parties, have been reviewing the performance
of the Electoral Commission in recent years and have thought it in many
ways deficient. That has led quite a number of people to say that the
commission should be abolished as an institution. That is not the
official position of our party or any other party, as we have a Bill
here to improve its performance, but that would be a valid starting
point for you to give your views on whether it is a valid institution
and whether the general thrust of the Bill is correct in terms of its
reform, if you think that that needs to be
done.</div><a name="0811079000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> From my point of view, the Electoral
Commission is essential. I cannot contemplate us having a system of
regulation of elections, donations or party funding without an
independent agency of this kind. I am reinforced in that belief by the
fact that most other mature Westminster-style democracies have agencies
of this kind. It would be inconceivable now not to have such an
organisation.</div><a name="0811079000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am aware of complaints and concerns in the House and elsewhere about
the performance of the commission, I think since it was established in
2001. I am not sure who is ultimately responsible for the failure, as
some see it, of the commission to perform as well as it might, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>I suppose I feel slightly that much of the criticism has been unfair, in
the sense that this body has been presented with a very detailed
framework of legislation and much of it, or the drafting of it, has
been quite difficult. Much of it is very technical. Much of it is
incomprehensible. I think it has been as steep a learning curve for the
commission as it has been for everyone
else.</div><a name="0811079000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
sense is that since the loans for peerages affair, there has been a
significant improvement in the performance of the commission. Certainly
over the last 12 months, the regulatory role of the commission has
greatly increased and the profile of the commission has increased, and
I think overall the performance of the commission has improved. From my
point of view, there should be a healthy tension between Members of the
House and the commission. They should not be in each other&#146;s
pockets. It should be a conflictual, not a consensual, relationship. I
would see that as quite
healthy.</div><a name="0811079000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me into a measure of scepticism about the desirability of some of
the reforms proposed in the Bill. I am not convinced of the case for
political commissioners. I do not know of any other Westminster-style
democracy where such an idea has taken root. In most countries,
electoral
commissions&#151;</div><a name="0811079000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Michael
Pinto-Duschinsky:</b></i> Save for the United
States?</div><a name="0811079000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> That is not a Westminster-style
democracy. Let me finish the point. I am not confident that this is a
good idea and I have a certain hesitancy about the proposals to deal
with civil penalties, but perhaps we could explore those in more detail
when others have had a chance to
speak.</div><a name="0811079000042"></a>

2</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000303"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does Mr. Pinto-Duschinsky want to
come in here? He appears to have made some
remark.</div><a name="0811079000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Michael
Pinto-Duschinsky:</b></i> Yes, I made a factual point, as I
sometimes do, because it is good to get these things
correct.</div><a name="0811079000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question itself, there have been some grounds for concern about the
Electoral Commission. Some of them have been addressed; I agree with
Professor Ewing on that. There are grounds for concern, first, about
the appointment procedures for the original chief executive and the
original chairman&#151;it is very important that those appointment
procedures are seen to be wholly non-political. I think this is a
matter of history
now.</div><a name="0811079000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission spent too much time on electoral policy and participation,
in encouraging modernisation and participation, and ignored its
regulatory role. That is being addressed now to some extent, but it is
notable that the assurances on examining the inaccuracies in the
electoral register that the Electoral Commission gave in writing to the
Committee on Standards in Public Life have not been followed through.
This has been in the service of not wishing to highlight the huge
extent of inaccuracies in our electoral register and the need to change
to a system of individual registration. Paradoxically, the commission
favours a system of individual registration, but it has not brought
forward the evidence that it promised to the Committee on Standards in
Public Life&#151;a major survey of inaccurate names on the
register.</div><a name="0811079000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission also has failed to deal effectively with the problem of
electoral fraud. The amount of electoral fraud has been systematically
understated. Indeed, Electoral Commission documents called for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>local reporting to be careful in case reports on electoral fraud
lessened confidence&#151;it was inviting people not to report
electoral
fraud.</div><a name="0811079000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is significant that the key questions of registration and electoral
fraud have been left out of the Bill. Those are the key gaps in the
electoral system today and in the architecture of the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The other thing that I
should point out is that there are loopholes in the 2000 Act relating
to funding by third parties and the funding of
referendums.</div><a name="0811079000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are four vital areas that have been left out of the Bill. Some of those
relate to the Electoral Commission, and some to the wider problems.
However, I do not think that at the moment we can really think in terms
of abolishing the Electoral Commission. We should want to help it to
concentrate on its core role. To that extent, there is a lot in the
Bill with which I would agree.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Chairman:</b> What about Professor Justin Fisher?</div>
<a name="0811079000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> I would broadly concur with Professor
Ewing&#146;s view. It is important to remember that the changes
introduced by the 2000 Act were a series of fundamental changes, both
for the parties and the establishment of the commission. Therefore, as
Professor Ewing suggests, there has been a steep learning curve. It is
also important to divorce the criticisms of the commission made by the
three separate reports in 2006-07 from the situation that followed. It
is unhelpful to focus on activity before that
period.</div><a name="0811079000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission has addressed some of the complaints that were levelled
against it. Some of those complaints were reasonable, some were utterly
unreasonable. In my study of how campaigns were conducted, it seemed
that some of the parties had unrealistic expectations of what the
Electoral Commission would and would not do. As a result of those
observations, I welcome the proposals in the Bill to reduce the
qualifying period for Electoral Commission staff, which is a sensible
move.</div><a name="0811079000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am, however, opposed to the move to introduce political commissioners.
That satisfies no one and the formula proposed fails to recognise the
increasingly multi-party character of British politics. If I were a
leader of the Scottish National party or Plaid Cymru, I would be
hopping mad, given that my party would be in government or in coalition
in the devolved institutions yet under the proposals there would be
room for one representative
only.</div><a name="0811079000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the complaints have been addressed. I welcome the move on commission
staff, but I think that the move on political commissioners is a step
too far and needs a rethink.</div>
<a name="0811079000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000305"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does Professor Ewing want to come back? You had
a short innings, so do you want to add to your opening
remarks?</div><a name="0811079000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> Not really, except on the political
commissioners to endorse what Justin has
said.</div><a name="0811079000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, I do not know of any Westminster-type democracies that have the
idea of political parties being represented on the commission. I cannot
think of other regulatory bodies, although there might be some, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>include members of the regulated community to regulate the people who
are to be regulated. It seems to be a very strange
idea.</div><a name="0811079000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further point is that I understand the reason why the proposal has been
introduced: it comes out of the lack of confidence in the commission
and a time of problems in the past, to which Justin referred. However,
I think those problems have been overcome. An idea that was designed
initially to help the commission could in the long term serve only to
weaken it. We ought to be seeing what we can do to strengthen the
commission&#146;s independence and overall
authority.</div><a name="0811079000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000306"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Professor Fisher started to answer this question
in his earlier remarks, so perhaps I can give the other two a go first
and come back to him. Looking specifically at the party fundraising and
expenditure parts of the Bill, what do you think are the leading
problems in that area and to what extent do you think the Bill solves
those
problems?</div><a name="0811079000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> I shall focus first on expenditure.
The Bill seeks to address what I consider a genuine problem: excessive
spending in some constituencies prior to the official candidate
campaign period. That clearly is a problem and there is academic
evidence to support the argument that it has beneficial effects for a
party that engages in pre-campaign spending. However, I have deep
reservations about the proposal put forward to counter that issue,
which will effectively return us to the situation we had before the
implementation of the 2000 Act. It seems that that is a poor solution
for a number of
reasons.</div><a name="0811079000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
before 2001, when the new Act came into place, the system known as
triggering barely worked. It was almost impossible to enforce and there
was a great deal of uncertainty from all sides about what constituted
appropriate spending. Secondly, it fails to deal with the fact that the
number of candidates standing for election has increased. You will see
in my memorandum that at the last election there were 3,354, which is
an average of five per constituency. The idea that the Electoral
Commission can effectively police those with completely different start
points seems to be a significant challenge&#151;for it and for local
returning officers.</div>
<a name="0811079000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
concern that I have simply relates to the practicalities of
implementing this sort of legislation in terms of the
agents&#151;those who are legally responsible for MPs&#146;
expenses. We have been studying the work of agents at elections at
every election since 1992&#151;we have a lot of data on who the
agents are, how much experience they have and so on. In our most recent
survey, which is of 2005, we found not only that the vast majority were
volunteers, but that a majority had not worked under the previous
legislation. More than 60 per cent. of agents from the main five
parties had no experience of triggering. In the original White Paper
proposals, the implication was that we were simply going back to rules
that had existed before and that everyone would know how they worked.
That is patently not the
case.</div><a name="0811079000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that we might create an unreasonable regulatory burden on
volunteers and, without those volunteers, elections simply will not
run. Part of the Phillips inquiry and many of the inquiries on party
funding were about re-engaging voluntary activity at local level. It
strikes me that although this proposal has the right message at its
heart, it is the wrong way of going about
things.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="0811079000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> In direct response to your question, my
view is that, overall, the structure put in place in 2000 by the 2000
Act is basically sound. It was designed to deal with three questions:
first, the issue of transparency; secondly, foreign donations; and
thirdly, the issue of election expenses. That was all wrapped up with
an independent commission to supervise the process. That package
emerged from a consensus report, around which the three main parties
united. To this day, the foundations that were put in place as a result
of the Neill committee report are sound, but, as is inevitable with any
form of regulation, flaws, loopholes and gaps are exposed as political
party practices on fundraising and spending change.</div>
<a name="0811079000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite all
the excitement that has emerged in the past two or three years, my view
is that the legislation is sound but that loopholes need to be plugged.
There are loopholes in relation to transparency, such as the issue of
unincorporated associations making donations to political parties. They
are largely unregulated and there is a lack of transparency on that.
One issue that needs to be addressed is the extent to which foreign
donations are adequately controlled consistently and in the spirit of
the Neill committee. Another issue is the serious loophole on spending
limits.</div>
<a name="0811079000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not feel
quite as strongly about the third issue as Justin does. Perhaps
triggering could be made to work, and perhaps we need to go back to
that with a more realistic view about how it can be implemented,
bearing in mind our experience from 100 years of the arrangement since
1883. The problem will be with what happens to the money. If the
candidate cannot spend the money that is currently being spent, where
will it go and who will spend it? Currently, if the money is going to
be spent by the constituency party, it will form part of the overall
spending limit of the national party. That would cover one of the
obvious potential loopholes that will emerge from a triggering regime.
What we have to ask is what other loopholes might emerge. We have some
time, before the Bill is passed, in which to anticipate potential
loopholes and to take steps to deal with them. This loophole has to be
addressed, for obvious reasons&#151;for example, it is undermining
the spending limit ambitions of Neill. Those three issues are not all
dealt with in the Bill, but they need to
be.</div>
<a name="0811079000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000307"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The idea of anticipating loopholes in the Bill
raises the big issue of party spending as opposed to candidate
spending. Do you agree that we can see that that is going to be a
problem in the future, and that we should be doing something to address
it either at national level or&#151;this is a big gap in the
Bill&#151;at the local level. We currently have national spending
limits, although only for a year, and candidate spending limits in the
election period, but we have no party local spending limit at
all.</div><a name="0811079000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> In the non-election
years.</div><a name="0811079000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000308"></a>David
Howarth:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="0811079000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> That is quite true. The danger is that
you would require volunteers to keep records, for which they could face
criminal prosecution if they are in breach, throughout the campaign
period. Unfortunately, we have to accept that as long as we have a
difference between party spend at national level and candidate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>spend at constituency level, some things will slip between the cracks.
The Bill&#146;s goal should be to try to deal with that as best it
can, but we should be under no illusions that it will plug the hole
completely.</div><a name="0811079000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Michael
Pinto-Duschinsky:</b></i> First, let me address the
architecture of the system and what is wrong with party funding. What
is wrong is that not enough people want to give money to political
parties or candidates. We have had nothing like the Obama method of
fundraising large numbers of small donations through the internet. That
applies to all parties, and would apply to your party. Compared with
the number of votes that you get, the number of members that you have
is very small. That is the nub of the problem with British party
funding, but that is not amenable to legislation. Indeed, if you have
too much regulation and too much subsidy, you will make the problem
worse.</div>
<a name="0811079000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill looks
at one legitimate area and one legitimate loophole that relate to local
candidate spending, but it does so in a way that leads to many problems
of detail. As an observer of the British constitution, I think that the
debate about whether amendments can be tabled by 3 o&#146;clock or
6.30 shows great disrespect for the British constitution. You cannot
debate important matters that may be of detail, but which would have
crucial effects on the working of our system and the confidence in it
within such a tight
deadline.</div><a name="0811079000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Keith
Ewing and I were both expert advisers for the Labour party in the Fiona
Jones case, and we know the tragic consequences for her and for the
political system of certain ambiguities that will come back in spades
under the Bill. For example, Fiona Jones was charged for transport.
What is transport? We know from the Bill that transport costs are
included as a candidate&#146;s cost, but that does not tell us what
is meant by transport, what is included and what is excluded. In fact,
we shall not know that until after the Electoral Commission gives
guidance and it is put before the House. It would be scandalous if the
Bill came into force until that were known. Indeed, it is not for the
Electoral Commission to give that guidance in the first instance. It
ought to give guidance on unanticipated matters of law, but you can
anticipate that that is a loophole and it is for Parliament to be much
more careful about what is a transport
expense.</div><a name="0811079000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
is local party spending candidate spending, and when is it not? This
morning, the chief executive of the Electoral Commission said words to
the effect that that was a knotty problem. Well, it is, but it is for
you to solve it before you put a half-baked Bill through the House of
Commons to become our sovereign law. Moreover, let us consider the big
loophole whereby Members of Parliament can, through the communications
allowance and elsewhere, put forward advertising that their opponents
cannot. If you want amendments, I can give you a set of possible
amendments, one being that, in the communications allowance&#151;I
say this only half in jest&#151;there should be equal time for all
Opposition candidates. For example, if any of you put forward eight
pages about yourselves, each of the other candidates should be able to
do so without payment, or without it counting against the limit, or you
change the rules of the communications allowance so that, to produce
equality, you cannot do it. To create fairness, we need to look
carefully at the uses of the communications allowance. That was brought
up clearly on Second Reading.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="0811079000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to
another problem. When does national expenditure that is targeted on
marginal constituencies count as local expenditure? We all know that
political parties will have their posters sited more in areas that
benefit marginal constituencies than in others. I asked the Electoral
Commission about that very point, and it said that it did not have the
money to investigate the matter. The real question is what national
activities will count as local activities. There is then the matter of
transitional arrangements and, finally, third-party expenditure. Even
if you say that you bring political parties under a regulatory regime
throughout the parliamentary cycle, you will find, as does exist, that
many pressure groups are in practice offshore islands of one political
party or another, rather like the German political Stiftungen, which
have legal independence, but everyone knows that they support one party
or another. To go down some of these lines, you have to look at that as
well. The bottom line is that a decent Bill could come out of this. The
Government have a legitimate concern, but there needs to be time for
discussion of all the details in a sensible way, rather than rushing,
with the inevitable bad
results.</div><a name="0811079000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000310"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I ask colleagues to ask brief, succinct
questions. Martin Linton caught my eye first, then Eleanor Laing, the
Minister and, when he comes back, Mr. Tyrie. I see that
David Howarth wants to come in again, but we must move
on.</div><a name="0811079000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><a name="0811079000311"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I have
some specific questions, but I shall try to be
brief.</div><a name="0811079000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
one pretends that triggering is a 100 per cent. foolproof method, or
even necessarily the long-term solution to the problem, but I cannot
quite agree with Professor Fisher. On the one hand, he says that it is
impossible to police but, on the other, points out that there has been
only one case in living memory. My specific question is, if we do not
have triggering, what solution would Professor Fisher advocate? He
mentioned four months, which I supported in the Electoral
Administration Bill, but which the Lords did not like. What about 365
days, as with national expenditure? What about a solution advocated in
the past by the Neill committee of a Canadian-style system, lumping
local and national spending together and dividing it by the number of
constituencies, so that, effectively, you have a single limit for local
and national
spending?</div><a name="0811079000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have another couple of quick questions, mainly addressed to Professor
Ewing. I agree with him that, just as taxation legislation has to be
renewed every year to deal with the accountants&#146; loopholes, this
legislation has to be updated on a regular basis. I would be interested
if he could elaborate a little on what he sees as a solution to two
specific points he made. One concerns the unincorporated associations
and private companies that have become a conduit for undeclared
donations. Would it be possible to bring these bodies into the
legislation, so that whatever applies to political party donations also
applies to them? In many cases, they have just become a conduit for
non-disclosed donations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="0811079000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000312"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I ask Mr. Linton to come
to a conclusion? We have less than 20 minutes and there are a lot of
people who want to come in. I apologise to our witnesses if they feel
that things are being hurried, but unfortunately these are the
procedures under which we operate. The Committee agreed with timings
proposed by the Programming Sub-Committee, and I am in the Chair as an
adjudicator.</div><a name="0811079000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000313"></a>Martin

private
companies?</div><a name="0811079000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> It is not just me who has concerns
about triggering. In February 2000 in the House, Mr. Linton
said:</div><a name="0811079000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Candidates

Standing Committee G,</i> 10 February 2000; c.
365.]</div><a name="0811079000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
common
problem.</div><a name="0811079000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to your other two points and whether to use four months or 365
days, my concern with 365 days is that it would make legislative sense
in some sense to unify the times, but there is a great problem in
over-regulating local party activity. We do not want to strangle the
communications between parties and electors in advance of the election.
Electors respond to that&#151;where campaigns are more intense, there
is higher
turn-out.</div><a name="0811079000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of aggregating the spend, in one sense again that would make for
a convenient solution. The problem is that all that would happen is
that the money would be spent in about 150 seats, and the other
parliamentary seats would simply be ignored, so while it would be
convenient in legislative terms, it would produce adverse consequences.
My proposal of four months is a compromise; it is the most workable
solution in an imperfect
world.</div><a name="0811079000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> The answer to the question is in
paragraph 10 of my submission. What has happened is that a number of
satellite organisations have emerged around political parties. The best
way to deal with that is to say that we need to extend the scope of the
regulations, so that they apply not only to political parties, but to
what I call related entities and what the Australians call associated
entities. That way, bodies such as unincorporated corporations and, in
some cases, private companies, which exist principally to fund, raise
money for, or provide services to parties, would be subject to the same
financial accountability as political parties. That means annual filing
of income and expenditure and better regulation of the transparency of
donations.</div><a name="0811079000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of private companies, there is an issue there too. I would deal
with it by going back to the Neill committee recommendation and saying
that private companies can give money to political parties only from
trading income that is generated from activity in this country. I would
go further still, and say that only private companies that are owned
wholly or mainly by a permissible donor should be allowed to give to a
political party. We need to tighten up on that in order to be faithful
to the Neill committee position, and I would do it in the ways that I
have set out.</div>
<a name="0811079000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><a name="0811079000314"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): We have had in recent
times two general elections that have been fought with triggering, and
others still in recent memory that were fought without it, such as the
one in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>2000 that Mr. Linton referred to in the quote that Professor
Fisher gave. As distinguished academics, are any of you aware of an
assessment or a comparison having been made of the effects of one type
of election or another?</div>
<a name="0811079000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> It is difficult to make that
assessment because it is only since the introduction of the current
rules, under which candidate expenses begin at the point of
dissolution, that we have had an electoral commission taking a broad
overview. To be honest, the system prior to the 2000 Act was slapdash
and subject to minimal oversight, which is almost certainly why there
has been only one case in living memory&#151;the case in Newark. I
would stress that my point is not that the current system is perfect.
The Bill is correct to assert that there is a problem with significant
pre-campaign spend. My point is that triggering is the wrong way to go
about it, because it would create more uncertainty and potentially less
transparency, and therefore a lack of confidence in the
system.</div>
<a name="0811079000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000315"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> For clarity, what is the right way to go about
it?</div><a name="0811079000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> In my view there is no perfect option,
but the least bad option is the proposal originally included in the
Electoral Administration Act 2006. That assumes that general elections
tend to be in the first week of May, and that therefore 1 January is
the start date, giving a period of four months. That is the least bad
option, but on balance it is probably the best of the options on the
table.</div>
<a name="0811079000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000316"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I have brief points of clarification for Professor
Ewing and Professor Fisher, but I would like to offer a summary
assurance to Dr. Pinto-Duschinsky, who raised a valuable point about
the legislative process. We should be clear that our discussion today
relates only to amendments that arise out of the evidence that we have
heard, out of this relatively new process. There will be plenty of time
for amendments to be tabled on Report, for example. The Government have
made it clear that as long as other members of the Committee come
forward with proposals that are consonant with the overall objectives
of the Bill, we will be flexible and accommodating as far as we can
be.</div>
<a name="0811079000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick
up two points. Professor Fisher, your remarks about minority parties
and what you assume to be their reaction to proposals by party leaders
suggest that you expect such commissioners to operate on a partisan
basis. Do you agree that those with recent political experience could
contribute to the work of the commission in an impartial and
non-partisan way?</div>
<a name="0811079000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Justin Fisher:</b></i> In an ideal world, that would be the
case. Unfortunately, the basis on which the parties are selected
suggests that the Government do not believe that that could be the
case. It would be guaranteeing a place for the three principal parties.
If I may say so, Minister, your reference to the parties as minor
parties says everything about what is wrong with the
proposals.</div><a name="0811079000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Minority.</div><a name="0811079000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor

the Scottish National party is in power in
Scotland.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000319"></a>Mr.

grateful for your contribution. I am conscious of the time and the fact
that others still want to come
in.</div><a name="0811079000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Ewing, you made a good point about regulators regulating themselves.
Aside from the fact that only four out of the 10 commissioners would be
appointed in the proposed way and the rest of them would not have had
political experience, do you agree that, if a person had recent
political experience and is not currently an elected politician or
seeking election, that would not be a case of the regulators regulating
themselves?</div><a name="0811079000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> No, I do not agree. I do not know who
you have in mind to make the appointments and, in a sense, that is
another problem. The idea was that those who would be appointed would
have experience in running national elections or perhaps raising money
for political parties. If you intend to appoint people with that level
of expertise&#151;people who have committed their whole professional
life to the work of a political party&#151;it is difficult to expect
them to put their experience and that commitment behind them when
taking on such work. From being close to politicians and people who are
active in the political process, I know that political commitment runs
deep in the individuals concerned. It is unrealistic to expect people
in such positions to put such interests behind them, when operating in
those situations.</div>
<a name="0811079000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to the point that Michael made earlier, the Federal Election Commission
in the United States consists exclusively of members of political
parties. That would not be a good model for us to follow. There are
problems with the American system because the regulator community is
regulated by itself. A group of four people out of 10 is quite a
lot.</div>
<a name="0811079000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000320"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We are not following the American model, but thank
you very
much.</div><a name="0811079000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000321"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> On that very point, are you suggesting, Professor
Ewing, that people who have stood for election, been elected or taken
part in elections&#151;the only people who, by definition, have gone
through the unique experience of the election process&#151;are, by
nature of their belief in a political ideal, in some way untrustworthy
and incapable of behaving in an impartial manner? It seems that that is
what you are
suggesting.</div><a name="0811079000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> With great respect, I cannot see how you
can possibly construe that from what I said. It is unrealistic to
expect people who have spent their lives in politics in a partisan
capacity to put all that behind them when they move to the post of
commissioner. However, your point is a good one in that it would be
helpful to the commission to have the kind of experience to which you
refer. Provision was made for that in the Act by the creation of the
parliamentary parties panel. That was designed to create a dialogue
between an independent commission and people who have partisan
political experience on behalf of the political parties. The question
that you might want to ask the commission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>and the parties is, why has that system failed? It was designed to fill
the knowledge gap that is now said to
exist.</div>
<a name="0811079000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000322"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I wonder whether the other gentlemen agree with
that point of view.</div>
<a name="0811079000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Michael
Pinto-Duschinsky:</b></i> I have been less exercised by this
question of political commissioners than others. To me, it is partly a
matter of the political stance of the commission itself. If the
commission were truly independent, it would be ideal not to have
political commissioners, but I have had the feeling that at certain
times&#151;indeed, I have been informed of this by members of the
commission&#151;that its budget has relied to a considerable extent
on Government favour, and that it therefore needs to accommodate itself
to Government
views.</div><a name="0811079000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
danger exists in many commissions in relation to ensuring that they are
independent. If we could be quite confident that there were no
pressures on an electoral commission, it would be ideal to have it as
totally an expert commission. If, however, there are political elements
involved, having a cross-party element becomes useful, as is the case
with the Committee on Standards in Public
Life.</div>
<a name="0811079000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><a name="0811079000323"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): Briefly, if I
understood Professor Ewing correctly, he was suggesting that
unincorporated associations, dinner clubs and so on should have a duty
to report just as a political party has a duty to report, so that they
would have to account for their donors in the same way. Obviously, that
is to avoid the loophole that we cannot trace the original donor. What
would be the trigger for a company or a dinner club to be considered
reportable? Have Professor Ewing or other members of the panel given
any thought to
that?</div><a name="0811079000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> The legislation should apply, as I said
earlier, not just to political parties, but to entities that are in
some way related to a political party and that are not currently
regulated.</div><a name="0811079000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000324"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> May I make it clear what I am asking? It is about
avoiding a loophole within the loophole. Obviously, if I had an
unincorporated association and I said that 27 per cent. of its
activities were commercial trading activities, it would be clear that
it was substantially a donating body, but there must come a point at
which&#151;</div><a name="0811079000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Keith Ewing:</b></i> Well, it would depend on the
circumstances. What we are trying to do here, which people have lost
sight of, is create a workable system, not a perfect system. Too many
people are looking for perfection in an area where, frankly, it is
impossible.</div><a name="0811079000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I would say as a starting point is that any entity whose principal
purposes included raising funds for or providing services to a
political party, whether on commercial terms or not, should be subject
to the same forms of transparency obligation as a political party.
Basically, that would prevent a political party from offshoring some of
those activities, as it can do
currently.</div><a name="0811079000114"></a>

therefore the trigger would be whatever sum was in place for donations

defining the organisation. I would support that; I think it is a good

which Mr. Lloyd has done well to bring to our attention. At
the moment, the triggering for third parties and their donations to
political parties under the 2000 Act is very unsatisfactory.
The wording is different from the recommendation in the 1998 Neill

McIsaac:</b></i> I am relatively new to the political
process, so I do not have a lot to say about triggering, which came
into existence long before I got involved in politics. I have no idea
how it used to work or how it might work, so I have no real opinion on
that issue, save to say, obviously, that I was part of the Hayden
Phillips discussions and we did not really turn our attention to it at
any point. As I say, I have no comment about
triggering.</div><a name="0811079000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Working
backwards, regarding the Electoral Commission, there are some good
things in the Bill in terms of the ability to give a proportionate
response to potential regulatory error. On the other hand, some things
could be considered somewhat draconian by some people. That takes me to
one of the main points that I would like to make, about volunteerism.
On the question about declarations, I think that is very problematic
indeed and I wonder whether it achieves its stated
objective.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000335"></a>The

Stephenson to respond.</div>
<a name="0811079000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> I am absolutely not a candidate. I give a
cautious welcome to political commissioners in the sense of bringing in
some first-hand expertise on how things work and perhaps improving the
enforceability and practicality of some decisions. Obviously there is
the need for public reassurance in such matters, too. We certainly
welcome the discussion of donation and spending caps, which I assume we
shall be asked about in more detail later. Our particular concern is
the proposal to return to the trigger. It does not address the main
issues that need to be dealt with in terms of transparency and a level
playing field. It would deal only with candidate spending, not party
spending, which is our main
concern.</div><a name="0811079000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, we welcome the focus on spending caps and donations. We would
be worried about a move to reintroduce triggering. That was always
uncertain, and it caused many problems for agents and volunteers. It is
probably made worse in the current circumstances by the fact that we
have almost continuous party campaigning for various elections
nowadays&#151;more than we used to have. Making the distinction
between where one election ends and another starts is becoming
increasingly
unrealistic.</div><a name="0811079000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> I welcome the proposal for political
commissioners. I am a member of the political parties panel, so I meet
the commission regularly. I heard what was said earlier about how
people involved in political life are honourable. I believe that people
can become political commissioners and look at things honourably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>and properly, and give the view of the volunteer. All our parties are
volunteer armies. As a political parties panel, in many cases we have
had many years of major agreement about how things affect the
volunteers and members on the ground. I welcome that very
much.</div><a name="0811079000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have concerns about the transparency of donations. We welcome the idea
of having a certificate in respect of donations. The sum of &#163;200
is too small and we should be looking at increasing it. As you probably
know, &#163;200 is the recordable amount in making donations. There
are then the sums of &#163;1,000 and &#163;5,000 reportable locally
and nationally. It might be more sensible to move to those figures,
rather than &#163;200, again on the basis of getting volunteers
involved. I have some reservations about what are the reasonable steps
to take to verify when the certificate has been handed to us. How do we
deal with
that?</div><a name="0811079000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the trigger, it cannot be right that, outside the period when the
election is called, we have an unregulated period in which candidates
can spend money. We have the national limit, which is about &#163;19
million. The candidate spending limit is roughly &#163;12,000 in
their constituency. The trigger is one option. It was in place before
the 2000 Act. Okay, there might be other options. I heard about the
option of a year, or possibly one of four months. They might be
explored, but some proposal to control that spending must be
right.</div><a name="0811079000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000336"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Each of you has, in different ways, mentioned
the importance of the volunteer element of what you do. I should like
to think that we all respect that. Looking specifically at clause 8,
entitled</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#147;Declaration as to source of
donation&#148;,</div><div class="hs_Para">comments were made that there are
problems with that in respect of motivational issues. It might be
helpful to put on the record what actually happens in procedural terms
when someone wants to make a donation at the current time. What
mechanics do you go through that we should be worried about or have to
think
about?</div><a name="0811079000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Are you asking about
now?</div><a name="0811079000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000337"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> At the
moment.</div><a name="0811079000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Any donation in excess of &#163;200 can be
accepted only if it is from a permissible donor, so we have to ask what
a permissible donor is. The law requires us to verify the identity of
that person&#151;we do that through the electoral register or, if it
is a company, through Companies House. They are not necessarily a
perfect way of identifying, and we would not necessarily find someone
who was determined to pass themselves off, but that is what we do. The
electoral register is a finite thing, which exists, albeit that it
needs to be updated. It is somewhere we can go to verify that a person
exists. If the amount is more than &#163;200, it needs to be
recorded, with the cheques banked and so on. It is a simple process
really. An individual, if on the electoral register, is entitled to
make a donation. We encourage them to do so and, indeed, many thousands
of donations of more than &#163;200 are made each
year.</div><a name="0811079000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000338"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What are your problems with this
clause?</div><a name="0811079000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Think about a party such as ours. We have
600 and something constituency associations, of which about 350 put in
financial statements, which means that they have income in excess of
&#163;25,000 a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>year. Only a very small number of them have professional staff, and the
rest are run by volunteers. Typically, the constituency chairman, who
is the registered treasurer for the purposes of our constitution, would
tend to be someone who is probably retired, possibly elderly and not
necessarily with a background in financial services&#151;they are not
forensic accountants or anything of that sort, but teachers,
councillors and so on. At the moment, it is a very mechanical process;
it is very easy. Are they on the electoral register or not? There is a
help desk in central office, so we can help them with
that.</div><a name="0811079000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
you start getting into areas of judgment it gets more difficult. This
legislation has words such
as</div><a name="0811079000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;think
that the declaration was untruthful...suspected to be
untruthful&#148;.</div><a name="0811079000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is anti-money laundering language&#151;I am afraid that my
professional practice unfortunately got me involved in anti-money
laundering stuff, quite a lot. I checked out the joint money laundering
steering group guidance notes&#151;here they are, 159 pages long,
including things such as customer due diligence, how to identify your
customer or how to identify their money. All these things are highly
judgmental and very difficult. You can imagine yourself, or your
parents, being asked to become chairman of the local constituency
association&#151;not necessarily mine, but Lib Dem or Labour as
well&#151;and then being told, &#147;By the way, there is a bit of
a snag. There is the compliance manual. And, by the way, you ought to
be aware that if you make a mistake, albeit an innocent one, it could
be looked at through the eyes of someone who is very suspicious. Also,
be aware that the Electoral Commission has all sorts of powers to gain
access to your home and to look at your records. By the way, you do
want to be the chairman of the association, don&#146;t
you?&#148;</div><a name="0811079000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the sort of problem; it is not easy. Then that comes up to me. I had
a line with Sir Hayden Phillips, that if that were required, I am not
sure that Mrs. McIsaac would allow me to carry on with the
job. I mean that very sincerely, because the way that the
legislation&#151;the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000&#151;is written, the registered treasurer takes responsibility
for the compliance of all the associations. You can see the
picture&#151;slightly elderly chairman, no professional staff, people
who come in three days a week, and so on and so forth&#151;but every
quarter I have to sign off the donation report. I have to rely on these
people. I can do that now, basically because the electoral register
exists. It is a mechanical thing to check it. If, on the other hand, I
want to rely on the quick-wittedness of those in the associations to
spot something that they suspect to be untruthful, or ought to suspect
to be untruthful, I am starting to get into serious
difficulty.</div><a name="0811079000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
can see the pattern. There is the whole verification area, the
judgmentalism and the lack of staff. A large investment bank that I
dealt with when in professional practice had more than 1,000 people in
compliance and legal&#151;not risk. I think of the Conservative
party, and we have a
handful.</div><a name="0811079000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000339"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you. Would either of the other two
witnesses like to add to
that?</div><a name="0811079000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> Yes. I wholeheartedly endorse a great
deal of that. It was all very true to me. Finding treasurers, even
under the past decade of legislation, has become more difficult. We are
changing a culture 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>with those people&#151;in the way that election agents are quite used
to some of those compliance-type things, while treasurers traditionally
have not been. To add something else on top, another burden at this
stage, would make quite a difficulty, although in practice I think that
the outcomes of this could be laudable&#151;where we are trying to
go. If the amount at which this was triggered was higher, the problems
might be
minimised.</div><a name="0811079000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> My experiences are similar. Getting
treasurers to do this work is always difficult and getting a
constituency officer is obviously difficult. We have local constituency
Labour parties that send all their reports to our head office, either
online or on paper, for donations of &#163;200 and above. We collate
loads of stuff and then the checks are made: are they on the register?
If it is a company, is it registered? Are they registered through a
trade union? We can find those things, they are there and can easily be
found. Going beyond that, the question of reasonable steps and so on is
a much more unclear area for us, so we have some concerns there and
that area needs to be thought through further. On the raising of
earnings, as I said in my earlier submission, it should be raised at
least to &#163;1,000 or &#163;5,000 at both local and national
levels.</div>
<a name="0811079000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000340"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I come back to something that Hilary
Stephenson said on the spending side? It was very striking, and I would
like to have your reaction to it. She said that campaigning is now all
the time, not just at elections, and that it is difficult to tell the
difference between campaigning for one election and another. My
experience is similar to that. If that is so, does not that mean that
the idea of controlling election spending through candidate spending
near the time of the poll is a 19th-century approach to a 21st-century
problem, and that what we should be looking at is something like the
Hayden Phillips global spending cap approach, throughout the electoral
cycle? Taking into account what you have just said about the problems
of compliance and voluntarism, there should be some way of dividing
that up into a local cap too, so that it is comprehensive and does not
depend on the accidents of when a general election might
occur.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000341"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Hilary Stephenson, if that was directed
to her?</div>
<a name="0811079000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000342"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It was directed to the other two witnesses,
because I was taking up what she said and putting it back to
them.</div>
<a name="0811079000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000343"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let us start with Mr.
McIsaac.</div><a name="0811079000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Can you just clarify the precise
question?</div>
<a name="0811079000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000344"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Is it the experience of your party that
campaigning is constant and undifferentiated between elections? If so,
is it the case that if we are to control campaign spending, we must
control it all the time?</div>
<a name="0811079000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> I assume that that must be right, because
the same people are doing the campaigning and they are campaigning for
all the elections that are relevant. There are the European elections
coming up, the local government elections, parliamentary by-elections,
general elections and so on, so what you say has to be correct. As for
the way in which the money is divided up, I understand that the current
system is fairly straightforward. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>Not being a candidate, I would not know about the Representation of the
People Act, but I am aware of it. We know about that and that is how we
manage it. I do not know whether the money could be divided up into
different pots. Already, there are different limits on, for example,
the European elections and by-elections and so on, but you are quite
right that there is a degree of artificiality about it. Unless people
keep timesheets, you will never find out what they are getting up to
and even then, from my experience of timesheets, you cannot necessarily
agree with them.</div>
<a name="0811079000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> The point made earlier was that there is an
unregulated period local spend but a national cap of &#163;30,000 per
constituency, which is roughly &#163;90 million. You then have the
local candidate limit at the election time itself, which has been in
force for many years, but then you have a whole period that is not
regulated at all, so your campaigning goes on. People are now
campaigning constantly for elections that could be many years in
advance and for all sorts of different elections that take place each
year. That period is unregulated and it should be
regulated.</div>
<a name="0811079000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000345"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> It might be helpful if people amplified their
answers to one part of David&#146;s question, which is: in practice,
is it feasible to try to divvy up a global cap that might run for the
life of a Parliament between hundreds of individual
associations&#151;646 constituencies, or whatever&#151;given the
scope for being active in one period but in fact being active in
another? I ask that because I know that this was discussed as part of
the Hayden Phillips process, which I participated in. Hayden himself
became sceptical about the feasibility, which is why he was seriously
discussing only the development of a global
cap.</div><a name="0811079000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> I do not know. We should look for a way of
controlling regular local spend. We could find a system. We have the
national spend, as you know, at the time of the election. Perhaps we
could find a way of doing the regular spend&#151;there may be other
ways. I think that we can work together and find a formula or a
procedure that deals with that, so that we control spending in a
constituency year on year. That must be a good thing, if we can get
there.</div><a name="0811079000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Andrew Tyrie knows that I was present at
those discussions as well, and all the parties agreed that it was
impractical to seek to control spending constituency by constituency,
without changing the constitution of the parties
concerned&#151;obviously the Conservative party&#151;and bringing
in accounting systems of some sophistication to deal with that. It is a
complicated beast, when you think about it&#151;a party of several
hundred autonomous associations having to march together, be
individually controlled, and then controlled as a group. So, who is
going to do the controlling? Who is going to be responsible if it goes
wrong? The chairman and the officers change every three years&#151;it
is not an even cycle. Who do you point the finger at when somebody has
overspent? Who is going to take responsibility for that? As I say, we
came to the conclusion that although theoretically it may seem an
attractive solution, it is practically impossible to do it in a way
that can be
implemented.</div><a name="0811079000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> Surely this comes down to it certainly
being an extra burden on the party nationally, but that does not
necessarily mean that it is an impossible  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>thing to do. This is not ever going to be perfect, however we do it. It
would mean that we were regulating expenditure over a period&#151;not
getting into some of those rather uncomfortable territories of what
defines the trigger of this or the start of that&#151;and we would
not have a big unregulated period somewhere in the process. I tend to
think that it is worth seriously looking at just how practical this is,
and that it is somewhat more practical, perhaps, than colleagues have
said.</div><a name="0811079000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000346"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I want to pick up on a couple of comments that have
been made by the different party representatives about the difficulty
of policing donations. I think that Roy Kennedy said that there is a
good argument for raising the limit from the current &#163;200 to
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="0811079000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> It is &#163;1,000 locally and
&#163;5,000 nationally. That is really
important.</div><a name="0811079000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000347"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> So, the first part of my question is whether there
would be rough agreement across the political parties for that kind of
approach. Ian McIsaac mentioned the difficulty at local level, which
most of us who have had practical experience of local parties would
understand. At the other extreme is the more contentious policing of
the irregular donor&#151;the foreign donation, or whatever. Those
donations do not tend to be the &#163;201 ones; they tend to be
significantly more. Is there any reason to believe that the political
parties have a problem checking out the eligibility of donors regarding
their taxation and residency status, and their registration on our
electoral registers? In essence, there are clear concerns that foreign
donations still come into our system. Do the political parties
adequately police at that top level? So, the small issue is whether we
should be raising the limits and whether the parties can agree on what
they should be, and the big one is why we cannot get our collective
houses in order and stop the irregular donors coming
through.</div><a name="0811079000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> I think that your question is about the
bottom-up and the top-down. I will deal with the bottom-up first. The
larger the limit, the smaller the number of donations involved and
therefore the smaller the problem. The principle remains exactly the
same. The principle is that volunteers out in their constituency
associations are not equipped to verify the origins of donations or to
know to the point of being able to challenge a declaration whether
someone is giving their own money or someone else&#146;s. That is the
real problem.</div>
<a name="0811079000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
large amounts and tax residence, which you mentioned, I am not aware of
any way you could find out a company&#146;s tax residence without
going to the Inland Revenue, and obviously its information is
confidential. I also have bitter personal experience of trying to find
out who controls companies when you go way up the line. In one sense,
the only way to do that is by checking against the information
available, which is the companies registry. I do not know, for example,
whether BP is a British company. How would you define that? Are the
majority of the shareholders British or foreign, or are they a mixture?
That is a very difficult problem. Tracing money through major
insolvencies, which I have had a lot of experience of, is very
difficult. It is hard enough for a large firm of forensic accountants
to track that down, but to put that sort of burden on a volunteer or a
registered treasurer is very difficult.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="0811079000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> On the bottom-up question on the extra
burden of verifying donations, I think that a higher limit of
&#163;1,000 or &#163;5,000 would help to minimise the problem. From
the point of view of local treasurers, I understand that the main thing
they are required to do is to require extra verification from the
donor, rather than to do a huge investigative job. It would be helpful
if there were fewer occasions when they have to do that, but in
principle I do not see that as a huge problem.</div>
<a name="0811079000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the top
end, I am not a party treasurer or financial expert on that part, so I
acknowledge how difficult that verification is. However, if we
simplified things so that it was clear that donations from a company
controlled by an impermissible or foreign donor were impermissible,
regardless of whether that company was arguably in the UK, that might
help to clarify the situation, reassure the public and make it easier
to administer.</div>
<a name="0811079000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> Obviously, I would like to see the local
limit raised. We made the point several times about our volunteers
being able to do that properly, so I think that raising the limit is
important. With regard to being able to comply with the legislation, we
also need clarity and certainty on the sources we are using to verify
it. Every party has to submit its return every quarter and be
confident, when things are being checked and looked at, that they have
gone to sources that can be relied on, and then it can be accepted that
they have done those checks. In terms of big amounts of money, we again
need certainty that we can go to the source to confirm that the money
has come from where it is said to have come from. So we need certainty
and
clarity.</div><a name="0811079000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000348"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> In terms of the large national donors, I take Ian
McIsaac&#146;s point, which the other witnesses generally concurred
with, that there are difficulties in tracing things through. I
appreciate the genuine problems in that. Do the parties now routinely
ask those large donors to assert their ability to make a donation under
existing law?</div>
<a name="0811079000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> We know our donors over a certain
level&#151;it is obviously a reasonably high level because we cannot
know them all. So we are aware of the sort of people we are dealing
with and their background. By and large, we have personal knowledge of
our donors, which is helpful, certainly when it comes to individuals.
We are quite satisfied, for example, that we are getting money from the
business man, rather than his chauffeur.</div>
<a name="0811079000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes
to companies, however, we have to stick to the law, which means being
satisfied that the company is incorporated in the European Union,
registered in the UK and carrying on business in the UK.
&#147;Carrying on business&#148; is a term of art rather than
science. Sometimes we can be satisfied by checking the company
accounts. If they appear to show trading activity, that will satisfy
the requirement, and that is the final tick in the box. Where we cannot
see company accounts, whether that is because a company is a start-up
or it has not finished its first year or they are late, or whatever, we
would, for example, take a statement from the independent auditors
saying that they are carrying on business. So the answer to your
question is, yes, we take the matter very seriously indeed, but we do
not routinely check back through some chain of ownership, because we do
not have the ability to do that, nor does the law, at the moment,
require it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div><a name="0811079000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> This is not my field, in detail, but I
know that we take serious steps to do the things that the law requires
us to do at the moment. Of course, it does not require us to backtrack
through the various layers; that is the point I was making. That could,
perhaps, be
clarified.</div><a name="0811079000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> We take our responsibilities on this matter
seriously, as well. We know, nationally, about donors at a certain
level and we take responsibility and acknowledge them. We check what we
need to check there to ensure that we are meeting our responsibilities
seriously and properly so that we are submitting a proper return each
quarter.</div>
<a name="0811079000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000349"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Can I take you to triggering and spending money
rather than raising it? I appreciate that Mr. McIsaac has
said that this is not his expert area, so perhaps I had better address
my question to the other people before
us.</div><a name="0811079000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have spoken a bit during these Committee proceedings about the lack of
clarity in the Bill and the uncertainty as far as triggering is
concerned. I wonder if you have had any chance to consider the
disproportionate effect that the Bill might have on a candidate, as
opposed to a Member of
Parliament?</div><a name="0811079000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to the Secretary of State two days ago that, in my constituency,
for example, I am the MP and am represented as the MP: I get coverage
in the papers, and so on, and I can send out literature as a Member of
Parliament. Could a candidate standing against me find that he or she
has spent to the limit of the election expenses and, discovering that
this Bill applies, therefore not be able to campaign in the period
immediately before a general
election?</div><a name="0811079000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> Assuming this Bill becomes law, yes, we will
have to go through the processes. It is not retrospective, but will be
going forward, so I assume that what will happen then is that the
commission would give advice and guidance to parties and candidates on
how to operate. So anything that has happened in the past would not
count and everyone would have the advice on how to operate, moving
forward. I do not see the point you are
making.</div><a name="0811079000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000350"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> You are assuming that it will not have a
retrospective
effect.</div><a name="0811079000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="0811079000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000351"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> But we have advice that it could have a
retrospective effect; that was my concern. Would you then be concerned
for your candidates? I know that that is not a fair
question.</div><a name="0811079000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000352"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Do any of the other witnesses&#151;Hilary
Stephenson or Ian McIsaac, wish to comment on what Eleanor Laing has
said? Do they foresee a
problem?</div><a name="0811079000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> If it was retrospective, most certainly I
see a problem. I do not think that there is an intrinsic problem with
the triggering in respect of inequality in any case between incumbents
and candidates. That would be much worse, should it be
retrospective.</div><a name="0811079000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000353"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> But could it not have retrospective effect, because
we do not know exactly what the triggering rules are as they are so
unclear, or are you certain, at the moment, how you would advise
candidates to behave to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>ensure that they do not trigger? With the triggering rules being so
unclear, if they are clarified at some point&#151;perhaps by a court
judgment or by the Electoral Commission, or in some other
way&#151;you may discover that you have candidates who have
inadvertently, but undoubtedly, triggered some months previously. They
might have spent &#163;10,000 in that time. Therefore, in the few
months before a general election they would not be allowed to spend
another penny. Could that not
happen?</div><a name="0811079000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> It could happen, of course. With triggering,
it would be in force and I assume it would be retrospective, although I
would not want it to be retrospective. We would seek advice from the
commission and other partners would do the same. Then we would give
that advice to our candidates and parties. We would do training as well
to make sure that people did not get themselves caught there.
Potentially, if the trigger is brought in, somebody might, at some
point, trigger
themselves.</div><a name="0811079000186"></a>

McIsaac:</b></i> Obviously, I do not have the detailed
knowledge of my colleagues. While, as finance director, I would welcome

this occasion, that could give rise to a lot of
inequity.</div><a name="0811079000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Picking
up your point, at the end of the day there will presumably be a judge

35</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000359"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am not suggesting for a moment that that is
relevant to your current job, but it might help you to explain to us
the complexities of some of these issues to do with
companies.</div><a name="0811079000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two particular problems with the Bill. One concerns these
unincorporated associations and private companies, which are
effectively excluded. Some of them, such as Midlands Industrial Council
and Bearwood, have made donations of well over &#163;1 million, so it
is fair to assume that within that there might be donations well over
the &#163;5,000 declarable level.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="0811079000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
hear your opinion of the idea of having declarations of the true
individual source of donations over &#163;5,000, even though they
might be given through an unincorporated association or private
company.</div>
<a name="0811079000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question relates to donations that a person or his party might receive,
which are intended for a particular donee. I know that donations have
been canvassed, for instance, for members of staff of George Osborne,
the shadow Chancellor, which is perfectly legal and above board. As I
understand it, these are declared in the Electoral Commission accounts,
as opposed to the House of Commons register, as donations to the
Conservative party, so there is no indication there that they are given
for the shadow Chancellor&#146;s staff. That raises all sorts of
issues about shadow Ministers and their accountability. I wonder
whether he would welcome a change in the law that would make that more
explicit. I know that he wrote to the Electoral Commission saying that
this money is, at the moment, commingled with other funds, not
segregated. These people are employed by the Conservative party, so all
the money goes into the same
pot.</div><a name="0811079000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000360"></a>The

<a name="0811079000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000361"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I have asked some
questions.</div><a name="0811079000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000362"></a>The
Chairman:</b> This appears to be a speech. I am speaking not
to you, Mr. McIsaac, but to Mr.
Linton.</div><a name="0811079000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> Shall I answer your three questions? The
first concerned companies. Obviously, we go through the process that I
have mentioned to you. If a company is an agent for another donor, the
company already has a legal obligation to declare that to me. If it
does not, it commits an offence. We draw the attention of our donors to
that, where we believe it to be relevant.</div>
<a name="0811079000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">You mentioned
also an unincorporated association&#151;a particular one&#151;and
again the law is quite clear: where the unincorporated association is
acting as an agent for one of its members, it is the member who has
made the donation, not the unincorporated association. In fact, the
particular entity you mentioned has been reviewed by the Electoral
Commission. Those suggestions were made, and were signed off by the
commission.</div><a name="0811079000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000363"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am asking not whether it obeys the letter of the
current law&#151;I am taking it for granted that it does&#151;but
about possible changes to the law that would make it more
explicit.</div><a name="0811079000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> The issue really is whether a piece of paper
saying, &#147;By the way, you know that that is the law really,
don&#146;t you?&#148; is sufficient. I think that, by and large,
people know that it is the law, but a large organisation could deal
with that. I would be surprised if anything changed, and if they
suddenly said, &#147;Oh, now that I must sign a declaration, let me
come clean. It wasn&#146;t my money at all; it was someone

37</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000364"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Clearly, if the money was not sent in that way, it
would have to be declared, and the individual&#146;s identity would
have to be
declared.</div><a name="0811079000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> That happens already in the case of the
association you mentioned. Individuals request it to be passed to the
Conservative party. We record that as being a donation from the
individual, not the association. It is clear that that is
happening.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="0811079000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the final
point you mention, it would be useful to have clarity when money has
been given to the party with a wish attached to it that it be used to
support a member of staff working in someone&#146;s office. The
Electoral Commission guidance seems to suggest that if it is supporting
the role of an MP&#151;his party role as a shadow Minister&#151;the
party should declare it to the Electoral Commission. When it is
supporting the MP as a constituency MP, it is the regulated donee, the
MP, who should report it to the commission. It is, interestingly,
whoever receives the money.</div>
<a name="0811079000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to
be the guidance on the Electoral Commission website, and that is the
guidance on which we base our actions. It is slightly unsatisfactory,
because there could be a situation in which an MP receives money, but
the party has the obligation to report it, or the party may receive
money and the MP may have the obligation to report it. That is separate
from the Register of Members&#146; Interests to which the MP, as a
matter of good sense and good dealing with the House, will report it,
whoever received
it.</div><a name="0811079000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000365"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> But you would not have any objection if it was
made clear in law that when a donation was made for a particular donee,
that should be made clear in the party
accounts.</div><a name="0811079000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> You say the party accounts.
I&#151;</div><a name="0811079000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000366"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> In the party declaration of donations, in the
register of
donations.</div><a name="0811079000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> My difficulty is that when someone pays
money to the party, and I bank it and commingle it with party funds,
that money ceases to exist. I may be able to follow that wish, or I may
not. It is rather like a charity when someone says, &#147;Here is
some money; I want it to be used for building a certain dam, and for no
other purpose.&#148; If the project is cancelled, the money must be
sent back. Or someone may say, &#147;I would like it to be used for a
purpose similar to that, following your normal charitable
objectives.&#148; One is trust money, which is very specific, and the
other is general support with a wish that it support a particular
objective.</div>
<a name="0811079000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter is
slightly more complicated than that, but I see where you are coming
from. By and large, MPs do report donations to the Register of
Members&#146; Interests, so there is transparency and
clarity.</div><a name="0811079000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000367"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Are you satisfied that the money from Bearwood is
from a legal
donor?</div><a name="0811079000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> If I was not satisfied, I would not be here;
I would be in Wormwood
Scrubs.</div><a name="0811079000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000368"></a>The
Chairman:</b> A very good answer.</div>
<a name="0811079000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hilary
Stephenson, have you anything to say to Mr. Linton on behalf
of the Liberal
Democrats?</div><a name="0811079000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> There are essentially two things: the
source of the money and the application of it. On sourcing, we are very
much of the view that the purpose of legislation and the requirement
for public reassurance are about ensuring that we have law that gets us
back to the source of the money. That clarification would be
welcome.</div><a name="0811079000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
particular donations for particular purposes, at the moment I cannot
think of an example in which that applies. I can see that there might
be some difficulties in some cases, but in principle it is a good thing
that it should be clear whether such conditions are made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="0811079000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> My view is similar. I obviously welcome
transparency, and it is important to be clear about where money comes
from. A declaration of assets will help with that. It will determine
where the money has come from. There will be particular uses. If that
is the case, it should be stipulated as
well.</div><a name="0811079000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000369"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Three people have caught my eye; the first is
David
Howarth.</div><a name="0811079000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000370"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My question has been
answered.</div>
<a name="0811079000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000371"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I have a specific question for Ian McIsaac, which
is the stem of a general question for everybody. Mr. McIsaac
said to us a few moments ago that where there was no unincorporated
association, one would seek to know who the individuals who made a
contribution through that association were. Do you make a public
declaration on who those people
are?</div><a name="0811079000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> I did not intend to say that. I intended to
say, and I think that I did say, that when an individual instructs or
requests the unincorporated association to pay the money over to my
party, it is recorded as an amount coming from that donor, not from the
unincorporated
association.</div><a name="0811079000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000372"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> And is registered with
the&#151;</div><a name="0811079000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> And is registered by me with the Electoral
Commission as coming from that donor. If the unincorporated association
is a members&#146; association, that association itself has the
obligation to declare all amounts over &#163;5,000 directly to the
Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="0811079000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000373"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> In fact, that moves us on to a more general
question. In the previous sitting, Professor Ewing suggested that all
associations and equivalent bodies ought to have a statutory duty to
act, so that they police the donations going through those bodies in
the first instance. Mr. McIsaac, you indicated that
unincorporated associations do that, but I am not clear that that is
the case. I would be grateful for your view on whether they already
have that legal obligation.</div>
<a name="0811079000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> They have the obligation, because it is in
the law. I can only assume that they discharge their obligation. I have
no reason to believe that they do not. The association that your
colleague mentioned earlier is well aware of that, and the Electoral
Commission has reviewed that issue with it and has satisfied itself
that that is what
happens.</div><a name="0811079000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000374"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> That it is a regulated
donee?</div><a name="0811079000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> No, it would be a regulated donee if it was
a members&#146; association. That particular one is not a
members&#146; association, but others are. &#147;Unincorporated
association&#148; is the umbrella term and the members&#146;
association is a subset of that.</div>
<a name="0811079000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000375"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> That is helpful in clarifying the position.
Professor Ewing suggested that for those bodies that do not have a
legal obligation to declare the sources of their income, there is
inevitable concern about whether the ultimate sources of the donations
are compatible with the law, even though they may have a legal
structure. Should we force all such unincorporated associations to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>register and provide details of their donations, so that they have the
duty to police the situation? Would the various parties support
that?</div><a name="0811079000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> I heard that. I assume therefore that there
would also be obligations to file financial statements. The Electoral
Commission now wishes to standardise those and incorporate them into
regulations, with regulatory sanctions. Baring in mind that when I went
on to the Electoral Commission website this morning and looked up
unincorporated associations, I found that even my colleagues to my left
accept donations from unincorporated associations. One of them accepted
&#163;1,072 and the other &#163;754. That is apart from my
party.</div><a name="0811079000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000376"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> It is a common question, I agree.</div>
<a name="0811079000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I can see regulatory overload
killing the golden goose. Many associations are small&#151;dinner
clubs and this, that and the other. I think that trying to generate
volunteerism and political engagement is, by and large, a good
thing.</div>
<a name="0811079000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000377"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Andrew
Tyrie.</div><a name="0811079000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000378"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Sir Nicholas, this is a general
question.</div>
<a name="0811079000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000379"></a>The
Chairman:</b> You addressed it to Mr. McIsaac, but
if you want the other witnesses to answer, please go
on.</div><a name="0811079000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000380"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> To clarify, the first specific question was to
Mr. McIsaac and the more general question was to all the
witnesses.</div>
<a name="0811079000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> I think that there is a clear difference
between organisations that donate a few hundred pounds, which are
primarily volunteer organisations, and much larger organisations and
donations. In going along this line, the way to do it would be to have
a kind of cap on where that imposition came in. In principle, it would
seem quite sensible, although, as I said, I do not have hands-on
expertise to whether there are further complications with
it.</div><a name="0811079000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> In principle, it would be a good thing. You
have to get the figures right. Perhaps we could follow the model of the
&#163;200 that is recordable by the association with the report at
another level. Yes, we should be clear where the money is coming
from.</div><a name="0811079000242"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000381"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I have no questions. The point that I wanted to
raise was answered by Ian McIsaac in response to a question put to him
earlier.</div><a name="0811079000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000382"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does any member of the Committee wish to ask
further
questions?</div><a name="0811079000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><a name="0811079000383"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): I have a brief question for
all the witnesses. Others witnesses have commented on things that they
believe should in the Bill. Given that you have all stressed the
voluntarism of your parties&#151;mine included&#151;is there
anything that you regard as a missed opportunity and that should be in
the Bill that would encourage voluntarism, strengthen it or acknowledge
it? Shall we start with Mr. McIsaac?</div>
<a name="0811079000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> I can answer that question in a slightly
different way. Anything that seeks to impose, by regulatory sanction,
complex and ill-understood rules on volunteers will kill it stone dead.
That is a negative answer.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div><a name="0811079000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
encouraging voluntarism, it will flourish on its own as long as it is
not put down. By and large, people are interested in politics and they
want to have the opportunity to engage. As for declarations, one of my
concerns is that those who give money will consider there is something
dodgy about supporting political parties. They will think that Oxfam is
okay, but not this or that party, because they have to go through a
special legal hoop for it. The negatives are the problem. Take the
negatives away and it will
flourish.</div><a name="0811079000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> Clarity is the thing for me. Volunteers
worry when they do not know whether they are breaking the law. The vast
majority of them want to do the right thing. We need anything that is
simple, clear and consistent. That brings me back to one of the good
things in the previous legislation: the clarity concerned with the
starting of expenses during an election. Unless we are moving into much
broader areas, I strongly urge that simple clarity is very
helpful.</div><a name="0811079000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> Clarity and certainty. We are all officials,
but all the parties are basically volunteer armies. People have to be
certain and have clarity about their responsibilities, what they have
to do and what they do not have to do. That is what we need. We have
all referred to raising the limits. I hope that you will consider
it.</div><a name="0811079000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have another point to make that is not about voluntarism. When we gave
evidence to the Graham inquiry and supported the idea of commissioners,
we also said, although the inquiry did not take it on board, that
perhaps the others who should have a role in the commission were the
administrators. They obviously run the election from the other side of
the table, as it were. We put that forward. They certainly have a valid
viewpoint that should be taken account of as
well.</div><a name="0811079000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811079000384"></a>The
Chairman:</b> On behalf of the Committee, I ask our witnesses,
who have been extremely helpful, whether they wish to express any views
to us about the Bill that the Committee will be considering from next
Tuesday morning&#151;line by line, almost word by
word?</div><a name="0811079000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> The only thing I would say is this. I have
been involved with this party, or any political party, for less than
three years, but I have noticed that innocent mistakes have a habit of
being magnified in the press, on the blogs and the rest of it, as if
they were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>some sort of scandal. People make mistakes, even in the best regulated
organisations. To open up the possibility for mistakes, and thereby the
whiff of scandal, could be very
counter-productive.</div><a name="0811079000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="0811079000385"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> What are you
suggesting?</div><a name="0811079000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
McIsaac:</b></i> That it would be absolutely inevitable. With
the thousands of donations involved, the volunteers involved, the lack
of training and compliance manuals, and all the rest of it, there will
be mistakes. The Electoral Commission would have no choice but to act
on those
mistakes.</div><a name="0811079000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not talking about breaking down people&#146;s doors, but even the
commission putting it on its website that such and such a constituency
association accepted some dodgy donation from someone would mean that
the press were on to it and the whole thing would become a hoo-hah,
when actually it was nothing&#151;someone dropped the declaration
down the back of the desk and found it a month later. That is the sort
of problem that we have to be very careful not to
exacerbate.</div><a name="0811079000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Stephenson:</b></i> I want only to reiterate the point about
clarity and enforceability of the rules&#151;that has to be key. They
are not going to be perfect; it is not possible to do something perfect
here. However, something that people can understand and not
accidentally fall foul of is what we need. To that end, I hope that the
Committee will consider the possibility of a spending limit over a
period of years in the electoral
cycle.</div><a name="0811079000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Roy
Kennedy:</b></i> Just a point about volunteers&#151;all
parties are volunteer armies. Today, you have probably heard with
surprise the amount of agreement on certain things between the three
representatives. You can take that on board in your deliberations over
the next few weeks. Thank
you.</div><a name="0811079000257"></a>

and full way in which they dealt with every question put to them. Thank
you very much
