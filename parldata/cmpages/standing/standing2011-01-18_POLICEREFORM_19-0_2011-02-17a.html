                        </p>‘(4AB)
A specialist unit shall be established within the Crown Prosecution
Service, reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions, so as to
ensure minimal delay in decisions relating to arrest warrants issued
under this
section.’.<p class="tabbed">Good
morning, Mr Benton. Yet again, it seems very early in the morning. I do
not know what it is with this place; 9 o’clock is the usual time
to go to work, but it always seems so early
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are towards the end of the Bill, but the clause introduces a
significant and important change to the law on universal jurisdiction.
As the Government will know, that is something we support in general,
but obviously we need to discuss certain issues and, no doubt, there
are some that the Minister himself will want to put on the record. I
accept that the right hon. Gentleman will reiterate that such
significant, poignant and symbolic legislation is embodied in all sort
of international treaties and conventions. Universal jurisdiction is
rightly seen by many people as something that ensures no hiding place
for someone who has committed any of the worst crimes that we can
imagine anywhere in the world, let alone within our own country.
Notwithstanding some of the discussion that we might have on the clause
and its implementation, it is worth restating that no member of the
Committee would seek to erode its
thrust.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have tabled a probing amendment, which is none the less important. As
the Minister knows, controversy has arisen among people who are
concerned that the change to the process of universal jurisdiction will
allow individuals who may be guilty of serious crimes, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 678<a class="bkMark" name="Column678">&#160;</a>
                           </div>such as hostage taking or genocide, to escape or evade justice. There
are particular worries that the process will be lengthy and
time-consuming. Human rights groups say that it will hamper efforts to
bring alleged war criminals to justice, hence our
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the Bill, there is to be a requirement for the Director of Public
Prosecutions to consent to a magistrate issuing an arrest warrant when
a private prosecutor has laid an information. Kate Allen, the United
Kingdom director of Amnesty International,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
is a dangerous and unnecessary change. Unless a way of guaranteeing a
means of preventing suspects fleeing can be built into the proposals,
then the UK will have undermined the fight for international justice
and handed war criminals a free ticket to escape the
law.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>She
points out some of the dangers. Notwithstanding the fact that she does
not agree with the change, she says that if safeguards were built into
the policy, they would mitigate some of the danger. As the Minister
knows, Justice has similar
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
whole thrust of our argument this morning will be to suggest to the
Government that safeguards need to be built into the Bill to address
the worries of Kate Allen and many others about the impact of the
change. We support the clause, but delays should not hamper justice.
All of us want prosecutions to proceed whenever possible, and the
amendment would introduce the necessary safeguard. The establishment of
a specialist unit in the Crown Prosecution Service, with people trained
in that area of work, who know about it and understand the context of
the decisions, would help improve speed and minimise delays. People
would also have someone to go straight to rather than, as sometimes
happens, being left wondering to whom a warrant should be given, to see
whether the DPP agreed to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have suggested in the amendment that there should be a specialist unit
in the CPS, but the Minister might also consider, although this is not
in the amendment, whether it would be useful to have a specialist unit
in the Metropolitan Police Service. Is there already such a
unit, or are trained officers available, to whom an immediate reference
can be made when a warrant is
sought?<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, notwithstanding the
proposals in the Bill, serious and valid cases are not lost as a result

deals with the most serious issues around the world. As has already
been said, it is clear that we have to deal with them in a very serious
way. There are two issues to discuss. First, is there a need for a
change? Secondly, if there is to be a change, is the provision the
right way to do it? The amendment relates to the second question, so I
will talk about whether there is a need later. I give hon. Members
advance notice that I am not yet persuaded that there is a need for a
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000034">&#160;</a>

there is to be a change, the real question is whether the DPP will be
able to respond promptly, or be available to make the necessary
decisions. That is at the heart of the amendment. I have been concerned
about whether there would be capacity, and I understand exactly what
the hon. Member for Gedling said, but I was somewhat mollified by the
comments of Keir Starmer in his

Committee, which seem a long time ago. I suggest that anyone who is
listening, or following the transcript of our discussion, should look
at his evidence. He discussed extensively the timeliness and
availability of resources. There are real issues, one of which is the
availability of a
team.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
general, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that what
Keir Starmer said in his evidence to us is not only his own view or the
official view of the current DPP, but what the Government believe the
policy of the DPP ought to be. It makes a huge difference whether the
DPP will or will not try to act promptly. I look forward to hearing
specific reassurances from the Minister on those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is an issue of simply having a team ready and available. It does not
have to be a specific team that works only on such matters, but it has
to understand the specific timeliness of universal jurisdiction cases,
and be ready and prepared to deal with them. Mr Starmer has made it
clear that he would need such people, and I am sure that the Minister
will be able to confirm that. I gave him in advance a list of
particular points on which I would like confirmation, to make things
easier for us
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not just about having the team ready because, no matter how large a
team is, sometimes, as Mr Starmer
said,<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>It
is also a question whether that team will be able to look at
information in advance. Will the DPP and the team be prepared to look
at and process the evidence ahead of time, so that when there is a need
for an application to happen, it can be done very quickly?
Mr Starmer invited people wishing to pursue cases to

                        <p>I seek
a reassurance from the Minister that that is what the Government expect
from the DPP and the CPS about the team, because that is not always the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
submission from Hickman and Rose Solicitors— PR
128—which we received today, is relevant. It refers to its
experience of trying to work with the existing team in the CPS, and to
the Metropolitan police, which we will come on to in the clause stand
part debate. I hope that hon. Members have looked at the letter that it
sent round, and which it received from the CPS team. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I…respectfully

                        </p>
                        <p>If
there will be a system like this, and a team to look at things, will
the team look at evidence in advance? When there is notification that
someone will be landing within an hour, a day, or a week, the team
would then be ready and would not have to start afresh the process of
going through a complex legal case. That is a key point, and I look
forward to the Minister’s response on
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
test would this team in the DPP be using? How would it establish
exactly what was happening? I hope that the Minister will confirm what
Mr Starmer said, which was that the team would use a threshold test
where time was short. That would be below the threshold normally used
to go ahead with a prosecution, although, of course, well above the
standard test for an arrest. How would such a team be expected to make
its decisions? What would it be looking for? How would it interpret 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>advice from the Attorney-General? In this model, the Attorney-General
does not play a key role, but he does play a role in giving commentary
on public interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
Starmer said a number of times during the session that there was a
powerful force in favour of a prosecution, because universal
jurisdiction crimes are such large things. I would appreciate the
Government’s agreement with the DPP that that is the
case—that there is a powerful weight in favour of prosecuting
and that public interest tests would have to be equally overwhelming to
counterbalance that. We do not want the Attorney-General simply to
comply with a suggestion of vague general interest. It has to be more
substantive than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will the team work and how quick can a response be? It seems that there
are three responses that the DPP could give when faced with a request
for a warrant. One is to say yes; one is to say no; and, one is not to
get round to it quickly enough, so that it does not matter. In the US,
that would be known as a pocket veto. I think that we would all be very
keen to say that, while we might accept that the DPP could have some
say, we do not want to see a default no, simply because the DPP did not
have enough time, or a large enough team—whichever process it
is—or had not looked early enough, to make a decision. I want
the Minister to confirm that the DPP will use best efforts to process
claims promptly, to avoid that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
we will need some way of monitoring the provision, because it is a
change. Will the Minister commit to a mechanism to report back on
cases, other than parliamentary questions, which would be an
alternative? The Government should report to Parliament, not on cases
that the DPP accepted or declined, but on cases on which he failed to
act fast enough for the situation to be settled sensibly, one way or
another. Can we have some way in which Parliament can have a look if,
whatever the size, structure or timeliness of the team, it is not able
to deliver a decision quickly enough? I hope that the Minister agrees
that, if that happened, we might need to revisit this and look at a
different process at some stage. That is all I have to say on the
amendment; I have further comments on the general principles, which we
will come to
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000046">&#160;</a>

Good morning, Mr Benton. I understand why the Opposition and my hon.

that these applications are dealt with in the most timely manner. It is

offences are serious, and the Government share the belief that those

Geneva Conventions

                           </div>Act 1957 and the few other offences over which the United Kingdom has
asserted universal jurisdiction can be issued on the application of a
private
prosecutor.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem that the clause is designed to solve arises out of three
things: the principle of universal jurisdiction, the right of private
prosecution and the basis on which the courts will issue an arrest
warrant. Universal jurisdiction enables certain offences—a very
small number—to be tried in the English courts even though the
crime took place outside the UK and regardless of the nationality or
residence of the offender. A private prosecution may be initiated for
any offence, including those attracting universal jurisdiction, if the
prosecutor can obtain a summons or warrant from a magistrates court,
and courts can issue an arrest warrant on the basis of far less
information than would be required for a prosecution to be allowed to
proceed. The upshot is that a person might be at risk of arrest in
cases where there is no prospect of a successful prosecution. This
might happen in relation to a very grave crime alleged to have been
committed outside the UK by a person who is not a British citizen, does
not live here and, indeed, has no connection with this country apart
from being present
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem is not that large numbers of warrants are being
issued—the Government are aware of only two—but in the
perception<em> </em>that visitors to this country might be at risk of
arrest. That such a perception exists is certain and it is not confined
to Israel, although the two instances in which an arrest warrant was
issued involved Israeli nationals. There are indications that some
people may not be prepared to visit the UK for fear of a private arrest
warrant being sought. We are concerned in particular that these may be
people who are, or have been, in leading positions in their countries,
with whom the Government would wish to engage in discussions. This is
unsatisfactory and risks damaging our ability to help in conflict
resolution and to pursue a coherent foreign
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
151 is a modest provision. All that it is designed to do is to ensure
that, in universal jurisdiction cases, a warrant is issued only where
there is a realistic prospect of a viable prosecution. The Opposition
canvassed a different proposal before the general election, when they
were in government, which removed the right of private prosecution
altogether—the previous Government also recognised, as the hon.
Gentleman has noted, that there was a problem. However, this proposal
does not go as far as to remove the right of private prosecution
altogether, nor does it, as some have alleged, interfere with universal
jurisdiction. It does not, as some have suggested, allow war criminals
to come to Britain with impunity. Any genuine war criminals who are
under that misapprehension might have a disagreeable surprise if they
put it to the test and the DPP, as we have just discussed, has
reaffirmed the seriousness with which these matters would be decided in
the public interest. Private individuals will still be able to apply
for a warrant, provided there is a realistic prospect of a viable
prosecution taking place. Suspects will also continue to be liable to
prosecution by the Crown Prosecution Service, which is likely to be
more appropriate for offences of such
gravity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
reiterate that the Government’s commitment to tackling grave
international crimes is something we take extremely seriously and we
are confident that the proposed change is entirely consistent with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000062">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that introduction; he was
right to start the debate on this important clause. We believe that it
is essential—as, indeed, do the Government and all members of
the Committee—to maintain universal jurisdiction so that, even
where a crime has been committed by someone outside one state, and even
where there is no link between the prosecuting state and the suspect,
the victim or the place of crime, prosecution is possible and, as I
have said, there is no hiding place for those who have committed some
of the worst crimes imaginable. This historical right has been seen as
an important constitutional safeguard against the failure of the
authorities to prosecute and, in that sense, we must do all we can to
protect it. We all agree that that is important. However, the proposed
change has been prompted by controversy over recent efforts by private
prosecutors to obtain arrest warrants in respect of foreign political
and military figures who have been visiting or, indeed, proposing to
visit the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the law stands, the arrest warrant can be made by the magistrate before
the consent to prosecute, which is required from the Attorney-General.
That has caused some controversy. The Justice Secretary told us in
November that in the past 10 years, 10 applications were made for
arrest warrants under universal jurisdiction, only two of which were
granted, as the Minister has said. I shall give some interesting
examples: in April 2002, an application by Peter Tatchell for the
arrest of Henry Kissinger was refused. His arrest was demanded on the
grounds of war crimes in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. In September 2005,
an application for an arrest warrant was granted against Major-General
Doron Almog, the former head of Israeli forces in the Gaza strip. He
avoided arrest, however, after his plane turned around after landing at
Heathrow airport and returned to Israel. The Minister alluded to the
case in December 2009 of Tzipi Livni, Israel’s former Foreign
Minister, who cancelled a visit to the UK after having an arrest
warrant issued against her. In response to those cases and others, the
then Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for South
Shields (David Miliband), said that the Government were looking at how
to avoid such situations in future. Now the coalition Government have
come forward with their own proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we said
before the election, the law should change to bring arrests into line
with prosecutions. The Government propose that the Director of Public
Prosecutions must give consent to an arrest warrant in the same way in
which the Attorney-General must give consent to a prosecution. The
proposal will not change the standards for prosecutions or reduce the
likelihood of a successful one. Cases that are strong enough to get the
go-ahead by the Attorney-General for prosecution should also get the
go-ahead from the DPP for arrest. Importantly, the proposal does not
prevent private citizens from applying for an arrest warrant, as the
Minister has said. It does, however, seek to address some of the
concerns that have been raised. Andrew Dismore, the former MP and Chair
of this House’s Joint Committee on Human Rights, has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Andrew
Dismore referred to the Attorney-General, and there was criticism that
that in itself would politicise the judicial process. The proposals,
which are better and more sensible, are for the decision to grant an
arrest warrant to be made not by the Attorney-General, who makes the
prosecution decision, but by the DPP, which is an important
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill does not prescribe, however, how the DPP should reach a decision
about whether to give consent. Which factors, such as the weight of
evidence or the likelihood of prosecution, should be taken into
account? Will the Minister comment on that? Will he confirm that the
changes will not weaken our ability to prosecute those who are guilty
of serious international crimes? Can he explain how the involvement of
the DPP will prevent international criminals having time to return home
and escape prosecution? It would be useful for the Minister to set out
why diplomatic immunity is not, in itself, a sufficient safeguard. Will
he confirm that the measure is not simply a consequence of lobbying
from the Israeli Government? Will he say how our system compares with
those of other countries, so that we have some context? What does he
expect in terms of the liaison between the Director of Public
Prosecutions and the
Attorney-General?<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the law should be changed so that private citizens can
secure an arrest warrant, even when there is no prospect of a
prosecution. We support the proposals to change the law to bring
arrangements for arrest more into line with those for prosecution.
However, it is extremely important that such changes do not reduce the
chances for successfully prosecuting those who have committed serious
international crimes. That is what people would expect, and that is
what they are concerned about. As the Bill goes through Parliament,
with this change in it, it is incumbent on us in Committee and on
Report, as it is incumbent on the other place, to ensure that those
concerns are addressed and that reassurance is
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000070">&#160;</a>

amendments, I am not persuaded that there is a need for a change. I do
not think that a sufficiently strong case has been made about why the
current system is not working. In 10 years, two warrants have been
granted and at least eight, perhaps more—of course, we do not
know the details—were rejected, which suggests that the system
is working quite well in filtering out claims that have no merit. The
case of Mr Tatchell was given as an example, and it was concluded that
the system seems to be functioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed, but we already have a process that
filters out the least meritorious. We have no idea what would have
happened to those two warrants if there had been a process involving
the Attorney-General or some other system. It is entirely possible that
they would have been granted in any case. I will come back to why it
does not address the concern that I think my hon. Friend is heading
towards. I do not think there is evidence to suggest that warrants have
been unreasonably issued. It is not clear that those two were issued in
cases in which the DPP would have said that they would not be. It is
hard to tell, because the DPP did not examine them, but it is not
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
has been a lot of talk in the press and among some lobby groups that a
person simply applies to a magistrate. That is rather unfair and
dismisses the role of the people who actually make the decision, which
is in the special jurisdiction of the senior district judge at
Westminster magistrates court, not a magistrate somewhere who happens
to be free on a Thursday evening. It is taken very seriously. Evidence
from Hickman and Rose cited one example in which there was a lot of
analysis and discussion. A lot of care and attention went into one
particular case that they dealt with, which shows that such cases are
handled
sensibly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a risk of people doing things purely for grandstanding. I accept
that grandstanding will happen, but I do not see how that changes
anything. If somebody wishes to pick—I will not pick on Mr
Tatchell—a case to get publicity, they will still be able to do
that. They will simply say that it has gone to the DPP, and they will
still be able to generate publicity. If they know that they have the
sort of case for which the senior district judge would not grant the
arrest warrant, they can still get the publicity in the meantime. The
measure does not solve that problem at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000075">&#160;</a>

with which the hon. Member for Cambridge speaks about the issue, but
one of my concerns is the use of selective cases. For example, the
arrest warrant is often used against Israeli politicians. There have
been many examples of its not being used. There is the example of a
former dictator in Pakistan who was accused of crushing political
opponents. He came to the United Kingdom to address the Cambridge
university students’ union. He came for a week and no one took
any notice of him. According to <em>The Times</em> in 1999, another
individual was suspected of supplying on an industrial scale most of
the machetes that were used in the Rwandan slaughter, and he stopped
over on holiday. Less high profile war criminals were also living here,
such as senior officials of Saddam Hussein’s
regime—<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000076">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point,
which is that the police are not doing a sufficient job. If one asked
Hickman and Rose, which deals with such cases, it would agree that the
police should be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 686<a class="bkMark" name="Column686">&#160;</a>
                           </div>doing the work wherever possible. He makes a good point for the police.
If there are serious cases—I do not know the details of the
cases to which he has referred, so I cannot comment on what the police
should be doing—the police should have resources to look at
them, which will be a better situation for us
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
problem with private prosecutions is that we cannot mandate that
private individuals should prosecute whomever we feel they ought to, so
I would have no problem with someone taking up a private prosecution,
if there is evidence but the police are not prepared to act. The hon.
Gentleman’s comments support my argument that the police should
do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the point made by the hon. Member for Northampton North, unless
there is a situation where it is not possible for an arrest warrant to
be granted—for example, in the case of a foreign dignitary who
has diplomatic immunity coming for some talks—there is still a
risk that people will face that when they come to Britain. He argued
that they face a risk and will be concerned about coming here, which
will continue to apply unless they know that there is a zero chance of
anything happening. I am concerned, because if that is the case, we are
not giving the DPP sufficient freedom and independence. If we give
those people some sort of assurance, I will be worried about the role
of the Attorney-General. I am sure that that is not what the Government
want to do, but if that is the case, they will always have that worry.
Unless people are absolutely sure that there is no evidence that could
lead to a successful prosecution, they will have that concern, so I do
not think the problem will be solved. Therefore, I am not persuaded
that there is a need for change. However, I have heard the comments,
and I accept the fact that a majority among Committee members, unless I
hear otherwise, believes that there is such a
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Several
methods of change have been proposed. The original one was to say,
“You cannot have any private prosecutions,” but that
would be a problem. Private prosecutions of any kind are rare in this
country, but it is important that they exist as a safeguard if, for
some reason, the police and the CPS do not go ahead—I think that
we agree that it is important to have private prosecutions as a safety
net.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The next
suggestion was that the decision should be made by the
Attorney-General. There is a logic to that, in the sense that it would
be the Attorney-General who would have to agree to continue the
prosecution, but it would mean that the decision would be taken at an
immediately political level. It would put an Attorney-General who
wanted to be fair in a very difficult position, and it would place the
law in the difficult position if the Attorney-General felt bound to do
whatever was in the Government’s best interest. I am pleased
that neither option has been proposed. The proposal in the Bill is the
least bad step, given that I do not see the need for change. I am still
concerned, as I believe that the case is unique—the DPP has said
that. There are no other examples where his consent is required for an
arrest, and of course, there are roles for people later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000082">&#160;</a>

will be interested to listen to the Minister’s response to the
suggestion by Shami Chakrabarti from Liberty to put the DPP on notice,
which I believe is the situation in a number of other
countries—or a rough equivalent, as not all legal systems
fit—where the DPP is told of the arrest happening and has the
ability to step in. That

                           </div>would remove my concern about a pocket veto, where the DPP just does not
get round to acting fast enough. I am interested to hear from the
Minister why that cannot be done. Although Mr Starmer was careful to
neither support nor oppose the changes, he seemed open to the
suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000083">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to clarify some of my earlier points. I am sure that the Minister
will correct me if I have misunderstood the Government’s
position, and I would be grateful if he did so. He confirmed that the
Government’s opinion is that the DPP should take evidence and
process it ahead of an application. If that is the Government’s
position, it is welcome—again, I look to the Minister to correct
me if I am wrong. We have already heard that the DPP will have a team
ready. The Minister did not comment on the idea that the threshold test
should be used when time is short. I would be grateful if he were to
confirm that the Government intend that, where time is tight, the
threshold test would be used as Mr Starmer
outlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has commented on the powerful weight in favour of prosecuting
such cases, and I thank him for that, because it is an important
safeguard against over-politicisation of the process. I would like
confirmation that the Government intend that the DPP should not wait
too long. We must avoid the pocket veto situation, and we want a yes or
a no from the DPP within the time frames available. Again, I hope that
that is the Government’s intention and, if I am wrong, I hope
that the Minister will correct
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000085">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister support a mechanism to report back on cases when the DPP
does not act fast enough? That does not mean that it will be the
DPP’s fault—he might have been given insufficient
evidence or too much evidence, too late, that he cannot consider.
However, it would be helpful to know of cases when he did not make such
a decision. If he were to say, “There is no evidence
here,” I would have no problem. I am interested in cases when he
has not got around to looking at matters. I hope that the Minister will
respond to the specific issues that I have raised. I take from his
silence so far that I have understood clearly what he has
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000086">&#160;</a>

am not wild about the change, because I do not see the need for it. I
accept the mood of members of the Committee who feel that we should go
there. It is the lowest step, and I am mollified by the approach of
Mr Starmer. The change will not do much damage to our
ability to prosecute such cases. I hope that it will work out. We shall
have to keep an eye on whether it does work or whether it hinders our
abilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000087">&#160;</a>

to me by members of the Committee. First, the hon. Member for Gedling
asked how the decision would be taken. The public interest factors that
the DPP will consider are a matter for him. He made it 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>clear in his evidence session that the factors are clearly set out in
the code, and he explained how he would attempt to reach a judgment. I
shall not elaborate on anything further that the DPP said at the time,
because he set out his views quite clearly so it would be wrong for me
to attempt to do so. The code is available for anyone who wishes to see
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will my right hon. Friend confirm the fact that we
already entrust the DPP with discretion in several other
areas?<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> I am happy to confirm that. It is why we ask the
DPP to exercise his judgment according to the principles that are set
out and to act in the public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the hon. Member for Gedling asked me to confirm that the proposals will
not weaken the ability to bring to justice people who are alleged to
have committed the most serious crimes. I discussed that matter in
relation to an earlier amendment, but I repeat that the clause will not
remove the right of private prosecution. It does not interfere with the
offences of universal jurisdiction, and private individuals will still
be able to apply for a warrant. There is no intention to weaken the
ability to bring criminals to justice, when they have committed very
serious crimes. All we are saying is that there should be a realistic
prospect of a viable prosecution taking place. The hon. Gentleman and
other members of the Committee have set out why that might not happen
under the current
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the time taken, a matter which we dealt with
in an earlier debate to everyone’s satisfaction. I repeat that
the DPP said in his evidence that he would act as quickly as he could.
Diplomatic immunity would not help all concerned who might be the
subject of warrants because serving Heads of State, Governments and
Ministers of Foreign Affairs have immunity from criminal jurisdiction.
Immunity can attach to other senior Ministers who travel by virtue of
their office, but it does not extend to all Ministers, and warrants
have been served against persons who are not serving Ministers,
including Members of Parliaments in other
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the position of Israel, and he asked
specifically for an assurance that this is not a measure that simply
responds to the concerns of the Israeli Government. I can confirm that
the question of arrest warrants for universal jurisdiction offences has
been under review for a considerable period—he noted that it was
under review by the previous Government—and the Government have
repeatedly made clear our commitment to addressing existing anomalies.
He also pointed out that Henry Kissinger was subject to an attempt to
issue a
warrant.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about systems in other countries. It is true that
other countries with legal systems similar to our own allow private
prosecutions—Australia, Canada and New Zealand—but we are
not aware that other countries have the same problem as we do in
respect of the ability to issue warrants and the lower threshold, as a
consequence, that has to be met in order for the warrant to be issued,
which is the whole basis of our concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
hon. Gentleman asked about liaison with the Attorney-General. That was
also covered in the DPP’s oral evidence to the Committee, when a
number of us probed that quite carefully. The DPP and the
Attorney-General will each have distinct legal functions in respect of
the case, and the conventions according to which they carry them out in
relation to one another are, in general terms, articulated in a
protocol published in July 2009. If the Attorney-General’s
consent is requested, it is likely, although not inevitable, that that
request would be made after the DPP has taken his own independent
decision in the way he described to the Committee. There may well be
further evidence, or other relevant information or representations
before the Attorney-General, which may not be available at the time
that the DPP is considering the case. The DPP was at pains to point out
that his office was independent and that he would take the decision
independently, albeit with the normal
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000097">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just to reiterate, this issue is extremely
important. The hon. Member for Cambridge raised the point, which the
Minister rightly pointed out came up in the evidence sessions, so the
independence of the DPP vis-à-vis the Attorney-General is
important. Clearly, people do not want the Attorney-General to take the
decision to agree the arrest warrant, because of concerns about the
politicisation of the process. People are seeking the reassurance that,
although it is the DPP who gives consent to the arrest warrant being
granted, the Attorney-General cannot influence it through discussions
that may take place. The protocol and the points that the Minister has
raised—and, indeed, that the DPP made in the evidence
sessions—are extremely important, so that people are aware that
the Government are seeking to do all they can to maintain the integrity
and independence of that DPP
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000098">&#160;</a>

reviewable, so if it is not taken properly it can be exposed in the

timing issue, but it is one of the safeguards that ensure that

My hon. Friend conceded that there is a risk of grandstanding, but went
on to say that under the arrangements the pressure groups could still

that the arguments could be put to the magistrate. The DPP has not

                           </strong> The Government new clause and the Government new
schedule amend relevant provisions in previous legislation to bring
them in line with the changes contained in the Bill. They insert a
replacement clause 99, giving effect to a replacement
schedule 15. I will explain to the Committee why we need to make these
changes at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee knows, we are abolishing police authorities in England
and Wales, including the Metropolitan Police Authority, and replacing
them with police and crime commissioners and, in London, the
Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. As a consequence, we have
to change all the references to police authorities in Acts of
Parliament affecting England and Wales. There are well over 500 of
these references in all. Some of them are being changed by the main
provisions of the Bill, which we have already debated, but others are
of less significance and fall to be dealt with as consequential
amendments. Some of this work was done prior to introduction and was
reflected in the original schedule 15, but there was not time prior to
introduction to make all the necessary amendments. That is why we now
wish to substitute a new and complete schedule 15 now, which contains
all the necessary consequential
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have debated all the substantive points in relation to police and crime
commissioners already, during our consideration of the main clauses of
the Bill. There is nothing further in these amendments that I believe
is of particular note or controversy. In the majority of cases they
simply replace references to police authorities, references to police
and crime commissioners, to the Mayor’s Office for Policing and
Crime and to the Common Council of the City of London in its capacity
as a police authority. Where it is necessary to include all three, a
reference to local policing bodies is substituted. In a few cases, the
reference to a police authority is replaced by a reference to the chief
officer of police, because the legislation in question concerns police
staff who are going to be employed by chief officers in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will draw
attention to some of the additions. Paragraphs 135 and 386
of new schedule 3 deal with the Race Relations Act 1976 and the
Equality Act 2010 respectively. Inserting references to police and
crime commissioners and the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime
ensures that those bodies will be subject to the same equalities duties
as police authorities are now. Paragraphs 332 to 336 deal with the
Children Act 2004 and ensure that PCCs will have the same
responsibilities to promote and safeguard the welfare of children as
police authorities do
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000129">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> New clause 12 relates to new provisions to deal
with police complaints. The police complaints system is an important
safeguard in holding the police to account. The focus of the system
should be to allow people who are dissatisfied with the provision of a
policing service to make a complaint, and for that complaint to be
appropriately dealt with. The Independent Police Complaints Commission,
as guardian of the system, conducted a review following four years of
operational experience which found that the statutory provisions for
the handling of complaints included some processes that are either no
longer necessary or are unnecessarily bureaucratic, which can go
against the effective handling of complaints. New clause 12 is a result
of that review. The changes will make the police complaints system more
effective and efficient. They will afford additional discretion to the
police service to deal with low-level complaints, with the focus on
dealing with the complainant’s dissatisfaction, rather than on
bureaucratic
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the specifics of the changes, we intend to allow the IPCC greater
flexibility in carrying out its functions. The minimum number of
commissioners required in the IPCC will be reduced from 10 to five, and
the IPCC will no longer require the consent of the Secretary of State
for the delegation of its functions. The changes will remove the
provision that currently excludes complaints relating to the direction
and control of a force from being handled in the police complaints
system. Currently those complaints are dealt with under a parallel
process of informal resolution governed by Home Office guidance. We are
also changing the definition of the conduct that can be the subject of
a complaint, making it clear that decisions, as well as acts, omissions
and statements, are included.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000140">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The changes
will simplify the process for complainants by ensuring that all matters
of concern about the standard of service provided by the police are
addressed within a single system. Complaints of a nature set out in
regulations, such as those that are vexatious or an abuse of the
complaints system, will no longer have to be recorded by the police.
That will remove the bureaucratic process that requires police forces
to record complaints and then apply to the IPCC to dispense with
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Low-level
complaints, described by the IPCC as relating to police officers being
rude and late, will be the responsibility of police forces, which will
have the flexibility to determine how best to respond to the complaint,
whether by investigation or by other methods such as mediation. A
complainant will have a right of appeal to the chief constable. Police
and crime commissioners will be able to ensure that chief constables
have fulfilled their duty in the handling of such
complaints.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000142">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Do I understand that the Minister intends to
introduce regulations to identify what is meant by low-level
complaints? Clearly, if someone is being rude, the police should not
necessarily always have to send that matter to the IPCC—that is
a sensible change—but where is the line
drawn?<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It will be determined in regulations. That is my
understanding. I emphasise that police and crime commissioners will
also have a role, which is another reason for the new clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Commissioners
will have the same responsibility that police authorities have now to
keep themselves informed about the handling of complaints, but they
will also have an additional power to direct chief constables to take
action in case of a failure to deal with a complaint appropriately. I
do not wish to set up an entirely new complaints machinery in the
office of the police and crime commissioner, as that would be an
unwelcome duplication. However, we think that police and crime
commissioners should have a role in ensuring that low-level complaints
are dealt with properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In cases
where a complaint reveals that a police officer’s performance is
unsatisfactory, the IPCC will have the power to recommend and direct
that unsatisfactory performance proceedings be brought against them,
which is the same power that the IPCC has in respect of misconduct
matters. The IPCC will retain its oversight of the whole system and
direct involvement in dealing with the most serious complaints. It will
continue to have the power to call in any complaint that it determines
should be referred to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000146">&#160;</a>

measures will improve the handling of police complaints by removing
bureaucratic processes from the system and ensuring a focus on dealing
with the complainant’s concern. Committee members may note that

that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I did so to give him a bit
more time to consider before Report whether he is happy with the
proposals, and perhaps to discuss them with the IPCC. I believe that

                           </strong> The Minister was right to put the schedule to the
Committee in the way he did so that we could consider it. To be fair, I
need to look at it in a lot more detail myself and to go through all
the different points. I have been in touch with the IPCC, and it is
satisfied with the Minister’s proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is some
scope for discussion. As always, the devil is in the detail, which is
why, as the Minister rightly said, the document will say in a couple of
places that the provisions are subject to further regulations. The big
issue is what counts as a low-level complaint. That is not easy to
define, and it is even difficult in regulations; sometimes, it is a
matter of professional discretion. At one level, it is easy to say that
these things should not involve a huge amount of bureaucracy and time,
with things going up to the IPCC and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
always scope for those involved in a complaints procedure to see what
they can do to sift out vexatious or trivial complaints, or complaints
that could be dealt with by someone asking, “Can’t you
say sorry?” That is not to trivialise people’s
complaints, but people do not always want millions of pounds of
compensation or for others to be dragged through the courts and sacked;
they just want someone to listen to their problem, to act on it and, if
necessary, to issue an apology. Of course, there are times when that is
not appropriate, and more serious action must be pursued. In some
circumstances, however, that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister say a little more about what role he sees for the police and
crime commissioner in the complaints process? Some of this will come
out later, but what complaints do we envisage going to the police and
crime commissioner? The chief constable is responsible for operational
matters. If somebody complains about an operational matter that they
feel a police officer has got wrong, we would automatically assume that
that would initially be a matter for the line manager of the sergeant,
inspector or superintendent involved. Obviously, if the matter is
serious and it is not resolved, it will go up the tree to the chief
constable. What sort of complaints does the Minister envisage going to
the police and crime commissioner? Not operational matters? Some
operational matters? If so, which ones? There is a lack of clarity
about what the provisions mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, people have the right to take a complaint to the IPCC. I
apologise if this is in the Bill and I have not seen it, but is the
ability to make such complaints still available to an individual? Does
the new schedule retain the right for somebody to take a complaint
about policing in their area to the IPCC for it to consider?<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
schedule also gives the IPCC a new power to direct unsatisfactory
performance procedures. Will the Minister say a little about what
powers he envisages the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 696<a class="bkMark" name="Column696">&#160;</a>
                           </div>IPCC having to direct such procedures? Why is that change included? My
understanding is that the IPCC does not have that power at the moment,
but the new schedule includes such a power. There is always an issue
about performance, but we are talking about complaints about
performance, rather than performance itself. Again, I would like some
clarification of that issue. As regards the membership of the IPCC, the
Minister referred to the number five, and my understanding is that that
is a minimum, not a maximum. It is not that there will be five
commissioners, but that there can be five or more.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With those
few questions, which begin to address the more detailed issues, I will
leave it there. The Minister is right to try to make the system less
bureaucratic and easier, but the provision relates to the fundamental
rights of people to be able to complain about the police, and to have
an independent body to look at that. There is a lack of clarity about
the role of the PCC, and I would like the Minister to say more about
that. The issue of what constitutes low level is extremely
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000156">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because
those are important matters, and the provisions will slightly change
the system, so it is important that we all understand how it will work.
I am due to write to him about several issues, and I am happy
to do so before Report to set out how the new system will work for each
type of complaint, so that he can see how it will work and that we can
all be satisfied that it will deal with complaints in the right
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the issue of low-level
complaints. There were 31,259 complaints recorded by police authorities
in England and Wales in 2008-09, of which 41% were dealt with by local
resolution. The vast majority of complaints fell into two
categories—21% under incivility, impoliteness and intolerance,
and 24% under other neglect or failure in duty. There should be
capacity to deal with those kinds of complaints, which are important to
members of the public, but are not the result of misconduct and need to
be investigated at a different level. Such complaints should be dealt
with by the organisation through local resolution, while ensuring that
there is a right of appeal to the chief constable if the complainant is
not
happy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
brings two matters into question. First, is the right to go to the IPCC
still available? The answer is yes. Secondly, what is the role of the
police and crime commissioner? I have considered that matter carefully,
because one question I asked myself was whether the PCC should take
responsibility for low-level complaints, although the IPCC would remain
in charge of issues relating to misconduct. I concluded that the
problem was, as I have said, that we would have to set up an entire
complaints machinery in each PCC’s office, which would duplicate
the complaints machinery in each
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is better that PCCs have oversight, as they will be under a duty to
keep abreast of all of their force’s activities. They will focus
primarily on the direction and control of the force, but we will give
them a specific power to direct chief constables to take action on
complaints, where there has been a failure to deal appropriately with a
complaint. That is an additional safeguard so that, where an appeal has
gone to a chief constable and someone is unhappy, there is oversight on

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 697<a class="bkMark" name="Column697">&#160;</a>
                           </div>how that matter has been dealt with. Of course, the PCC has a particular
role on complaints against the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that we have arrived at a sensible balance. To some extent, the
situation will evolve, depending on how far people address future
complaints to the PCC rather than to the force, although that might
still result in the complaint being handed to the force, and the PCC
wanting to be certain that it has been appropriately dealt with. In
general terms, the deputy mayor for policing in London said that when
the change in arrangements was made in London, there was a big increase
in the volume of correspondence received by the Mayor as that position
became more visible in relation to policing. That is not the same as
saying that they should have formal responsibility for a complaints
procedure. We want to avoid unnecessary
duplication.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be happy to write to the hon. Member for Gedling, setting out in
a little more detail a map of procedures on different complaints that
shows how we can be sure that we are not unintentionally creating any
kind of lacuna or fettering the right of complaint. I do not believe
that we are, and the IPCC would have told me and the hon. Gentleman if
that had been the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that explanation. It
would be helpful if he wrote to me, and copied the letter to other
Committee members, showing how the new schedule would work. It is a
fact of life that schedules have a lot of the detail. There is an
enabling clause, with a related schedule with pages of detail. That
detail is extremely important. While everyone would want the complaints
procedure to become less bureaucratic, in a democracy it is important
in maintaining confidence in the police and ensuring that they are
accountable in the way that we would all want—I know the
Minister agrees with that. If he set out some of the issues that I have
raised—dealing with vexatious complaints; what “low
level” means; and some of the processes involved—that
would be extremely
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000163">&#160;</a>

Minister should consider further what the role of the PCC will be. I
accept that we do not want to set up 43 mini IPCCs or whatever around
the country, attached to the PCC’s office, duplicating the role
of the IPCC. The Minister said that he envisages a role for the police
and crime commissioner. That is fine, but people reading our
proceedings and people seeking to implement the legislation need to
know a little more about what that role is, particularly when it comes
to matters of operational independence, which we will come to later. It
is about

know that there are measures on misconduct, but if that role is
blurred, there will be a problem. I will leave it there, but the

difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11021761000164">&#160;</a>
