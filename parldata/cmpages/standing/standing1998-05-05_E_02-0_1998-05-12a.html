<P>
(Except Clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147) <P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is customary to ask the Chair for permission to remove jackets. As it is very warm, I have no objection to hon. Members doing so, but I should appreciate being asked in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. You are aware that the question of regulations has come up already in our proceedings and that many of the tax provisions are not detailed in the Bill but are to be published subsequently as regulations.
<P>
We hope later this week to reach an important section of the Bill concerning corporation tax and, in particular, clause 32 and schedule 4, which is founded on clause 5. Both those clauses refer to regulations that will be published by the Government. I seek through you, Mr. Butterfill, an assurance that those regulations have been published in draft form and should, therefore, be available to the Committee. It would be out of the question for us to consider clauses without the necessary information on the regulations.
<P>
Further to that, Mr. Butterfill, I seek your guidance on whether it would be possible for us to consider the clauses without the regulations being available.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and we shall look into that. It is really a matter for the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. The hon. Gentleman did not give me notice of this specific point, but I shall make inquiries and, before we break for lunch, I shall, with your permission, give the Committee information about the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Further to that point of order. Mr. Butterfill. I am grateful for the Financial Secretary's interest in this matter, but I did give notice of my question in the order of consideration motion. I and a number of my hon. Friends referred specifically to the fact that the regulations were not available. I asked for the courtesy of being sent draft regulations, which we understand have been placed in the Library. That has not been done, but perhaps that is administratively difficult for the Treasury at present. However, this is a separate point about whether regulations are available to anyone, in the Library or outside. It would have been possible to amend the order of consideration motion and put the clauses further back in the Bill, to ensure that the regulations were available by the time we reached them.
<P>
Therefore, we have given notice and we urgently require an answer. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary could make immediate and urgent inquiries and perhaps inform the Committee about it before the lunch break, because it will colour our attitude to the clauses that we are considering today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. You will be aware that, following the publication of the Finance Bill, the timetable for this Committee has been extremely tight. Tax practitioners and others have had very little time to consider the Bill. If the information, particularly relating to secondary legislation, is not published, it is very difficult to make the appropriate representations to improve the Bill.
<P>
As you will be aware, Mr. Butterfill, some 20 clauses involve major chunks of secondary legislation, and it is intolerable if the information cannot be published in reasonable time. As a courtesy to the Committee, will the Financial Secretary give urgent consideration to when the information will be published, so that the Committee can do its work properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Is it not the case that the previous Government included many provisions in Finance Bills to allow for regulation? Is it not also the case that draft regulations were often not available for discussion by Finance Bill Committees?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I should like to clarify what we want. We are asking not for the regulations but for the draft regulations. We are not simply seeking information; we want a commitment from the Minister that the draft regulations will be made available in advance of our discussion of that clause. We are not asking her to discover what is going on but to take charge of what is going on and to give the Committee a commitment that we will have the draft regulations before we discuss the clause on Thursday.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. The order of consideration of the clauses was agreed through the usual channels. It was debated last week and agreed by the Committee. The timetable for publishing the Finance Bill followed the normal practice. It was not rushed. Hon. Members have asked specifically about the availability of draft regulations and I have undertaken to ensure that the Committee is told before lunch when the regulations will be available. Hon. Members can make as many points of order as they like, but I am unable to and will not take the Committee any further at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it on the same matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that we have had enough on that subject.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty on wine and made-wine</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, [5 May], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): The Government would not expect me to let this part of the Finance Bill go by without referring to the plight of the English wine industry and, yet again, the discriminatory nature of the proposals. Your predecessors, Mr. Butterfill, will recall that last year we debated at length various subjects, including English wine brands such as Breaky Bottom. The Economic Secretary even chipped in with her own contribution about Irn-Bru. However, last week's reference to Lambrini bianco by Liberal Democrat Members surpassed that.
<P>
The matter is especially important this year because last year, when I mentioned the discriminatory nature of excise duty on wine and the way in which it affects the English wine industry, I referred to Lamberhurst Priory in Kent, one of the pioneering vineyards in the revival of the English wine industry. Since last year, the Lamberhurst vineyard one of the largest and oldest vineyards in this country has gone bust. It cites as a major contributory reason for its demise the high level of duty charged on wine, which set it at a disadvantage to foreign-made wines and imported wines from the continent. It is extraordinary that some clauses will give preferential treatment to British industries such as the Scotch whisky industry while the English wine industry is left completely to the devices of competition with producers on the continent who get much more favourable treatment on duty.
<P>
I shall give some examples of how continental countries treat their wine industries. In the United Kingdom, the typical duty on a litre of still table wine up to a strength of 22 per cent. is £1.44 which, in continental terms, is 1.75 ecu. In France, the duty on a litre of wine is the equivalent of just threepence, or 0.039 ecu. In Germany, the duty is nil, or nil ecu. In Austria, it is nil; in Italy, it is nil; and in Portugal, it is nil. Yet in this country we charge about £1.40 a litre, whether it is an English wine that is produced, grown and bottled in this country or whether it is imported from France, Germany, Austria or Italy. Some French wines sell for less than the duty charged on a bottle of wine in England. That cannot be fair competition. Yet spirits are certainly not banded at nil value in their continental partner countries. In France, typical duty on a litre of Scotch is £3.78, and in Germany it is £3.43. Only the wine industry is treated favourably by all the other continental Governments who have domestic wine industries. So there is an unlevel playing field and I fear that this provision in the Finance Bill, yet again this year, does absolutely nothing to level that playing field. This is a double whammy, a move against the English domestic wine industry, which increasingly harms the UK wine market.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Witney (Mr. Woodward) and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) spelt out in detail the absurdity of the situation; the bought-in-France, drunk-in-Britain trend is reducing the amount of revenue going to the Treasury and, at the same time, giving unfair competition advantage to our partners on the continent. That was why the last Government froze duty on wine in 1995 we saw it as a diminishing return to the Revenue, which was counterproductive. Since then, there has been a reduction in the official level of wine consumption in the UK. So the clause will be harmful to the trade, harmful to the pubs and clubs that sell wine and contribute £11 billion per annum to the Exchequer, and certainly harmful to English wine producers.
<P>
Why are the Government singling out wine, particularly English wine, for unfair treatment? Is wine drinking too popular? Official figures show that the consumption of wine has been declining compared with consumption of other alcoholic beverages during the past few years. Consumption of wine per head in France is a lofty 62.5 litres a year. In Italy, it is 52 litres and in Portugal, 52.5 litres. Even in Austria, where they add curious substances to their wine, consumption totals 31 litres a year, but in the UK, only 14.7 litres of wine are drunk roughly a quarter of the equivalent wine consumption in France.
<P>
The UK wine industry should be encouraged, and wine drinking is a form of alcoholic consumption that should be encouraged. It is the only natural alcoholic drink, which does not require a heated fermentation process or distilling. It has health-giving properties, as we are frequently told by medical reports. To back that up, a recent survey of deaths from liver cirrhosis on the continent showed that, in deaths per 100,000 of the population, the top country was Austria with 29 out of 100,000 probably due to what they put in their alcoholic drinks. In Portugal, there were 27.2 deaths per 100,000 and in Italy, 26.6. But in England and Wales, only 5.6 deaths per 100,000 were caused by alcohol. So deaths as a result of liver cirrhosis in this country are well below average, and we can afford to allow them to increase a little without having a major health hazard.
<P>
Lest Labour Members are surprised at that information, I should add that the figures for Scotland are not quite such good news. In Scotland, the figure is almost double that in England and Wales 9.3 deaths per 100,000 of the population caused by liver cirrhosis but of course they do drink other things apart from wine in Scotland. Indeed, the manufacture of Irn-Bru, in the constituency of the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, may be a contributory cause.
<P>
If wine drinking is not a health hazard, does it contribute towards crime and disorder? Again, the research would suggest not. In this country, we have the highest level of non-abstainers from alcohol 89.5 per cent. in the western world. In Germany, 86 per cent. of the population are non-abstainers; in Spain, the figure is 85 per cent.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
British people therefore do drink, but they do not drink enough wine. A survey by the Finnish Alcohol Monopoly Committee found a significant link between strong alcohol and arrests for drunkenness. At the time of that survey, arrests for drunkenness caused by the imbibing of spirits numbered 91,002. Only 17,610 people were arrested for drunkenness caused by wine. The vast majority of those who get drunk and who are a menace therefore imbibe heavy spirits, not wine. Indeed, the number of arrests per kilolitre of alcohol has declined by approximately 50 per cent. since 1979.
<P>
Wine drinkers are sensible, well-behaved members of society. The clause will penalise them further by locking in an index-linked rise in the level of duty on wine. If we want to use taxation to fashion people's social drinking habits, wine is the wrong candidate. Drunken teenagers who swagger along with a bottle of Chablis, Puligny Montrachet, or an entertaining little Beaujolais, are rarely to be seen on the streets of Worthing. Wine is not the cause of crime and disorder in this country.
<P>
I fear that the clause will further promote the bought-in-France, drunk-in-Britain trend to which smuggling and unhealthily high duty levels in this country have given rise.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I think that my hon. Friend may be reaching the end of his peroration. Like me, he has a vineyard in his constituency. Does he agree that, given the right fiscal encouragement, English vineyards could flourish in our increasingly warm climate? They are particularly important to rural constituencies because they provide much-needed employment. For the capital and land area involved, vineyards create considerably more jobs than similar agricultural industries. Viticulture is therefore precisely the type of industry that should be encouraged in rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Because of the complete failure of the Government's environmental tax strategy which we shall consider when we debate later clauses  the problem of global warming will not improve. As a result, our climate will get warmer and the English vineyard industry will be a beneficiary of that problem. Vineyards are able increasingly to set up in the north of Enland one day they may even reach Scotland. It would be interesting to taste wine produced there.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold is also right when he says that the English vineyard industry not only produces wine but is a major employer in the countryside. It is also a major contributor to the tourist industry and to education tourists visit vineyards to see how wine is made, as do school children.
<P>
My hon. Friend further rightly notes that vineyards have to employ more people because factors such as our climate make it harder and more expensive for vineyards to flourish in this country. The vineyard industry is therefore an increasingly major contributor to employment in the countryside.
<P>
The Government's refusal to give some degree of preferential treatment to the English wine industry is nonsensical. With a rate of duty of 140p per litre, compared to zero in Germany and zero in Italy, the English vineyard industry is subject to unfair competition. The clause will further harm that industry, and the wine trade in general, because it will contribute to the smugglers charter, which is becoming the Government's whole approach to alcohol, tobacco and other duty-liable imports from the continent. As we said, in terms of raising revenue for the Exchequer, the proposal is self-defeating. It also discriminates against wine, which is the most natural of alcoholic drinks.
<P>
The clause is a stab in the back for the English wine industry and for flourishing vineyards such as Breaky Bottom, which, I am glad to say, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury enjoyed last year when she imbibed the brew. The clause is also damaging to the English wine trade and the employment that goes with it. For those reasons, I oppose the proposal to index the duty on table wine.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, because my colleagues have advanced an extremely powerful case to which I have little to add. I endorse, in particular, the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton): I, too, have a vineyard in my constituency New Hall in Purleigh whose representatives would want me to say that they wholly endorse my hon. Friend's remarks about the plight that the proposed imbalance in duty represents for English wine-makers.
<P>
I am tempted to make a brief contribution because I heard a Labour Member mutter that the wine trade was the free market in operation. Conservative Members who support free enterprise and believe in markets wish that that were the case. The problem is that the free market is being prevented from working. Those of us who are sceptical about the drive to harmonise everything across the continent have always felt that harmonisation by Governments is largely unnecessary because the market will produce harmonisation.
<P>
The wine trade is a perfect example of the free market at work. Consumers in this country who are faced with higher prices naturally go across to the continent, where they enjoy lower prices. If the market were allowed to respond, there would be a steady equalisation of the price differential. The problem is that the Government have imposed an artificial barrier, which has introduced total rigidity into the price mechanism. The only way to remove that is for the Government to recognise that they are causing the difficulty and to try to move towards greater equalisation.
<P>
Last year in Committee we discussed the proposal in considerable depth, and I shall not repeat the whole debate that we had then. However, the most up-to-date figures that I quoted in that debate showed that the typical private car that crosses from France contained on average 26 bottles of wine in 1993, and 80 bottles of wine in 1996, which would leave barely enough room in the car for any passengers. Since those figures relate to the average car, many cars will carry more than 80 bottles.
<P>
The number of vehicles not bringing alcohol from France to this country was one in four in 1993, but that has fallen to one in 50 in 1996. I happen to have December's figures the latest that are available for clearances in this country of alcoholic drinks. They show that in that month there were substantial further falls in all drink categories fortified wines fell by[Mr. John Whittingdale]
15.6 per cent. and still wines fell by 1.5 per cent., which is a drop of 1.9 million bottles. At the same time, there was an enormous increase in the number of people who travel to France in December 2 million people made the return journey to France from Dover, 600,000 more than a year previously. There has been a steady rise in the number of people who travel to France and in the number of bottles being brought back from France, and there has been a steady fall in the number of bottles of wine that are sold in this country. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the problem is enormous and that it is getting worse. For that reason, I implore the Financial Secretary to consider, even at this late hour, whether something could be done.
<P>
I have so far spoken only about the entirely legitimate activity of bringing wine back from France for private use. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) described the problem of smuggling which is a more serious matter and the introduction of quite serious organised crime into that trade. I invite the Financial Secretary to come with me, on any weekend, to a car boot sale in my constituency in Essex this may be an irresistible offer. Essex is in many ways the mecca of car boot sales, and in many ways I am an admirer of those who give up their Sundays to carry out small-scale trading in a field off a motorway in Essex. However, they are no longer just car boot or garage sales those who visit them will find enormous pantechnicons stocked with illegally imported alcohol. That is becoming a substantial problem, which is hitting every retailer in my constituency and in most of south-east England.
<P>
I shall finish by telling an anecdote that I heard from Lay and Wheeler, which is a substantial wine merchant based in my constituency and has a fine reputation in the world of wine. It has had long-standing trading arrangements with restaurants and other outlets in the vicinity, many of which have suddenly decided not to renew their orders. In one or two cases, those outlets might have found an alternative supplier offering them a better deal, but I do not believe that that can be so in all the many cases being reported. I am afraid that the truth is that some restaurants and retailers are using supplies smuggled from the continent because they have reluctantly drawn the conclusion in light of the competition they already face that they must do so to remain competitive.
<P>
The Financial Secretary must rapidly complete her investigation into the problem of smuggling, publish it and take action upon it. The problem is not going to go away, and unless it is dealt with now, we will return here in a year to have this debate again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I will not speak at length because the subject has been well covered by my hon. Friends.
<P>
My constituency has a number of vineyards which operate on the edge of what is technically and commercially feasible. They could, therefore, do without the additional handicap of high rates of duty, which make cross-border shopping and smuggling so attractive.
<P>
In earlier debates, the Financial Secretary told us that the problem of cross-border shopping and the associated but separate phenomenon of smuggling is both high and rising. In other words, not only has a huge new industry been created in Calais but it is becoming more successful year on year. Such illegality is a serious law and order issue, which the Government should take seriously. They, after all, invented the phrase, "Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime." They should understand that it is not good enough to deal with the symptoms by trying to stop smuggling or bootlegging at the frontier or at the point of sale. Instead, they should deal with the root cause the persistent imbalance between rates of duty in the United Kingdom and on the continent, which the Conservative Government had started to erode. Despite our budget deficit, we froze alcohol duty and cut duty on spirits. The Government have reversed that policy, which coupled with the strength of the pound is making a bad situation worse.
<P>
I should like the Financial Secretary to answer two questions relating to earlier promises made by the Government on this matter. First, do the Government intend to deliver on a promise made by the Prime Minister on 1 May last year when he was still Leader of the Opposition it was before the announcement of the election result? He said there should be an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"urgent, independent and comprehensive study"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of this issue. He made that explicit and unambiguous promise before he was elected. He is now in a position to deliver on it. Can the Financial Secretary say whether that promise still holds and when the Government will honour it?
<P>
Secondly, will we see the study already completed by Customs and Excise? It was ready at the end of last year. We have been given a lot of excuses about why we do not have a right to know what is in it, despite the wonderful White Paper from which we keep quoting called "Your Right to Know", which contains all sorts of rash statements about openness and the public's right to know. Could we start in a modest way by having sight or at least a promise that it will be published of the study completed last year by the Government into this issue, which is of growing public concern?
<P>
With those two questions, I eagerly await the Financial Secretary's reply to the debate.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As always, the debates on clauses relating to excise duty on alcohol settle on a number of important issues in addition to the increase in duty. I shall deal first with some of the specific questions and then return to the important issues raised by a number of Opposition Members about smuggling and the Government's attitude to combating it.
<P>
I shall decline the offer of the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) to look at car boot sales in Essex not very exotic. Like a number of other hon. Members he made an important point about the availability of smuggled goods and he then referred to clearances of alcohol. He gave the Committee a snapshot of the December figures, but it can be a little misleading to look at only a snapshot. Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman by saying that clearances for wine over the entire year 1996-97, which are the accurate figures, show a considerable increase on those for 1995-96. The whole-year figures show that wine clearances continue to be buoyant.
<P>
In the hon. Gentleman's concluding remarks, he used an anecdote about restaurants. The Committee would expect to hear that the Government take such possibilities seriously. Indeed, the Government's announcement about offences and likely charges did not relate only to those who smuggle the goods and those involved in planning the large-scale activities that the hon. Gentleman describes. If restauranteurs and licensees are prosecuted for selling smuggled goods, there will be further investigations, and their licences, and thus their ability to trade, may be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may finish the point, I shall then give way.
<P>
The Government have made their attitude to sentencing clear. We shall pursue the criminal activity of smuggling with as much energy as we can. We were encouraged by a recent judgment by Lord Chief Justice Rose, who issued judgment guidelines for offences of this type, noting the type of offence, the loss of revenue, the social problems connected with the widespread availability of smuggled goods and the effect on legitimate traders. The guidelines clearly follow the Government's strategy over the past year. He set out sentencing guidelines that courts should bear in mind, together with other factors, when they deal with duty evasion. Courts should take into account the playing of an organisational role, repeated importations, continuing to smuggle after being stopped by Customs and importing more than one type of product. The guidelines reinforce the Government's action on the confiscation of vehicles, the power to destroy such vehicles, increased liability to a fine and the collaboration that we now have with the van hire industry. In one year in government we have been bearing down considerably on the illegal trade about which all members of the Committee are concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I welcome what the Financial Secretary says about the need for stringency in sentencing. I was particularly interested in the possible removal of a licence from a person convicted of selling smuggled alcohol. Can she tell the Committee how many licences have so far been revoked in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As I said, the Government announced the tightening of procedures a few weeks ago because we belived that they were not tight enough. Therefore, these are additional new powers that we have introduced. The hon. Gentleman asks about what happened in the past. Unfortunately, in the past the offence was not pursued as vigorously, but I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that we should pursue it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before the Financial Secretary finishes her explanation of the clause, will she answer the question that I asked her at the previous sitting? Can she tell the Committee what resources are being devoted in Customs and Excise to detecting the increasing trend of smuggling?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I began by replying to the comments that have been made today, but I was coming to the questions that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members asked me at our previous sitting. Perhaps I can come to that when I answer the point put by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) about the review and when it will be published.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made a number of points about the treatment of English wine. I know that we understands that, under European law, we cannot apply a lower rate to wine produced in the United Kingdom than to imported wine. The clause provides for a 4p increase in duty; it is a revalorisation of the rate. The hon. Gentleman was mistaken in saying that the previous Government did not raise the duty on wine in 1995, a point raised by the hon. Member for Witney as well. I have the figures here for the Budget increases under the Conservative Government from 1980 to 1995 for table wine, beer, standard cider and spirits.
<P>
The previous Government increased duty on those products, without taking the action on smuggling that we are taking. They increased the duty on wine on 12 occasions, the last being January 1995 
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall give way in a minute.
<P>
The previous Government increased duty on beer 12 times, the last being in January 1995; 13 times on standard cider, the last being in 1995; and 10 times on spirits, the last being in 1995. Year on year, the previous Government took the same action 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will give way first to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
The previous Government took the same action as we are taking, except that we are involved in a revalorisation; the previous Government's rises were real rises. However, I am not saying that there is no issue to deal with on smuggling and importation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the Financial Secretary acknowledge what is said in the Treasury notes accompanying the Budget which state that in real terms, the level of duty on wine over the past four years has fallen by 5 per cent.? While acknowledging that her hands are supposedly tied in the levels of duty that can be levied on home-produced wines as opposed to imported wines, will she consider other forms of preferential tax treatment for people who set up English vineyards to help them to acquire and maintain equipment, which is particularly costly here? There are several ways in which to give them some advantage.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have not received proposals on why English wine producers should get special treatment. The hon. Gentleman is aware of the constraints. In 1995, 1996 and 1997, the revenue from tax on wine that went to the Government increased year[Dawn Primarolo]
on year. There is every indication that wine revenue is buoyant. All Governments including, I am sure, the previous Government pay careful attention to the level of any tax that is set and its likely impact on the activity to which it is applied. It will come as no surprise to the Committee to learn that the Government pursue and undertake that analysis with as much vigour as the previous Government did when they were deciding whether a duty increase could be withstood by the industry.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that, although there was some scope for misunderstanding or misinterpreting the facts and figures that he gave on alcohol, the over-consumption of alcohol and the anti-social or violent behaviour that it might produce, he will accept that the well pursued strategy of the previous Government and this Government is to use taxation on alcohol as part of a health policy to buttress and prevent over-consumption. The hon. Gentleman's figures on the low incidence of alcohol-related diseases in the UK should be celebrated; we should not be complacent and, therefore, act differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Just one moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will know of the submissions made to the Government and probably to every member of the Committee by organisations such as Alcohol Concern on the importance of alcohol duties in contributing to the low incidence of alcohol-related diseases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have just said that I will give way to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but of course I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Although I understand the Financial Secretary's point about the contribution that the taxation of alcohol can make to health maintenance, does she accept that in the long term the Government either have to persuade our European partners to increase their alcohol duties or they have to implement a strategy for gradually reducing the United Kingdom's dependence on alcohol duties? It is not viable in the long term to impose alcohol duties that are substantially out of line with those prevailing in neighbouring countries.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It must be obvious to all Committee members that it is in the best interests of the United Kingdom and of Parliament and the Government to defend that revenue base and that source of income for the Treasury. The attitude of our European partners to the use of indirect taxes is significant. Ultimately, Parliament will decide the level of our indirect taxes, and it will do so in the United Kingdom's interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I just want to squeeze one concession from the Financial Secretary, which she will grant, I am sure, reluctantly. I have been the vice-chairman of Alcohol Concern for some time and I have some experience of alcohol problems I am sure that she is an imbiber of alcohol in modest amounts herself. Does she agree that the figures that my hon. Friends and I gave show that it is not wine imbibers who are the main sufferers of alcohol problems, including problems of health and social disorder? The people who use the wine bars of Islington and the dock side cafes in her constituency in Bristol are, by and large, a law-abiding lot. Excise duty is a blunt instrument, and indexing does not deal with the problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I did not know that the hon. Gentleman was connected with Alcohol Concern, and I was not trying to score points off him. I congratulate him on being associated with an excellent organisation. He will be aware that the briefing that it sent to Committee members in response to the Budget stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Pricing of alcohol is widely recognised as a key strategy for influencing alcohol consumption across the population ... The danger remains that a reduction in alcohol prices would lead to an increase in overall consumption which, in turn, would lead to an increase in alcohol-related harm."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not distinguish between wine drinkers and beer drinkers the hon. Gentleman and I, who are both wine drinkers, have our own views on that and its proposals are an important part of the overall strategy. The clause will revalorise and hold the revenue in line with inflation. That is in line with the suggestions made by Alcohol Concern and other organisations and, indeed, by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge discussed the revenue that the Government lose to smuggling, and he asked for the relevant figures, which were made available in a parliamentary answer. In 1997, smuggling alcohol and tobacco accounted for £950 million. That should be set against the massive income that the Treasury receives from alcohol and tobacco. However, I would not under any circumstances want to suggest that the Government are complacent or do not take the question of smuggling seriously, but we should keep the problem in proportion. The hon. Gentleman also made a point about revenue maximisation, and asked whether that had been achieved in relation to wine. I told the Committee that income from wine receipts was buoyant at present, so the Government had no need to be worried about that point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney made some points about smuggling to which I will return and asked a specific question about spirits. He is not here, but I shall answer his question in case anyone suggests that I chose not to. The Government have decided to freeze the duty on spirits because they are already heavily taxed compared to other alcoholic drinks. The previous Government cut the duty on spirits in recognition of that, and this Finance Bill does not change that position.
<P>
I shall deal with the question of the review, and the point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold about costs. Before I do that, I would like to respond to the claim made in a previous sitting that the Wine and Spirit Association had been betrayed by the Government. It was claimed that we had led the association up the garden path and then disappointed it perhaps I am paraphrasing. I have a letter from the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for whose participation and assistance in the review of tobacco and alcohol taxation, along with that of the other associations involved, I am extremely grateful. It was received after the Government's recent announcement of further pressure to reduce cross-border smuggling. Far from expressing disappointment and betrayal, it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am writing to say `thank you'" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we are not normally thanked for betrayal, Mr. Butterfill, but for recognition and working togther 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to you and the Department's team for the action you are taking to reduce cross border smuggling and the pernicious effects that it has on the legitimate trade."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not indicate a complacent Government; it indicates quite the reverse. It is a plaudit, dated 27 April this year, from the very association that the Opposition were quoting.
<P>
That leads me to the points made by the hon. Member for Cotswold and the right hon. Member for Wells about the review. To paraphrase the hon. Member for Cotswold, he was asking whether the battle against smuggling was worth the necessary investment, and whether it would be better to give up and reduce rates. I have explained what the revenue loss is as a proportion of the revenue secured, and he will understand that the revenue secured is enormous. Customs and Excise has deployed 330 front-line specialist staff, who are working specifically to combat smuggling from Europe. Those staff are supported by specialist intelligence and investigation teams, and as you might expect, Mr. Butterfill special Christmas exercises take place, especially in Dover, in recognition of the points made by Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Just one moment, please. In 1997, 30 additional staff were deployed, which resulted in 856 additional seizures. The revenue involved amounted to £998,000, and 856 vehicles were seized. That was in addition to the multi-agency work carried out by Customs and Excise with the Department of Social Security and the Kent police. For example, the special joint exercise conducted during the weeks before Christmas resulted in an 18 per cent. reduction in crime in south-east Kent. The Benefits Agency reduced fraud claims by almost £350,000 between April and December 1997, after the Government engaged in their new activities. The cost of protecting revenue by combating the pernicious activity of smuggling is therefore a sensible investment.
<P>
The review was set up when the Government were elected. The trade participated fully in that review and made a number of proposals. However, as all Committee members will understand, the budgetary implications of some of those proposals are subject to scrutiny through the comprehensive spending review. That review will take precisely the decisions on expenditure that hon. Members are expecting us to take. The Government will publish the CSR announcements, which will include future activities to combat smuggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether the Customs and Excise study that was completed in 1997 will be published as part of the wider review?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That was the right hon. Gentleman's second question, which I intended to answer. The trade took an active role in the review, and the question of publication was discussed. The confidentiality of information submitted by the trade must be considered. [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but the trade participated fully, disclosed information to the Government so that a strategy could be developed, and asked for its view on the matter of the publication's contents to be considered. However, the review's outcome, and the Government's strategy, will be published. As Opposition Members know, that has always been our intention. The Government will not publish their findings until a strategy has been fully developed and a conclusion reached. Conservative Members applied the same principles when they were in power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Lady said that the smuggling figure for 1997 was £950 million. I do not know whether that figure includes cigarettes and other items, so it is hard to judge the figure for alcoholic smuggling. However, table B9 on page 117 of the Red Book shows that the total revenue from all spirit, wine and beer duties amounts to approximately £6 billion. That is virtually the same figure as that forecast in 1996, despite the revenue increase given in the clause.
<P>
The amount of alcohol smuggling is rising yearly, but the amount of excise is more or less static. The Government's long-term strategy must therefore be altered, especially given that none of our European partners is likely to change its rates of duty to anything like the British level. At the end of the last sitting I asked the Financial Secretary to indicate the Government's long-term strategy in this respect. I should be grateful if she could give the Committee some indication now.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I had finished, but I am happy to respond to that point. The figure of £950 million that I gave the hon. Gentleman was for all alcohol products and tobacco. Figures have been published breaking down beer, cider, wine, spirits, hand-rolled cigarettes and tobacco products and they are available in parliamentary answers, as I think the hon. Gentleman is aware.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is also aware that duty is not the only influence on the price of a product; greater or lesser pressures to smuggle are also a factor. The Government's strategy is first, as I have outlined, to ensure that the tax base is secure. All the points that he and other hon. Gentlemen have made in the debate must be part of the continuing review of what is happening to the tax base.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central) rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I just finish this point?
<P>
That will clearly take account of the movement of excise duties elsewhere in Europe and of any negotiations and discussions, such as encouraging the French to bring their excise duty on beer up to our level.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point was whether the Government thought that the tax base was sustainable or needed other action. Now that they are in Opposition, Conservative Members are saying that the revenue base is not sustainable, but when they were in Government they thought that it was. Now we are pursuing a strategy, but we have added the work that we are doing on combating smuggling, sentencing and confiscation, and we await the publication of the CSR for Customs and Excise with the other announcements about the Government's future strategies to tackle this problem. I give way for the last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary agree that, in essence, the Government's strategy is to defend Exchequer revenues at the same time as vigorously combating smuggling, which we did not see before? That is in sharp contrast to what we have heard today from the Opposition, who are simply rolling over and agreeing with Euro-harmonisation, holding up their hands to the smugglers and letting them roll forward.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution.
<P>
I think that I have covered all the points raised by hon. Gentlemen in the debate and I ask the Committee to endorse the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I intervene again because we asked a number of questions that have still not been answered, and that is beginning to disturb Opposition Members. We do not want needlessly to prolong proceedings: if we ask succinct questions, we want some straight answers.
<P>
It is clear from what the Financial Secretary has said that she has no strategy or response to the wide, and in some cases widening, differential between continental and UK duty rates. When asked a direct question by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and indeed others, about whether she believed that, in the longer term, some harmonisation was necessary to cut the cause of smuggling, she waffled off at a tangent. It is clear that she has no strategy, which is surprising, as we know that the Government have a study completed by Customs and Excise.
<P>
One of our questions was when the Government would publish the study. We all know that information given in confidence to the Government must be respected, so it is easy to take items out of a report that is given to the Government. But we still look towards publication of the study, in line with everything that the Government have said about the public's right to know and their philosophy of openness, about which they lecture us in other forums.
<P>
I want to press the Financial Secretary a little more on this point. We do not simply want the Government's conclusions from a study. We want to know what Customs and Excise found out, thought and said about this issue, particularly in the light of duty rates. We are anxious not only to know what additional staff may have to be deployed to counter illegality and smuggling but to know about the causes of this phenomenon, which must have been considered if the study is worth while. That is why we want it published. Will the Financial Secretary return to that?
<P>
Secondly, I asked a very straight question about the Prime Minister's promise. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government should ... initiate an urgent, independent and comprehensive study."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to know whether that promise will be kept or whether it has been broken.
<P>
If we do not get an answer now, another debate is coming up on cider. I hope that we shall not have to debate that at great length, because a number of issues relating to the cider industry were touched on in earlier debates. We said that we wanted a constructive debate on the Finance Bill, but it takes two to be constructive. When we ask questions about public policy and the Minister refuses to answer, we might have to have a debate on that as well to elicit the answers that we want.
<P>
Perhaps through you, Mr. Butterfill, I can give the Financial Secretary another opportunity to give those two answers first, about the review that has been completed by the Government so it is certainly not independent and, secondly, about the Prime Minister's explicit pledge before the result of the general election that there would be a study. What has happened to it?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Let the record show that I answered both of the right hon. Gentleman's questions, even though he wants to pursue this silly attitude of "We ask questions; you don't answer", even when I have.
<P>
I have made it clear that the Government will publish their reports when we publish comprehensive spending reviews. I said that at least twice in my comments just now. I also said that the industry fully participated in the review, which the right hon. Gentleman accepts, because he acknowledges the point about confidentiality. Therefore, the Government have done what they said they would do and what the previous Government failed to do. When the Opposition were in Government they failed to conduct a full review of issues, including health, crime, social order and others. That is the answer again to the right hon. Gentleman's two questions. I hope that on this occasion he sees that I have answered them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It clearly embarrasses the Financial Secretary, as indeed it might, that we have finally got out of her an admission that the Prime Minister has broken his promise. The study to which she refers is clearly not urgent, because it has not been published yet. Here we are, a year later, and there is nothing. The study is certainly not independent, because it has been carried out by the Government and, by any reasonable definition of independent, it must be carried out by someone other than the Government. Therefore, there has been a clear breach of a promise, which we will add to the growing list of the Prime Minister's broken promises.
<P>
As to whether the study is comprehensive, the Financial Secretary has told us a little bit. She has said that it will go into the health, smuggling and duty aspects. We shall hold her to that when the study is published and make sure that nothing has been cut out that might be embarrassing to the Government. However, on the first two promises, namely, that the study would be urgent and independent, I regret, on behalf of all members of the Committee, that it has taken this long, but we have now got the Financial Secretary to concede that the Prime Minister broke an explicit promise that he made on 1 May last year.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Briefly, the clause will increase the rate of duty on cider in line with inflation from 1 January 1999. The rate on standard cider will increase from £24.29 to £25.27 per hectolitre, and the rate on strong cider will increase from £36.74 to £37.92 per hectolitre. The changes do not represent increases in real terms; they are necessary to maintain the revenue. The new rate will increase the tax by about one penny on a litre bottle of cider.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Drawback of excise duty on beer</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I ask the Financial Secretary a simple question in relation to clause 5? The notes on clauses that the Government have helpfully produced say that regulations introduced in 1995,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the intention of simplifying the drawback arrangements, provide for refund of excise duty for all duty paid goods which are exported, removed to warehouse for export, or destroyed, but not removed to ship's stores."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies that perhaps the duty still has to be paid on beer consumed while on board ship in international waters. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary could clarify that for me.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps I may explain briefly what the clause does and answer the hon. Gentleman's point about drawback in the case of ship's stores. This is a technical measure to simplify the law. I hope that it is uncontentious, because it removes a provision that is not needed and not used.
<P>
Section 42 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 ceases to have effect by virtue of clause 5 on such day as is appointed by the commissioners of Customs and Excise by way of an order made by statutory instrument. I should like to explain why and deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold.
<P>
Section 42 allows for a refund of excise duty in respect of beer exported from the UK or removed as ships stores. That is duplicated in the Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995, which provide a drawback scheme for all classes of duty-paid excise goods, including beer, that are exported, but not for those shipped as stores.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995 will make the appropriate provisions to ensure that shipment as stores is covered. That is being done under the care and management arrangements for secondary legislation and will be in place to allow time for the repeal of the 1979 section 42 provisions dealt with by the clause. When United Kingdom excise duty has been paid on goods which are subsequently exported, removed to ships stores or destroyed, the duty may be refunded, subject to certain conditions being met. That provision is known as drawback.
<P>
Section 42 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 provides for the refund of excise duty on drawback in respect of duty paid on beer being exported or removed to ships stores. Regulations introduced in 1995 under section 2 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, with the intention of simplifying the drawback arrangement, provide for the refund of excise duty for all duty-paid goods that are exported, removed to warehouses for export or destroyed, but not removed to ships stores.
<P>
That provision has inadvertently resulted in some duplication in legislation and a disparity between the set conditions relating to beer and to other goods. Traders[Dawn Primarolo]
have been confused by the provision of drawback facilities for beer. Clause 5 simplifies that situation.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for that detailed and helpful answer, which reinforces the points made by my right hon. Friends and me at the beginning of the sitting.

<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Charge on production without delivery</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I shall not detain the Committee for long on what appears to be an uncontroversial measure, but I should like to draw its attention to a long-standing issue within the oil refining industry. Compulsory stocks are required by a European Union directive. There is an implied differential treatment of UK-refined oil products and those that are imported, principally by the large supermarket chains. The UK refining industry, as I am sure the Financial Secretary will be aware, is under considerable pressure due to its over-capacity. The industry has been urging the Government to tackle the long-standing problem of compulsory stocks.
<P>
When I first considered the clause, I was concerned about the way in which the change in duty point might interact with the issue of compulsory stocks required to be held by United Kingdom refiners. I have discussed that with the industry, which takes the view that the clause is a tidying-up measure of a technical nature and, broadly, that the Government's proposal has the industry's support. However, that support should be seen in the wider context of the EU review of the compulsory stocks directive and the Government's commitment to remove the long-standing disability under which United Kingdom refiners labour, compared with their continental counterparts, in the importation of oil products into the United Kingdom.
<P>
Will the Government seek to redress the balance in favour of United Kingdom refiners or at least restore a level playing field and ensure that the charging point of duties does not interact with the compulsory holding of stocks by United Kingdom refiners in such a way as to further disadvantage them in comparison with importers of foreign-refined products?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 6 is uncontentious, and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made helpful comments on it.
<P>
There is no change in the time for paying duty. The proposal relates to the time at which the chargeable event occurs. The direct answer to the hon. Gentleman is that the clause will have no impact on stocks that are held by refiners. The industry was consulted about the clause and discussions are continuing about the regulations that will emerge from it.
<P>
The clause alters the time of the imposition of the charge to excise duty on imported and UK-produced oil. That involves the time when the oil is imported into or produced in the UK. The present charging scheme applies to imported oil when it is imported or, after removal to a refinery on importation, when it is delivered from the refinery for home use. UK-produced oil is charged when it is delivered from the refinery.<P>
The amendments are mainly of a technical nature, but they are an important first step which will help to simplify the legislation for oils. They are designed to bring the legislation for oil into line with that for alcohol and tobacco, with duty becoming chargeable when it is imported or manufactured. The important point to make is that there is a clear distinction in the legislation between duty being chargeable and duty becoming payable.
<P>
Full consultation will be held with the industry about drafts of the regulations that will replace the Hydrocarbon Oil Regulations 1973 SI 1973/1311. That should be of benefit to the Government and the industry. I hope that the Committee will support the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Ultra low sulphur diesel</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Clause 8 is the first of the clauses that touch on the so-called green taxes. I hope that you will allow me, Mr. Butterfill, to make a couple of general points about the Government's handling of green taxes.
<P>
The Budget produced further evidence of the environmental gap in the Government's policy. There is a gap between the Government's rhetoric before the Budget and what we saw in the Budget. There is a further gap between the hype in the Budget surrounding the proposals introduced and explained as so-called green taxes and what we find in the Finance Bill. There is, for example, no mention in the Bill of a reduced rate of vehicle excise duty for smaller, more efficient, low-polluting cars. Yet somebody listening to the Chancellor's Budget speech or reading the newspapers the following day would be forgiven for believing that a key green theme in the Budget was the introduction of a reduced rate of vehicle excise duty for smaller and cleaner cars.
<P>
The Financial Secretary gave a commitment only last year that the Treasury would publish each year, alongside the Red Book, a green book, evaluating the environmental impact of the Budget measures. There is no sign of the green book. Indeed, the only attempt to evaluate the environmental impact of the Budget measures is a single table on page 158 of the Red Book. This deficiency has already been noted by the Treasury Select Committee. It further undermines the Government's green credentials and underlines the cynical manipulation of the environmental movement indulged in by the Labour party when in Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Not only, as my hon. Friend says, did the environmental spokesperson for the Labour party, while in Opposition, promise a green book alongside the Red Book, but as recently as July last year the Financial Secretary herself promised to fulfil that undertaking. She repeated it in her evidence to the Environmental Audit Select Committee. Here we are with what is supposedly a full Budget it could not get any fuller and there is still not a hint of a green book to go alongside it. What are we to believe?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. It is a theme to which we shall return as we go through the Bill and address the clauses dealing with environmental taxes and duties on environmentally damaging products.
<P>
Ultra-low sulphur diesel, which was discussed in the debate on clause 7 on the Floor of the House, has seen the duty differential increased to 2p a litre. Clearly any increase in the differential between standard diesel and ultra-low sulphur diesel is welcome. However, the increase in the duty on ultra-low sulphur diesel was 9.44 per cent., a higher percentage increase than the increase applied to duty on petrol. The result is that the pump price of ultra-low sulphur diesel is now almost identical to the pump price of regular diesel, although the production cost of ultra-low sulphur diesel is about 3.5p a litre higher than the production cost of standard diesel. Therefore, the industry is absorbing part of the increased production costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I want to make one point before my hon. Friend goes on to the specifics and moves away from general comments on the Government's green record on this issue. He may be aware that the Treasury Select Committee's report on the Budget it is an all-party report, and this is the Committee's unanimous conclusion said, at conclusion (n):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are disappointed that an environmental Green Book did not appear with the Budget."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a condemnation by the Government's own supporters. The Government have failed to deliver on the promise that they made after the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I was aware of the Treasury Select Committee's conclusion. I believe that I mentioned it and I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond to what we have said this morning and to what the Committee said about the green book.
<P>
While the increase in duty on ultra-low sulphur diesel to 9.44 per cent. is less than the increase on standard diesel, it is more than the increase on petrol. I wonder whether the Government are sending out the right signals by increasing the duty on ultra-low sulphur diesel albeit at the same time as increasing the differential between ultra-low sulphur diesel and standard diesel. It seems to me that the Government's laudable objective of attempting to reduce pollution through, among other measures, fiscal incentives, is in danger of degenerating into an unthinking anti-car policy.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government seem to be obsessed with the 20 per cent. CO2 output that comes from the transport sector, while having absolutely no serious strategy for dealing with the 80 per cent. of CO2 that comes from other sectors. Indeed, they seem paranoid about announcing any strategy for dealing with the large percentage of greenhouse gases attributable to the coal-fired generation of electricity, for the obvious reasons that, in opposition, the Labour party made mutually incompatible commitments to the coal mining industry and to the environmental lobby. Through the use of technology, modern vehicles produce less pollution and are less harmful to the environment than vehicles of the past. I am a great believer in technology and very much hope that that trend will continue, so that we will see the development of ever-cleaner and ever more efficient engines, and techniques such as catalysers, which will allow motor cars to be less polluting.
<P>
The proper target of Government policy should be to reduce the total amount of pollution released into the environment by the transport sector, not to attack car ownership or private car driving for its own sake. The private car is with us it is a reality, and it will not go away. I hope that the Treasury will focus on ensuring that the damage to our environment is minimised, rather than appearing only to take a mindless cudgel to the concept of private car ownership. Responsible use of the private car will always be a vital part of the transport equation; Government policy should recognise that.
<P>
I am unsure of the Government's precise objective in relation to ultra-low sulphur diesel. A 2p per litre differential in the rate of duty seems a timid incentive to the road haulage industry to switch to using ultra-low sulphur diesel. I have already commented on the fact that it apparently costs about 31/2p a litre more to produce ultra-low sulphur diesel than standard diesel, and thus, in a sense, the equality of pump price is achieved only through the goodwill of refiners, who absorb the additional costs. Operators are faced with a similar pump price, but there is evidence that vehicles run on ultra-low sulphur diesel are less mileage-efficient, so there may be cost implications for operators of ultra-low sulphur diesel vehicles. More important, I am not entirely clear about the rationale behind the Government's promotion of ultra-low sulphur diesel.
<P>
There seems to be a muddle over prioritising different environmental objectives. It is a sad fact of life that very few of the laudable objectives of reducing pollution output are cost free, not only in financial terms but in environmental terms. To remove 1 tonne of sulphur from diesel produces 20 tonnes of CO2, which is produced as emissions during the refining process because of the amount of energy required for desulphurisation. The Government are promoting ultra-low sulphur diesel, having placed the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions at the top of their priority list. I hope that the Financial Secretary can comment on that inconsistency.
[Mr. Hammond]
<P>
Furthermore, there is clear evidence that ultra-low sulphur diesel increases emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, both of which are pollutant gases that the Government have targeted for reduction. There is evidence that ultra-low sulphur diesel benefits air quality in cities, where heavy vehicles are operating in stop-start conditions. But there is an equal body of evidence to suggest that the overall beneficial impact of the use of ultra-low sulphur diesel given that 90 per cent. of heavy vehicle diesel engine miles are done in open-road conditions may be marginal or, given the reduced fuel efficiency of low-sulphur diesel, negative.
<P>
If I may digress slightly, vehicles that run on liquid natural gas produce lower levels of nitrous oxide but higher levels of methane. At Kyoto, methane was identified as the most harmful of the six gases targeted for reduction in emissions. In converting his own vehicle to run on gas, the Deputy Prime Minister is therefore reducing the production of nitrous oxide but contributing to an increase in methane output, which he has identified as an urgent target for reduction.
<P>
I am not trying to score a cheap point; I recognise that any attempt to reduce pollutants will result in conflict. But the road transport industry needs a clear steer a clear indication of the direction that future Government policy will take so that it can take long-term decisions with confidence that it is addressing the Government's priorities for pollutant control. Environmental trade-offs will always occur, and the industry is anxious to co-operate with the Government to achieve the cleanest possible operation of diesel-engined vehicles in the longer term.
<P>
In evidence to the Treasury Select Committee recently the report of which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) Treasury officials said that the time it takes to implement green tax changes was related in part to the need for consultation with the industry. That is, in itself, entirely understandable. But there was no consultation with the industry over the changes which were announced in the Budget which clause 8 will introduce. The industry was given two hours notice of a change in the specification of diesel eligible for the lower rate of duty. That suggests a stunning lack of understanding by the Government of the process of manufacturing anything, let alone something as complex as low-sulphur diesel. At 6 pm on the evening of the Budget, refiners had stocks produced to the specification prevailing at 3 pm, which no longer qualified for the lower rate of duty. That would be bad enough if changing the specification of diesel were as simple as pressing a couple of buttons on a refinery control panel.
<P>
As the Financial Secretary will know, the precise output mix of a refinery is a complex matter, which is determined by many factors, including the refinery's physical configuration. Any change in the product mix or the specifications of the refinery's products requires careful planning. It is not an overstatement to say that the industry was genuinely shocked by the Government's stance in introducing such a complex and technical change without prior discussion. It is not as though we are talking about a change that is price-sensitive in the markets. The proposal could have been flagged up in advance and discussed openly with the industry without any danger of adverse fical effects.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary explain the extraordinary step that the Government took without consultation? It has effectively impacted on the refining industry as a retrospective tax. Having absorbed the31/2p per litre additional cost of refining ultra-low sulphur diesel, the industry had to deliver the diesel to retail markets as standard diesel without the benefit of the duty rebate, which would have offset part of its additional manufacturing costs.
<P>
The clause's specification is extremely precise. I am told by those in the industry who know about these matters that it appears to be based on the specification of a product that is produced by a refinery in Finland and which is imported in some quantity into this country by one of the large hypermarket chains. If that is the Government's idea of supporting UK industry, in which there is substantial overcapacity and pressure on profitability, I am unimpressed.
<P>
Neither the Bill nor any of the supporting documentation that I have seen states where the specification came from. As recently as October 1997, the Government signed a European Council of Ministers proposal containing a long-term specification for diesel that is different from that in the clause. When I say "different" I refer, not to sulphur content, but to other parameters of course the sulphur content in ultra-low sulphur diesel will differ from the sulphur content in standard diesel. The industry was astonished to find that the clause specified different parameters relating to the fuel's density and distillation characteristics.
<P>
I do not pretend to be a petroleum engineer perhaps the Financial Secretary is more knowledgeable about these matters than I am but I believe that changing the characteristics of one fraction of an oil refinery's output will inevitably have consequences for the other fractions that are produced. It will change the supply availability of other fractions, and could have an impact on the price of those products in the marketplace or at least on production costs and on the competitiveness of the UK refining industy.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will explain the specification's origin. The Treasury, for all its well known, superhuman powers and capabilities, would have to be incredibly arrogant to believe that it could define in precise detail the specification for a product without consulting that product's manufacturers in the United Kingdom. The industry believes that it has always shown itself to be ready and willing to co-operate with the Government in the development of cleaner, more advanced fuels. That co-operation has been damaged by this episode, and especially by the lack of consultation.
<P>
The Financial Secretary wrote to the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association of 30 April, acknowledging its concerns about the specification and the manner of the measure's introduction. She told the association:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I will consider these points very carefully."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The industry association and, indeed, the Opposition anticipated that the Government, after considering their position on the matter, would table amendments to the clause to correct the situation. No such amendments have been tabled, and the industry remains in the dark as to why the specification has been selected and why the industry was not consulted in advance.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In summary, the ultra-low sulphur diesel episode appears to be a classic case of how not to go about something. I understand the Government's reasons for promoting ultra-low sulphur diesel and I appreciate that the subject is relevant to vehicle excise duty reductions for vehicles fitted with catalysers which need ultra-low sulphur to ensure that they operate effectively we shall debate that when we reach clause 16 but if the Government are serious, the 2p differential gives out a feeble signal. The differential does not even cover the increased production costs of ultra-low sulphur diesel. That signal is further diluted by an increase in the duty on ultra-low sulphur diesel announced in the Budget. That level is higher than the increase in petrol duty.
<P>
If the specifications of a product of this complexity are to be changed, there needs to be a clear scientific or technical basis. The process of arriving at that decision needs to be transparent. The players involved in that industry need to be consulted and involved, and there needs to be a consensus. Progress will be made only by co-operation with the industry. There is no excuse for the fiasco of introducing a specification change on two hours notice which leaves a highly complex industry high and dry, with no opportunity to respond to the Government's fiscal signal.
<P>
If the Government intend to pursue green objectives, they must clearly spell them out. When conflicts between different green objectives arise, as they will, the industries that are affected will need to know what the Government's prioritisation of those different objectives is, so that they can anticipate and prepare for future evolution of Government policy.
<P>
I expect and hope that the Financial Secretary, in light of what she has written to the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association, will either concede that the specification change and the handling of the matter was a mistake, or be able to give us a detailed response to the case, which I have paraphrased, that was put to her by that association. I urge my hon. Friends to listen carefully to her response before deciding how to vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Although I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, in particular that the Government have not been as active in environmental policies as they promised we were especially worried by the lack of a green book in the Budget we should welcome some of the measures in the Bill, and we are in accord with the aims of the clause. I do, however, want to press the Government on how much further they intend to go.
<P>
A big issue in the petroleum industry and the environmental movement concerns which fuels are the cleanest and which should be promoted by the Government through the right incentives. I am informed that the tightening of the definition in the clause is the right way forward. I listened with interest to the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. He seems very well informed, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer some of his points. Before we vote, Committee members should know whether proper consultation has taken place on which fuels are clean and worthy of promotion.
<P>
I have been told that, although the Government are going in the right direction, they have, if anything, been too timid. There must be further incentives to promote these fuels.
<P>
I have a worry that hon. Members may perhaps share. Bus operators in my constituency tell me that some of the routes for which they have previously tendered are becoming uneconomical because of the increase in fuel duty. If duties for the cleaner fuels to which bus operators can switch are reduced, such routes would still be able to be served. I am worried about those bus routes to Kingston hospital that bus operators consider uneconomic. I am raising the matter with them and with London Transport because there may be other reasons why they do not want to serve such routes. If the Government assisted them by promoting fuels with low environmental impact, there would be no reason to pull out of operating such important routes.
<P>
The Government should be praised for adhering to the principle of using tax incentives to promote cleaner fuels. It is important that that principle is reaffirmed and developed. Will the Financial Secretary give assurances that this is just a start, and that she and her colleagues intend to go further?
<P>
The environmental challenges that face the road and transport industry are great. Much tougher specifications are being agreed at European Union level, which will be finalised by 2005. They will impose significantly stricter regulations on pollutants such as sulphur, benzene and nitrogen oxides. The market must therefore be given the right incentives to prepare for those specifications.
<P>
I urge the Financial Secretary to look at other clean fuels when, before the next Budget, she reconsiders the matter in the light of today's debate. The 1998 Budget contains welcome new tax incentives for road fuel gas. However, many other new processes and clean emission products are now available. The Government should analyse them properly to decide which ones they should back. For example, a new product, which formulates petrol or gasoline, reduces significantly the levels of harmful components, in particular benzene and sulphur, and of primary pollutants such as hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. In turn, ground-level ozone is thereby reduced.
<P>
The Government need to examine the use of a number of such products, so that we have a clear, coherent approach. We must decide which of the plethora of new products the Government should back. To reiterate the remarks made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the Financial Secretary should assure the Committee that there will be a proper technical review of the available fuel options. That review should take account of the environmental impact of such fuels not only when they are burned by the car but during the process of production. If we are to get a[Mr. Edward Davey]
proper assessment, the environmental impact must be examined from start to finish.
<P>
I look forward to the Financial Secretary's response, which I hope will assure the Committee that those matters were examined fully before the measure was agreed by the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Mr. Butterfill, perhaps you will allow a little leeway on the few points I want to make on the clause, because this is an opportunity to look at all the environmental taxes in the Budget, particularly with regard to fuel. This is a further example of tokenism from the Government's green rhetoric that is not translated into deeds. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said, we need to take an holistic approach to environmental taxes, taking into account all the noxious gases and bad pollutants, instead of simply discriminating against particular elements.
<P>
The Labour manifesto promised to put the environment at the heart of policy-making. As most environmental groups will agree, the Budget puts it somewhere near the big toe, certainly nowhere near the heart. What we have in the clause is an inadequate tinkering around. Why are the Government singling out ultra-low sulphur diesel? Why are there no concessions on liquid petroleum gas or compressed natural gas, which have other major environmental advantages?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to go down this route. We are discussing quite a narrow point in the clause, and he is seeking to make a point that would have been better made on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made many of the points that I intended to make, probably because he is speaking from the same brief as I am.
<P>
I do not doubt the Government's and the Financial Secretary's sincerity in principle in wishing to make environmental gains by encouraging the use of low-sulphur diesel and introducing the technical changes in clause 8. Indeed, I pay tribute to Safeway, which was the first supermarket chain to introduce the so-called city diesel, which is a euphemism for ultra-low sulphur diesel. The Government are to be congratulated on that. However, I wish to criticise the manner in which the clause was introduced and the technical changes that it introduces.
<P>
The United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association UKPIA which is a conglomerate of all the petrol producers in this country, would have expected to be fully consulted about the changes that the clause introduces. The clause, along with many other excise duties, came into force at 6 pm two hours after the Chancellor's statement. The clause changes the technical specification for ultra-low sulphur diesel, which had been agreed with our European partners under British Standard EN590. The petro-chemical industries had stocks of ultra-low sulphur diesel, but the Government suddenly decided, at a stroke, that those stocks did not qualify under their new definition.
<P>
That is not a sensible way to proceed. It meant that the stocks had to be recycled, involving considerable extra cost. One might ask why the Government changed the technical specification, which, as I said, had been agreed over a number of years with our European partners. Indeed, the UKPIA said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is difficult to know how the new specification parameters were derived and on what basis. We are even aware of one instance where HM C and E responded to a request as to the origins on 18 March by saying UKPIA" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the industry's watchdog 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"had provided them!"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, Dr. Frend, in a letter to the Financial Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This was patently untrue and HM C and E later said that HMG had originated the new specification."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear indication of the Government changing the specification far too late in the process and without proper consultation.
<P>
The same letter from Dr. Frend goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It appears very odd that the definition of ULSD" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ultra-low sulphur diesel 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the UK falls outside the range of the new reference fuels proposed by the Commission for Euro III cars!"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Financial Secretary must tell the Committee why the Government changed the specification at such a late stage, particularly when it had the agreement of our European partners.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, said that the Government should clarify the matter of environmental benefits, particularly diesel over petrol and different types of petrol and diesel. I wholly support that, because we must look at the environmental benefits as a whole. It is often easy to change a technical specification, as in clause 8, without considering the holistic approach or, using the jargon of environmentalists, the proper, full, life-cycle analysis. Increased energy is involved in producing the new super-high specification of ultra-low sulphur diesel. We must balance the possible environmental benefits that the clause is introducing against the benefit to the environment as a whole.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are reasons to question the precise environmental benefits introduced by the clause. City diesel increases emissions of both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons by as much as 20 per cent. in heavy duty vehicles. The new specification will not help that one iota. The increase in hydrocarbons produces the so-called smog that we see in our cities. We need to find ways of improving the use of diesel. That has been done over recent years by the introduction of lean-burn engines, but technical specifications that are coming along will improve the use of diesel still further I am referring to the use of carbon traps in diesel exhaust systems. When they are commonly fitted to cars and heavy duty vehicles, they will have as significant an environmental effect as the catalytic converter has on petrol cars.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not falling into the trap of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and straying rather wide and that he will come back to the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. That is very helpful.
<P>
If the Government have introduced the wrong technical specification, we must consider the environmental benefits and disadvantages that could result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend talks about the Government introducing the wrong specification. Does he agree that the Government's intention in putting forward a certain specification for ultra-low sulphur diesel is to reduce the aromatics output from its combustion? Does he not think it extraordinary that the Government sought to do something as precise and technical as that by unilaterally introducing a specification in the Finance Bill, instead of consulting the industry and our European partners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. It was the point that I was trying to make earlier, although clearly not as effectively as he did. I think that it is extraordinary that the Government should have introduced the new specification without proper consultation and without considering the whole life-cycle analysis, particularly as more energy is necessary to produce ultra-low sulphur diesel and since it produces more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons than ordinary diesel.
<P>
The Government should now rethink this matter and consult the industry properly to make sure that they have not produced a specification that favours the low-sulphur diesel produced in Sweden, which is where Safeway sources its diesel. I wonder whether the Government have introduced this specification in response to lobbying from either Safeway or the Swedish refinery that produces this high-quality diesel to the detriment of refineries in this country.
<P>
Anyone who knows anything about the petrochemical industry I confess that I do not know a huge amount, but I have been round a refinery and talked to experts will know of another knock-on effect. As a member of the previous Environment Select Committee, I spent a whole day at Fawley discussing these matters, so I have gained a little bit of knowledge. When the specification of a particular fraction of the distillate is altered, it is harder to refine the higher quality fuels required for aviation purposes. It is therefore likely that the clause will have the knock-on effect of an increase in the price of aviation fuel, which will become scarcer and more expensive to produce. The Financial Secretary has a duty to explain to the Committee the precise mechanism of bringing about this change, its full knock-on effects in environmental and economic terms, and how it will benefit British refineries and British jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This has been a good debate, because it has illustrated the Government's approach to the environment to look for a political fix rather than to take action to improve, in this case, air quality.
<P>
We were told that the merger of the Department of Transport with the Department of the Environment was an opportunity to take an overall view of the environment, which would inform the Budget process, and that a green Budget would be produced at the same time to show the results. That has not happened.
<P>
Instead, the Government have put together a small environmental package, which could end up having a detrimental effect on the competitiveness of British industry. That has an indirect effect on the environment, because if manufacturing industry is so damaged that it transfers to other, less regulated countries, there could be an overall detrimental effect on the global environment. That is of great concern to the Committee.
<P>
As has already been pointed out, the European Commission which is much less interested in industrial competitiveness believes that we should ratchet up standards continuously, the overall effect of which would be a migration of industrial processes from Europe to countries in the Asian basin, for instance, which do not have such high standards. If that were to happen, the overall impact on the global environment could be more damaging.
<P>
By failing to consult adequately with those who understand fuel and vehicle technology, we could be making a mistake. We do not know that because the technical appraisal promised by the Government has not been forthcoming. Will the Financial Secretary tell us when the promised green book will be produced, so that the details can be assessed?
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked as usual for more. He asked for the environmental policies to go further, and criticised their inadequacies. Again, that is a naive approach to the subject. It is not what you do; it is how you do it. These are complex issues and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge illustrated in his introductory remarks, there are difficult trade-offs to be made. What finally goes into the atmosphere is determined by vehicle technology, fuel technology, whether a catalyst or particulate trap is used, or a combination of all those things. Users and manufacturers must be consulted to reach the right answer, and the industry is anxious that that should happen. The Freight Transport Association produced an excellent document before the Budget called, "The future is green but how do we get there?" Clearly, the association is anxious to reduce the pollution caused by its members' vehicles, and wants the Government to help in that process. Similarly, the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association another responsible organisation from which we have already heard in this debate was anxious to co-operate. A startling indictment of the Government's approach is the fact that on 7 July the association wrote to the Financial Secretary, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We all appreciate the need for the Budget security net but certain additions were made seemingly at the last minute which have significant and undesirable repercussions. Further, these were in areas normally pre-discussed with the oil industry and, given the declared, and welcomed, intentions of the current Government towards more openness and transparency, we were extremely surprised to be suddenly at the sharp end of exactly the opposite happening!"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there we have it, Mr. Butterfill. There was less consultation than UKPIA experienced previously. In the various jobs that I have done, I have always insisted that we talk closely with operators, who could tell us what was technically feasible. Naturally they had to be[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
cajoled and encouraged, but they have an important role to play in framing legislation. To try to proceed without their help is madness.
<P>
The background to the Government's proposal is also unfortunate. Although the Budget had the declared intention of encouraging the use of low-sulphur diesel fuel, the Government did not do that by reducing the cost of that fuel they increased it by more than the duty on petrol. They are driving people away from diesel, which is the chosen fuel of industry and which produces less carbon dioxide, which is a cause of global warming.
<P>
The Government's trick in encouraging the use of that fuel is to increase the rate on ordinary diesel by even more. There was a huge and damaging increase in all fuel duties, but the duty on low-sulphur fuel was increased by slightly less than on ordinary diesel fuel. That does not constitute encouraging the use of a more benign fuel. The proposal needs to be seen in the context of an anti-competitive drive against the fuel that is used by industry. It would be unfortunate if the longer-term consequences made British industry less compititive, but the Government's proposal can only aid our competitors. The global environment will also be affected.
<P>
All of those arguments came up before in relation to the carbon tax. I am glad to say that until now the Labour party was resistant to that tax because of the impact that it would have on the coal industry. The clause will introduce a carbon tax by the back door. Our competitor countries have no intention whatever of introducing a carbon tax. The overall effect could well be the migration of the relevant industrial processes to less regulated, less taxed countries, and global warming could increase as a consequence of the Government's ill-judged measures.
<P>
When will the Financial Secretary produce the promised green book so that we can see the answers to the complex questions that we have asked? What do the Government intend to do, and what difficult trade-offs will they make? In any event, will the Financial Secretary undertake to consult next year with the users, and in particular with the petroleum industry, so that she will not make such mistakes again?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Earlier this morning, questions were asked about two sets of corporation tax regulations. The first was the draft instalment regulations, which were placed in the Library on Friday 24 April. The second was the advance corporation tax regulations, which will be published shortly, and in good time for the Committee's deliberations. We shall ensure maximum consultation before the draft is produced, and there will be two months of consultation on the regulations. I shall now return to the debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was not a point of order, but it was a useful point of information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Further to that point of order or information I am grateful to the Minister for coming back to us and for the knowledge that the draft regulations will be available to the Committee before we discuss the relevant clauses. Can we have an assurance that they will be sent to hon. Members individually? If not, we may have problems similar to those experienced by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who persistently tried to obtain the draft regulations from the Library, but was told that the interface between the Library and the Treasury was faulty. It would be helpful if they were sent to us individually.
<P>
To avoid burdening you with such points of order again, Mr. Butterfill, I request that in all cases the draft regulations are made available well before we reach the appropriate part of the Bill.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Further to that point of order, given the difficulties experienced by some hon. Members in finding things in the Library and in the spirit of assisting the Committee, I shall ensure that the draft regulations are circulated to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to that point of information, Mr. Butterfill, the Financial Secretary said that she would ensure that the draft regulations were circulated in good time for the debate. Given the splendid progress being made by the Committee, it seems reasonable to presume that we shall reach the relevant clauses on Thursday, so will the Financial Secretary clarify her understanding of "in good time" for a debate on Thursday?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Further to that point of order or information my right hon. Friend in his earlier point of order referred also to the regulations in schedule 4. I shall be grateful if the Financial Secretary will confirm that she also intends those draft regulations to be ready by Thursday.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thought that I had made it clear that I would ensure that the Committee received the draft regulations in good time for the debate on the relevant clauses. I am not being ambiguous.

To return to clause 8, I do not want to shoot the Opposition's goose [Interruption.] but I shall anyway. Great play was made of the stocks in place at 6 pm on Budget day. I do not know whether Opposition Members are aware that all those stocks were being sold as ordinary diesel and not as ultra-low sulphur diesel. That dramatically changes

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Financial Secretary has said that there were no stocks of ultra-low sulphur diesel in the United Kingdom. That is simply not credible.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I said that the stocks in the United Kingdom at 6 pm on Budget day were being sold as ordinary diesel and not as ultra-low sulphur diesel.
<P>
I should like to make progress in answering the points raised by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of UKPIA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Financial Secretary is implying that the oil companies were selling ultra-low sulphur diesel, which costs more to refine, as ordinary diesel. Again, her answer is simply not credible.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am saying that ultra-low sulphur diesel was produced and the duty incentive was gained, but it was then sold as diesel. Clauses 8 and 9 deal with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to press the Financial Secretary, but is she saying that Customs and Excise made an extra-statutory concession to allow fuel produced under the old specification to attract the full amount of duty rebate and then be sold as regular diesel after 6 pm on Budget day.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I think that I was clear. If the Committee will allow me to make progress and answer the industry's objection to the proposal, the matter will become clear. It relates to what is produced and what is sold, and to the Government's conclusions in relation to the clause.
<P>
On the question whether the increases are higher or lower, and how ultra-low sulphur diesel compares, both duty rates increased by 3.7p in cash terms. The hon. Gentleman referred to differences in the rounded-up figures of 9.4 per cent. for the increase in ultra-low sulphur diesel and an increase of 9.2 per cent. for unleaded.
<P>
After the ultra-low sulphur diesel passed the duty point, there was nothing in law to prevent producers from mixing ultra-low sulphur diesel with diesel and selling it as diesel.
<P>
The Government are using a fiscal incentive to encourage production of a higher standard. That is the benefit of economic instruments, which can be a more cost-effective means of producing environmental gains than an across-the-board regulatory requirement. That is what the Government are trying to do in the clause I shall return to the points that were made about the British and European standards.
<P>
On the question of definition, let me assure the Committee that the definition was reached in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry. There was full consultation and agreement with those two Departments about the definition in the Bill. This is not, as one hon. Member suggested, an example of the Treasury dreaming up some definition unconnected to reality. [Interruption.] Opposition Members now want to change what they said, but it is important to understand what consultation took place within government and that decisions were based on a range of criteria, including the specifications to which hon. Members have referred with regard to aromatics and cetane, for example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What is the origin of the specification? We are now told that not only the Treasury but the Department of Transport and Department of Trade and Industry were involved in discussions. However, we know that the industry association that represents UK refiners was not consulted. From where did the Government get their scientific or technical evidence to support this change?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Government used the information available to the three Departments with regard to considerable discussions and consultations in this area. [Laughter.] Opposition Members laugh, but they are suggesting that the Government are incapable of taking any decisions, cannot draw on information that they already have, have no understanding of the industry and that, somehow, consultation has not taken place.
<P>
If I can make some progress, I shall deal specifically with the points made by UKPIA, which was the only brief from which hon. Members read today when dealing with the clause. UKPIA's first point was that ultra-low sulphur diesel was characterised only by its sulphur level, all other parameters being the same as for normal diesel. Its letter follows with a technical description of density and distillation, as the two criteria which the Government settled on in the Bill.
<P>
The additional criteria were decided in full consultation with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and Department of Trade and Industry officials. That consultation considered a range of criteria that could be applied to the specification, including aromatics and cetane, for example. The conclusion was that the density and T95 of ultra-low sulphur diesel gave most of the emissions benefits without unduly complicating the specification. There was no attempt to align the ultra-low sulphur diesel specification with the British or European standard, because the measure is not about fuel standards as such; it is a fiscal measure aimed at improving the emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxide, particularly in urban areas.
<P>
The lower the density, the better, because it gives fewer particulates. The density standard for ordinary diesel is 860 kg per cubic metre, whereas the standard for ultra-low sulphur diesel is 835 kg per cubic metre. With distillation, the aim is to burn the maximum amount of fuel at the lowest possible temperature. The standard in the clause of 95 per cent. distillation at 345 deg C means that more hydrocarbaons are burned and fewer are emitted into the atmosphere. The distillation standard for ordinary diesel is 95 per cent. at 370 deg C.
<P>
I was asked why the criteria do not align with the European auto oil standards. The criteria are still under negotiation and are subject to the co-decision conciliation procedure, which will not be finalised until later this year. If the critria have not been finalised, alignment is hardly possible. The Budget is about measures now; it is not about the auto oil standards and possible fuel standards in seven years' time. It is about fuel standards today to produce real benefits in our congested and polluted urban areas.
<P>
The UKPIA letter to me to which hon. Members referred says that the environmental benefits of city diesel are overstated and that it increases emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in heavy duty vehicles, with little impact on particulates, compared to buses and light duty vans. The most pressing pollutants in terms of meeting air quality objectives are nitrogen oxide and particulates, and particulates pose the greatest health risks. That is why the Government have moved to deal with them.
<P>
The report by the Cleaner Fuels Forum, "Clean Air: the role for cleaner fuels", in which the UKPIA[Dawn Primarolo]
participated, concluded that there would be reductions in both nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions for light and heavy duty vehicles. Some increase in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions for heavy goods vehicles was shown under the European Programme for Emissions of Fuels and Engine Technology equations EPEFE although other evidence in the Cleaner Fuels report suggested that those equations understated the reductions for other pollutants.
<P>
Almost all the recent experimental evidence, which is what we based our decision on, including trials by London Transport buses and London taxis, has shown significant reductions in particulate and nitrogen oxideemissions, which tend to be much greater than those predicted by the EPEFE equations. Recent research updating the EPEFE equations
