<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 26, line 7, at beginning insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(A1).—Whether on application from a public authority or from any person who has made a request for information to that authority the Commissioner may review any decision made by the public authority under section 13.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
One of the idiosyncrasies of life on the Committee Corridor is that, although hon. Members may be shuffled into other jobs, ceasing to perform one set of duties and beginning anew another set almost instantaneously, that procedure does not extend to Standing Committees. I am delighted still to be in the Committee under your chairmanship, Dr. Clark, not least because we have reached one of the most important parts of the Bill—the enforcement provisions. Having reached this late stage, I hope to be able to persuade the Under-Secretary to see the sense of the argument that will be paraded by me and by other members of the Committee in respect of the provisions. 
<P>
I do not wish to be uncharitable, but the current provisions are a bit of a dog's breakfast. Admittedly, on the Richter scale of dog's breakfasts, it is by no means the worst that one has come across. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): Small bones. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes, small bones. Nevertheless, individual members of the public, and campaigning groups, will have to use the provisions to press for information that public authorities are reluctant to release. It is crucial that we debate the matter thoroughly, notwithstanding our general desire to make progress. 
<P>
Clause 48 is the first clause to relate to enforcement. The amendment is, in one sense, a probing amendment, intended to find out what the Government think the provisions mean, but it also has substance. Neither the reason why the clause appears in part III instead of in part IV, nor the way in which the mechanism to provide for a commissioner to issue a discretionary disclosure recommendation under clause 13 may be triggered, is clear. 
<P>
Under clause 50, a complainant may apply to the commissioner for a decision. It seems odd to have the clause proposing the mechanism for a discretionary disclosure decision—which would follow a review of a public authority's refusal to provide information—two clauses ahead of clause 50. In fairness, clause 48 was inserted during the period between the appearance of the original draft Bill and public scrutiny, and the eventual publication of the Bill before Parliament. The Under-Secretary will, no doubt, tell us why the clause is in the right place. However, because of its positioning, we are confused about the way in which the commissioner might have a review. 
<P>
At the heart of our amendment is a second question. From reading the clause, it would appear that not only the applicant might trigger the mechanism. Subsection (3) provides for what should happen when 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Commissioner gives a discretionary disclosure recommendation in a case where an application has been made to him under section 50''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That seems to suggest that the Government intend that someone other than the person who is looking for the information might seek a decision from the commissioner. 
<P>
Is it intended that a public authority could apply to, or seek advice from, the commissioner, because of uncertainty about whether, under clause 13, it should withhold or publish information? We should welcome that, and unlike some campaigning groups we have not suggested removing clause 48 from the Bill. The general concern about the commissioner's being able only to make a recommendation—a debate that we shall reach this morning—does not mean that there is anything wrong with a mechanism open to a public authority; in fact, there is everything to be desired in it. That might not be a Government Department but perhaps part of the quangocracy dealt with in the Bill, such as a body dealing with health or medical services. There might be uncertainty in such a body about its powers and it might not have access to the finest Treasury legal advice. It might well want advice from the commissioner. 
<P>
The amendment is intended to establish whether we are right about the Government's intention, and I acknowledge the nods and winks from the Under-Secretary. XThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I take great offence at the suggestion that I might wink at the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Only in the sense of helping the Committee to make progress. 
<P>
We need to establish at the outset the reason for the position of the clause in the Bill; it might make more sense to insert it around clause 51 or 52. More importantly, we need to clarify whether the review procedure could be triggered not just by an applicant but by a public authority. I shall not stray on to the argument about why the commissioner's powers should be greater. If the Under-Secretary and his officials have studied the train of thought behind the amendments and new clause 1, they will understand that we want to clarify whether the commissioner would provide a way to review, and make a recommendation on, whether a disclosure should be made. We might need to discuss further powers of review and enforcement for the commissioner and even the tribunal, should the recommendation not be followed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the amendment sought to probe the Government's intentions. There is not much distance between us on a number of the issues that it raises, so I hope to reassure him. 
<P>
We decided that the clause should be included in part III rather than part IV of the Bill because it does not deal with an enforcement function. The commissioner will be able to review any issue put to her, and many requests for consideration will be made merely for clarification. Arguably, the clause could have featured in part III or part IV, but we felt that part III was more appropriate for the sake of clarity. 
<P>
The commissioner will have power to review decisions taken by the authority pursuant to clause 13. I confirm that such a review can be initiated either by the applicant or by the authority. The hon. Member for Ryedale said that a public authority could be unclear about the meaning of the legislation or about the circumstances that apply to a request. Such an authority could initiate an application under the clause in order to obtain clarification from the commissioner, who would make the decision more straightforward. 
<P>
An applicant can complain under clause 50 in order to prompt a recommendation under clause 48, but such a complaint is not required to prompt a recommendation. The commissioner could reach a decision under clause 48 on her own initiative or on the prompting of any other person. A third party could therefore seek such an indication from her. If an application obviously relates to an issue about which a public authority is unclear, it can seek the commissioner's assistance at any stage, so it will not have to wait until it has made a decision or is about to make a decision. 
<P>
Those are the intentions of the clause. The hon. Member for Ryedale said that the amendment sought to probe, and I hope that I have reassured him on his concerns. If the amendment were adopted, however, the clause would be less clear. It allows the commissioner to review a decision under clause 13 on her own initiative or at the request of a third party as well as at the request of an applicant. The amendment could raise questions about that autonomy and put in doubt whether a review must be conducted at the request only of the authority or the applicant. Perhaps that is what the hon. Gentleman intends, but I am not entirely clear about whether he wants a third party to be able to request clarification from the Information Commissioner. Our view is that it should be straightforward for the commissioner to accept a request made under the clause, provided that she thinks that clarification is necessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Under-Secretary has confirmed the Government's position. I hear what he says about why the provision is included in part III and agree that that confirms that it deals with a reviewing process. However, his remarks lead neatly into the Opposition's next concerns about unclear intentions in the clause, which will be best dealt with during consideration of subsequent amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 160, in page 26, line 8, leave out `have'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 161, in page 26, line 9, leave out `informed,' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`inform,'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 162, in page 26, line 10, leave out `communicated' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`communicate the'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendments were originally drafted to be consequential on amendment no. 159. Given the Under-Secretary's confirmation that the commissioner or a third party could trigger the mechanism, I realise that that amendment would not be appropriate. However, had it been accepted, we would have needed to change the tense of the rest of the clause, which uses the past tense. 
<P>
Line 11 of clause 48 implies that a review will take place only when a public authority has made its decision under clause 13 not to release information. The phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and has not done so'',
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
has triggered the concern that the clause is part of the enforcement process. When reviewing a decision not to release information that was taken in respect of clause 13 provisions, the commissioner might decide that she can make a recommendation only about release. But that process happens after a decision not to release has been made. The Under-Secretary said that it is conceivable that the review could take place before a public authority has made a decision whether to release information. Therefore, it could request advice from the commissioner. If that is the intention, the amendments would not be appropriate because they are linked to our earlier amendment. However, the Under-Secretary should think about whether the clause should be clarified because that would have a beneficial effect on understanding the Government's intentions. 
<P>
As well as the opportunity to review a decision that has been made, there is the chance to review in advance whether a public authority should release or withhold information. It is important to consider what would happen if the public authority chose to ignore the commissioner's recommendation. In light of what the Under-Secretary said about amendment No. 159, we are right to suggest that the clause needs some attention if it is to have the intended effect.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 48 enables the Information Commissioner to take action when she believes that a public authority should have disclosed information or informed an applicant that it holds information under clause 13 provisions. The commissioner may issue a discretionary disclosure recommendation in writing, specifying information that should be disclosed. 
<P>
The effect of the amendments would be to enable the commissioner to issue recommendations specifying information that should be disclosed, without having to wait for the authority to make a decision under clause 13. In effect, that would mean that the Information Commissioner could try to pre-empt an authority when a decision had not yet been made and the authority had not yet made a request. To allow the commissioner to issue a recommendation about what information should be disclosed under the discretionary disclosure procedure before a public authority has even considered whether the information should be disclosed would be to put the cart before the horse. The commissioner's role is to review decisions and recommend disclosure. An authority will then have to consider the recommendation and decide whether to follow it. That does not mean that an authority may not seek advice from the commissioner before then, just that the formal recommendation procedure may not be invoked until after the decision under clause 13 has been made. 
<P>
There are two issues here. The first is whether the public authority can ask the commissioner to clarify its obligations, and the answer is yes. The second is whether a third party or an applicant can go to the commissioner and say, ``Before the public authority has made its decision, I want you to make a recommendation on what that decision should be.'' That would create an entirely different situation, so that an applicant would be able to prejudge the decision of the public authority, and the decision would, in theory, be not that of the public authority but that of the Information Commissioner. That is not what we want. There will be an option to apply to the Information Commissioner just to seek advice, if that is appropriate, which, I believe, will mainly be used by public authorities. However, if a decision is made with which an applicant does not agree, that applicant will be able to seek a discretionary disclosure recommendation from the commissioner, and it will then be up to the public authority to determine how to react to that recommendation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> So that we can be clear, is the Under-Secretary saying that, if a public authority were to go to the commissioner and say, ``We are not quite sure what to do here. We would like your advice.'', and if the commissioner were then to advise the authority to release the information, by implication, the public authority would form the view that, if it did not release the information, it would be likely—even without an applicant making an application—that the commissioner would issue a discretionary disclosure notice if the decision then goes against the release of the information? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> For entirely different reasons, a decision might be made not to disclose, so the public authority might have to ask whether it could interpret the law in a particular way with regard to the information that it was being asked to disclose. It may then seek a view from the Information Commissioner on that point, and the commissioner would give a view. The public authority would then examine the request for information and may conclude, on a different point, not to disclose the information. That is still a matter for the authority, but it may be that, having received a discretionary disclosure recommendation under the clause, the authority would then decide not to release the information on a totally different basis. 
<P>
We do not want to put the cart before the horse. Our aim is to ensure that the process operates with maximum flexibility and enables a public authority to make a request to the Information Commissioner. It might even mean that a third party will seek advice on a particular point, if that is appropriate, but not a formal recommendation, until the public authority has made a decision, but at that point, a formal recommendation may be made. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): The example given by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of a public authority trying to decide whether to use its discretion seemed to rest on a technicality, but surely he would accept that the occasions on which an authority's decision not to disclose will be contentious will be when disclosure would embarrass that authority because it has opened itself up to public criticism. Does he think that it is satisfactory that an authority should have the right to judge itself in that way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sure how my hon. Friend's point relates to the issue that we are discussing. He makes a broader point, which he may wish to address later, but I am unsure how it relates to the amendment. We are dealing with the issue of whether the Information Commissioner may prejudge the decision of a public authority. My answer is clear; no, the Information Commissioner does not prejudge, although she may offer advice on a narrow point. 
<P>
In considering whether to disclose a piece of information, several issues may arise. It will be for the public authority to determine whether it should disclose the information under the right to know that the Bill will create. If it decides not to disclose the information, it will be for the applicant or third party or, indeed, for the public authority—although I suspect that a public authority would do so before the decision is made—to decide whether to refer the matter for a discretionary disclosure recommendation. The procedure seems to be straightforward. It merely creates a procedural device to enable everyone to receive information about what they should be doing. The Information Commissioner may initiate a decision, if she thinks it appropriate, but I suspect that she will be busy making all the other decisions that she must make. If a third party, an applicant or a public authority wants to seek her intervention, the clause provides for that. 
<P>
The amendment would complicate the matter because it does not make it clear how the commissioner would determine which cases are suitable for a recommendation. When a recommendation is made after the authority has made its decision, the position is clear. The commissioner is likely to exercise the power to make a recommendation if she disagrees with the decision taken, but if she is to act before that decision, how is she to know in which cases to make a recommendation? The commissioner would be forced to guess which decisions would go against the applicant under clause 13. That does not strike me as being a sensible use of the valuable resources of the Information Commissioner. We do not want to create an Alice in Wonderland world, in which judgments should be reached and recommendations issued in a void because an initial decision has not been made. If the freedom of information regime is to have credibility, it is important that actions, decisions and recommendations should be based on an objective and informed assessment of individual cases. 
<P>
We should not lose sight of the fact that the public authority is the primary decision maker. The commissioner can issue a recommendation if she feels that an authority has made a wrong decision. Allowing her to issue a recommendation on disclosure before the authority has made a decision would confuse the commissioner's role as a reviewer of decisions with that of a maker of decisions. In view of those difficulties, I invite the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This has been an important exchange from which several issues have emerged that will inform later debate. I understand the point made by the Under-Secretary, who clarified the Government's position in our brief exchange, although he prompted the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) to anticipate where the intentions to which he referred come in the overall scheme of things. 
<P>
The clause effectively provides an opportunity for the commissioner to review a decision that has been taken. I take the point that we are dealing with the past tense. The commissioner can review a decision not to release information taken under the discretionary powers in clause 13, prompted by the applicant, by a third party or by the public authority, although I cannot quite understand why an authority would wish to seek a review of a decision that it has taken. Such a review can also be initiated by the commissioner herself. Having reviewed the decision, the commissioner can then recommend that an authority that has chosen not to disclose information should have done so. We are clear about those intentions. 
<P>
I do not want to prolong the debate, but I must say that I am not entirely sure that people outside the Committee will immediately understand that that is the way things stand. I do not seek a formal undertaking, but I urge the Under-Secretary and his officials to reconsider the clause in respect of another, second point. He has told us that it is perfectly in order for an applicant, a third party, the commissioner or a public authority—that is the important part—to seek the commissioner's advice about whether a public authority should use its discretion to release information in particular instances. That process is not clear from the wording of the clause, and can, we are told, occur in advance of the taking of a decision. The Opposition believe that such a mechanism is wholly desirable, especially in respect of the many public authorities that are not Departments of State. The clause does not make it clear, however, that such a mechanism is provided or that the provisions can apply to two separate processes: a pre-decision review and a review of a decision already taken.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hope that I can clarify that point, as I am anxious to avoid confusion on the commissioner's authority to give advice. An application may be made under the clause, but authority in respect of advice lies in clause 46(2), which deals with the commissioner's ordinary ability to give advice on any issue. Such an ability does not, therefore, have to be created anew in clause 48. We have ensured a procedure to enable public authorities to seek advice; clause 48 ensures that a post-decision recommendation is also available. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I hear what the Under-Secretary says, but I am not sure whether he has entirely clarified the matter. Clause 46(2) is a general provision that does not cover the seeking by a public authority of the commissioner's advice in advance of the taking of a decision. I do not want to prolong the debate, as the Under-Secretary and I do not disagree about the intention. I am merely questioning—as I have sought to do through other amendments—whether what is intended is clear and fully covered by the provisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): As a point of reinforcement, I should say that it is likely that public authorities in particular will use the opportunity, if available, to seek prior advice of the commissioner, because that would give comfort and guidance. There is a parallel in the already established procedures in law on confidential guidance given by the Competition Commission. It would be helpful to consider the matter. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I do not want us to spend more time discussing the subject, which I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider again. However, we are entirely on all fours. Our substantive disagreement concerns the commissioner's powers and whether recommendation is adequate. We do not think that it is, but that is a separate argument. If the Government are to insist on the commissioner having the power only to recommend release and not to require it, it is crucial that everyone understands the mechanism. There should be a formal provision of advice; we are not clear whether the wording makes that obvious. Having explored the issue, I do not wish to detain the Committee further, and so beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 26, line 30, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The complainant may also apply to the Commissioner for a decision in cases where a public authority has not complied with a discretionary disclosure recommendation given under section 48.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is difficult to discuss the issues in isolation because the amendment is part of a scheme of enforcement procedure including amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 and new clause 1, to which we shall come. Our narrowest point regards the Government's insistence on having the commissioner recommend whether a public authority should release, or should have released, information. The previous debate was important because, notwithstanding the possibility of persuading the Government to include a power for the commissioner or the tribunal to require the release of information, there was at least the sensible option of a review procedure to make a recommendation. 
<P>
What would happen if the public authority ignored the recommendation and decided not to release the information? The question has caused concern because the power of decision currently rests not with the commissioner or the tribunal as independent arbiters but with the public authority, the Minister or one of the quangos listed. That is not good enough. A public authority's decision not to release information but to exercise its discretion to withhold it under clause 13 might be reviewed. What would happen if the public authority ignored a recommendation made by the commissioner? The amendment is intended to clarify whether the applicant would be able to ask for the matter to be considered again. At present the alternative under the Bill would be for the applicant to obtain through the courts some judicial review of the public authority's decision to ignore the recommendation. 
<P>
I anticipate that the Under-Secretary will say that no Minister likes a ruling from a parliamentary ombudsman that he and his Department are guilty of malpractice or maladministration and that, equally, no Minister would feel comfortable ignoring a recommendation to release information. In reality, that would be seen as the lesser of two evils of embarrassment. The Minister concerned might be less embarrassed to face media wrath at his ignoring a recommendation than he would be to release the information, supposing that that would involve huge embarrassment to those with the highest authority in government. 
<P>
Our aim, as a prelude to subsequent amendments, is to argue that if the Government believe there is merit in a recommendation procedure—notwithstanding the possibility of improvements to the powers under the Bill for requiring the release of information—the Bill should make it clear that an applicant could challenge, through the commissioner and, eventually, the tribunal, a public authority's decision not to follow a recommendation. 
<P>
The kernel of the matter concerns the question whether, as amendments Nos. 6, 7, 61 and 62 would provide, the commissioner should have the power to require the release of information. In that case, the Minister would have to decide whether to include clause 48 at all. That is why our earlier discussion was so important. We see sense in retaining clause 48 as a prelude to an ultimate requirement to release information, whereas we all know that it has been included instead of such a requirement. 
<P>
Clause 48, if it remains, gives rise to a need for a review mechanism, involving first the commissioner and ultimately the tribunal, for decisions not to abide by recommendations. That process should provide for a requirement to release the information, if appropriate. We should bear it in mind that if that stage were reached, a commissioner would have recommended the release of information and the public authority would have refused. A second opportunity would then be given for the public authority to demonstrate its reason. That would create a significant additional pressure to favour the release of information over secrecy. 
<P>
The fact that a public authority declines to abide by a recommendation that is made under clause 48 should not be the end of the matter. The Bill should go further. The first step would be to extend the powers that require a decision to be reviewed by the commissioner to include a decision not to abide by a recommendation. The Under-Secretary made it clear that clause 50 triggers clause 48. An applicant could say to the commissioner, ``I wanted this information. They haven't provided it. Please will you review that decision?'' What happens if the commissioner finds that the public authority was wrong to use its discretion under clause 13 and makes a recommendation that is ignored? There should be a further process. I hope that that is the Government's intention. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me deal first with the amendment and then with the broader issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale. 
<P>
The amendment would introduce a specific right for a complainant to apply to the Information Commissioner for a decision when a public authority has not complied with a discretionary disclosure recommendation under clause 48, but it would achieve nothing. The clause provides applicants with a right to complain about an authority's compliance with part I. As for decisions that are pursuant to clause 13, a decision notice is limited by virtue of clause 50(7). The amendment would not remove that limitation. It would not give the commissioner a greater power. If the limitation were removed so that the commissioner could issue a decision notice in respect of disclosure of information under clause 13, the amendment would be rendered otiose. It would not take us far. 
<P>
As for broader principles, clause 48 provides an alternative route, which in practice is probably the better approach. In many ways, the issue goes to the heart of what we are trying to achieve. We are not trying to create an Information Commissioner who will make decisions for public authorities, but public authorities that take decisions to disclose information and comply with the public's right to know. It is our aim that the pubic authority be the decision maker, not the Information Commissioner. She reviews the decision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me continue because I think that I am about to cover my hon. Friend's point. 
<P>
What happens if an authority decides not to disclose information under clause 13, notwithstanding the commissioner's recommendation under clause 48? As with the parliamentary ombudsman, we expect the recommendations to be followed. The commissioner can also name and shame a public authority that does not follow a recommendation. In addition, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, a judicial review challenge is available to an applicant who believes that a public authority's decision is contrary to case law and administration. Judicial review remains an option. The courts would need to take into account the fact that the Information Commissioner has taken a view on a decision. 
<P>
The idea that there is no legal recourse is wrong. More importantly, if a Minister's decision not to disclose information because it might be embarrassing goes against the Information Commissioner's recommendation, he would have to ensure that he had the collective support of the Cabinet and probably the whole Government. His decision would have serious implications. It would almost certainly require a debate on the Floor of the House and someone would probably be hauled before a Select Committee. There would be a great deal of controversy. It is inconceivable that Ministers would take such a decision lightly. It would not happen; it is not real politics. 
<P>
It was suggested to me that a Minister might take such a decision if personal information was requested on a high-profile individual who was the subject of legal proceedings. It would be up to the courts to determine the law on that, but the advice to, for example, the Home Secretary might be not to disclose that information for reasons of privacy and because of human rights legislation. The Home Secretary would have to ensure that he had collective support and be prepared to defend the decision in Select Committees and on the Floor of the House. He would have to be on firm ground. 
<P>
I suspect that the decision would be taken only if it were absolutely essential. The idea that a Minister would do so because information might merely be embarrassing to the Government is, in itself, embarrassing. A decision would have to stand up and not be overturned by judicial review. The idea that a fanciful scandal could be hushed up and would not be subject to substantial political discourse is unrealistic.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I find the Under-Secretary's argument breathtakingly naive. Was he in the House at the time of the Scott inquiry? Does he recall the previous Government's attitude? Is he saying that a bit of publicity can embarrass a Minister to change his or her settled opinion? Ministers are right hon. and honourable people. They can decide, in their wisdom, to oppose disclosure. It is amazingly naive to suggest that a Minister who believes that disclosure is wrong and against the public interest would admit, after a bit of pressure from the newspapers, that his judgment was incorrect and agree to release the information. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend has chosen one of the worst examples to defend his case. The Scott inquiry examined circumstances in which Ministers in the previous Government tried to restrict the publication of information. That information became the subject of enormous controversy. It was made public and Ministers were hauled before a public inquiry and had to defend themselves. The Scott inquiry was a substantial scandal with extensive repercussions, not least in my area, where Matrix Churchill workers are still trying to deal with the consequences of ministerial decisions. 
<P>
My hon. Friend did not give a good example. He accuses me of naivety, but I accuse him of not getting his act together on the arguments, which are clear. If an Information Commissioner were to make a recommendation to a Department's disadvantage, it would be a very brave Minister who, merely to hush up a scandal, would take the risk of putting the whole Government on the line, of causing substantial public controversy and perhaps of losing the next general election. Such a Minister would also risk a public investigation such as the Scott inquiry and might be questioned through other means such as judicial review. 
<P>
It is difficult to foresee such circumstances. The issues raised by the Scott inquiry show the weakness of the case presented by those who suggest that Ministers would treat recommendations made by the Information Commissioner in a cavalier way. They almost certainly would not deal with them in such a manner. If any lesson was learnt from the Scott inquiry, it was that Ministers could not easily hush up their decisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am trying to understand my hon. Friend's remarks. He appeared to suggest that no Minister would go against a decision made by the Information Commissioner because to do so would be too embarrassing. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Well, that is what he is saying. He is saying, ``Don't worry about this.'' 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Let me finish my intervention. The Under-Secretary is saying that we should not worry, because any Minister who disregards a decision made by the Information Commissioner will be foolish and impolitic. Is not he telling us that? If he is saying that the Information Commissioner's ruling will be law and that Ministers will comply with it, why will he not give the commissioner the power to enforce it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Because that is not what I am saying. As I said, a Home Secretary might decide that the Information Commissioner's view is not one that he is able to accept. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Or wants to accept. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A Home Secretary will have to defend his position in such circumstances, and might be able to do so on the grounds that he is complying with the Human Rights Act 1998 and that his interpretation of the law and his legal advice are different from those of the Information Commissioner. Such a difference would be entirely feasible. In such circumstances, he might feel unable to accept a decision and be fully prepared to argue his case in justifiable terms to show that he is taking a reasonable step. 
<P>
The fundamental difference between my hon. Friend and me is on whether an elected Government should take the decision about what is in the public interest. We take the view that, by and large, the Minister should be able to take decisions on serious issues that affect the country as a whole. However, checks and balances must apply. No one is suggesting that the Minister should be able to take decisions in a free-wheeling and cavalier fashion. A decision should be subject to checks and balances and to the ability of the Information Commissioner to make a recommendation. The point is that the Minister will have to justify his decisions. If there is no good reason for a decisions, that will quickly become apparent. That will lead to substantial public criticism, inquiries and the type of mess that the previous Government got into in respect of the Scott inquiry. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> But at the end of the day, the Minister will decide. Where is the check and balance in that? The Bill gives ultimate power to the Minister and no check and balance whatever will apply if he finally decides that he is correct. How does that approach differ from the status quo? The Minister currently has the final say, as it is up to him to decide whether to release information. The Under-Secretary is leading us inexorably towards the conclusion that, although the Bill is well intentioned, the nub is that it does not substantially change the current circumstances, in which the Minister makes up his or her mind on whether to release information. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend is fundamentally wrong and completely ignores the Bill's effects. It creates new circumstances, in which the Information Commissioner can make a recommendation— 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> But not enforce it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will my hon. Friend let me finish? The commissioner can make a recommendation on whether a Minister should disclose information. That is a very important difference from current legislation and it takes us beyond the status quo. There is not currently an Information Commissioner, but the person in that role will have considerable authority in such cases. That authority will not come from an ability to enforce but from a moral authority enabling the commissioner to make an objective decision. It is conceivable that a Home Secretary and an Information Commissioner could receive conflicting legal advice, that a different view of the public interest might be determined and that that difference could be legitimate on both sides. In my view, it is right in such circumstances that the view of the democratically elected Government should be subject to the will of Parliament to hold a Minister properly to account. That is where my hon. Friend gets it wrong. The idea that a Minister is not subject to checks and balances when he must defend a decision not to comply with the commissioner is untenable and does not submit itself to rational argument. 
<P>
My hon. Friend takes the view that the commissioner should be able to overrule the Minister. He and I disagree on that, but he is perfectly entitled to take that view, which other hon. Members share. The Government take a different view. The differences between us depend on whom we believe the House should regard as having the overall decision-making capacity in determining the public interest. We believe that a democratically elected Government should have that capacity and my hon. Friend believes that a non-elected public official should have it, which is a legitimate difference of opinion. 
<P>
There may be similar, proper differences between a Minister and the Information Commissioner, which are openly argued and in respect of which nothing is secret, on whether a piece of information should be disclosed to the public. Such information may concern somebody's medical records and may relate to a public decision of a sort that the Committee can easily imagine. A perfectly proper difference of view may exist about whether that information should be released. There is nothing wrong with such a difference, which can be openly argued on the Floor of the House and defended by a Minister who may cite the legal advice that he has been given and deal with challenges deriving from legal advice tendered to the Information Commissioner. To suggest that this is a conspiracy to protect Ministers from embarrassment is to misunderstand the situation with which we may need to cope in the real world. That is where I believe that my hon. Friend has got it wrong. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Nobody has used the word ``conspiracy''. The Under-Secretary is panicking, but he must be able to see that his argument turns in on itself. The checks and balances that he identifies in a Minister having to justify himself on the Floor of the House, subject to the bar of public opinion, are real pressures, but they are precisely the pressures that currently exist. The Under-Secretary has not identified a single new check or balance in addition to those that already exist on a Minister who refuses to release information. The Bill does not increase the checks and balances on a Minister's discretion to release information by one iota. 
<P>
Before the Under-Secretary responds, will he also consider another point? Unless I have lost track, the clause does not give powers only to Ministers, but to all public authorities and bodies. The Government are granting the power to determine whether to release information not only to Ministers, who are subject to public pressure, but to local authorities, such as Westminster, which had trouble with cemeteries and sales of land, and to hospitals, such as the Bristol hospital that got into difficulties over information. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is plenty of opportunity for speeches, but this is a long intervention. I would prefer interventions to be short and crisp and for speeches to follow, if appropriate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to you, Dr. Clark, but this is such an important point, which goes to the nub of the Bill's effectiveness. The Under-Secretary does not seem to understand that the Bill does not change the status quo. The checks and balances that he has identified are the same as those that already exist, and they apply only to a Minister, not to other public authorities who will have the ability to determine whether to release information.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend says. In essence, he has repeated the argument that he put to the Committee earlier and with which I sought to deal. There is no advantage in me repeating what I said. He and I fundamentally disagree on this issue. I do not believe that we are preserving the status quo—far from it. We are creating a new situation, in which checks and balances will exist in the power of the Information Commissioner to make a recommendation that will have substantial public authority. I do not accept the idea that such a recommendation is virtually akin to the current position. 
<P>
We have already debated my hon. Friend's second point about other public authorities as it relates to clause 13. Clause 1 creates a statutory right of access to information. Clause 13 creates a statutory duty to consider disclosure of exempt information. Whether information is exempt is a matter that the commissioner can determine and make enforceable decisions about. The new powers of recommendation under clause 48 are also new. Those powers make the prospect of judicial review of any decision more real than before. The idea that the Bill will preserve the status quo is untenable. New laws will come into effect, which will provide for a recommendation to be made and for the courts to subject any decision to judicial review. It might not be what my hon. Friend wants, but it is entirely different from the current situation and will give the public a much greater right of access than they have now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I am sure that hon. Members have listened riveted to the debate, for the issue is noble and, perhaps, the most important that we have considered. The debate between the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central revealed not so much a different interpretation of the amendment's effects as a different political and constitutional philosophy. 
<P>
I hesitate to inject an alternative note into the debate, because our sympathies are strongly with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. However, the Under-Secretary has seriously overstated his position in suggesting that, because of the measure, we shall move into a new world regarding the commissioner's power to administer a slap on the hand of a public authority that decided not to respond. 
<P>
I cannot predict with more certainty than other hon. Members the way in which public authorities will react to such a slap on the hand. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration's use of such a power has varied from that of the local government ombudsman. However, it is highly unusual—almost unknown—for public authorities and Ministers to turn their face against the parliamentary commissioner's ruling. The convention was established early in the life of the parliamentary ombudsman, probably by the decision of the late George Brown in the Sachsenhausen case. He was minded to pay no attention to the ombudsman's conclusion and to decide in the public interest that damages should not be paid to those held in the military, rather than the concentration camp, wing of the complex. However, he knuckled under and the Government accepted that such the ombudsman's decision should be accepted as public policy because that was where the public interest lay. 
<P>
We who think like the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and for Ryedale are trying to give the Information Commissioner authority comparable to that enjoyed by the parliamentary ombudsmen in such cases. The acceptability of having an outside official, appointed by the Crown, determining where public interest lay was established by the practice of a Labour Government. The Under-Secretary suggested that there was something almost undemocratic in that, but the principle that such authority may exist is long established under the constitution—it is not a flagrant violation of the democratic principle. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary's characterisation of public authorities as more democratic than such procedures seemed a far-fetched description of our constitutional arrangements. These authorities are not all Ministers of the Crown like the Home Secretary. There may be arguments about whether the Home Secretary's power is democratically based, as he is not directly elected to the post—constitutionally, he owes it to the prerogative power of the Crown to appoint Ministers on the advice of the First Minister. However, I reject arguments that are as theoretical as that one. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who has almost conceded the point. In effect, any Minister taking such a decision would have to be sure of collective support. Although the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that, in theory, the Home Secretary is appointed by the Prime Minister, in practice, such a decision is so important that collective support is required. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am not entirely sure about that—even if the Under-Secretary is theoretically right, the Home Secretary's arguments would not be accepted by other Ministers sharing collective responsibility. It would be said that the Home Secretary was responsible for making such decisions, and who were they to question them? Such authority is, in practice, considerable. 
<P>
I am not trying to make a theoretical point about democracy and the undemocratic nature of appointed Ministers. I sometimes think that they behave more like sovereigns and monarchs than like democratic representatives. There is a serious issue, which the Minister has brushed too easily aside, about whether the advice of the Information Commissioner will be given equivalent weight in the Government to that of the parliamentary ombudsman. Will it, instead, be treated more like that of the local government ombudsman, which is too often brushed aside and not given effect? We cannot tell that in advance. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary and his colleagues have demonstrated that they wished to see changes to the existing culture. He thought that the rejection of advice would be highly unusual. However, if the law is not to develop by authorities saying that they, rather than the independent commissioner, had the power to decide to release information and concluding that it was better not to disclose, Ministers must highlight the enormity of rejecting the commissioner's advice. 
<P>
It is not undemocratic for Parliament to appoint a person with the authority to scrutinise and to judge. The Government began by rejecting such arguments when they gave the Bank of England the power to decide where the public interest lay on one of the most sensitive issues—the setting of interest rates. The argument that that was a profoundly undemocratic act, or that it was unreasonable for Ministers not to have the final word on the subject, has not carried the day. We are considering an analogous situation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman comment on the position, not of Ministers, but of the 200 plus bodies in schedule 1 that will also have the power to determine where interest lies? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Yes, I was intending to do that but, because the Under-Secretary focused on the Home Office, I thought it better to start there. 
<P>
Often, Home Office Ministers especially are impressed by the seriousness of their role. They deal with state secrets and matters of high policy. Reaching that rarefied level is the culmination of a great career of decision making in the public interest. It is quite understandable that those concerned say to themselves, ``I am paid to take this decision, which is of massive importance. Why should not people trust me? I may not be paid as much as I would have been in industry, but I am making these decisions.'' The panoply of office, the boxes and all the rest of it inculcate a sense of the crucial nature of the role. There is the sense that the buck stops somewhere. That is the background against which we are asking for the cool light of an outside judgment, unaffected by the history of a matter, to be brought to bear on the question whether the discretion has been aptly exercised. 
<P>
Even Home Secretaries are capable of making mistakes at times and defending ground that is not worth standing on, as a matter of honour. For such reasons we could rely on the judgment of an independent person, who would almost certainly be appointed with the advice and consent of, if not actually by, the Home Secretary or the other Ministers involved. It would be a person of undoubted weight and judgment. 
<P>
As to the point made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, relevant decisions may not arise in the rarefied atmosphere of high policy; they might come about as the exercise of discretion, at its worst, to cover up unwise behaviour or, to put it at its least severe, trivial maladministration or something mildly embarrassing. In those circumstances it would be patently right for a higher officer of state—the commissioner—to have the right to intervene and judge that the discretion had not been properly exercised. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary tells us that the remedy of judicial review is available. Yes, it is, but it is confined in its ambit and the tests are hard to surmount. It is extremely expensive and judges do not like to substitute their judgments for the discretion of those people appointed to do particular jobs. They do not see that as their role and only in flagrant cases do they think it appropriate. We are not thinking about such cases. I have attended closely to the Under-Secretary, but he is a little over-excited by the democratic authority and omnipotence of Ministers, and that has coloured his thinking and arguments to an extent that has made him less sympathetic than I should have hoped to the arguments of his hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. I hope that on reflection he will consider the issue again. 
<P>
The issue is a difficult one. It is not straightforward, because in the worst cases big decisions may need to be taken. However, I should have thought it possible for two wise individuals to determine where the public interest lay with respect to the disclosure of top level documents. In the event of a significant clash between the Home Secretary and the commission—if we have the right commissioner, and there is no reason why we should not—I would favour the commissioner. She would have no distorting vision or influence and the capacity to assess objectively. In the worst case scenario, if the issue came to a head, the Secretary of State could disclose to the commissioner the entire argument of what has persuaded him that the thinking is sound. The public interest would not be at risk by allowing the independent commissioner to have the last word on the matter. 
<P>
There is a difference of philosophy, but there is not such a gulf between us. I should like to do what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central suggested, but if the Bill remains unchanged, I hope that the Government will make it clear that it is an enormity not to accept the commissioner's view on the exercise of discretion. That would help to change the culture and the exceptions would be extremely infrequent. I am frightened that the culture will prove too strong and there will be little change. It is uncertain whether the awful prediction of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that the Bill might make no difference will come true.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I feared that the amendment would disturb the hornet's nest. It was inevitable that the contributions would be wide ranging. We cannot consider any aspect of clause 50 without regard to who should have the ultimate say in whether information is released. It is ironic that, while we have been listening to the exchange of views between the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central on the Scott inquiry, another part of the Palace is debating Iraq. The Scott inquiry was not the best example. Indeed, it was established by the previous Government to consider some difficult issues. There are better examples, but I do not want to detain the Committee. There will be plenty of opportunity to thrash out our views when we debate subsequent amendments. 
<P>
The debate has exposed three issues. First, the premise of the Under-Secretary's argument is that a recommendation by the commissioner is as good as a requirement that information should be released. But it is not. We are dealing not only with Departments and ministerial decisions, but with the gamut of public authorities, which includes local authorities. How many Committee members have experience of local authorities ignoring the decisions of local government ombudsmen? I have had two such cases in which the chief executives refused to give ground. That caused my constituents huge financial damage. Without Members of Parliament exposing the scandal of that practice, the world would never know about it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is a group of habitual offenders in local government who frequently ignore the ombudsman's decisions. There is no reason to think that they will not ignore the commissioner's recommendations. Indeed, they will be advised to do so by the proper officer of the council. Taking into account all the matters that he has to consider, the consequences of not accepting the commissioner's decision are likely to be more satisfactory than accepting it. That is why we need to strengthen the clause. 
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The decisions in both my cases were to do with money. Substantial savings were made. For all our support for the strength of the code, the status quo is not completely satisfactory. The Bill's purpose is to improve on that, but we are not doing so. The Under-Secretary says that a recommendation is as good as a requirement, but it is not. Doubtless we will discuss that further. 
<P>
The second issue, which is at the heart of the amendment, is that a decision not to follow a recommendation will be subject to judicial review. But the opportunity for judicial review should be the last refuge of the public authority when the decision to require the release of information needs to be challenged, for the reasons that the Under-Secretary gave. The Home Secretary may have a valid reason why information should not be released. Let him go to judicial review if he has been unable to persuade the commissioner or the tribunal that the information should be withheld. It should not be the first port of call for an applicant who discovers that a public authority has ignored a recommendation by the commissioner to release information. The Under-Secretary confirmed that that is the Government's proposal. 
<P>
The third issue is also at the heart of the amendment. Can the Government's preferred scheme be improved? As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) said, that could happen without undermining the arguments to retain decisions, as far as possible, as the preserve of public authorities. We do not want the commissioner or the tribunal to become the regular mechanism through which decisions to release information are made. But unless public authorities understand that the consequence of not releasing information is a swift and certain judgment from the commissioner that they will be required to do so, there will not be the change of culture that the Under-Secretary wants. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I can see that the hon. Gentleman is trying to find common ground between Committee members and the Under-Secretary, which is constructive and laudable, and he suggested one way of doing that. As we are not making much headway in convincing the Under-Secretary of our argument in relation to Ministers of the Crown, does he not agree that we might make more headway were we to distinguish between the authorities in schedule 1, including local authorities, and give the Information Commissioner enforcement powers either in the terms of the amendment or of the whole of clause 50, but leave Ministers in a different category? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a helpful intervention and holds out the tantalising prospect of half a loaf, which may be better than no loaf at all. Unless the Under-Secretary gives some ground, or gives some indication in response to this amendment—he has given none so far—or to other amendments that the Government are prepared to reconsider the matter, we shall want to return to the issue on Report. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is forgetting that we have already said that we will consider what hon. Members have said about clause 13. Concerns about enforcement of recommendations are closely connected with clause 13 and must be considered in the overall context. Certainly, in principle, Ministers are accountable in relation to the public interest, and the Government believe that that is important. Whether one says that democracy deserves two cheers or three, we should pay it some account. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is becoming an unusual loaf with three halves because the Under-Secretary has offered us the prospect of another half of another loaf. In response to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, the Committee's job is to press for the entire loaf and for what we believe is correct. We believe that the structure of the Bill can be improved. 
<P>
We have strayed a long way from the principle behind the amendment, which is that it is unsatisfactory for an applicant to have no other option than to seek judicial review if a commissioner's recommendation is ignored by a public authority. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central suggested that we could differentiate between public authorities and others. I would hope to avoid that, but it might be an approach worth pursuing. I have serious concerns not only that local government public authorities might ignore recommendations, but that many other organisations listed in schedule 1 might do the same. Many of those bodies are no longer accountable and might be prepared to run the gauntlet of damaging headlines appearing in the tabloids for a day or two in order to withhold information. Therefore, although I agree with the Under-Secretary that those matters are interrelated, clause 13 must be strengthened, and I am a little encouraged that we might see some prospect of that when the Bill returns to the House. 
<P>
In the meantime, we have made it clear that, whether there is a recommendation process or a straightforward requirement to release, an individual should have more opportunities to challenge decisions than those that are available under the Bill. It is wrong to tell such an individual, who has a shallow pocket, that he must apply for judicial review. The debate has made the Committee's views extremely clear. We can pursue the matter in the amendments that we shall debate shortly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we come to the next amendment, I remind hon. Members of the comment by the hon. Member for Ryedale that I was very charitable during the debate. However, my charity does know bounds. The wide debate ranged over much of the ground covered by the amendments grouped with amendment No. 61, so I do not expect such a wide or lengthy debate on them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 26, line 33, leave out `exhausted' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`taken reasonable steps to raise the matter in accordance with'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 163, in page 26, leave outline 36. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I hope that I will not exhaust the Committee in moving this relatively simple and straightforward, and to some extent probing, amendment. It is intended to investigate the Government's attitude to the operation, in this context, of the code of practice provided for in clause 44. We have not had a proper debate on that. 
<P>
Under clause 50 the commissioner is required to investigate a complaint 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless it appears to him—
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) that the complainant has not exhausted any complaints procedure which is provided''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That seems sensible, but there is a possibility—or a likelihood, unless that is not counteracted—that public authorities could erect byzantine, unduly complex appeals systems that could so protract the process that the applicant would find it difficult to take advantage of clause 50. 
<P>
That is not a purely theoretical problem. We have already seen how, in response to the code of practice established by the previous Government, some Departments have set about creating systems for reviewing initial decisions. A procedure operated by the Northern Ireland Office was brought to my attention, involving four separate appeal stages. I shall read it to make it clear that I am not talking about an abstraction. Its Environment Department's procedure stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The formal procedure for internal review of appeals against disclosure of information is as follows. Initial appeal will be to the Grade 7 in charge of the Branch which dealt with the request. Heads of Division may wish to review the decision to deny access to the information at this stage in conjunction with the Central Management Branch, or as necessary with the Departmental Solicitor. If not satisfied with this review, the applicant will be entitled to ask the Under Secretary with lead policy responsibility to review further the decision to refuse access. If the applicant is still not satisfied the Permanent Secretary may be asked to arbitrate and in extremis the case may be referred to the Minister. If the applicant is still not satisfied the Ombudsman may be involved in reviewing the Department's decision.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I venture to suggest that such a process could baffle the public.

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman is providing an illustration, rather than an example that is on all fours with the Bill. The procedure will not apply in the same way to Northern Ireland, which has special circumstances. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that Government Departments will have to comply with the Information Commissioner's code of practice and guidance.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> As I said, I should like to illicit from the Government clarification of their view on the exhaustion of local or departmental remedies and on the importance of handling the matters expeditiously. The procedure should not be so complex as to preclude or make untenable the remedy provided for by the Bill. The amendment seeks to avoid that, and I have illustrated the need to do so by referring to a specific example. I am advised that a number of other Departments, including the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence, have two stages of internal review, which must be undertaken before the public can approach the ombudsman. First, the individual who takes the original decision will be approached. Then the review will apply to a more senior person, although I gather that the process has been somewhat revised. 
<P>
I do not want to labour an obvious point. I hope that the Under-Secretary is sympathetic to the aims of the amendment, even if he is not entirely certain about the proposed means of achieving expeditious handling of the internal precedent inquiry by the public authority. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have sympathy with the views of the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, who made clear the need for straightforward procedures that are not only easy for the public and applicants to comply with but which are understandable to the Departments who will have to conduct them. If we were to introduce a complex system under which public officials had to refer every decision through an appeals procedure that they did not fully understand, the level of caution created would undermine the very change of culture that we seek to achieve. The important thing is for the procedures to be open and for a proper code of practice to be in place. We want to ensure that the procedures set out for the internal appeals mechanism are guided by the Information Commissioner. I do not want to predict what she will do, but I hope for and anticipate appropriate procedures. I share the right hon. Gentleman's view that those procedures should be straightforward, simple and easily understandable, although I shall not comment on the Northern Ireland example. We do not want to end up with complex procedures when we reach the end of the initial period, after which we hope not only that the law but the whole culture of Whitehall will be changed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Under-Secretary was extremely sympathetic, although he did not accept the amendment and forgot to advise the Committee not to accept it. In this instance, I shall not take silence as consent. As he has taken a sympathetic view and is clearly minded to take the right steps on the code and on regulations made under clause 44, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 27, line 19, leave out subsection (7). 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 6, in page 27, line 20, leave out `not'. 
<P>
No. 7, in page 27, line 22, leave out from `information' to end of line 26. 
<P>
No. 62, in clause 52, page 28, line 23, leave out subsection (2). 
<P>
No. 8, in clause 52, page 28, line 30, leave out `not'. 
<P>
No. 9, in clause 52, page 28, line 32, leave out from `information' to end of line 36. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As you said, Dr. Clark, we have covered the thrust of the objections made by some Committee members, including me, on the powers of the commissioner and the Minister's robust defence. It would therefore be otiose to delay the Committee too long on the amendment, which is another attempt to find a way through the thicket and to give stronger powers to the commissioner. In this instance, those powers relate to the public interest test. The clause allows the commissioner to issue a decision notice in response to a complaint, and so require an authority to comply with the Bill. However, because of the interaction of the clause with the discretionary disclosure provisions contained in clause 13, the commissioner cannot issue such a notice on public interest grounds. 
<P>
The differences of opinion between the Under-Secretary and hon. Members who object to that approach are clear. The amendment would remove some of the restrictions and at least put the commissioner's public interest powers on the same footing as her powers to determine whether information is exempt. The Committee is agreed that the class exemptions are especially widely and clearly drawn, indeed, we have discussed that on earlier clauses. Discretionary disclosure in the public interest is the only serious qualification to those exemptions. One step further down, it is only the Information Commissioner's use of that power that stands between an applicant and secrecy. It would be good to make progress and to find common ground with the Government on these matters. 
<P>
On a detailed point, will the Under-Secretary clarify a tiny aspect of the clause's relationship to clause 13, which may be unintentional? Will the public interest test apply when information is refused on cost grounds or to the extent that it is so refused? Clause 13(1)(a)(ii) suggests that it will apply, but the balancing test in clause 13(4) deals only with cases that involve exempt information and does not seem to apply to information refused on cost grounds. That may be the Government's intention or a drafting problem. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can confirm that the Government intend the test to apply. When we consider the application of clause 13, we shall ensure that that is clear. I am informed that clause 11 is an exemption. I hope that that explanation is helpful. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> May I take it that the Government will propose their own small amendment on that point to provide clarification? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We had taken the view that it was not necessary to table an amendment because the provision was clear. However, I shall reconsider clause 13 to ensure that it is completely clear, and perhaps write to my hon. Friend to draw attention to the inter-relationship of clauses 11 and 13. I hope that that will enable my hon. Friend to be clear in his mind that the test will apply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful response. Perhaps I am being especially stupid today, but the matter is not clear to me; it might be clear to better minds than mine. Will the Minister review it and consider whether a tiny and specific amendment would make it clearer? That would be helpful. 
<P>
My contention that the Bill would be better if subsection (7) was deleted was supported by remarks made by other Committees. I remind the Under-Secretary that the Lords Select Committee said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the ultimate decision whether information is exempt from such a right of access is made by a government Minister or public authority rather than by an independent arbiter, the law may be regarded as a statement of good intentions, but it is not a Freedom of Information Act as that term is internationally understood.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Select Committee on Public Administration made the same point: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In this crucial sense, the Bill continues the present discretionary system of the Code of Practice—it is `open government' and not `freedom of information' ''. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>I take the Committee to mean that open government and freedom are to be distinguished. Applicants drive the freedom of information process. Open government is driven by the Government's desire to be open, rather than by the desire of applicants—outside bodies—to seek information. Both processes are desirable, but they are not the same. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I see my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary nodding; I am glad that he takes the point. We have gone over the ground. If he looked at other Acts from around the world, he would see that such matters are handled differently, especially in the Irish Act. We cannot tell yet, but the Scottish freedom of information legislation might also handle it differently. 
<P>
To return to the discretionary powers, especially those with regard to the public interest, I should remind the Under-Secretary of what Elizabeth France—the Data Protection Registrar and Information Commissioner-designate—said in her evidence to the Public Administration Committee about the registrar's preferred solution. She said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think the simple remedy is to allow discretionary decisions to be reviewable and an enforcement notice issued if the Commissioner's view is that in spite of preliminary discussion about the balance the public authority has given what the Commissioner believes to be the wrong weight to some of the elements considered.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I do not want to review the discussion on the earlier amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale. I hope that the Minister will see sense in deleting subsection (7). I look forward to his reply, albeit with no great confidence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Like the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, I do not wish to rehearse arguments deployed in respect of an earlier amendment. However, it is worth recalling that the amendment would not give the commissioner the final power to overrule the Minister. It would import a right of appeal to the tribunal against the commissioner's decision, which could be used by a public authority under clause 56. Decisions would also be open to appeal beyond the tribunal on a point of law. There can be no question of an issue being arrived at in a rush, determined unadvisedly and with no redress. That fortifies the hon. Gentleman's approach.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has said, we rehearsed the arguments on an earlier amendment. However, I wish to make two or three further points to explain the rationale behind amendments Nos. 6 to 9, which apply to clause 52, as does amendment No. 62, tabled by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. They must be taken together. 
<P>
First, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Public Administration Committee's second report on the matter—confusingly, its first report of the Session—published on 30 November, made a telling point. It referred to the argument about whether the final power to decide to release information should be with Ministers, public authorities or the commissioner. We—including the Under-Secretary—must consider the Committee's judgment, which was: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We do not believe that this is consistent with moving from a code-based to a statutory framework for Freedom of Information.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is important. I do not know what can be done on a code-based system apart from have the parliamentary commissioner review decisions and make recommendations. 
<P>
I, and the Select Committee, believe that, in a statutory system with a framework of information, enforcement and decision notices and proper appeals through the tribunal, it should be possible to trust the bodies established to deal with matters to take decisions. Further, they should be trusted to issue not recommendations but requirements on what information should be released. As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross noted, there is a route of appeal to the tribunal if the public authority does not like a decision, and the tribunal may also be subject to judicial review. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) had such a scheme in mind when he published his White Paper. I should hate to think that we could let the debate pass without reminding the Under-Secretary of paragraph 5.6 on page 27 of the White Paper: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioner will be able to challenge authorities which refuse to release records and information which are subject to the Act. The Commissioner will have the power to order disclosure.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
However, such a scheme is not in the Bill. The commissioner has wide-ranging powers to order disclosure, but they do not cover the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of clause 13. 
<P>
There is a difference between such a scheme and the commissioner's ability to enforce an individual's rights to information and to know that information exists under clause 1(1). Rather than delete subsection (7) or clause 52(2), as the amendments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central would, we wanted to debate the possibility of allowing the differentiation to remain, but with the word ``not'' deleted in each case. It would be made clear that, in such circumstances, a commissioner could have the power to require the information to be released. That would suggest that the commissioner would have to determine, quite separately, whether to require information to be released, if it related to subsections (2) and (3) of clause 13. Were that power included in the Bill, it could be challenged through the tribunal by way of appeal and, ultimately, through judicial review. Whatever the niceties of the arguments, and whatever the technicalities about how that should be achieved, we have come to the ultimate crunch point in our deliberations. Will we send the Bill back to the House with the commissioner's powers unamended or will the Government approve an amendment that reflects the feelings of many Committee members and the views that were forcefully expressed on Second Reading? 
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will say something to suggest that the Government recognise the strength of our arguments and are prepared to do something. I say that more in hope than in expectation. I do not mean to be uncharitable, but this is the crunch point. I am unsure how we will proceed once we have heard the Under-Secretary's response, but this is a defining moment in Committee. We agree both with the Select Committee and with the White Paper that the commissioner should have the power to release information. One or other of the amendments would have that effect. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I begin by agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central—I have not had many opportunities to do that during the Committee. 
<P>
I agree that there is a distinction between the Government's intention to create a new culture of openness and the creation of laws that will enable an applicant to enforce openness. It is our intention that central Government and public authorities should create a culture in which the public's right to know is at the core of public administration. That should apply in a doctor's surgery as much as in the handling of politics on the international stage, provided that it complies with legislation. Nothing in the Bill requires secrecy, as clause 76 makes clear, and we intend to begin the process now—and continue it in future—of changing the culture under which public authorities operate. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would have the effect of removing the limitation on matters that may be addressed in a decision notice under clause 13. In particular, the commissioner would be able to require disclosure of exempt information if she believed that the public interest required that. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 would have a similar effect to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, and amendment No. 62 would have a similar effect to amendment No. 61, but in relation to enforcement notices. Put simply, the amendments would allow the Information Commissioner to override the exercise of the discretionary power of disclosure if a public authority had determined that the balance of public interest was such that it should not disclose information exempt under the Bill. 
<P>
Under the amendments, the commissioner's decision would be enforceable. We have expressed our view that the amendments would, artificially and unnecessarily, create a democratic deficit. A democracy must mean something. Despite the fact that, as E.M. Forster said, democracy is the worst possible system of administration except for all the others—two cheers for democracy rather than three—it does account for something. Some of the arguments that we have heard, seeking to shift the balance towards allowing an unelected official to overrule the democratically elected Government, are profoundly undemocratic. I do not want to reiterate arguments that have already been made, but there is an important distinction here. 
<P>
I listened to the representations that were made on clause 13, which is—far more than this clause—the part of the Bill on which hon. Members are looking to the Government to listen with care. A further effect of the amendments would be to make clause 48 redundant, yet the Committee seems to agree that clause 48 has some purpose. The clause enables the commissioner to issue a discretionary disclosure recommendation. The redundancy arises because I foresee no circumstances in which the commissioner would be tempted to issue a discretionary disclosure recommendation when the option of the direct route of a decision or enforcement notice would be open to her. 
<P>
The amendments strike at the heart of both the means of protection for such information and the concept of discretionary disclosure. I make no comments about Mrs. France, whom we intend to appoint as the first Information Commissioner. I have great respect for Mrs. France's work as Data Protection Registrar and have no doubt about her competence or the high standards that she will bring to the making of any decision, but I do not believe that she or her successors should always be regarded as the best people to weigh the balance of public interest in the exercise of discretionary disclosure. She is not elected. She has never had to knock on doors and talk to people about the issues that concern them. She is an extremely competent public servant, who is able to provide the proper check and balance that a democracy requires when it gives power to those who are democratically elected. That is one thing, but to go beyond that and give the Information Commissioner powers that might be even greater than those that we give judges to overrule Ministers and Parliament in certain circumstances is quite another. 
<P>
For example, a Minister might make a decision with which the Information Commissioner disagrees, but which is strongly supported by Parliament. It is even conceivable that the majority of the House would support the Minister's decision, for which there might be good legal reasons. Should we give an unelected public official the right to overrule a Minister and Parliament in those circumstances? We should be cautious about taking that route. 
<P>
The Bill is about balancing freedom of information and the right to know with rights of privacy and business confidentiality and the needs of efficient government. There is also a place in that balance, which I have not mentioned before, for democracy, with its faults as well as its benefits. Two cheers, perhaps, not three; but it is still the worst system of administration apart from all the others. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The public authorities covered by the Bill vary widely in the subject matter that they deal with. Each has an in-depth knowledge of its business, with which it deals daily. That compels us to the conclusion that those authorities should make decisions in relation to clause 13. There is a difference of view between those who tabled the amendments and the Government. We are listening with care, particularly on clause 13, but we think that the amendments are inappropriate. They would strike at the heart of the balance that we have tried to create between conflicting rights. I recognise that hon. Members, and indeed my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, are concerned about the discretionary disclosure provisions. I have said that we will consider those concerns in relation to clause 13. The Government will reflect further on what has been said in Committee and on Second Reading. If appropriate—and I cannot be definite about this today—the Government will table amendments on Report. 
<P>
Many of the points made in the debate, like much of the difference between my view of the matter and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, hang on how one interprets clause 13 with respect to the balance between the Information Commissioner and the public authority. I hope that I have shown a conciliatory approach, though not conceding the principle of the amendments. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear my hon. Friend the Under Secretary's more conciliatory tone and I am grateful for the closing remarks of his reply, but there is an enormous gulf between his position and that of the hon. Member for Ryedale, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and myself—as well as many people who are not members of the Committee. 
<P>
The clause and the amendment go to the heart of the Bill. The question is whether the Bill provides reasonable powers to make the right to know effective. If the Bill is to be anything more than well intentioned or a marginal—no, distinct—improvement on the present situation and if it is to move matters on and bring about a right of access and a right to know, it must be practicable. The Minister has used that word often in rejecting amendments. I take the word ``practicable'' to relate to whether a measure is capable of being put into practice and enforced. The enforcement powers in clause 52 are very weak. The amendment would strengthen them. 
<P>
Having listened to the hon. Member for Ryedale on amendment No. 6, I was much impressed by the neatness and elegance of removing one word. I wished that I had had the wit to understand that the clause could be changed by the removal of one word and possibly the amendment of another. He might have trouble with the word ``but'', which he might want to substitute with ``and''— 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In fact, amendment No. 7 would remove ``but'' and the rest of the subsection. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is true. 
<P>
As the Under-Secretary said, this is an important matter. In defending his position, he rightly praised Elizabeth France, but the Bill does not trust her to have enforcement powers. We can heap on her whatever praise we like, but the Bill does not trust her to be objective and make the final decision. She has the objectivity, but the Under-Secretary and the Government believe that the final decision, in difficult circumstances, should be made by those people with a subjective view who have a self-interest in defending their position that information should not be released. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman also embrace his earlier argument about authorities that are not Government Departments? I listed three—the Environment Agency, the Millennium Commission and the New Opportunities Fund. The Under-Secretary suggests that he does not trust the commissioner or the tribunal to make a decision on what information such organisations should be required to release. There is no question of democratic deficit because those bodies are not democratically accountable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman anticipates my point. The argument that the Under-Secretary adduces in support of his position is the democratic argument that he and other hon. Members have knocked on doors and are better in tune with decisions than a commissioner who is a public servant. The commissioner would consider decisions without ready and weekendly access to public opinion. 
<P>
We can take different views on that. The Under-Secretary's democratic argument would apply to local authorities, but none of the 200-plus bodies in schedule 1 has that democratic advantage. He believes that their opinion of whether information that could be prejudicial, embarrassing or critical of them should be released, should take precedence over the view of the Information Commissioner. The Advisory Council on Libraries should determine information and the Britain-Russia Centre is better to be trusted with disclosures about its activities than the Information Commissioner. The argument does not stand up. 
<P>
We may want to return to the attempt at conciliation, although I realise that we are not going to defeat the Government's decision on the role of Ministers. The Under-Secretary is determined that they will continue to have the final say on the release of information. We will have to test that on the Floor of the House or in another place. We should also test the idea that I floated. I presume that the Under-Secretary will not move on the role of local authorities. It is interesting that the Government defend local authority judgment over that of the Information Commissioner. Having been a local councillor, I believe in local authorities, although they are not perfect and I sometimes get the feeling that the Government do not trust them. 
<P>
The clause is an interesting example, however, of the Government having complete confidence in the judgment of local authorities to make decisions affecting their own interests. The hon. Member for Ryedale made a good point about that. When the Under-Secretary quietly considers it and discusses it with the Home Secretary, who has also been critical of local authorities over the years, he may want to reconsider his view. Is he really suggesting that local authorities should be able to cover up their own ineptness when the Information Commissioner, in all her objectivity and wisdom, could decide that they should not do so? That is the position into which he is putting himself. 
<P>
Whatever my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary feels about his own powers and those of other Ministers, when he sits the in the bath tonight, he will have an awful job in saying, ``I believe that local authorities should have precedence and that their judgment is better than that of the Information Commissioner; that is what the right to know means.'' He certainly cannot justify that view in relation to all the other indirectly democratic bodies that are listed and whose membership is appointed by the Government. The Under-Secretary is an honest and straight Minister who has often been very candid. I am sure that he will request that I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, and I shall do so, as the Committee has had a terrifically wide-ranging debate without getting anywhere with the Government. When he thinks calmly about the issues raised, however, I suspect that he will want to reconsider. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall give way to the Under-Secretary, in the hope that he has undergone a Pauline conversion at the last minute. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was hoping that my hon. Friend would allow me to reply rather than to make an intervention, as I should like to deal with several points. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall think again about whether to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend rightly said that he and the hon. Member for Ryedale have made some fundamental points. Those points essentially concern the role of democracy and a public official such as Elizabeth France. My hon. Friend tells me that unless the Government give her more power, we do not trust her. I must reply to that, as it is not the case. The Bill gives considerable power to Elizabeth France and to anyone else who will hold her post. That power confers the ability to influence the future development of public administration in this country, which shows that we trust both her and those who will follow her in the post. It is important that we place on record our high regard for her. The fact that she was appointed as the Data Protection Registrar and that we decided that she should have the broader role as Information Commissioner shows our confidence in her professional ability. Her role and that of her successors is to review, not to usurp the democratic and constitutional administration of this country. 
<P>
I shall return to my hon. Friend's point about non-elected, non-governmental public bodies, but I must say now that there is real concern that a democratic deficit will be created if Parliament and its rights are handed over to a non-elected of official by a decision made in the House. Arguably, that is done with judges, who are sometimes given power to tell Ministers what do. However, it is right that that should happen, and judges will continue to exercise those rights through judicial review and to fulfil their proper role. The creation of a new branch of government, which would not merely comprise legislatures, executives and judiciary but an Information Commissioner who would be all-powerful in determining the public interest, should be approached with more caution than some hon. Members are suggesting.
