<P>
<H5>12.50 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Shortly before the break, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that, on Second Reading, several hon. Members--
<P>
<B>The Chairman's</b> attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, she suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall start again, Mrs. Michie, because I said only half a dozen words. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said before the break that several hon. Members saw internment, with which clause 3 deals, as the key issue raised by the Bill. I shared that opinion on Second Reading and nothing that I heard in that debate or have heard in our debate on clause 3 has led me to revise that opinion. Indeed, there is an argument for saying that much of the rest of the Bill is the packaging that surrounds the gift of the end of internment, which the Government are offering to placate Back Benchers who feel strongly about the issue and who would prefer more action. I have no hesitation in saying that I am convinced that the matter is another instance of the Government being wrong.
<P>
The Minister has not yet addressed the fundamental point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire earlier, and several times on Second Reading. The arguments can be summarised briefly. They are well rehearsed, and there is no need to explore them in detail.
<P>
Opposition Members believe that internment is undeniably an infringement of civil liberties. It would be folly to pretend otherwise. It would be equally foolish to deny that when internment was introduced in the 1970s, it was a disaster. It was entirely counterproductive, and it left the IRA stronger. The Committee should not spend much time discussing these issues. It should acknowledge that internment is an infringement of civil liberties and that it failed drastically in the past. It by no means follows from that acknowledgement, however, and it is an ultimate non sequitur, to argue that the power to intern should therefore be abandoned. The drastic failure of internment in the past does not mean that it is bound to fail in future. There is no logical reason for drawing that conclusion.
<P>
Internment failed in the 1970s for a variety of reasons. One of them was that the then Government suffered from woefully inadequate and inaccurate intelligence. It failed also because it applied only to republicans, and therefore accentuated the sectarian divide between communities. That compounded its negative impact. Internment was, I believe, seen predominantly as a weapon of persecution used by the state against republicans. Some people would argue that internment failed in the 1970s also because it was not deployed at the same time by the Republic of Ireland. I do not believe that that is especially significant. Internment failed above all because the mood and character of the times was very far from supportive.
<P>
Acknowledging those factors does not mean that such circumstances will always prevail, for the simple reason that times change. For example, the quality and quantity of intelligence gathering has been transformed since the 1970s. If internment were used even-handedly against loyalist and republican paramilitaries, the stigma of sectarianism that plagued it in the 1970s could not arise.
<P>
Selective internment--as opposed to mass internment--could render terrorist activity virtually impossible, if it was aimed at breaking the chains of command and of communication without which that activity cannot occur.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, it is possible to envisage internment--especially selective internment--winning widespread support. There are no pragmatic, practical factors to prevent internment being effective. It would be foolish to deny that the principled objection--the civil liberties argument--has force. However, it no more carries the day than the practical or pragmatic objections.
<P>
<H5>1 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a fact of life that the power of internment has not been used for 20 years and has lapsed in a technical sense. Nevertheless, Opposition Members argue that the option should be retained. It is dogma gone mad to discard it.
<P>
The argument for retaining it is simple: we simply do not know what may happen, in Northern Ireland or anywhere else. So we cannot and should not discount the possibility that circumstances may arise when the use if internment could be justified on the grounds that it is lesser of evils. In such circumstances, the use of internment could save lives that it might reasonably be assumed could be lost without it.
<P>
A more elaborate version of that argument was put forward by several hon. Members on Second Reading, and by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire earlier. The Minister's comments on internment on Second Reading invite comment and investigation. The Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The fact that the provisions were not used during that period''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the period of 20 years--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and did not prove a deterrent against terrorism exposes their redundancy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does no such thing. The Minister made a bald pronouncement; he did not offer a reasoned argument. The period of 20 years demonstrated only that successive Governments decided that it was not appropriate or necessary to use internment. That does not expose redundancy; it shows that successive Governments judged that the circumstances did not justify internment. I accept that. The Minister continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government's clear view that internment did not represent an effective counter-terrorism measure in the past''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no serious quarrel with that. I agree with the Minister, who continued that internment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not represent one now''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
again, few of any Opposition Members would disagree--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and is not likely to do so in the future.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That too is probably right. Yet it is no reason to remove the power from the statute book. It is an opinion that future Governments are unlikely to use the power; it is not an argument for removing it from the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman should read on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall do so, as I enjoy reading the Minister's comments. He went on to say that the use of internment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would only ever have been justified in the last resort.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is my poiny exactly, He continued that it,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has never been seen as a means of achieving stability within the community.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree. I think that at times of heightened terrorist activity, or when such activity is anticipated, internment--the lesser evil--could be used to save life. It would certainly not be used to achieve long-term stability, but as a short-term security measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend used the word ``stability'' and developed his point to talk about long-term stability. No one would consider internment of any description as a policy that leads to long-term stability, but what about short-term stability? What if we needed quickly to stabilise an unstable situation and to take into state control people who were perpetrating violence on the streets and who posed a massive risk to society? Can my hon. Friend see merit in having a provision on the statute book to accommodate such a short-term situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Precisely; that is exactly my argument. I hope that my hon. Friend was not confusing the Minister's words with mine. My argument is that internment would be justified precisely when it could prevent the carrying out of acts of terrorism that would have an immediate destabilising effect and cost lives. In those circumstances, internment could be used.
<P>
The Minister went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government believe that the effect would be quite the reverse: it would increase community tension; cause serious damage to respect for the rule of law; strengthen the terrorist organisations; create political prisoners; and ultimately prolong the violence.''--[Official Report, 18 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 175.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not an argument, but a series of suppositions that are based on a premise--that the accuracy of the suppositions is taken for granted. That is a circuitous presentation of ideas, not a coherent argument from a basis.
<P>
The Minister does not give a single reason to justify his rejection of the argument that internment might, sometime and somehow, conceivably be the lesser of evils and justified because it saved life. I hope that the Minister will address that point. Will he say that we are wrong and that internment will not be used in those circumstances--even if the result is the loss of lives? If he does not accept that proposition, his argument will not stand up because he has not given us one reason to explain why we are wrong to say that internment in the rare circumstances that I have outlined is the lesser of evils and can be justified.
<P>
Clause 3 cannot be seen in splendid isolation. Several hon. Members have developed the theme that the Government's adoption or abandonment of security measures transmits a political message. On that basis, the Government's willingness to abandon the power to detain without trial is one expression of their wider, underlying approach to Northern Ireland. I regret that I cannot see many grounds for optimism about the peace process as it stands. I do not believe that the Provisionals are unequivocally and exclusively committed to non-violence and democracy--the pre-requisites of the Downing street declaration and of participation in the process. They have no intention of decommissioning unless the talks deliver what they want; nor do they accept the self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland or the principle of consent. It is because of the Government's assumptions that I believe their approach to the process is fundamentally flawed. Equally flawed is the measure before us.
<P>
I do not believe that the Government's attitude or approach accept that the Provisionals are remorselessly exploiting the process, and have been from the beginning. They won concessions by delaying their first ceasefire. They gained even more concessions during that ceasefire, and yet more concessions were made to secure from them the second ceasefire. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness that confidence building measures may be justified in certain circumstances, such as if all the participants were committed to the fundamentals of the Downing street declaration. But because the Provisionals are not, those confidence building measures--and I interpret this clause to be one--are in fact concessions.
<P>
This is the wider context in which clause 3 and the end of internment should be placed. I do not think that the Government have deliberately set out to concede or appease, but the effect of their policies is unintentionally one of appeasement. That is why the current situation is so very dangerous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I shall make a general point. There would be something terribly wrong with the parliamentary process if, in a Committee such as this, or on the Floor of the House, Back Benchers such as myself and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone cannot and do not question and tease out the elements of the legislative process. That would be unhealthy for all of us. That is why, in relation to the debate on the previous clause, I take a great deal of comfort in the fact that, for the first time in many years, that has been the case. I shall leave that general and basic point about parliamentary democracy there.
<P>
I have convinced myself that I will not say much about internment. I do not see the clause as a concession to anyone, nor do I think that it should be seen as such in a parliamentary democracy. The choice is between putting people in gaol without trial and without a verdict or sustaining the belief that all people are free before the law until they are found guilty. That is a fundamental premise. We cloud the issue by using the words such as internment, but we are talking about taking away a person's freedom without a trial or verdict.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman is now pursuing a philosophical, moral argument. He spoke earlier about a Bill of Rights, and I know that that is dear to his heart. As he perceives it, it would apply not just in Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom--it is about individual rights before the law. Yet the United States, which has a Bill of Rights and the fifth amendment, and which prides itself on having individual rights under the law, has twice in history, under Lincoln and Roosevelt, exercised a form of internment.
<P>
<H5>1.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is an interesting point. The hon. Gentleman referred to it as a philosophical point, which it is, if one wants to use such words. I believe that it is a moral point, which I will extend from his analogy with the United States. I feel no moral convergence whatsover with the United States in the way in which it uses capital punishment. I feel no philosophical convergence with it in the way in which it trades in political terms its process of justice against its electoral system. We want to be absolutely sure that we will never do that on this side of the Atlantic. One has only to consider some of the causes celebres in the prison population in the United States to realise that we should never take that route. We should therefore make a clear distinction between political concessions, as have been identified by some hon. Members, and points of principle.
<P>
It must remain a point of principle that people are innocent until proven guilty, and that is what internment is about. Once one accepts that internment is viable and possible, one steps away from that principle. That is something with which we should never bargain and never put at stake, whatever the perceived advantages of the past or of the American system, which I consider ephemeral. We should never barter with the principle of the assumption of innocence.
<P>
I have certain reasons for being committed to that view. I come from a long line of internees, going back long before the 1950s. People talk about internment as if it were something that was introduced in the 1970s, but it existed in the 1920s, the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s. Internment failed in each of those decades because of a common factor and if it had not done so, we would not be here debating it today. It is not a matter simply of failure but of cumulative failure, not in a negative but in a positive sense, however one views the matter.
<P>
I throw words off the top of my emotional head--the Argenta. Who will tell me which period of history that relates to? Most people here do not know what I am talking about. In the community in which I live the Argenta is a badge of honour for those who were interned in that prison ship. Many of our predecessors were there. Who remembers Ballykinlar? That was another step in the process of internment. We all talk about the Maze or, to update matters, Long Kesh, but the same principle was always at stake--taking away people's freedom without trial and experiencing political problems as a result. The same abject failure occurs each time.
<P>
How does that abject failure translate itself in political terms? I am probably better placed than most to say. It is part of nationalist folklore to say, ``My brother was on the Argenta'' or, ``My uncle was in Ballykinlar''. The failure has translated into a type of nationalist-republican folklore down the years, not in terms of the solution to the problem but the perpetuation of the refusal to solve it. That is what internment means to me.
<P>
I shall go to the grave remembering three things, in time and place. First, from the late 1960s, I remember exactly where I was, what I was doing and what I should have been doing on the day that John F. Kennedy was shot; secondly, from the early 1970s, I remember the day of internment; thirdly, I remember the day on which Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed. Internment is a failed experiment. It failed in the past, it would fail now and it would fail in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Mrs. Michie will call us to order if we indulge in a history debate, but do I understand the hon. Gentleman to be saying that neither in the 1920s nor in the 1940s did internment play a significant part in securing the cessation of IRA violence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. If internment had secured a cessation of IRA violence, we would not be discussing the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> As the hon. Gentleman surely knows, there have been times when the IRA has been militarily inactive. Two such periods were the 1920s and the 1940s when measures were taken, mainly by the Government of the Republic. One was internment. It resulted, for a period, in the cessation of IRA violence. In the light of that, how can the hon. Gentleman say that internment played no part? Surely that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to that matter. They were, in effect, incubation periods for this reason: the best way to create a university of terrorist violence is to intern people and put them in situations like those of Ballykinlar, the Argenta, Long Kesh or the Curragh. The matter is not just one of terrorist violence, but of perpetuating an ideology which has not given way.
<P>
I do not want to spend too long talking about history, but we should consider the 1920s and the decades through to the 1970s. All that occurred was brought to fruition by circumstances in which a better education system for terrorists could not have been invented. There were universities dedicated simply and solely to the ideology and pragmatism of political violence. I know that at first hand and it cannot be denied. People who have been involved in violence in the north of Ireland have exemplified it throughout my life. It is there. Play with it as we wish, but it must be ended. I commend the Government for ending it. There is no question or doubt in my mind that the only people whom internment suits are those people and those organisations which benefit from it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke made a reasonable point about internment in the Republic of Ireland, but I make exactly the same strictures in response. Let the Republic of Ireland remove it from its statute book, because it serves no purpose there or here. It serves none of us. It is wrong in philosophical, moral and political terms. It is as wrong in the south as it is in the north. The fact that it may be retained in the statute book in the south of Ireland means nothing to me. It is equally wrong there, and it is equally necessary that it be dealt with quickly.
<P>
It was suggested that internment should be used in the north and the south simultaneously. That will never happen. We will never see internment in the north of Ireland again. We will never see it in the Republic of Ireland again. We will never see it in the north and south again. Why? Because it is a failed process. It simply cannot work. The north of Ireland has changed radically, as has the Republic of Ireland. The relationship between Ireland and the rest of the world has also changed remarkably and fundamentally. No Administration in the north of Ireland, be it Labour or Tory, or in the Republic of Ireland, be it Fianna Fail, Fine Gael or a coalition, could ever hope to play its role in European or world terms with that blot on its legal character. For that reason, it will not happen.
<P>
Let us therefore stop talking about simultaneous north and south internment. The north and south should simultaneously try to deliver a political solution to the problems that internment was supposed to solve. They should do that quickly and positively, so that, in the ancient words, Ireland north and south can take its place as an equal among the nations of the world on the basis of strength, equality or justice--call it what you like. To hark back to the antiquated notion that there could somehow be an alternative to that is to be archaic in the extreme.
<P>
When we were debating clause 1, I referred to an act of faith. In many ways, everything in the north of Ireland is an act of faith. I would prefer to make an act of faith in the process of law and in legislation that emanates from this Parliament and the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland rather than in the words of Francie Molloy. It is self-evident that the sheer weight of that which is positive and good in our society--and that which is based on the rule of law--is much more potent in its application than the words of one person on Cullyhanna on a certain date, whatever that was. If we do not accept that, on what do we base our future?
<P>
<H5>1.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The words of Mr. Molloy were used earlier. Which is more important, the process of law emanating from a parliamentary democracy, north and south, or the commitment to a political process as represented in this Committee by me, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and others? The scaremongering words of one person were uttered in a certain set of circumstances and in a certain place. Is the political agenda to be based on that approach? Where is our act of faith and our commitment to the future?
<P>
I hope for one thing out of this Committee and the Bill. It may be too much and too soon, but in my own mind I want a big signpost to the future. I want that future to have no emergency legislation, but to have a new act of faith as a signpost pointing to a new line of approach. That may be too risky and too optimistic, but that is what we should be looking for. We should not hang our arguments on notions of internment that long since have lost their force, or on the words of Francie Molloy that, ultimately, mean nothing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke for leaving the Room during his speech. I consider that my hon. Friend knows as much as the best experts, and I always listen to him.
<P>
I entirely agree with what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said at the start of his speech. If I am wrong he will intervene, but I think that he said that consideration of clause 2--we are now on clause 3, of course, with which I shall deal--showed the real reason for the Committee's existence. Our job is to tease out the Government's intentions. We have succeeded in that, and the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have contributed a great deal.
<P>
I noted your earlier stricture, Mrs. Michie, about consideration of clause 2. If I may say so, some of your interventions have been absolutely correct. I did not intervene much earlier, so I conclude that you were not getting at me especially. You did not intervene on me once, so I shall try my best to ensure that you do not intervene on me during consideration of clause 3.
<P>
From the point of view of Labour Members who are not present to listen to the arguments for and against the clause, this may seem to be repetition, but it is not: one merely wants to put one's speech in one's own way. I am no good at making speeches--I never have been, but I do my best even though others do not--particularly when I am provoked.
<P>
I did not come to the Committee intending to make speeches, but I want to reinforce what my hon. Friends have said--it bears some repetition. During consideration of the amendment I have listened closely to the arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is not an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am delighted to be corrected by the Minister. He has not quite gone to sleep, although not long ago he gave signs of doing so.
<P>
I am disappointed that so few Government Back Benchers are prepared to sit it out with the rest of us, particularly my hon. Friends, to hear the arguments from both sides on such an important clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I must tell the hon. Member for Lewisham, West that we do not do business in the House of Commons that way. The Government presents a Bill and it is the job of the Opposition to get at the truth. I fear that the Government have not been too good at that up to now, but as we have gone through the clauses--if I had not been otherwise engaged, I might have made a modest contribution on clause 1--I have detected a certain impatience on the Government Front Bench. Labour Members want us on the Opposition Benches to agree to their proposals almost immediately--they will admit no other view. That is the only construction that we can put on not only what they say but how they act.
<P>
I never had high hopes for the Government, though they have a bit to run yet, but I did at least think that they would do us the courtesy of listening to what we have to say rather more carefully. It is immensely inconvenient--
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the great favour that he has done my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North through his lengthy and articulate filibuster? Because of our endurance and ability to listen to his well presented arguments, the Government pairing Whip has given us any night off we choose. I should like to put on record my profound thanks to the hon. Gentleman--I can choose which piece of legislation to come to the House to support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Government Front Benchers are clearly irritated and fractious--my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has alluded to that--but I am delighted that the few Labour Back Benchers present are in better fettle. I will be perfectly happy if tomorrow, or the next day, or whenever the hon. Gentleman cares to do so, he suitably rewards me for what I have done for him. That does not change the fact that Government Front-Benchers are somewhat rattled about clause 3. There is no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> To develop my hon. Friend's theme, there should be 12 Labour Members. There are only seven, so five were obviously told by the pairing Whip that they could go home.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is irrelevant to the clause and I would appreciate it if the hon. Gentleman would return to the discussion on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Of course, Mrs. Michie. I am exceedingly anxious to get back to clause 3 because there is no doubt that there is much to be said about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Are there any circumstances at any time in any year in which a clause that removes an individual's personal freedom and involves imprisonment without trial can be compared to being given a night off by the Whip?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> As I have already said, I have enormous respect for the hon. Gentleman's views on this clause and other clauses. Although we do not always agree, I certainly agree with his point about the intervention made by the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter). However, it is germane that the Government do not have their forces here to listen to the arguments. Labour Members will simply accept whatever they are told by the Government Front Bench and do whatever they are told when the Whip cracks his whip as we consider clause 3, as I am about to do. In answer to an earlier point, I can imagine only that the residue of Labour Members are in their beds or splitting a bottle elsewhere.
<P>
It was noticeable that when we resumed at 12.50 am that the Government were in complete disarray over consideration of clause 3 because the Committee was inquorate. As my hon. Friends and I were attempting to get into the clause and dissect it, we were trying to be as helpful as possible, but there simply were not enough hon. Members present. I think that was rather shambolic on the part of the Government.
<P>
I listened extremely carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke because he knows what he is talking about. He said that from the Government's point of view, clause 3 is another of what we would call their confidence-building measures. I am considering this matter a priori and viewing the situation not, as some hon. Members would remind me, as someone who lives in the community that we are discussing. None the less, I have taken an interest in the issue for many years and, indeed, in a humble way I tried to help the previous Secretary of State in his attempts to achieve the same aim of peace in the Province. I believe that the Government's problem--which my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke was trying to convey, but which bears repetition--is that one man's confidence-building measure is the opposite of that of another man. I cannot think of the exact expression but the Minister will know what I am trying to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Principle.
<P>
<H5>1.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That was a sedentary intervention.
<P>
That is how the hon. Gentleman might look at the matter, but he and I know perfectly well that such a view would not necessarily be generally shared. The Government may say that this is a confidence-building measure but some in the community in the Province simply do not agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I want to make the distinction between the notion of confidence-building measures and the principle that every person in any society has the right to his or her freedom until convicted by due process of law. The hon. Gentleman seems to be evading that distinction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I was not evading any such thing. I know the distinction that the hon. Gentleman is making, because I think that he will do me the courtesy of agreeing that I listened carefully to his speech. But his point was answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, and I do not need to repeat that answer.
<P>
Let me return to clause 3, which I am always desperate to do. The Minister had a little jibe on cribbing--well, I am happy to crib from his documents. I think that one of them says--I am simply repeating this to make sure that it is correct; if it is not, he will be the first to intervene and tell me so--that clause 3 repeals the powers in section 36 of, and schedule 3 to, the 1996 Act. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire alluded to the fact that we recognise and accept that these powers have lapsed since 1980. I think that I am correct in saying that they have not been used since 1975.
<P>
I am interested in the policy objective, which is the heading in the Government's document that must have been circulated to the Committee and others. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The objective is to remove from the Statute book the powers to detain without trial''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what it does. The document goes on to say that it is generally accepted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the powers would be used only exceptionally, since they have human rights implications.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that Conservative Members have ever evaded that issue. My hon. Friends for Basingstoke and for North-East Cambridgeshire were perfectly open in accepting that. These powers are not to be used lightly in any way, shape or form. I am looking at the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh as I say this. I listened exceedingly carefully to what he said. The question of which approach to take is one of balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I will give way in a moment--I have been generous enough in that respect. It is a question of balance. I shall not say that I have come down just on balance on one side or the other, but I recognise that there is a balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> How do we strike a balance between a human rights implication and a basic principle of human natural justice that a person is entitled to his or her freedom until subjected to the rigour of the law? It is spurious and, indeed, facetious to try to present that as a balance, because the fundamental human right of any person to remain innocent until proven guilty through due process must be a principle which far exceeds the expediency about which the hon. Gentleman talks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman clearly states his views and obviously believes them, but he repeated what he has already said. I tried to point out, perhaps not as eloquently as some, that the answer to the conundrum was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. All I can say is that later today, when we are eventually given our freedom, he should consult the report of the proceedings to see whether he finds the argument convincing. I do not think that he will, but that is all I can suggest. There is fundamental difference between us, which cannot be evaded.
<P>
To return to clause 3, the quotation continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``They have not been used for more than 20 years and in the present day''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
these are the important words--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``they cannot be considered to represent a significant counter-terrorism weapon.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the Government's view, and they hold their views with as much tenacity as the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh holds his. I do not doubt that the Government's views are nearer to his views than to mine and those of my colleagues.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke gave a rather good exposition of why the measure failed in the 1970s. I am not sure that I would have used the word that my hon. Friend used, but I hope that I took down what he said correctly. Whether I would have used the word ``failed'' or not--perhaps that is a slight point of difference between my hon. Friend and me--he was absolutely right to say that one of the components of the lack of success of the approach at that time was the inaccuracy of the intelligence. Again, if I have that wrong, I hope that my hon. Friend will correct me. It is important that the Committee understands this point, on which my hon. Friend is an expert. He also said--and had he not, I would have pointed it out--that it was used--if I do not say it, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will--as a weapon of persecution.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I think that the Official Report will show that I have never said that. I attempted to say that it was used in 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960 and 1970 with the same degree of failure. The record will show that I have never used those terms. It is a failed product. It had the same built-in failure in the 1920s as it had in the 1970s, and it would have again. Will the hon. Gentleman consult the Official Report, because it will show that the words that he attributed to me were not used by me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> There is some misunderstanding between the hon. Gentleman and myself. I was trying to say that the words were used by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. If the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh assumed that I was attributing the words to him, that is my fault. I was quoting my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. Even though I do not have the knowledge of some hon. Members, particularly those with constituencies in the Province, I would have known, had I made that remark, that it was completely misplaced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I apologise if I have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The reality is that the change before us is fundamental. My hon. Friends and I have, therefore, tried to spend a little time on it. I should say, en passant, that we only ever wanted a couple of days and perhaps even less than that to discuss the Bill, which is exactly what we have got because we started yesterday and are finishing today. My only comment is that matters could have been dealt with in a more civilised fashion than at the minute. All that matters, however, is that we are discussing the Bill in some detail, as my hon. Friend or rather the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said--if it were not for the rules of this place, I hope that I could use the words ``hon. Friend''. We are discussing the Bill in detail and are, therefore, fulfilling our obligations to clause 3, as we shall on all the clauses to come.
<P>
Clause 3--[Interruption.] I was slightly put off by the fact that you were talking on this occasion, Mrs Michie. My eye departed from my script I shall allow it to alight once again on the remark that I was going to make. I am not sure whether the point has already been made because I am not taking notes, but Conservative Members acknowledge that internment powers have not been used since 1975 whey they lapsed under the then Secretary of State, Merlyn Rees. We also acknowledge that the Labour party, when in opposition in the interverning period, would have wished clause 3 to be wider. That is consistency, although the Labour party has not always been consistent in what it says in opposition and what it says in government. If the clause were wider, I would be able to tease out all those areas in which the Government have not been consistent. On this issue, however, the Government have been consistent and have argued frequently for the removal of the powers. I wonder, however, for a variety of reasons given by my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke and for North-East Cambridgeshire, whether the Government have thought about that carefully enough.
<P>
In the notes on clauses, the Government state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use of internment in the early 1970's provided a short term answer''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the interesting phrase--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to a very serious problem''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Conservative Members would, however, not look at it like that, as my hon. Friends have said. The Minister may disagree with me because I may have misquoted, in which case I would be delighted to hear from him. The Government go on to say that internment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``created a special category of prisoner''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that there was a knock-on effect that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acted as a spur to terrorist recruitment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the Minister has not intervened, I assume that that is the Government's position.
<P>
I know that I am going to get into trouble with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, but I shall plough on and hope that he does not intervene again to restate his view. Tough judgments have to be made and I readily accepted the Minister's comments on clause 2. I understand that the Government considered the matter carefully and came down on one side of one or two of the questions that we asked. That is exactly the case with clause 3: normative judgments must be made about whether we should go down the route indicated by the clause. The Minister is in no doubt about what Opposition Members feel about that.
<P>
<H5>2 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I repeat--[Interruption.] Despite heckling by hon. Members, it bears repeating that we are worried about the reception that the clause will get in some parts of the community. The community represented by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will accept the clause and consider it appropriate, but the hon. Gentleman will be the first to agree that that view is not shared by everyone. Other contributions to the debate will, I dare say, back up that view.
<P>
I found the Minister's earlier slight aside interesting. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made a first-class contribution. He spent some time considering the clause and reaching conclusions about it. The Minister was a bit of beam to say that he thought that my hon. Friend was cribbing from the Second Reading debate. To assert that hon. Members may not crib offers a fascinating view on life. I say freely that I am unashamed of cribbing when considering clause 3. I am prepared to examine all aspects of the argument. I accept that I am not the repository of all wisdom about the clause. I admit that I have cribbed from the Second Reading debate. I have cribbed also from Government documents. The Minister is yawning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is because this is boring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It may be boring, but Ministers in Committees sit and listen to the Opposition until they have an opportunity to respond. The Minister will have his chance to tell the Committee all about clause 3, but I get the strong impression that the Government do not want to discuss it. The Minister cannot wait to get up and reply. I can understand that; he has a point of view to communicate. However, Opposition Members also have views and our only chance to put them is to take a bit of time, catch the Minister's attention, and get him to listen to us. It is sad that the Minister said more or less, that Opposition Members were speaking a load of old tosh.
<P>
<B>Mr Ingram:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I paraphrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Boring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister's sedentary remarks again betray his impatience with other people's views. I thought that new Labour was open minded, but it is not so at all. This is my first blooding and my first acquaintance with new Labour in Committee. Militaristic is not the word that should be used but the Government have characteristics that come close to it. I worry about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I shall give way--[Interruption.] I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire for reminding me that I should remind the hon. Gentleman that he should obtain his Whip's permission to intervene. I do not think that the Whip wants his interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I shall take whatever retribution the Whip chooses to hand out tomorrow or on Friday, or whenever the Committee finishes.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman's points are important enough to make tonight, why did the Second Reading debate end one-and-a-half hours early? Have the hon. Gentleman's arguments only just come into his head?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am pleased to answer those questions. I should be delighted to respond to any other intervention. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has not done too much reading of the Bill. If he says that he has read it closely, I shall give way--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The intervention was not relevant to the clause, so the hon. Gentleman does not have to answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am disappointed in myself, because I should have known better than to accept a second intervention from the hon. Gentleman. I have studiously kept close to clause 3, and I intend to do nothing else for the rest of my speech.
<P>
I promised my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that I would return to the scurrilous allegation of cribbing. The Minister has cast it about that the Opposition crib. As I think that I said earlier, I am happy to crib from anybody, simply because I am open minded about the issues involved. I may stumble upon something that I have not considered--
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a Bill that goes to the heart of our problem in the north of Ireland, and which means removing freedom from people without any trial or conviction in a court, should not be dealt with in a cavalier, smarmy and News of the World manner such as his own? He is offending many people in this Room with his presentation. The hon. Gentleman can be as smarmy and as clever as he likes, and he can crawl up as many--I shall not say it--as he likes. He is debasing the issue about which he is talking. Will he cut out the crap, and deal with the matter seriously?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not think that the word ``smarmy'' is a parliamentary word--it should not be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I withdraw that word, and the one that I used later. I re-emphasise that the hon. Gentleman's tweaking of the debate is offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I know, Mrs. Michie, that you want to keep me in order. I shall not respond, therefore, to the hon. Gentleman in the manner in which his invervention was made, which disappoints me. At least I have spent some time reading the documents and forming a view. I did not come to the issue five minutes ago--I spent a great deal of time helping a former Secretary of State on it. I do not need lessons from anyone on the subject, but I would never detract from a speech by an hon. Member. Each of us must decide how to marshal our arguments. The mere fact that my presentation does not suit Labour Members is neither here nor there. It will not stop me putting my views as I choose.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Stop crawling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The hon. Gentleman can heckle as much as he likes, but it will not change my view of how to treat the issue and what to say about it. On sober reflection, he might regret his remark because it will look all the more sober in print.
<P>
I distinctly remember saying during the debate on clause 2 that the Government were being precipitous and engaging in tokenism, and that that was a dangerous route to go down. The Government are doint the same on clause 3, which removes from the statute book the power of internment-- executive detention--without trial. No Government, Opposition or individual should treat the subject lightly. I pay other members of the Committee the tribute of saying that I hope they take the matter seriously. I hope that, with the same generosity, they think that we do the same.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay) said on Second Reading that we were urged time and again to reintroduce internment. We were also advised by several sources, in the Province and in the House, to repeal the powers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke said, we have been completely consistent. In government, we thought that the powers should be used only if there was a serious deterioration in the security situation. I recall my hon. Friend saying that it would be self-defeating to spell out a precise definition of that. Our view is that the power should be retained; it would be seldom used.
<P>
On Second Reading, it was said that the history of the Province and, perhaps, that of the whole of Ireland, is littered with bitter divisions. I have visited the Province on many occasions and have seen them at first hand. It is worth making the point that all Opposition Members hope fervently that the Government will succeed in achieving their aims with the peace process.
<P>
<H5>2.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the same way, I give credit to the Labour Opposition when we were in government. In this context they wanted the then Conservative Government to succeed. It would have been disappointing had it been any different. However, a point raised by a number of hon. Members on Second Reading has not been answered, and so needs to be raised again. The question is: if the Government succeed in their aims but some elements in the Province do not accept what the Government achieve, what will the Government then do? Opposition Members have suggested that the Government should keep the power of internment in reserve. We have said no more.
<P>
My brief remarks are the result of a certain experience of the Province and of the fact that Opposition Members have articulated a certain disagreement with the Government's approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> As we approach ten hours in Committee--we have almost got halfway in our consideration of the Bill--I hope that you, Mrs. Michie, will be as generous in deciding the length of our break for breakfast as you were when you allowed one hour and twenty-five minutes for dinner.
<P>
I tried to be brief in my contributions to the debates on clauses 1 and 2, but clause 3 is so very important that I feel constrained to speak at some length. I listened to what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said, and in many ways I compare myself with him. We share a desire for total peace in Northern Ireland. We have some opinions in common when it comes to punishments. We both are entirely opposed to capital punishment, although that is not a matter of party lines, as any vote on capital punishment is a free one. The hon. Gentleman and I have both voted against capital punishment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and I part company, however, when it comes to the need for a civilised society to be able, if necessary, to carry out internment. I am convinced of the need for that. The hon. Gentleman has implored me to indulge in an act of faith. It is exceedingly difficult to do so when there appears to be no reciprocation from those who are involved in terrorism.
<P>
Some hon. Members will have seen the television debate some time ago between me and Martin McGuinness. The spokesman for the IRA--who, under the pseudonym of Sinn Fein, sits at the table of democracy as chief negotiator--had three points to make in that debate. His first was that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland had no relevance as far as he was concerned. I have already touched on that point in so far as I have said that it directly contravenes one of the six Mitchell principles, the acceptance of which enables the IRA to sit at the table of democracy.
<P>
Secondly, Martin McGuinness made it clear that the IRA will not disarm to the extent of a single bullet. That organisation has in the past received by the ship load vast quantities of arms from the Gaddafi regime in Libya. We have spoken of the Semtex reserves held by the IRA, which are believed to be about two tonnes, or 2,000 kg. You may not know, Mrs. Michie, that only about 1 kg. of Semtex in needed as a catalyst for a Canary wharf, Manchester or Oklahoma-type bomb. If one such bomb exploded every month and we divided 2,000 by twelve, we would find that whatever age we lived to, our lifetime would not be long enough to see that Semtex used up. Perhaps I can better demonstrate the enormity of 2,000 kg. of Semtex by saying that it would enable the IRA to detonate an Oklahoma or Manchester-type bomb every day for almost six years. That is the reality of the IRA's armoury.
<P>
The third point made by Martin McGuinness was that there would be no agreement to have any sort of administration within the region of the United Kingdom that is Northern Ireland. That was his repudiation of violence. I have listened to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, but I cannot ignore the recent words of Councillor Francie Molloy. He is an elected councillor who has pledged himself publicly to repudiating violence, but he can tell a meeting that if the talks end his organisation will go back to what it does best.
<P>
In those circumstances, I must look carefully at that organisation's record. During the ceasefire of August 1994 to February 1996, many members of the nationalist tradition sat with the IRA in the Dublin forum for peace and reconciliation. There were no Unionists to queer the pitch; we were not present. The predominant political complexion of the people in the forum was nationalist or republican, whichever term is preferred. I accord to both the respect that they merit. I prefer the word republican in so far as it describes a form of government. The word nationalist is a somewhat disconcerting concept. The leader of the party of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has said that the term dates back to the end of the last century.
<P>
Within the forum there was every opportunity for those who wanted to engage in an act of faith to do so in terms of Sinn Fein-IRA. They had the ball at their toes in terms of convincing the IRA to move away from the Armalite and ballot box philosophy to which it has adhered for many years, long before it was articulated by Danny Morrison. That philosophy still appears to be relevant. Indeed, we can understand from Francie Molloy's speech what the Armalite and ballot box philosophy means in real terms--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is giving us background information, but it would be appreciated if he related it to the clause. We are discussing the removal of the Secretary of State's power to detain a person without trial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is kind of you, Mrs. Michie, to draw my attention to the purpose of the clause. Perhaps I had lost sight of it, but I must put the requirement for internment within a civilised society in the context of the danger that faces our society in Northern Ireland. One must understand the philosophy that has been pursued for many years. Some will say that it is based on the Mao Tse-Tung approach to guerilla warfare, but I will not bore you, Mrs. Michie, with the details of phase 1, phase 2 lower, phase 2 upper, phase 3 and so on. I would enjoy illustrating the point more graphically in such a way, but I shall desist.
<P>
I return to discussing the society within which I live. Sinn Fein-IRA have had the opportunity to reach an accommodation with those of us who believe in a peaceful society.
<P>
<H5>2.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We were told 30 years ago that the grievances of those from the nationalist tradition stemmed from certain discriminations and inequitities. In 1969, I was writing to my local newspapaer decrying the fact that my party was not conducting itself properly in respect of the allocation of houses. That was not a popular view in 1969, but I understood why people such as the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh were demonstrating on the streets. They wanted to remove the inequity that they believed derived from prejudice and fear among members of my tradition. That fear concerned the pressure, and the possible ensuing violence, that might be applied by some members of the tradition to which the hon. Gentleman belongs.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke said internment failed in 1972 not only because of the lack of high-grade intelligence. That was one reason, but the failure had more to do with the fact that a large element in Northern Ireland society wanted to demonstrate its disaffection through street protests and what in those days were called civil rights marches. Under those conditions, it was the height of folly to try to effect the strategy--or even the tactic--of internment.
<P>
The Heath Government decided in 1972 totally to wipe away the existing administration rather than reform it. The House decided that it would apply exactly the same administration criteria to the region of the United Kingdom to which I belong as applied to the north-east or the north-west, to Wales or to Scotland. That process has continued and, to be fair, has been acknowledged by both traditions in Northern Ireland. Indeed, it has become increasingly widely accepted.
<P>
Direct rule is not a satisfying form of administration. I want to have a say in what is decided, but sometimes I am not even consulted about the administration of my region of the United Kingdom. Every new Government take an arbitrary approach, which sometimes is maintained for longer than is necessary or wise. I hope that the Government will ensure greater consultation until we sort out a new form of administration.
<P>
I return to the need for internment. Direct rule has been maintained for 25 years. During that period more checks and balances have been put in place that exist in any other western democracy, including the United States of America, whose citizens believe that it is coming down with checks and balances and openness in government. Yet the people of Northern Ireland are held to ranson by those who articulate a philosphy similar to that of Martin McGuiness, which I just recounted. What should a western democracy do to counter subversion of the elements of democracy that hold society together?
<P>
Of course, we can detect those who commit terrorist crimes and take them through the court system, but we cannot try them by jury, as jurors and witnesses are more susceptible to intimidation under a jury than under the Diplock court system. We can, however, take them through that process and hope to send them to prision for their crimes. In my constituency there have been something like 200 murders. It may surprise hon. Members to learn that when I entered the House, only 8 per cent. of republican murders were resolved to the extent that the perpetrators were out in prison. Similarly, only 48 per cnet. of loyalist murders in my constituency were resolved. There is a significant difference between the two figures, but I am told that there is a reason for that.
<P>
I spent almost 12 years as a uniformed soldier--I was an officer with the Ulster Regiment. As part of my duties I was able to stop in transit people who were known to be leading members of the IRA and, indeed, leading members of loyalist paramilitary organisations. Because of the constraints on us, however, we had to treat them in the same way we would have treated a 70-year-old lady visiting her grandchildren: ``Good evening. How are you? Do you mind if I have a look in the boot of your car?'' Of course, the people who drove through our checkpoints--not always, I am happy to say, but very often--were clean. They did not have their weapons or bombs with them, yet we knew that they were going about terrorist business. From time to time, our suspicions were confirmed and they were caught in the act of committing a murder or ambushed by members of the security services. Very seldom did the information we had prove to be erroneous. We have to start from there when it comes to internment.
<P>
When there is no other means of protecting the ordinary law-abiding citizen and when that person's greater civil right--that right to live without violence being perpetrated against him--is infringed, society has a right to expect something slightly out of the ordinary.
<P>
It is always difficult to illustrate this particular point. Slab Murphy has been a member of the IRA army council; he has been an IRA chief of staff and perhaps still is, for all I know. He is totally immune to the law, in a way that someone like me could never hope to be. He controls an area along the frontier with the Irish Republic, and I believe that he controls much of what happens in south Armagh. People who were not from my tradition tried to convince me that the IRA had nothing directly to do with the bomb claimed by the Continuity IRA that exploded in Markethill. They went out of their way to assure me that Slab Murphy knew nothing about it and I was expected to take it as gospel. If Slab Murphy knew nothing about it, the IRA had nothing to do with it.
<P>
These evil men are totally dedicated to terrorism. On the same level as Slab Murphy--I hope that this does not alarm the Minister, although I wish that it would--we must put someone like Martin McGuinness, who held the power of life and death over Protestant and Catholic alike in Derry city and in that part of the north-west of the region of the United Kingdom from which I come.
<P>
Martin McGuinness was condemned out of the mouths of members of his own tradition. When a young man was banished--exiled--by order of the IRA from Derry city, Martin McGuinness sent a message through that person's relatives that he should be brought back again and that it was all sorted out. He reassured the young man's mother that she need not worry and to get him back to Northern Ireland. When he came back, he was sent a message that he needed to square his position with the boys. That was the last that that young man's mother saw of him until she got his body with a hole in the head.
<P>
I know of no other civilised western society that has invited unreconstructed terrorists to the table of democracy and given them equal--indeed, more than equal--status with those who have abided by the democratic process from the day they were old enough to make a decision.
<P>
<H5>2.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Not only have we heard today--and yesterday, last week and the week before--about how we must accommodate these evil people, but we are told--

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I find it difficult to see how this relates to clause 3 and the detention order. It is part of the Bill and it is important that it is discussed in some detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Michie. It is a complex issue, but I hope that I can demonstrate its relevance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh argued that from the 1920s to the 1970s internment was not a solution to the problem, but then imprisonment is not a solution to the problem of theft. We have had theft throughout the centuries and people have been sent to prison, but more theft occurs. That does not mean that it is wrong to send people to prison and make them pay their debt to society if they commit that crime. That is how the justice system works. Similarly, nobody has said that internment is a final solution. It is a mechanism that enables society to protect itself against a particular crime which we refer to as terrorism. It is a crime that can pay, bribe, bully, intimidate and pervert the normal course of justice.
<P>
With the threat of violence hanging over us, are we so naive as to believe that those who sat on the Dublin forum for peace and reconciliation with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and turned a deaf ear to all his persuasion will respond to the Minister, the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister because they decide to water down or diminish the mechanisms that we use in an attempt to control the terrorists? However optimistic, hopeful or naive the Minister may be, he cannot believe that he will change the nature of republican or loyalist terrorism in Northern Ireland in the short term by handing out--yes, the Minister is about to hear the words again--the Danegeld, the ransom that is paid to keep the terrorist at the table of democracy but which sustains his Armalite and ballot box philosophy.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked a question that I hope is answered soon. He asked why the Chief Constable is content with the changes when a short time ago he was not content. The Chief Constable may have had a conversion on the road to Damascus; he may be naive, but I cannot believe that. He has served in Northern Ireland as a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary for many years and has had to endure frustrations in every one of them. He has walked behind the hearses and the draped coffins of colleagues who have been slaughtered by terrorists. I can only speculate--I shall do my best, Mrs. Michie, not to go to far as you will tell me that I am straying out of order--but I believe that a measure in the Police Bill, which the House will consider soon, obliges the Chief Constable to be subservient to political pressure.
<P>
Until now, the Chief Constable has controlled 86 per cent. of the budget; 14 per cent. is administered by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, civilians who represent a cross-section of society and give their time to an organisation that was craved by particular elements in Northern Ireland. The change has happened arbitrarily and without any benefit being demonstrated. For the past three years I have sought figures that prove that the decision was right. But the 14 per cent. is being taken from police authority control and handed to the Chief Constable. As well as 13,500 policemen, he will have another little kingdom of civilians to control, and they will administer the 14 per cent.
<P>
No one, except the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, will have control of the Chief Constable. He will be answerable to and dependent on no one else. If the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and I resolve our difficulties, he may in future come under the political control of one or the other of us, but our Chief Constable will be under the political control of the Secretary of State. I had thought that political control of our Chief Constable, which can amount to political manipulation, was finished for ever in Northern Ireland.
<P>
 I want to use an analogy further to illustrate what internment means. A terrorist organisation does not operate in a loose and disorganised fashion. Over many years the IRA, in particular, has adopted the cell system, which is a tight system of control intended to protect its members. It operates in such a way that very few members know who other than themselves is involved in an act of violence.
<P>
Every cell has its own management. Someone brings the guns--the same applies in the case of a bomb--from the quartermaster and leaves them at a drop-off point. Another person drives the car, picks up the guns from the drop-off point and meets the killers. He conveys them to and from their target, drops them off and disposes of their overalls, Balaclavas and gloves. He moves the guns home to a hiding place and someone else picks them up and takes them back to the quartermaster. I am talking about operational guns. We all know that there are great armouries and bunkers of guns and explosives that are not accessible to the quartermasters at a moment's notice. The IRA depends on a strict command and control system.
<P>
I return now to my analogy. If I want to destroy a business or a factory that makes particular goods, what do I do? I remove the managing director or the financial manager or the export manager or the sales manager--I remove the command and control structure. Of course, those people can be replaced, but their removal causes an upset, as we have all seen in business. If I can consistently remove people and disrupt the command and control system of that business, it will soon become less profitable until, one day, it goes to the wall.
<P>
That is how we should treat terrorists. We should not make a series of concessions in the hope that we can buy their acquiescence within our regulated society. We should disrupt their command and control systems again and again for as long as is necessary to destroy the operating ability of the group.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke made a good contribution, but I must make one comment. I probably stand alone in the Committee in my attitude towards internment. I am not a hard man, but I do not and I never have felt the need to apologise for disrupting the command and control structure of terrorist organisations; nor should the police and our legislators and administrators feel the need to apologise for trying to contain that most difficult element in the criminal world--the terrorist.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must interrupt you, Mr. Maginnis. I have to have a care for hon. Members, so I shall suspend the Committee for about 25 minutes. We shall return at 3.25 am.
<P>
<H5>3 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>3.25 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have not lost my train of thought, but I am about to conclude my remarks.
<P>
I want to ensure that what Ulster Unionists feel about internment is understood clearly. It has been suggested that internment provides the students for a university of violence. Internment ended in the early to mid-1970s--I do not remember the exact date. Since then, we have had 20 years of violence. No university of violence was needed to supply, recruit and train the manpower that has kept the violence going for that time.
<P>
Terrorists are not old hands. For one reason or another, their active lives tend to be concentrated between the ages of 18 and their early thirties. The ones who have been active for the past 15 years or so were produced through means other than those deriving from the benefit of being interned.
<P>
Finally, I wish to speak about selective internment. The word ``selective'' has been emphasised several times tonight. Internment has to be selective; if it is to be successful, it has to be very selective. I use the analogy of a business. One does not pick up and intern the people on the shop floor, so to speak: the highest level of management needs to be targeted. That level includes the quartermasters, the godfathers and top gunmen who, for other reasons that I have already recounted, cannot be put behind bars.
<P>
In conclusion, it may be beyond my powers of persuasion to get the Government to agree that clause 3 is foolish. The previous Government were foolish in the same way, because internment should have been implemented in the period between the late 1980s through to 1994. The IRA was under pressure, and removing its top command and control echelon would have made a tremendous difference. This Government will leave us without even the possibility of recourse to internment to deal with the IRA top echelon, whatever happens and whatever violence is perpetrated against society.
<P>
The Minister should note that the Government of the Irish Republic have not gone as far as he. They understand the nature of terrorism. They know that if push comes to shove, they will use internment as ruthlessly as they used it in the past--when it was used more ruthlessly that it ever should have been.
<P>
<H5>3.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Instead of removing that measure, the Minister should have built in safeguards to ensure that, if it was used again it could be monitored, and that cases of internment could be regularly examined. During the 1956 to 1962 campaign, people were interned but then released on the basis of a solemn and binding promise not to engage again in violence. Strangely, that worked, and very few people who were released on their own cognisance reoffended. I should like the Minister to consider those points as the Bill proceeds. It is asking too much, I suppose, to ask him to change his mind and to adjust to society's needs, rather than to make a great and deep cut across the limited measures that deal with terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The Committee has had a long debate, if ``debate'' is the right word to use. I thought that the clause would be contentious, so I listened with close interest to what hon. Members purporting to oppose the clause said. I did not hear much justification for their argument that internment should remain in the regulations. I heard long speeches, but not much substance. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone knows that I am a reasonable man. If a strong case had been put, I would have listened to it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh made an impassioned speech and trenchantly set out the reasons why internment has failed in the past, has failed now, and will fail in the future--the very words that I used on Second Reading.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, in his exceptionally long speech, said only one thing with which I agree--his outline of the clause's aims. The clause sets out to repeal the powers in section 36 of schedule 3 of the 1996 Act to detain without trial persons suspected of being terrorists. In short, it proposes to end the internment provisions that were reintroduced in Northern Ireland on 9 August 1971. Those powers have existed in lapsed state since 1980 and have not been used since 1975. Notwithstanding Opposition Members' comments, the powers have to be considered again in their proper context.
<P>
Hon. Members who argue that the powers of detention without trial should be retained must ask themselves why they support that retention. They should justify their arguments that such powers have a rightful place in a free, democratic society. More importantly, they must prove that such powers deter terrorism. They must also prove how, if the powers are used as they have been before, they diminish the terrorist threat to society in the long term, rather than just the immediate structures of terrorist organisations. History proves that in the long term, such powers did not prevent a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
<P>
Let us take the debate away from politics and away from those who feel that they have great knowledge and are close to the situation. Let us consider what the independent reviewers who examined the internment provisions said and what conclusions they have reached. They are not too close to the issue and they do not think that they are experts on the subject. Their conclusions were not touched on by Opposition Members, but I am sure that if they had examined them, they would have ignored them because of their prejudice against coming to the debate with an open mind.
<P>
The 1975 Gardiner report criticised both the theory and practice of detention under the 1973 Act. It recommended new procedures, most of which were incorporated into the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment) Act 1975. However, no detention order has been made since 9 February 1975, and the last detainees were released by the end of that year.
<P>
In 1980 the detention provisions were allowed to lapse--they were to remain on the statute book, but effectively not in force. The decision was taken by the Conservative Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of that time. He judged that allowing the power to lapse would be an important demonstration of the Government's commitment to normalisation--a word that was mentioned earlier. He said that it would be,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an expression of confidence in the minority community's rejection of terrorism''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why he allowed the powers to lapse.
<P>
The matter was reviewed again in 1990 by Lord Colville, when he considered in detail the difficulties associated with the operation of internment and its repercussions on the nationalist community. He said that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``perhaps the most sincere by-product was the tendency actually to strengthen terrorist networks through increased hostility and criminal skills among those detained''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are not the words of a politician. Lord Colville was making an analytical assessment of the provision.
<P>
Lord Colville thought that internment served significantly to undermine respect for the law and the judicial process. He strongly advocated repeal of the powers of detention, both as an important political signal to the nationalist community and because the powers to detain without trial arguably fail to comply with international standards for a fair trial. Moreover, their use was widely associated with the practice of totalitarian countries. He said that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be ironic for the UK to have to explain that its much-cherished legal system is so liberal that it has proved inept to bring to trial and convict known criminals, and that it is an excess of fairness which now predicates executive detention as coming to our society's rescue''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Colville considered, but was unpersuaded by, the two main arguments advanced for the retention of the internment provisions. The first was that they served as a powerful symbol of the strength of the Government's resolve to fight terrorism--Opposition Members have advanced that argument again tonight--and the second was that the abandonment of the power would make it impossible to achieve surprise, were it decided to introduce detention in an emergency. Again, that was touched on, but not too convincingly, by Opposition Members.
<P>
Lord Colville made a telling point in relation to that second argument when he said that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it seems improbable that in a small community similar steps for readiness could in future be concealed so as to ensure complete surprise.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Effectively, he was saying that internment as it is on the statute book could never achieve the objectives for which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone argued. The hon. Gentleman talked about his small community, thus backing up the dimensions of the problem as identified in Lord Colville's quote.
<P>
In 1995 the matter was considered again by Mr. John Rowe QC as part of his fundamental review of the EPA. His view was again straightforward: he recommended that the provisions should not be re-enacted.
<P>
No matter how the issue is judged, the truth is that internment--either in practice or as a deterrent--has not stopped terrorism in Northern Ireland. If it has, I want to see evidence that it has worked. Mr. John Rowe, Lord Diplock, Lord Gardiner and Lord Colville certainly did not come to that conclusion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister has quoted a number of what he would term experts, and I do not dissent from his right to do so. They have a particular view of the subject and he is entitled to tell us what they have said because that supports his views. However, earlier in the proceedings he said that all the historical precedents supported his views. To complete his case, will he set out all those historical precedents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have no intention of doing so. I do not know where history begins in the hon. Gentleman's mind. Where in history should I begin and where should I end? What lessons could be learned? The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh spoke about the time from the 1920s to the 1970s and argued that that showed that internment did not work. We were right to listen to that history lesson because he has particular experience.
<P>
The three people whom I cited as examples are not experts in that sense, they are people who were brought in to assess and analyse the situation. They were bringing to the subject not expert knowledge but an analytical approach. If those people, who were appointed by the Government solely to exercise their minds on this issue, had come to a different conclusion, they would have done so on the basis of what was happening at that time and whether it was a deterrent to terrorism. They would have considered the history of internment--I know that they did and I could quote extensively the areas that John Rowe considered--in other regimes in other countries to try to test events here in relation to that. Specific criticisms emerge from those analyses, from which we should all learn lessons based on history and precedent and taking into account the future impact of such provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I accept the Minister's correction. I used the word ``experts'' and I accept what he said about that. However, I asked a much simpler question. The record will show that the Minister said that all historical precedents point in his direction. I merely asked him to trot them out for us. If he has all those facts at hand and uses them, perhaps they will go some way towards changing my opinion. If he will not do so, he will not change my mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I thought that there was any possibility of changing the hon. Gentleman's mind, I would spend a long time going through the details of the issue. Before he entered into this debate, he should have examined those references. Why did those people come to those conclusions? They were based on historical analysis and assessment of the present effectiveness of the provision. Such assessments are helpful to anyone--whether inside or outside Government--trying to come to conclusions. At the end of the day, Ministers have to make individual judgments. All advice must be taken on board and one must make one's own assessment of the situation. That being the case, if I am bringing any prejudice to the matter, it has been borne out by the weight of evidence. Therefore, I have no grounds for shifting my approach; if anything, it is bolstered by the analyses that I have examined. The case for what we are trying to achieve has been strengthened.
<P>
<H5>3.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Members spent a long time not teasing out the issue, but setting out their stall on it. If they are so strongly against the clause--clearly, my arguments have not persuaded them--they should vote against it. Labour Members are certain that the case in favour has been made repeatedly by my party in opposition, in government, on Second Reading and during previous debates. A point was made about consultation. If anyone is surprised that my party in government has brought the proposal forward, I do not know where they have been for several years. Indeed, on Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North reminded the House of comments and criticisms made in 1971.
<P>
In earlier debates, it was hinted that we are making a concession to terrorists and being soft on terrorism. I say to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that that is insulting and wrong. Is he saying that the independent people who have assessed the proposals are being soft on terrorism because they have criticised internment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It ill behoves the Minister to say that we are insulting. He gets excited about our opinion. He sat and listened, we thought, to what we had to say about the place for internment. I told him that from 1975 to 1997 there was no internment. Terrorists are still being produced, but he harks back to someone else's opinion because that person agrees with him. If his assessment of an argument is that those who agree with him are experts and those who put another case are not, he has little service to give to the people of Northern Ireland who are dependent upon him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I make a simple point: if internment was so effective, why was it not used by the previous Government over their 18 years in power? Why did they not tackle the command and control and the cell structures of the Provisional IRA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister is not listening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Was it not concluded that internment would not achieve results? The hon. Member for Basingstoke took on board most of the criticisms made on Second Reading, effectively accepting that internment did not achieve the desired objectives. Hence, internment was not used by the previous Government in the crucial years in which the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups were expanding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman can come back on the matter.
<P>
If internment was a deterrent or an effective measure when put to use, it would have proved itself because terrorist movements would not have expanded during those years. The opposite happened. Internment is redundant. It has been analysed over the years and the time is right to take it off the statute book, not as a sop to terrorism, but as a testament to the quality of the judicial system. The Diplock courts are an effective part of the judicial process, in which people are given a fair trial. They have stood the test of time. Jury trials provide an added bonus. If we cannot take people who are apprehended and charged with terrorist offences through the due process of law, we shall all lose out on a free democratic society. The more we move towards a normal process and the more we can justify ourselves internationally, the better our position will be. That is why I ask the Committee to support clause 3 and remove the provisions from the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I wanted to address several of the Minister's comments. Methinks he doth protest too much. When he started, he seemed to be getting his retaliation in first. Earlier in my remarks on clause 3, I paid tribute to the work of a number of experts in Northern Ireland over many years. As the record will show, I said that we had listened carefully to bodies such as the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Ministers are, however, given opinions about everythng all the time. Just because they receive an opinion, they do not necessarily have to accept it--they cannot make that logical connection. Ministers must listen to opinions and make a judgment about whether to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> You make yours, we make ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We do--[Interruption.] This is not a pointless argument--the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh considers it the most important issue in the Bill.
<P>
Conservative Members beg to differ from the Minister. He has not made the case for his proposal and we shall oppose it. We are not just talking about opinions of learned gentlemen of one kind or another, but about politics and we have to make a political judgment. If politics and representation by political parties are to mean anything, the Minister should ask himself why the majority of representatives of political parties from Northern Ireland are against his proposal. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone spoke strongly about that and he speaks for his party. The Democratic Unionist party is not represented here, but I am sure that its members would concur.
<P>
The Minister has not made his case. He says that we have not made ours, but we beg to differ and on that basis we shall oppose his proposal.

<P>
Question proposed, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Committee will be delighted to know that I shall not detain it for very long on this clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> A cop out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Yes, a cop out. There is very little in the clause. It extends certain measures to different circumstances from those alluded to in the 1996 Act. When it was first introduced, the RUC had serious doubts about video recording. It might be helpful to the Committee if the Minister could tell us the RUC's current view, how the measure is working and how many centres have been set up.
<P>
The clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``interviews held by police officers in such other circumstances as may be specified in an order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister give us an idea of what the other circumstances might be? It suggests to me that there may have been an oversight when the original legislation was drafted and that this provision has been introduced just to cover those possible eventualities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> With regard to video recordings of police interviews, if I recall correctly, the silent video recording of police interviews was introduced for the first time in the 1996 Act. The brief comment by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire confirms my impression that, prior to the drafting of that Act, silent video recordings--as well as audio recordings--had been consistently opposed by the RUC. I think that it is correct to say that RUC opposition to audio recording suddenly, if not miraculously, disappeared on or soon after 2 May this year.
<P>
I have no objection to clause 4 amending the 1996 Act, provided that the RUC really is content with the proposed arrangements and has not assumed a position of political correctness, perhaps in pursuit of some other strategic purpose. I hope that the Minister may be able to give us some evidence of the RUC's firm acceptance of the proposal.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister referred to the additional protection which recordings would provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for both interviewees and police interviewing officers against claims of verbal abuse, intimidation and harassment.''--[Official Report, 18 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 176.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a familiar argument. Although there is nothing wrong with it, it has been produced consistently by the Labour members to substantiate their case for change. Traditionally, however, it was countered by a series of other arguments. It was said that recordings, whether audio or video, would deter the interviewee from co-operating with the RUC because of his fear that a recording might pass into the hands of people who might use it to threaten or intimidate him or his family.
<P>
There was also concern that on occasions a useful source of intelligence and information would dry up as a result of the introduction of recordings.
<P>
Another dimension to the argument against recording was the risk of identification of the police interviewing officer. Such identification, by appearance or by sound, could pose a security problem for that officer or for his family.
<P>
The Minister's comments on Second Reading did not cover those not unreasonable anxieties. I hope that he will deal with the arguments now, and reassure the Committee that the feared negative impact will not materialise.
<P>
<H5>4 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading I sought and obtained clarification of the precise meaning and effect of clause 4(2)(b), which by hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has also sought. On Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie said that the proposal was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``simply an amendment of an oversight in the current Act, regarding silent video recordings of police interviews at holding centres. Occasionally, the police require to interview at a holding centre a person who is in custody in the care of the prison authorities, and also occasionally a magistrate may order a person to be produced to a holding centre for questioning. In such cases, arrest and detention will not have been under the PTA.''--[Official Report, 18 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 216.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand what the Under-Secretary said, but his answer was not as quite as complete as I should have liked. Clause 4(2)(b) poses many questions that the Government have not yet answered, although there is still time. It would be uncharitable of me to expect detailed answers to all of them tonight, but I hope that in due course the Minister will be able to answer the series of questions that I will put to him.
<P>
Are we to understand that clause 4(2), and subsections (a) and (b) cover all the interviews that take place at the holding centres? Will the Bill mean that there will be no interviews at holding centres that are not subject to video recordings?
<P>
I wish to approach a similar point from another angle. Is an order made by the Secretary of State under clause 4(2)(b) the only means other than section 14(1)(a) of the PTA by which a person can be detained at a holding centre? Does the Bill cover the recording of every interview, and does it now embrace all categories of people who may be required and held for interview at a holding centre?
<P>
The answer from the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, to me on Second Reading suggested that the police could require for interview at a holding centre a person in the care of the prison authorities. If a person is ordered by a magistrate to be produced for a holding centre for questioning, that too would happen.
<P>
However, it is not clear whether a person who arrives at a holding centre is questioned under the terms of the PTA and is therefore protected by the safeguards in that Act. If an interviewee is not being held under the PTA, what are the safeguards and which legislation provides them? I genuinely feel that there is a lack of clarity in the Bill, at least on a surface reading.
<P>
I turn to the code of practice in the 1996 Act. Will the Minister confirm that vieo recording, which it introduced, has not yet begun and that early in the new year is a realistic objective for that? Were the delays caused by technical problems--getting the kit up and running and obtaining the right quality of recording--or will he score a political point by saying that there was deliberate delay on the part of the previous Government? Did the Government inherit a prepared code from the previous Government? I do not recall that point being raised during deliberations on the 1996 Act. If the code was inherited, do the Government intend it to operate? If not, what deficiencies does it contain?
<P>
There is also the issue of scrutiny of the code. How will the Government make it available to hon. Members? Will it be in the Library? For the efficacy and justice of interviews we must ensure that the code of practice for video recording, albeit one drawn up by the Secretary of State, maintains our confidence. There is also the question of the enforcement of the code. Who will check that the code, which is a safeguard, is being followed? What are the procedures for checking and how frequently will that occur?
<P>
Giving the Secretary of State the executive authority to decide who may be interviewed at holding centres and the responsibility for the code raises a series of questions. We are entitled to clarification of how the Government see those issues developing.

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There has been a slight misunderstanding of what we are dealing with. The clause corrects the omissions of the 1996 Act. I was asked about the RUC view. We know of those omissions because the RUC, through the Chief Constable, alerted us to the weakness and asked for such a change. The logical conclusion is that they are signed up to the efficacy of silent video recordings. I hope that that answers the question about the RUC and the position of the Chief Constable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke set out the answer given on Second Reading by the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie. It is worth repeating that because it precisely defines what the clause seeks to do.
<P>
Occasionally, the police require to interview at a holding centre a person who is in custody in the care of the prison authorities, and a magistrate may also occasionally order a person to be produced to a holding centre for questioning. An omission meant that the RUC would find themselves interviewing in such circumstances people who had not been detained under the PTA and who had not been subject to silent video recordings. Those people would have received less protection under the law than those whose interviews were recorded, hence the need for the clause to change the legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that he would raise this matter on Report and did not expect an immediate answer. It would be wrong for me to try to answer now all his detailed points. It is better to ensure that the answers are accurate than to give them off the top of my head or to try quickly to analyse what he said. I will write to the hon. Gentleman and to other members of the Committee to deal in detail with the individual points.
<P>
Silent video recording will certainly commence in the new year. The code of practice has not yet been agreed. We inherited that and it will be agreed soon, issued and made available for consideration. That responds to some of the questions by the hon. Member for Basingstoke about the code of practice--how it will take effect and how it will protect those affected by it. We will set those matters out in more detail later because the code of practice is not available now. The answers to the hon. Gentleman's questions would be better set against that specific code of practice.
<P>
The clause corrects an omission in the legislation to which the RUC alerted the Government. The RUC and the Chief Constable have signed up to silent video recordings. They undoubtedly give added protection to people who are interviewed at holding centres. Putting the equipment in place was delayed partly by the need to ensure that it was effective, reliable and withstood due examination. Then, of course, the code of practice has still to be published.
<P>
Hopefully, I have addressed any misconceptions and concerns in the minds of Conservative Members. As I said, they will be dealt with in detail later.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Audio recording of police interviews</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause deals with audio recording and is closely allied to clause 4. It merely inserts an extra few paragraphs into the appropriate section of the 1996 provision.
<P>
When speaking to clause 4, I said that the RUC had had reservations about video recording. I am delighted to hear that those doubts have been satisfied. However, if the RUC had doubts about video recording, it certainly had them about audio recording. The reasons were obvious, and there was a fear that they would get little or nothing out of people taken into custody for interview if there was any possibility of audio recordings falling into the wrong hands. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that the RUC and the Chief Constable are happy with the proposals in clause 5.
<P>
<H5>4.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, in his comments about clause 4, raised the question of holding centres. Will interviews be recorded on audio and video only at holding centres, or could they be held elsewhere? The Minister talked about special circumstances: do they include locations other than the holding centres? The Bill is not clear about whether the recordings will be made only in holding centres. They are clearly the most secure places and, given the expense of the equipment, it would make sense to keep it in specific locations.
<P>
Clauses 4 and 5 refer to video and audio recording, respectively. Is it seriously proposed that such recordings will be made separately, or will there be a simultaneous recording of both audio and video? That would mean that the picture could be watched while the audio recording is monitored. The two types of recording are separated in the Bill, but in practice we probably need one piece of equipment that does both.
<P>
I have mentioned holding centres. What is the Government's position on Castlereagh? As was mentioned earlier, regular reports are compiled by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and Mr. Norris about the operation of the holding centres. On a number of occasions, the Labour party when in opposition supported Sir Louis's recommendations that the Castlereagh Centre should be closed.
<P>
I think that I am right to say that Sir Louis has made that recommendation four times. He has suggested that, in the absence of a new building--for which the Minister may tell us that the Government are able to find the money--it might be better to close Castlereagh and to use either Gough barracks or Strand road, or both. It would be interesting to know where the Government stand on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are now making rapid progress. I shall set out the purpose of clause 5, and then deal with all of the matters that have been brought up.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that clause 5, which makes new provision covering video recording, in effect mirrors the existing provisions for silent video recording, which have been amended by clause 4. The intention is to provide additional protection for interviewees and, importantly, for police interviewing officers against verbal abuse, harassment, and allegations of such behaviour. It will also assist the judicial process by providing the best possible record of the interviews, in the event that a criminal case ensues.
<P>
The introduction of audio recording for police interviews about terrorist crime was not supported in the past for two specific reasons: first, because it would inhibit interviewees from responding to questions and thus hinder the fight against terrorist crime; secondly, because lives could be put at risk if tapes were later disclosed in court, as they invariably would be if a criminal case ensued.
<P>
Alongside that, there has been mounting pressure for the audio recording of interviews in addition to silent video recording. Because of that, the Government had to judge where the strength of the argument lay--we have encountered a similar situation on other clauses. The judgment came down in favour of audio recording being introduced only into the holding centres. For the reason that was mentioned earlier and because assessments by people such as Sir Louis--[Hon. Members: ``Sir Louis Blom-Cooper''.] Yes, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper--it is 4.20 am and it is sometimes difficult to retain everything in one's head. Such assessments and comments highlighted the need to put a more robust system in place to deal with criticisms that could be raised about verbal abuse and harassment of interviewees and, indeed, of police officers. We believed that such a system would considerably assist the judicial process.
<P>
I was asked about the role of the Chief Constable and comments were made in debate on earlier clauses about him being politically correct or there being a trade-off because of a deal that he had with the Government. [Interruption.] The record may not show that, but it is certainly my recollection. [Interruption.] I am not saying that hon. Members said that, but Opposition Members spoke about the grounds for a possible change.
<P>
The Chief Constable recently said that he no longer considered that audio recording would deter his officers in the pursuit of terrorist crime, and that is his judgment. He did not say that because he wanted to be politically correct, but because he, too, has taken on board the assessments that have been made and the benefits that will flow from the introduction of audio recording.
<P>
I was asked how the two systems will operate, and they will operate independently. The Government examined whether they should be meshed together in one integrated system or dealt with separately. They do, however, fulfil two different functions. The purpose of silent video recording is quite narrow--it is intended to prove or disprove claims of physical assualt and tapes would be disclosed only for that purpose. On the other hand, audio tapes will be routinely discoverable if a criminal case ensues. There was a need to separate the two mechanisms, because although audio tapes undoubtedly would appear in evidence, silent video recordings would not necessarily do so. There were minor cost implications as a consequence, but it was felt necessary to make that distinction because of the use to which the systems would be put.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification and I almost understand his point. Is he saying that people who are taken into custody for interviews would go into a room in which there would be video equipment to make a video recording and separate equipment to make an audio recording? Would both sets of equipment work simultaneously?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answer to that is yes. The RUC could repeat the interview and we could examine that point, but the answer is yes.
<P>
Another point concerned the future of Castlereagh holding centre. There was a strong case for replacing Castlereagh--there are no two ways about that. Indeed, the Government would like all the holding centres to close if possible. Again, that would be part of the process of normalisation if the holding centres were no longer necessary. However, it is not possible at this time to contemplate their closure, nor to build a new holding centre in place of Castlereagh. It is a question of resource allocation, and other police building projects take priority.
<P>
The whole process of making judgments regarding the RUC's capital programme is a fine one. It is difficult to ensure that we get maximum return for the investment in new capital build. There are many RUC stations which could still be subject to particular types of terrorist attack, so the movement is towards hardened facilities to protect the officers who work in and are deployed from those facilities. I am not making a political point, but it is a case of inherited resources and we try to allocate them to the RUC's best advantage. We recognise the strong case for the need to close Castlereagh. Whether that means a replacement building depends on the progress in the talks.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the questions satisfactorily and that we can now move to a conclusion on the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause deals with the short title. That is probably a misnomer, given the amount of time that we have spent on this.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for two things--first, for offering us as much time as we needed to do justice to the Bill. That is what he said in his opening remarks, short title or no. He said that we could have as much time as was necessary to make sure that the Bill received proper scrutiny, and we welcomed that. We are also grateful for the way in which he has addressed our questions and concerns during our deliberations. May I add to that, Mrs. Michie, our gratitude for your kind deliberations and help throughout these proceedings?
<P>
However, I do not know why the Government wished to push the Bill through in one sitting. Clause 7, whatever it refers to, was rushed through in one sitting. We could have considered the Bill in two simple sittings, broken for tea on both occasions, and we would have covered the same ground. Was the Minister misled, or was communication with his Whip not terribly good? Just because, on Second Reading, the Opposition do not fill the time that is allotted--indeed, the Government's huge majority means that they do not care who is speaking--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would address his remarks to clause 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause deals with the title of the Bill. We have had a Second Reading debate, and we have now considerd the Bill in Committee. I do not intend to try to change the title--it is there for all to see. We have been accused of not contributing on Second Reading. We have more than made up for that tonight with regard to all the clauses, including clause 7. You will not like me saying this, Mrs. Michie, but where is the Liberal Democrat, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Opik)? He popped in for two minutes and was away. He spoke on Second Reading, so he should have contributed to the Committee's proceedings.

Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was gracious to you, Mrs. Michie, in his remarks, even though you tried to rule him out of order. If I am out of order, I apologise. I merely want to thank you on behalf of the Committee for your forbearance in our proceedings. I know that it was your first Standing Committee. I am sure that you have learned a lot from being in the Chair and that you will put it to good effect in future Committees. I also thank your colleague, Mrs. Winterton, for her time in the Chair. She carried out her task with considerable alacrity and called several hon. Members to order early on in our sitting. We all benefited from that.
<P>
I am grateful to the Clerks and others who assisted in the Bill's proceedings. The Government feel that it is an important measure and the fact that we have had only one Division and no amendments shows that other hon. Members accept it as an important way forward in tackling terrorism.
<P>
The Bill is only an interim measure. We will be back at a later stage with a much more comprehensive piece of legislation, and I hope that you will be in the Chair for the Committee proceedings on that, Mrs. Michie. It is not likely to be a Northern Ireland Office Bill but will be led by the Home Secretary. Perhaps the Committee will be even bigger then. I thank you, Mrs. Michie, and your Clerks for your assistance this evening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My thanks to you, Mrs. Michie, include your Clerks and all those who have been associated with the Committee. I also pay tribute to the Northern Ireland Office civil servants, who have sat patiently through all our deliberations and given excellent advice to the Minister. They have, in the main, drafted an excellent Bill. We picked up on one or two little items, but if they have taken umbrage at staying up all night, perhaps they would see the Minister and his Whip rather than writing to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you both for your kind words.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
