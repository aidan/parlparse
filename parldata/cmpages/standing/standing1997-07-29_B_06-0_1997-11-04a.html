<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 21, in page 49, line 15, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) A President who has been removed from office under the power conferred in sub-paragraph (3) above shall have the right of appeal against his removal to the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In view of the rapid progress that was made this morning, an amended selection of amendments has been prepared and is on the table. How far we shall proceed with it is in the Committee's hands, not mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> As I was saying this morning, amendment No. 20 resembles amendment No. 13, which we discussed at great length. That amendment related to incapacity and misbehaviour, and I was most anxious to have a greater understanding of how the Government defined misbehaviour. The Minister kindly offered to write to us with an explanation, and I am grateful for that. I also look forward to his comments, if he catches your eye, Mr. Gale, as he will no doubt want to speak further on the matter. I do not, therefore, want to detain the Committee on that aspect of amendments Nos. 20 and 21.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 is a probing amendment, designed to seek clarification on a question of accountability. It relates to the Government's power, through the Lord Chancellor, to remove the president of the tribunal on grounds of ``incapacity or misbehaviour''. That is a wide-ranging power, and it needs clarification. It is appropriate and important that the Government of the day should not have untrammelled powers to do as they like about the removal of such a person. There must be some check, if only to safeguard the interests of the person concerned, in case there is a miscarriage in the process of removing a person from office.
<P>
Conservative Members believe that the president shoudl have the power, or the right, to appeal to the Secretary of State against his removal from office, if that were to happen by means of powers exercised by the Lord Chancellor. The Minister might reasonably argue that only rare and exceptional circumstances would lead the Lord Chancellor to dismiss a president. At present, however, as I understand the schedule, if the Lord Chancellor were to take that course of action, the individual concerned would have no right of redress and no right to appeal. Although we hope that it would never happen, an individual might be removed for the wrong reasons, or erroneously, and that person would have no comeback.
<P>
The purpose of our amendments is to probe the Government on the safeguards for the president and on the operation of the relevant parts of schedule 1.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): I do not intend to rehearse the arguments that were advanced this morning, which reminded me, when I looked at the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), of the television programme ``Men Behaving Badly''--or misbehaving, in his case.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 proposes a new regulation-making power for the Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate to prescribe those definitions of incapacity or misbehaviour on which the hon. Member for West Chelmsford is so keen. Amendment No. 21 would give a president who was removed from office a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Bill makes the appointment and removal of the president matters for the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Advocate. The Secretary of State has been deliberately excluded from that process, and rightly so, as such an arrangement ensures judicial independence.
<P>
I hope that after some consideration of what ``misbehaviour'' means, the hon. Member for Chelmsford may feel able to withdraw the amendment. We have not had a great deal of time to research the matter, but I will give some further examples of behaviour that could result in removal from office: first, as I said this morning, any conviction for a serious criminal offence, especially one involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; secondly, abuse of judicial office; thirdly, proved racial or sexual discrimination or harrassment, and fourthly, persistent offensive behaviour while on the bench.
<P>
There has been only one case of the removal of a judge from office in England and Wales. That was in 1984, for smuggling. That adds to the list of misbehaviour, so I hope that hon. Members find the example helpful.
<P>
Finally, I found the case of a coroner who summoned a jury following a sudden death in his district. On the day appointed, however, he attended in a state of intoxication and, without swearing in the jury, dismissed them for no adequate reason. On petition to the Lord Chancellor, the coroner was ordered to be removed on the grounds of misbehaviour in office. That happened in 1861.
<P>
I hope that in the light of those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> What are the Minister's views on the possibility of giving the president a right of appeal if he were to be dismissed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As I explained, it is not the rule of the Secretary of State to become involved in such judicial matters, which are independent of the Secretary of State. It would not be right to have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State in such circumstances. I am not persuaded by the arguments, and hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am genuinely grateful to the Minister for the examples of misbehaviour that he has cited. That was all that we asked for this morning, and it is extremely helpful that finally, after the lunch break, we have received definitions beyond contracts of employment and criminal acts. I fully accept and understand his point.
<P>
I also understand the Minister's point on amendment No. 21 about having an appeal mechanism to the Secretary of State. He is probably right that the Secretary of State may not be the ideal person. I am not convinced about the principle that a person who is to be dismissed should have no right of redress or access to an appeals system. However, given what the Minister has said, not much can be gained by pursuing that at this point. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87 in page 49, line 17, leave out `Lord Chancellor' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Secretary of State'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment provides for the Secretary of State to pay the salary, pension and other allowances to the president of appeal tribunals. It reflects the provisions set out in schedule 2 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, and the current arrangements whereby the power to make payment is vested in the Secretary of State.
<P>
In practice, at present, most of the current president's salary is paid by the Lord Chancellor's Department, because the current president is a circuit judge. The DSS pays the president the difference between his salary as a circuit judge and his salary as president.
<P>
Neither the current legislation nor the Bill, however, require the president to be a judge. The qualifications required to be appointed president are either a 10-year general qualification under section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, or to be an advocate or solicitor in Scotland of at least 10 years' standing. If whoever is appointed president is not a judge, the whole of his salary, pension and allowances will be paid by the DSS, which funds all aspects of tribunal administration. The amendment is necessary to make appropriate provision for the payment of the president, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I trust that the Committee will forgive the naivety of youth and my recent introduction to the House if I say that I had understood, before seeing amendment No. 87, that the general purport of Government amendments to a piece of legislation was to improve that legislation. Amendment No. 87, alas, has the reverse effect. In the context of our proposed amendments Nos. 145 and 147, which will be debated shortly, it seems to take the opposite direction from that which we believe would improve the Bill.
<P>
The significance of the paymaster of the president of the tribunal must be understood in the light of all the Committee's discussions, and especially in the light of what has emerged about the character of the decision making to which various clauses will give rise. The Bill gives wide-ranging powers to the Secretary of State to make and unmake decisions, and to regulate his or her conduct in the making and unmaking of decisions by regulation, without constraint. It also allows the Secretary of State to make changes, on his or her own initiative, to decisions that have given rise to legitimate expectation--again, that will be done through regulations, made without constraint. In all cases, regulations will be subject to the negative, and not the affirmative, resolution procedure. In short, our consideration of the Bill up to this point has revealed that the Secretary of State will have wide-ranging, almost unlimited powers. In such a context, appeals--and their independence--become more important, as does the need for appeals to be seen to be independent.
<P>
The question of which Department pays a particular officer of a particular tribunal might be thought insignificant, or merely a matter of administrative convenience--but I am by no means sure that that is the case. The Child Poverty Action Group--that well-known repository of Conservative propaganda--alerts us to the fact that the phrasing of paragraph 2 gives rise to the possibility that the Secretary of State will determine the amount of that payment, and the rules that govern what it should be.
<P>
The CPAG points out quite rightly that it is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility--indeed, one might say that it would be in the spirit of the legislation as explained so far--for the DSS to link the president's salary to the tribunal's performance. It is easy to imagine the Minister telling us at a later date that we should have understood that the Bill, which he has frequently described as making social security more effective, efficient and--if I may use a word that has attained some notoriety in the Committee--depersonalised, might also give the DSS and the Secretary of State the power to regulate the president's salary in order to make his or her actions more efficient.
<P>
The Minister has often used the word ``modern'', and I suppose that it would be modern for the Secretary of State to set up a system that gave the president of the tribunal an incentive to dispatch cases with greater efficiency--that is, with greater alacrity.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In those cases dispatched with greater alacrity, either more appeals would be allowed than should be allowed, or more would be refused than should be refused. That would have been an important matter in any event, but it is especially important in the context of the wide-ranging powers that other parts of the Bill give to the Secretary of State.
<P>
It is vital that the tribunal president be utterly independent. Alas, he is bound to be paid by some arm of the state; we cannot imagine that he will be paid for by voluntary donations or by the private sector. So it is extremely important that both the person appointed and the paymaster should be as separate as possible from the Secretary of State, against whom, in effect, appeals would be brought on behalf of claimants who had been treated unfairly.
<P>
The change proposed in the amendment would have the opposite effect. It would convey from the Lord Chancellor, who is perhaps the most independent member of the Government, to the Secretary of State, who is perhaps the most interested party among Ministers, the role of paying the president of the tribunal. That would be a retrograde step, and I fear that it betokens the Government's likely rejection of amendments Nos. 145 to 147, which would give the Lord Chancellor the duty and power to pay tribunal members. Amendment No. 87 would deprive the Lord Chancellor of that right and duty and transfer it to the Secretary of State. I hope that the Government will reconsider it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I have absolutely no intention of reconsidering the matter. The terms of appointment of the president are clearly set out by the Lord Chancellor, and the Government merely pay the money. We already pay some of it, and there has never been any suggestion--nor should there be--that the current president is anything other than independent. I admire that independence, which the Bill would preserve. There is no reason for the Committee not to approve the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is reassuring, in part. The Minister has not accepted my argument, but Opposition Members have grown used to that. I had a brief, vague hope this morning that we might win a vote, as at one time very few Labour Members were present, but I did not expect the Minister to change his mind about the amendment.
<P>
I am reassured by the hon. Gentleman's statement that he respects the president's independence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I said that in my opening speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Indeed, and it is helpful to have that reassurance restated. Even more reassuring is the Minister's further statement--if I understood him aright--that the Lord Chancellor would set the terms of remuneration, and that the Secretary of State would merely make the payments. Have I misunderstood?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If the Minister was saying that the Lord Chancellor would continue to set the terms and that the Secretary of State would be merely the paymaster, that would be reassuring. However, I have not found a reference to that in the Bill. Will the Minister clarify the point?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clearly, the Minister does not intend to clarify that point.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 49, line 18, leave out, `allowances or gratuities' and insert `or allowances'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 23, in page 49, line 21, leave out `, allowances or gratuities' and insert `or allowances'.
<P>
No. 24, in page 49, line 23, after `tribunal', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or appointed under this Chapter to assist him,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 25, in page 49, line 38, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `5A. The classes of allowances and expenses which shall be payable under paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 above shall be set out in regulations'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> These are probing amendments. I shall be brief, but I am perplexed. The schedule empowers the Lord Chancellor to make payments available to the president of the appeals tribunal for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such remuneration, pensions, allowances or gratuities to or in respect of the President as he may determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is perfectly reasonable, just as it is for the Secretary of State to do the same with members of the appeals panel, because they have important work to do and we would expect them to receive remuneration. However, I would appreciate clarification from the Minister. Remuneration and pensions are straightforward; I understand the need for allowances in certain circumstances, but I am puzzled by the words ``or gratuities''. What do those words mean? What sort of payments could be made and what will be the criterion for gratuities being paid to the president or to appeals panel members?
<P>
Amendment No. 25 concerns accountability and transparency. We propose a new paragraph--5A--which would define allowances and expenses and provide, under regulations, what amounts would be payable, but that might not be the best way to make the information available. Perhaps the Minister has an explanation of how the existing system deals with the problem--I should be interested to hear it--and how people can find out what the remuneration is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman's two substantive points relate to gratuities. [Interruption.] May I deal with amendment No. 25 first?
<P>
As I have explained, the financial provisions are in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the schedule. The remaining provisions for allowances, in paragraphs 4 and 5, are largely a re-enactment of the provisions in schedule 2 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. They provide for the payment of expenses to appellants, for example, travel expenses incurred when attending a hearing or expenses arising from the work of an appeal tribunal, such as the fee for a medical report.
<P>
The amendment would insert a provision providing a regulation-making power to prescribe allowances and expenses payable under paragraphs 2 to 5 of schedule 1. Currently, we do not subject those matters to regulation and there is no reason to do so. They have been handled perfectly satisfactorily in the past and I am not persuaded that the schedule should be prescriptive.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about gratuities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Before the Minister finishes with amendment No. 25, will he clarify how the system works? How can people find out what the remunerations, pensions and allowances are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he is asking? His question was rather generalised--who would be seeking the information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> To make the question all embracing, could the information be put into the public domain so that anyone could have access to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall seek the precise information. I am not certain what is and is not in the public domain. The hon. Gentleman would not want me to give assurances on what may be matters of confidentiality. I shall come back to the point.
<P>
I am happy to reconsider the expression ``gratuities'' to clarify what it means in practice. Again, I shall come back to the Committee if we need to retain that word in that part of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his promise to consider the matter and to come back to the Committee. I should perhaps quit while I am ahead [hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] That would be uncharacteristic, I know. I have just one question, however. Given that the Minister wants to consider the term, what, at the moment, does he think that it means in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is pushing. I gave an assurance that I would consider the term to ensure that we were clear about how it was used in practice. That is exactly what I shall come back to the Committee about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I look forward to his comments on the two points that I have raised. He will, of course, come back to us when we have dealt with the schedule. That is no criticism of him, because it is not his fault--that is the way in which the Bill is unfolding. That said, we shall still appreciate being able to consider the issue. If there is a problem or if the Government, having considered our concerns and what may potentially be an anomalous financial reward, want to take action at a later stage, there will be an opportunity to tidy the Bill up. For that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 145, page 49, line 20, leave out `The Secretary of State' and insert `The Lord Chancellor'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 146, in page 49, line 24, leave out `The Secretary of State' and insert `The Lord Chancellor'.
<P>
No. 147, in page 49, line 34, leave out `The Secretary of State' and insert `The Lord Chancellor'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should preface my remarks on the amendments by saying that I have come to the conclusion that the Minister's comments on amendment No. 87 were far from reassuring, although he has been very helpful to my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) and, indeed, to the Committee in the intervening period. I fear that the same problem will arise in relation to amendments Nos. 145 to 147.
<P>
I begin, therefore, with a plea for clarity, just in case I have misunderstood. From what I understood him to be saying and from looking again at the paragraphs concerned, I think that the Minister was under an illusion. He suggested that the Lord Chancellor would retain a role in relation to members of the tribunal, with whom the amendments are concerned, and to the president. As far as I can see from the schedule--unless I am missing something, which the Minister could clarify--the Lord Chancellor is unseen, leaving the Secretary of State alone in place to determine what is paid, how it is paid and on what basis it is paid to the president and members of the tribunal. The guarantee of independence to which the Minister referred would apply neither to the members of the tribunal nor its president.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> So that there is clarity on the matter, clause 6(4), which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read, states that the terms of appointment will be determined by the Lord Chancellor with the consent of the Secretary of State. That makes it clear that the Lord Chancellor continues to have a role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is an extremely helpful clarification and I have to admit to the Minister that I had not recalled clause 6(4), although I looked at it when we were going through it. If I understand the matter correctly, the provisions relate exclusively to payment in all the cases before us--those of the president and the members of the tribunal. That is reassuring and if that is the case, I shall press the Minister on just one further point, which could lead the Opposition to withdraw the amendment and to be happy with amendment No. 87. Will the Minister assure us that there is no question that performance-related pay will be intruded into the character of the payment, which is based on schedule 1 ? Is he clear that clause 6(4), not schedule 1, will govern the nature of the payment and, therefore, of performance-related pay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I can give--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman for West Dorset giving way, or has he finished?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I was hoping to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In that case, there is no reason to continue with the movement to amend paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) in the way that is suggested in amendments Nos. 145 to 147. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 49, line 25, leave out `this Part' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`section 13 of this Act or section 20 of the Child Support Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment clarifies the circumstances under which the Secretary of State may pay travelling and other allowances to persons required to attend appeal tribunal hearings. As drafted, paragraph 4(1)(a) of schedule 1 provides for travelling and other allowances to be payable to persons required to attend any proceedings under part I of the Bill. However, part I includes provisions that relate not only to appeal tribunals but to appeals to commissioners and to the courts.
<P>
The amendment makes it clear that the Secretary of State may pay travelling and other allowances under schedule 1 only to those persons who are required to attend appeal tribunal hearings. Provisions relating to expenses in relation to appeals before commissioners or the courts are elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 89, in page 50, line 6, leave out `either panel' and insert `the panels'.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 50, line 9, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and with organisations which provide representation for appellants at tribunal hearings.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now return to a theme from this morning--at least, it was while I was speaking. I refer to the ability of appeal tribunals to deal properly with applicants who may have something a bit special about them, such as gender, disability or ethnic origins.
<P>
In this morning's debate, although we had some assurances, we failed to put in the Bill any requirement for appeal tribunals to include people with the relevant expertise. It is therefore particularly important that those on appeal tribunals who do not have the relevant expertise are given proper training to enable them to understand the particular problems of certain classes of appellant. That is why we believe that training should be carried out following consultation with organisations that may be able to provide a source of expertise that the Secretary of State does not necessarily have.
<P>
There are many sorts of different special requirements. Special legal training might be necessary; the Secretary of State might be thought to know a little about that, but not necessarily as much as some of the organisations representing appellants. In matters of gender, disability and ethnic minorities, it may not be a question of training in the law or in the difficulties experienced by different groups, but of how to approach such appellants, reassure them that their case is being treated properly and make them happier with the outcome. For example, certain groups might speak a language which is not easily understandable by some of those appointed to the appeal tribunals. That may be something with which the Secretary of State is not familiar.
<P>
For all those reasons, it would be sensible for training to take into consideration aspects of how to deal with an appeal with which the Secretary of State may not be as conversant as some of the organisations representing the appellants. The appeal process would be enhanced by a requirement for those who are carrying out training to take into account the views of organisations which deal with the appellants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Training is extremely important. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments, and am sure that everyone involved in the new arrangements will wish to ensure that all those who participate in appeals tribunals are fully trained in the widest sense of the word, taking into account all the training aspects that have been identified. I am well aware from my discussions with welfare rights organisations that they would welcome the opportunity to participate in training.
<P>
I know also that the president, as head of the appeal tribunal, will want to ensure that the training of panel members is extremely comprehensive and properly focused. However, I am not persuaded that the matter should be included in the Bill. I feel confident that the president will welcome any approaches from welfare rights and advocacy organisations about how the training should be developed. That will ensure that there is an increasing awareness of the many different aspects of training necessary to ensure that people sitting on tribunals are as competent as possible. It is for the president to make the necessary arrangements, but I know that there will be open-mindedness and that welfare rights organisations will, quite properly, make known their views; and that they will be taken into account.
<P>
I hope that with those assurances, and my belief that the matter does not need to be dealt with in the Bill, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I would welcome further reassurances from the Minister. He argued that the matter does not need to be on the face of the Bill. One wonders why, then, there is anything on the face of the Bill about this matter, such as the requirement that the president consult the Secretary of State. Paragraph 8 begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The President shall, after the requisite consultation,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and a separate sub-paragraph then defines ``the requisite consultation''. It seems peculiar that the Bill should specify much of what that phrase means, and that we should have the Minister's assurance that in practice that consultation will involve the organisations to which I have referred, but that for some reason that particular part of the consultation is not specified in the Bill. Can the Minister give any further explanation of why only that part of the consultation should not be specified in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall certainly try. There is a range of other bodies that could appropriately be consulted and which may want to influence the nature of the training. It would not be appropriate to include an exhaustive list in the primary legislation, but I am sure that all the appropriate appellants' bodies will make their views known to the president and that the training will be comprehensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Following his further explanation, it seems that the Minister may, if I withdraw the amendment, want to consider tabling an amendment at a later stage which includes the organisations referred to in amendment No. 151, perhaps with wording such as ``with some representative organisations among those which provide representation for appellants''. That would not require all organisations to be consulted--the Minister seemed rather frightened that that might be our definition--but the Bill would at least contain an assurance that the consultation that he has spoken of will take place. In the hope that he will reconsider the matter between now and Third Reading, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We propose further onerous duties on the president, whom we feel is not having a hard enough life.
<P>
Amendment No. 152 would require not merely that the president should tell the Secretary of State whatever the Secretary of State may ask, which appears to be the present requirement, but should have minimum reporting requirements. We also propose two types of reporting by the president. The purpose of the amendment, as with so many of our amendments, is to help the Government.
<P>
The Government clearly intend to speed up the appeals process and ensure that more decisions are right first time. If the president were to report annually on the outcomes of appeal tribunals and to identify issues that were repeatedly overturned on appeal, it would facilitate first-tier decision makers in their decisions, and improve the guidance that is given to them. A second report from the perspective of appeal tribunals and the president on the quality of first-tier decision making generally--on whether it was getting better or worse and on whether there were specific problems--would also facilitate the improvement of that decision making.
<P>
Amendment No. 152 would help adjudication officers get it right first time. The Secretary of State may, of her own free will, ask the president to supply such information, but should she be otherwise engaged, we think it should be the president's duty to provide that information and to make it public, so that if it is not acted on, parliamentary scrutiny and public pressure can cause it to be acted on.
<P>
Amendment No. 153 deals with complaints about the conduct of appeal tribunals or the behaviour of their members. The need for it is highlighted by the experience of a constituent who complained that her appeal had not been conducted correctly and, in particular, that the tribunal chair and not taken much account of the fact that she was deaf and of her other needs. I duly wrote to the independent tribunal service. My office received a phone call that, in summary, asked who this jumped-up upstart thought he was, daring to question the conduct of the appeal tribunal. The letter that I subsequently received as good as said, ``Of course you'll understand, old chap, that you shouldn't really be raising these sorts of things.''
<P>
That is my experience, but the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said that in its experience the procedures for complaining about the conduct of tribunals are not yet fully worked out. The amendment would simply ensure that complaints were properly dealt with and that formal procedures were established.
<P>
Both amendments would therefore ensure that justice was seen to be done and that the initial decision was more likely to be right. In that spirit, I hope that the Minister will look on them favourably.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment proposes to replace paragraph 9 of schedule 1 with a revised, more detailed version of the information that the president would be required to provide to the Secretary of State.
<P>
It may help the Committee if I explain the intention behind paragraph 9. The president of tribunal jurisdictions within the independent tribunal service is currently under no obligation to provide the Secretary of State with any information other than whether an original decision is upheld or overturned on appeal. Helpfully, the current president has recognised the value of providing information on tribunal activities and has voluntarily produced annual reports in the past two years. We believe that monitoring and reporting on appeal tribunal functions is essential to identify trends and to ensure that the intention of the legislation and the policy objectives are being achieved consequently. We have therefore made provision in paragraph 9 to put reporting on a formal footing and to ensure that the reports meet the required standards.
<P>
The information that the president will provide will include observations on the quality of the agencies original decisions. That important measure will provide an additional, independent method of monitoring agency decision making. Knowing why initial decisions are upheld or overturned will enable the agencies to monitor trends, deal with common errors and identify where additional training is required.
<P>
The amendment would require the president to provide the Secretary of State with information and reports on anything relating to his functions and anything that he could reasonably be expected to comment on, having regard to the nature of his office.
<P>
Using the words of the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), I believe that those would be over-burdensome requirements, since we are putting reporting on a formal footing, as I have described.
<P>
The amendment would widen, to an inappropriate extent, the scope of the information that the president would be required to provide and the influence that the Secretary of State would be able to bring to bear on him. We would strongly resist any measures that sought to undermine the independence of the decision-making process or indeed, of anything reported by the president as a result of matters having been prescribed inappropriately by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 153 seeks to ensure that the president of appeals tribunals will properly investigate complaints against a member of the panel or the conduct of an appeal hearing. As I pointed out to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), the Lord Chancellor has responsibility under clause 6 for the appointment and removal of panel members for England and Wales. Clause 7 gives similar responsibilities to the Lord Advocate with respect to the panel for Scotland. Responsibility for the investigation of complaints lies with the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate. Complaints about the conduct of tribunal chairmen and members are a serious matter and should always be thoroughly investigated. That will continue to be the case. If the hon. Member for Northavon knows of cases in which those matters are not being properly investigated, as he suggested, I would be grateful if he would write to me about them.
<P>
The amendment would require the investigation of any and all complaints, not only when they relate to the conduct of a panel member but when they are about how he or she has exercised judical discretion and how the appeal hearing had been conducted. The appropriate way to challenge the exercise of judicial discretion is by way of further appeal.
<P>
In the light of those explanations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I suppose that ``mildly reassured'' would be the most appropriate description. I am grateful for the Minister's remark that monitoring and reporting are essential; but I am disappointed that when a specific instance of monitoring and reporting that could have beneficial consequences is put forward, it will be rejected. Producing a report may be onerous on the president, but if an important decision is repeatedly being got wrong up and down the country or if endless appeals are being created, surely some overtime or weekend work by the president might save a great deal of work having to be done by everybody else. With that in mind, I had hoped that the reporting requirement might be strengthened. I am grateful to the Minister, however, for pointing out that the Bill makes some provision for that elsewhere.
<P>
I am also pleased to hear that the Minister takes the complaints procedure seriously. I was quoting not just from my own experience but from that of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which said that the process of complaining was underdeveloped and not well-known--presumably it did so from experience of citizens advice bureaux up and down the country. The Minister should not be quite as reassured on that point as he appears to be. Nevertheless, given his acceptance of the principles of the amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26 in page 50, line 17, after `service', insert `and advise'.
<P>
This is simply another probing amendment. I should like more information about the function of clerks to appeals tribunals. Paragraph 10 of schedule 1 states:
<P>
``The Secretary of State may by regulations provide--
<P>
	(a) for clerks to be assigned to service appeal tribunals; and
<P>
	(b) for clerks so assigned to be responsible for summoning members of the appropriate panel to serve on such tribunals.''
<P>
That is reiterated in the helpful Department of Social Security notes on clauses, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The clerks of tribunals should be under a duty to summon members of the appropriate panel to serve on a tribunal''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear and straightforward. I want the Minister to tell me more about the duties and functions of the clerk, as it is an important role to ensure that the nuts and bolts of the system operate smoothly and successfully. Will the clerk simply be a bureaucrat--for want of a better word--who apportions members of the panels; or will he be like the Clerk to this Committee--someone who has a role in ensuring that the Committee runs smoothly, but who also has an advisory role providing expert advice to the Chairman and to members of the Committee on points of information and fact, as and when required? What, in short, is the precise role of the clerks? If the answer is that they are more than just organisers of the system and have an advisory capacity, what sort of training will they have to ensure that they are fully qualified and up to speed to carry out that role successfully?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I hope I can be helpful to the Committee. The amendment would expand the role of the clerk to the tribunal to include advising appeal tribunals. As members of the Committee know, clerks have been a feature of the tribunal system for many years. They play an important role in supporting the work of the tribunal, both before and at the hearing.
<P>
Under the new arrangements, once an appeal has been allocated to a particular tribunal constitution, it will be the responsibility of the clerk to summon the panel members to sit on the tribunal.
<P>
In paragraph 11 of the schedule, we have provided for an expanded role for officers authorised by the Secretary of State. We intend that tribunal clerks will also be able to carry out some limited functions of appeal tribunals. With proper training and access to judicial advice, the role of the clerks could, and should, be extended further. They should be able to help appeal tribunals by taking some very limited decisions. For example, clause 28 provides for the correction of accidental errors in any decision or record of decision. Paragraph 11 will allow regulations to be made so that a clerk can make these corrections. At present, to correct an error such as 1996 written as 1796 requires a decision by a tribunal chairman. The types of decisions that a clerk will be able to undertake in the new arrangements are limited, however, to that type of correction. The clerk will not be able to take any decision that would be an actual determination of an appeal, application or reference.
<P>
	Paragraph 10 provides for clerks to service tribunals. That can include giving advice. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. We agree that the role of the clerk should be expanded and the provisons in the Bill deal with that change satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> If I heard the Minister correctly, he said that under paragraph 11 clerks were going to be categorised as officers, able to take limited decisions to remedy faults, and he gave the example of 1996 being written as 1796. But sub-paragraph 11(1) (a), which is a general power for officers, describes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``officers authorised by the Secretary of State to make any determinations which fall to be made by an appeal tribunal and which do not involve the determination of any appeal, application for leave to appeal or reference''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may be wrong, but on the face of it, that seems to suggest that the officers have more powers than simply correcting factual errors such as dates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As I said, that was just one example. I am not saying that that is an exclusive list of limited matters that the clerk could deal with. I am making it absolutely clear--paragraph 11 makes it clear--that the clerk would not be involved in making any determination of an appeal, application for leave to appeal or reference. The matters to be dealt with would be closely prescribed in the way that I have outlined. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will it be specified in regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The exact powers of the clerk in the relevant matters will, I think, be laid out in guidance to the tribunal service.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> If so, what will be in the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We are carrying forward in regulations any matters that the clerk currently has power to determine. Through schedule 1(11) we will expand matters. Any description that is required of what the clerk may do will appear in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I fully understand that, but how is it compatible with the Minister's previous statement about laying the matter out in guidance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No, I was saying that the way in which the arrangement would operate in practice would be set out in guidance, but the powers, as the hon. Gentleman has identified, would be in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am slightly perplexed by the Minister's last statement. If the way in which the arrangement will operate will be in guidance, but the powers will be in regulations--what is the difference?
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily and I should be more than happy for the Minister to write to me to explain, once we have both had an opportunity to read the Official Report tomorrow. Provided the Minister is happy to write to me, and does not want to deal with the matter now, I shall withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The note handed to me reaffirms what I have been saying. Powers are always laid down in regulations. Guidance explains how they are put into effect. The method of operation will be in guidance, but the power of acting, and the limitations on that power, are established through regulations. I know that it is confusing, but that difference between the guidance and the regulations is what I intended to explain in my earlier comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 91, in page 50, line 19, leave out `appropriate panel' and insert `panels'.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 50, leave out lines 20 to 23.
<P>
I am concerned about schedule 1(11) because of the apparently sweeping powers that it would give to administrative officials of the Benefits Agency or the other DSS agencies. In particular, if our understanding of the paragraph is correct--I hope that the Minister will not let me drone on interminably if it is not; or even if it is--the officials will have discretion to strike out appeals. Our reading of the provision is that one of its consequences would be to give an official delegated power to examine an appeal or an application for revision, and say, ``No, you cannot appeal.''
<P>
That seems to us wholly unacceptable. A person who claimed benefit could be turned down, or find that the amount was queried. The applicant could then ask for the decision to be reviewed, whereupon the application could be granted, or the review could come up with the same answer as before. If that person then applied for appeal, a letter could come back in a buff envelope from the Benefits Agency, saying, ``Tough.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I hope that what I have to say will enable the honourable Gentleman not to drone on. The answer to his question is no; his understanding is not right. The administrative staff of the appeals service would be responsible--not the Benefits Agency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, but I am not sure whether it will leave me sleeping peacefully at night. It will still be administrative staff who make the decisions. I shall be happy to be corrected on the matter, but it appears that the person making the decision is not necessarily a legally qualified member of the panel. It is not even necessarily anybody from the panel--
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be helpful if the honourable Gentleman were to complete his opening remark. We can then propose the amendment formally and the Minister can respond.
<P>
<B>Mr Webb:</B> Assuming that our understanding of this paragraph of the schedule is correct, it provides for administrative staff to make decisions about striking out of appeals. We would be worried about that. From our discussions earlier today and other schedules it is clear that striking out will be an increasing practice. We would welcome reassurance that this will not be done simply by administrative officers. It is with that in mind that this probing amendment has been tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I hope that the honourable Gentleman will be reassured by my point about the Benefits Agency not being responsible; and secondly, that it will be a panel member who does any striking out, not a member of the administrative staff. I hope that, with that assurance, he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I expect that the most profitable course will be to withdraw it at this stage. We will want to return to striking out, which obviously has wider implications than whether it is done by administrative officials. With that assurance, and with due warning to the Minister that striking out still worries us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which either determines that a person is not entitled to receive immediate payment of the benefit to which it relates or determines that he is only entitled to such payment at a particular rate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Here we are talking about which decisions are appealable and which are not. We have the feeling that there is perhaps rather too little that can be appealable as a result of the clause. Our amendments to the clause mainly intend to widen the scope for appeals in some cases. In particular, there is apparently to be no appeal, unless the amendment is accepted, against a decision that a payment should not be immediate.
<P>
People who are trying to obtain benefits do not have much money--they would not be bothering to do so if they did. Therefore if a decision is made that a benefit is to be refused for some reason, although it may be payable later, when the person claiming the benefit may have had to exist in considerable poverty for quite some time, that unfairness can be alleviated if the person claiming the benefit has the right to appeal against the decision that the payment should not be immediate.
<P>
There may well be cases in which matters are still subject to other appeals, apart from the case of the applicant himself. But it is no good reason to withhold payment of benefit temporarily just because the Government accept that they may later pay all that benefit once the other appeal has been decided and it becomes possible to say that the applicant's own case should also have had the relevant benefit.
<P>
There is also the question of what rates should be paid. It is possible that a decision could be taken that a lower rate than that which has been applied for should be paid, and it is not acceptable to us that that should not be appealable. The amount granted may be only a small proportion of what has been applied for, and it is only fair that that should be just as appealable as a decision to reject completely an applicant's request for some form of benefit.
<P>
Were the Minister to accept the amendment he would save himself having to accept another Liberal Democrat amendment which we tabled to schedule 3. Knowing the voting power that we wield, I feel sure that he wishes to speed the Committee on its way swiftly by enabling us to withdraw the schedule 3 amendment. I hope that I have persuaded him that amendment No. 175 is a good one to accept, because it would enable us to move on swiftly in a manner to which he would not object. As a humane person, he is only too aware of the difficulties arising from a decision to put off paying benefit simply because another, perhaps fairly distant, case is going through an appeal process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Although any argument strong enough to speed the passage of the Bill through its Committee stage is clearly powerful and persuasive, unfortunately I am unable to accept such an offer at this time. I hope that at some stage of the Bill's passage we shall be able to accept the Liberal Democrat's amendments in the form that they present them. We do not wish to worry too much about voting power on the Floor of the House at this point in the Parliament, however.
<P>
Clause 13 is one of the most important in the Bill because it sets out rights of appeal to the new, unified, independent tribunal. Amendment No. 175 seeks to provide for a right of appeal against a decision on the suspension of benefit. It may be helpful if I explain to the Committee our intentions on appeal rights for suspension decisions.
<P>
Decisions to suspend do not, and will not, have a right of appeal. This will be made clear in regulations under schedule 2 paragraph 9. I will explain why the Government do not consider it appropriate to allow a right of appeal for suspensions. The Department suspends payment of benefit in two main types of case. The first is where it is not clear that there is a continuing entitlement and the claimant has failed to co-operate with measures to determine the matter one way or another. Usually it will take no more than a few days to resolve any doubt. The decision to suspend, and a decision to lift suspension, can be taken quickly. Speed and flexibility are essential. Where subsequently a person complies, and there is evidence of continuing entitlement, benefit will be reinstated, and full arrears paid. If it is evident that benefit should stop, or the amount be changed, a decision to supersede will be taken under clause 11. There will be a right of appeal against the new decision.
<P>
The second type of case is where the Department suspends payment of benefit when an appeal is pending, either in a claimant's own case or in another case that raises an issue of law that needs to be resolved before a final decision on entitlement can be made. In such cases an appeal will already be in progress in relation to the substantive issue of entitlement, either in the claimant's, or another's case. Providing for an additional appeal right on a procedural point such as a benefit suspension will merely multiply appeals at a time when we are attempting to simplify the process.
<P>
The power to suspend is an important tool for ensuring the integrity of benefit expenditure. We have responsibilities to the public who fund the welfare system to be prudent in the amounts that we pay.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Can the Minister tell us in how many cases he expects to use this power each year, and approximately how long he expects payment of benefit to be suspended? He will remember that part of my argument was that, if we are not careful, suspension of benefit that is unappealable may leave people in great poverty for a considerable time. That is relevant to the argument--if the suspension were for only a few days it would not matter, but serious questions would be posed if it was for longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. As I have said, the purpose of the first type of suspension to which I alluded is the quick resolution of any dispute about entitlement, and getting the material facts together to support one argument or the other. I do not have before me the details of the information that the hon. Gentleman has requested, but if it is collected I shall ensure that he receives it. Whatever the numbers are, they do not undermine the Government's argument that in those particular cases we would wish to use suspension powers and we do not intend to extend to them rights to appeal. I am prepared to give the information, but I will not be persuaded by the arguments against the use of suspension. Even though the hon. Gentleman does not have the information before him today, I hope that he will accept the Government's argument and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am prepared to withdraw the amendment pending the information, but I am sorry that the Minister does not think that the time involved is relevant. On the contrary, it is the crux of the argument. People who may have very little money on which to exist could be told that, even though it is likely that they are due the money, they cannot have it provisionally until some other case--it may have nothing to do with them and they may have no power to ensure that it is held quickly--is decided. They may be left in an intolerable situation through no fault of their own while the Government, if they chose to do so, could overcome the problem by allowing for interim payments.
<P>
The difficulty with the clause is not that interim payments are impossible, but that appellants have no right to appeal against a decision. They will not be able to make a case that they are in desperate need and require immediate interim payments to keep them going while the other appeals, which have nothing to do with them, are being heard. It is critical that we be reassured that the hardship that may be caused by the inability to appeal is not significant. Sadly, it seems likely that the information, should the Minister be able to obtain it, will show that the hardship would be significant in a significant number of cases. If so, we should want to return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I will be able to provide the information, and the hon. Gentleman could return to the matter under clause 22. Perhaps those assurances will help him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Certainly that is helpful, but the Minister is right--we may want to return to the matter, depending on the information. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Minister has said, the clause is central to the Bill. The matter of what can and cannot be appealed is important and we should focus on what areas outside those two categories the Minister has considered. Amendment No. 141 probes the Government's intentions on the time limits for bringing appeals and specifies a limit of six months.
<P>
In the process of substantially tightening up the appeal process there is a risk of stimulating a judicial review process. How does the Minister plan to speed up the appeal process without stimulating a legal action that might slow it down?
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I will speak only to amendments Nos. 155 to 157. Amendments Nos. 155 and 156 relate to the length of time within which one may appeal. Amendment No. 155 states that regulations ``shall'' be made; we were puzzled because the Bill simply said that regulations may be made regarding the length of time within which an appeal could be made. Will the Minister explain the use of the word ``may'' in that context?
<P>
We felt that the regulations should be made and that they should allow three months for an appeal. We have already discussed that point. The Minister said that many appeals are made within one month and that he would want to encourage appellants to appeal quickly. We have no problem with that, but it seems rather perverse to penalise those who, perhaps for good reason, do not appeal within one month. It may be a difficult time in their life. One can imagine a widow appealing against a decision on widow's benefit, or someone who has just become unwell and whose benefit claim has been turned down. In those cases the claimant's circumstances do not readily allow a prompt claim.
<P>
Appellants have perfectly good incentives to appeal without needing the Government to chivvy them along with artificially short deadlines. One month is not appropriate. The present limit of three months is adequate and, presumably, there is no good reason why people should not be given that extra time if they are to make valid appeals.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 would relax slightly the present restrictive rules on late appeals to allow those who have good cause--and who will be acutely affected if the limit is cut to one month--to put in their appeal after whatever deadline is set. I hope that even if the Minister cannot accept the three-month deadline, he will think seriously about the current draconian rules on late appeals and, given his new, tighter timetable, will look favourably on amendment No. 156.
<P>
Amendment No. 157 attempts to achieve a presumption in favour of oral hearings, rather than decisions based on papers. I was wondering what authoritative source I could cite in favour of oral hearings, and it struck me that, on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Mr. Goggins) made the point forcefully when he asked.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what is fair about a system of appeals in which people who turn up with an adviser have a two in three chance of winning, people who turn up alone have a one in two chance, and people who do not turn up at all have a one in four chance?''--[Official Report, 22nd July 1997; Vol. 298, c. 838.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman might have added ``the Government whom I support would like to move towards the system where people have a one in two chance''.
<P>
The current system is not producing justice if it presumes a paper hearing unless the appellant opts for an oral hearing. Many appellants will not be aware of their chances of success under the various routes. The system should therefore be geared to enable them to receive justice. Surely the higher chances of success in represented oral hearings suggest that, in some cases that are decided on the papers, the wrong decision is being reached. We think that the presumption in favour of oral hearings would mean that more decisions would be correct and that fewer decisions would then go on to further appeals, clogging up the process still further. We believe that the amendments would make the process more just.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I have a small comment about ``may'' and ``shall''. I am assured that this is the normal way of drafting regulations in the Bill; there is no sinister intention behind it. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Easily pleased!
<P>
I am sure that Members of the Committee appreciate that it is in no one's interest to leave important issues unresolved for an indeterminate period. It is our intention to set a one-month time limit in which an appeal can be made. That strikes a reasonable balance between giving the appellant sufficient time in which to consider his appeal and ensuring that there are no undue delays. As I said when the Committee considered clause 10, analysis of existing benefit appeals suggests that more claimants appeal within that time limit.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 141 and 156 would provide time limits of six months and three months respectively in which an appeal can be made. The argument against the amendments is the same as the basic principles that I have just outlined. A period of one month is perfectly adequate, and is in line with our policy of combining rights with responsibilities. A person who is dissatisfied with the decision has the right to appeal, but has responsibility for doing so within a reasonable period of time.
<P>
Moreover, as we discussed on clause 10, a period of one month will be allowed for a person to dispute the decision, and a further month if he or she subsequently wishes to appeal. That was what I outlined to the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) when we debated the matter under that clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 further specifies that a full-time chairman may accept a late appeal when he considers that a person has reasonable excuse for not bringing the appeal within the time limit. The current legislation contains special provisions to deal with late appeals. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured when I tell him that we shall be making similar arrangements in the future.
<P>
Amendment No. 157 would ensure that there will be an oral hearing of all appeals unless the appellant takes a positive step to opt out and allow the appeal to be heard on the papers alone. As hon. Members know, a year ago changes were introduced to appeal tribunal procedures, with the aim of improving the service offered to appellants. One key change was the abolition of an automatic oral hearing. Instead, appellants have to take a positive step of opting into an oral hearing. If they do not do so, the appeal will be heard on the papers alone.
<P>
That change was made because some 30 per cent. of appellants failed to turn up for their hearing. This involved a huge waste of resources by the ITS. It was important that the tribunal service was able to identify in advance those appellants whom it knew would not be attending so that it could arrange its work more efficiently. We are conducting an evaluation of those changes. Unfortunately, owing to the introduction of a new computer in the ITS, data are not yet available.
<P>
Amendment No. 157 would reverse that change. It appears on the surface to be appellant-friendly, but the effects would be counterproductive. Often, rather than taking the positive step to opt out, appellants would do nothing at all. Whether that was deliberate or the result of simple forgetfulness, the end result would be the same: the new appeals service would waste resources in setting up a tribunal for an oral hearing which the appellant was not going to attend. We believe that the amendment would be a backward step. We propose a radical revision of the way in which appeals are handled in order to streamline and speed up the appeals system. Opting out would be an unnecessary burden for the new appeals service.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon is reassured by my comments and comforted by the fact that we all have the same objective--an efficient tribunal service which gives speedy justice to those who wish to appeal. With those assurances, I hope that he and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) will feel able to withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful for that assurance, and pleased to hear that the Minister's Department is undertaking a review of the switch towards a wider use of paper hearings--that was my understanding of what he said. Given the problems with the Department's IT systems to which the Minister repeatedly refers, I suggest that it commissions the hon. Member for West Dorset to become involved.
<P>
I bridle, however, at the rhetoric according to which rights are combined with responsibilities, of which we hear so much. It is fair enough to expect people who claim benefits to be responsible and not to keep the system waiting, but the Minister will know that the system is bewildering, even to experts. I suspect that all hon. Members will have had people coming to their surgeries who do not know that they have a right to appeal. When we tell them that they had a leaflet sent to them along with the notification of the decision, they say that they do not know about such a leaflet.
<P>
It seems to me that simply saying to people, ``You have four weeks'' will not enable them to exercise their rights. The Minister has not reassured us, nor am I sure that he has justified the cut from three months to one month other than on budgetary grounds, which he did not mention but which I suspect underlies all this. Presumably, many of the people who take more than one month but less than three months delay making their claim not because they are sunning themselves on the Algarve but because their personal circumstances are difficult. There may well be a reason for the delay, but the Minister is going to make life even more difficult for those people. I am puzzled as to why he wants to do that.
<P>
The Minister has not fully addressed the issues of delay, nor has he met our concerns. However, I look forward to the results of the review of oral hearings, with the understanding that the Minister will make the findings public. Assuming that that is his intention, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain that where amendments are grouped, only the first amendment is formally moved, so there is no need for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. If he wished to press his amendment to a vote, it would have to be moved formally. Does the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs wish to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I say something first? In relation to the one month maximum period, I want to ask again whether the Government have focused on instances which do not fall under schedules 2 or 3 and for which it is not yet clear whether there is a right of appeal. If there is only a month in which to make an appeal and if, as I believe, there are many such instances, the Bill could cause a lot of trouble early on. I hope that the Minister can reassure me on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he wanted to know about matters that have neither a specific right of appeal nor are excluded from that right. Schedule 2(9) allows for certain matters to be added to the list of decisions against which no appeal is allowed. We intend to use it for certain administrative matters which are not currently appealable. We may, for example, use the provision where a pay day has not yet been allocated. I hope that with that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 7, leave out lines 42 and 43.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 63 and 64.
<P>
Amendment No. 142, in page 7, line 42, leave out from `tribunal' to end of line 43 and insert `shall consider only the issues that are raised by the appeal unless the Chairman deems consideration of other issues as relevant.'.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We have had discussions about Clause 13(7), but I am still unhappy about it, particularly as it is amended by Government amendments Nos. 63 and 64.
<P>
It appears that clause 13(7) allows an appeal tribunal not to consider matters that were true at the time of the appeal, but which were not raised at it, or that arose following the date of the appeal. It would be helpful if we made that distinction in our discussions because there are two issues involved. First, can and, indeed, should the tribunal consider matters other than those that the appellant has raised? Secondly, should the tribunal take account of circumstances that have arisen since the date of the initial appeal? In both cases, clause 13(7) as originally drafted and as amended by the Government amendments is problematic.
<P>
I shall deal first with the duty that we want placed on the appeal tribunal to consider matters other than those that were raised in original application. Put quite simply, people may appeal and feel with a sense of injustice that the decision was wrong. They may, however, not know chapter and verse why it was wrong or which are the relevant arguments to make or the relevant facts to include. If the tribunal chooses not to take account of those other considerations, which it is given leave to do under the original clause, justice will not be done.
<P>
It may be argued that the clause merely gives the tribunal leave not to consider such matters and that it does not require it not to do so. What is the point of the clause if it is ever the case that a tribunal does not consider other relevant information? A situation could arise in which one tribunal in one part of the country decides to take advantage of clause 13(7) and says that it will not consider other matters. Another tribunal in another part of the country might, however, look at the clause and decide that it will consider other factors. There could be injustice in treatment across the country. There should be a duty on tribunals, as case law seems to imply at present, to use their inquisitorial function to take into account other factors that are relevant to deciding whether someone was entitled on the dates when we applied. That is a matter of getting the right answer at this stage and it might reduce the scope for further appeals or appeals to commissioners.
<P>
Our second concern arises from the Government amendments, which would tell tribunals not only that they did not have to take into account other considerations that were true at the time, but that they would not have to--indeed, I think that the Government amendment says that they must not or may not--take into account circumstances that had arisen since the date of the appeal. That is a recipe for waste of time. In many of the briefings that members of the Committee will have received, instance after instance is given of appellants' circumstances changing from the date of the appeal. To take a simple case, an appellant has &#163;1 capital above the capital limit on the date when he appeals. By the time that the appeal comes around three or six months later, he has capital under the capital limit and is entitled to benefit. The Government's argument seems to be that such people should reapply for benefit while their appeal is waiting to be heard and that they should be making fresh claims on the basis that they are newly entitled. Common sense would suggest that that is a waste of the system's time. A tribunal that is considering a person's case should examine not only the date of the appeal, but what has happened since. That is why subsection (7) should be removed and why we would oppose the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The basic function of social security appeal tribunals is to reconsider decisions that have been appealed. As a result of numerous decisions of social security commissioners over the years, the function of the appeal tribunal has been expanded.
<P>
The proposals in the Bill provide the framework for a new, modern, more efficient system of social security administration. The Government want to focus resources more effectively on those issues that are important to the customer. As part of that approach, we want appeal tribunals to focus on the aspects of that decision that are in dispute. Clause 13(7) gives effect to that. It does not mean that the tribunal cannot look at any other issues. Rather, it gives the tribunal the discretion to do so in particular cases, if it thinks it should do so in order to reach a decision.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 42 will be to retain the current position. It will maintain the legal doubt about the function of the tribunal. Tribunals may, in the end, be forced to investigate the whole decision including those aspects positively not in dispute. That would increase the burden upon tribunals so that fewer appeals are cleared at each session; backlogs and delays could continue to increase and costs would rise.
<P>
We want to allow tribunals the discretion to decide the issues that matter in an appeal. The possibility that tribunals may become bogged down in hearing aspects of the decision not in dispute, runs completely contrary to our aim of improving the service to customers.
<P>
I shall turn now to amendment No. 142, to which the hon. Member for West Chelmsford has not yet spoken. I should like to explain to the Committee why we view it as unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I had thought that the Minister was replying initially to the hon. Member for Northavon on amendment No. 42. With your permission, Mr. Gale, I should like to address amendment No. 142.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We are in a slight difficulty here. That was an intervention. Would it be helpful if--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Flight rose rather late. If he would like to take his seat, he may be able to catch my eye if that would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. This is one of the most important issues being discussed today and it was much debated on Second Reading. It is clear that the clause and Government amendments are intended to speed up the process of tribunals, but it seems rather an Alice in Wonderland result. Appeal tribunals are being asked to consider a decision when they may know a lot more about what has happened before or since. If obliged, as Government amendment No. 64 would require, to limit the evidence on which decisions can be made to that at the time of the appeal, injustice could result.
<P>
The Minister will be aware that the Law Society has objected at some length to clause 13 (7) and to Government amendment No. 64. Strong objections have also been voiced by lawyers who practice in social security. They are concerned that the objective is to remove the longstanding legal duty on tribunals to declare claimants' entitlement to benefit from the date of the claim to the date of the appeal. It is not clear whether that will be the case. The Law Society is concerned that the clause and the amendments may be designed to put an end to the inquisitorial role of appeal tribunals.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 is a halfway house intended to make it clear that if a chairman deems it appropriate to consider other issues, he can do so. Claimants who do not know the law and have only a month to appeal will not submit subsequent daily, weekly or monthly claims, which they would be obliged to do if Government amendment No. 64 is agreed to and the Bill becomes law. Claimants will lose out if their complete situation is not considered. The net effect of Government amendment No. 64 and clause 13(7) is to give appeal courts far too narrow a scope. It is not realistic to believe that any fair-minded appeal tribunal would take a decision that they know to be morally wrong, as they will know the circumstances after the date of the appeal. We therefore think that the arrangement is likely to prove impractical in operation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that the customary way to catch the Chairman's eye in Committee--as in the House--is to rise when an hon. Member has finished speaking. The Chairman will always endeavour to call those with an interest in the amendments before calling to the Minister to respond, thereby facilitating debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for allowing the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to move his amendment; he clearly takes these matters extremely seriously.
<P>
In response to amendment No. 142, clause 13(7) provides that, in deciding on an appeal, a tribunal does not need to consider any issue that has not been raised by the appeal. As I explained, that gives the tribunal full discretion to consider other issues relating to the appeal decision if it wishes, but ensures that it is not obliged to do so. The effect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment would be to oblige the appeal tribunal to consider only those issues raised on appeal, subject to the discretion of the tribunal chairman. That would make the tribunal's discretion narrower than the provisions as drafted, which I am certain was not the hon. Gentleman's intention.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the tribunal will focus primarily on the issue in dispute. If it considers it appropriate for the proper resolution of the case to consider other issues, it can do so. It is important for the tribunal as a whole to make a judgment on whether issues are relevant to the appeal decision; the amendment would allow only the chairman that discretion. It would lessen the power of the wing members of the tribunal to influence proceedings, which could defeat the purpose of having members with special qualifications or expertise. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 63 and 64 ensure that appeal tribunals do not make decisions on the basis of changes in the appellant's circumstances that occur after the Secretary of State has made the initial decision. It is quicker and more cost-effective for the agency to deal with such changes, as customers can immediately notify the agency if their circumstances change while they are waiting for their appeal to be heard. A new claim for benefit can be made or an existing award changed, which is surely a more efficient way of dealing with such matters. The amendments will shorten the time taken to hear appeals and improve clearance time by focusing the tribunal on the issues in dispute.
<P>
 I have provided a briefing note to the Committee on the issue of down to date of hearing, which I hope all members have found useful. I commend the amendments to the Committee, and I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments after hearing my explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, makes some telling points about the failings of the Government amendments to this clause. We had reservations about the original clause 13(7); we now think that it is worse than we thought. It seems bizarre to have a tribunal in which three people consider a person's case in great detail--the wing members have flown back, as it were. They know that the person is entitled to benefit, but they are unable to award it because the person was not entitled to benefit at the date of the appeal, and although the person subsequently became entitled, he or she did not claim. Any right minded appellants would assume that the DSS was looking at their claim and would not think that because their circumstances had changed after 10 days, they needed to submit a new appeal.
<P>
Furthermore, backdating will be restricted through other parts of the Bill; that means that if a person realised only five or six weeks after his successful appeal that his circumstances had changed, even though the case was before an appeal tribunal, he would not be able to backdate his claim for more than a month. The effects of the amendments will be to deny natural justice to people whose entitlement to benefit is clear to the tribunal, but to whom benefit cannot be awarded.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have sought to emphasise the need to consider the experiences of appellants. They will believe that the DSS is considering their cases, and if the DSS knows that there is entitlement to benefit but does not award it, appellants will hardly see that as a fair system. Liberal Democrat Members have grave doubts about subsection (7) and we will press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for his written explanation of the reasons for the Government amendments. They are, however, not likely to be workable. How can a sitting appeal do justice to a set of facts at a particular moment when those facts have changed? The Minister will have seen the lengthy submissions from the Law Society and that representing social security lawyers. They raise fundamental issues that the hon. Member for Northavon has also echoed.
<P>
The Opposition do not accept that the explanation is adequate and we believe that the provisions will not work. We do not wish to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The amendments are the result of our reading words in schedule 2 that convey little, if anything, to the ordinary layman. The explanatory notes on clauses includes a description of paragraph 1 in schedule 2 that tells us that the limitation of appeal applies to cases that consider whether to give a direction to prevent severe hardship, or to issue a certificate as to good cause for failing to complete a course of training.
<P>
The limitation of appeal is an important point of constitutional principle and administrative practice, and will not affect merely the administration of social security. It is an extraordinary step to take under any circumstances when an individual's livelihood is at stake. It is even more extraordinary, however, to tell that individual that an appeal is not permitted, and to do so not as a matter of decision, or even of regulation governing special cases, but to include that in the Bill in order to prohibit a general class of case from coming to appeal.
<P>
The measure is especially extraordinary in the context of the Secretary of State's great powers of discretion and the ability to introduce further restrictions in regulations. A decision against which a person cannot appeal is close to being arbitrary as any permitted under English administrative law.
<P>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 2 is especially astonishing because the circumstances covered are those of severe hardship: a decision has been made not to give a lifeline to a person who believes himself to need such support. Schedule 2 (1) would deny the right of appeal to people who might be entitled--according to themselves or to, say, the citizens advice bureaux--to severe hardship allowance but who have been denied it.
<P>
The denial of an appeal under those circumstances is surely an abrogation intolerable even to Labour Members, as it must be to our friends on the Liberal Benches. The paragraph is also sufficiently unfeeling and politically imprudent to cause the Minister to think twice, and I hope that he will therefore adopt amendment No. 163.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 is clearly consequential to amendment No. 163. The Minister agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who identified the platonic limbo that exists between what can and what cannot be appealed. Therefore, to avoid that limbo, schedule 3 must include provision according to which decisions can be appealed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendments would have the effect of introducing new appeal rights for 16 and 17-year-olds claiming jobseekers allowance on grounds of severe hardship.
<P>
The Government believe that all 16 and 17-year-olds should be in employment, training or education. The last thing we want is young people becoming dependent on benefit at that very early age. But, in contrast to the Opposition, we are taking urgent action to enhance other opportunities and to replace youth training with national traineeships. We are retaining the guarantee of a training allowance or wage while training as financial support for this group of young people. It would send completely the wrong signals and undermine our plans if we were now to grant new rights that might lead 16 and 17-year-olds to believe that claiming benefit was the real alternative.
<P>
There are no proposals to change the existing arrangements for this group. Unemployed 16 and 17-year-olds facing severe hardship have access to jobseeker's allowance through the exercise of discretion by the Secretary of State. They do not have the same entitlement as adults and therefore do not have the same right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is difficult to reconcile the last part of the Minister's remarks with their beginning. Government policy appears to be that it is inappropriate for young people to have severe hardship grant under the jobseeker's allowance provisions, so it must follow that the Secretary of State should not have the discretion to offer such a grant. However, the second part of the Minister's remarks implied that the Secretary of State would retain that discretion. If the discretion is available, why should the right of appeal be removed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The right of appeal is not being removed. It was never there and we do not intend to change the existing arrangements. That would not be the right way to deal with the needs of 16 and 17-year-olds. The Government want to ensure that they have access to high quality education, training and employment. That goal was sadly neglected by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and for that clarification. I was remiss in saying that the right of appeal was to be removed: I should have asked why it was not being included.
<P>
I still do not understand the Minister's point, however. If the Secretary of State has the discretion to make a severe hardship grant available, there must be circumstances in which it is envisaged that such action would be appropriate. I have no doubt that the present Secretary of State is wise, all-seeing and all-knowing, but it is possible to envisage circumstances in which she would exercise her discretion in favour of an individual if she could be better advised about that person's case. Yet schedule 2(1) offers no right of appeal to an individual in such circumstances. None of the Minister's general remarks about the advisability or otherwise on policy grounds of the appeal being generally available can counteract the need to have some form of appeal to redress a grievance in a case where the discretion has been ill-used.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</b> Under current arrangements, highly trained staff deal with people who are claiming a job-seeker's allowance on the grounds of severe hardship. Staff spend a considerable time with applicants, and currently more than 80 per cent. of people who apply on severe hardship grounds receive the allowance. We have no evidence that people in such circumstances are being wrongly denied their right to the jobseeker's allowance.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Unfortunately, I have news for the Minister: he will shortly be in possession of such evidence, as I have a constituency case involving just such a problem. I am sure that other hon. Members have encountered similar cases. I do not doubt that the staff involved are highly trained, but the Minister has undone his general argument. He is, no doubt, correct that in more than 80 per cent. of the cases in which such discretion might be exercised it is applied, which suggests that the discretion is widely used in favour of the applicant. If that is so, it is a normal process and should be subject to the normal appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument. I will carefully consider his constituency case because such cases are instructive. I hope that if he has not already done so he will write to me soon so that I can investigate the precise circumstances. We will consider the case, and if other hon. Members have such information the Department should know about it. My current information is that it is not a problem. However, I shall look at the case.
<P>
The Government intend to ensure that people have access to employment, education and training. By accepting the amendment, we would be reaffirming that benefit is the right route for 16 and 17-year-olds to seek support. That is not the case, and I do not believe that my hon. Friends think that it is. We need to ensure that 16 and 17-year-olds have access to proper opportunities, and that is how we will handle our proposals for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister has been very patient in taking interventions and I do not wish to labour the point unduly, but his argument is entirely self-contradictory and unconvincing. The Opposition entirely understand the force behind the Government's argument that it should not be regarded as the natural course of things that young people are on benefit. That is common ground between all major political parties and right-thinking people throughout the kingdom. However, the point at issue is much narrower and I regret that by enlarging the scope of our discussions the Minister has lost that narrow point. It is a point about appeals--about an individual with a grievance and whether he should be deprived of the right to appeal. It is not about whether the policy in general should be responsible for administering benefits to young people as opposed to other, more constructive forms of assistance.
<P>
I regret that because of the way in which the matter has been approached the notion of a right and of an appeal, which are closely allied, has yet again been unfortunately disjoined from the notion of the exercise of authority through the discretion of the Secretary of State. This is another example of the discretion being increased by the Secretary of State without redressing the asymmetry that that creates--without, in other words, a corresponding right for the individual to appeal against the decisions to which that discretion gives rise. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 51, leave out lines 8 to 10.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 173, in schedule 3, page 52, line 36, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>[`Christmas bonus]<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (9A) A decision whether a person is entitled to a payment under section 148 of the Contributions and Benefits Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that my voice holds out, despite my current viral condition. Although I am tempted to bore the Minister and the Committee at length by repeating almost verbatim my comments in relation to paragraph 1 and amendment No. 163, I shall refrain. I should like to make an observation that I should have thought would echo strangely and effectively in the Minister's mind. If it does not, I recommend a brief absence from the Committee, if such a thing is permitted by the Chair, to enable him to consult the hon. Member who is at the other end of his pager about whether the Minister without Portfolio takes the view that the amendment should be dismissed in the same cavalier fashion as all the others. I do not, of course, refer to the elegant and kindly way in which the Minister has treated the Committee orally, but rather to the overwhelming voting power that is being used against our amendments.
<P>
Paragraph 2 relates to the Christmas bonus, which is very similar in popular esteem to the cold weather payment. The Minister may have become aware in recent days that the cold weather payment has occasioned a good deal of popular concern. These are delicate issues in the public mind, and rightly so. All hon. Members will have found that the Christmas bonus is of great concern to people on the doorstep--perhaps in some sense of unwarrantedly great concern. It is not the largest single item in the array of social security benefits, but it has a particular resonance for individuals. It has a resonance for them because Christmas--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Has my hon. Friend noticed the dramatic effect on matters such as cold weather payments that can occur when an hon. Member is translated into Government?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There was an interesting aside a moment ago on cold weather payments. It was an aside. It would be better if we now returned to the subject of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Perhaps as an aside I can say that I have noticed the remarkable effect of transition to Government on these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Goggins </B>(Wythenshawe and Sale, East): Let alone the transition to Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Some of us in the Opposition also took the view that there was something wrong with the cold weather payments, and continue to do so.
<P>
The Christmas bonus has a particular resonance among individuals in this country because of the nature of Christmas. It has an effect on the way in which individuals see themselves treated by the state. There has been an outbreak of levity in the Committee, but this is not a frivolous matter. One of the complaints that we have been making about successive clauses in the Bill, beginning, I fear with the clause relating to computers, is the tendency to depersonalise the system of social security, to leave the individual feeling that he is at the mercy of decisions made and unmade, of regulations made and remade, of wide discretion and limited appeal. It is setting up the relationship between the claimant and the state, which is that of pawn to manipulator.
<P>
This is not even how the Government intend that the system should develop. It is regrettable, therefore, that the right to appeal should be removed in a matter that will be of particular concern to people, and on which their attention will be focused.
<P>
The removal of the right of appeal with respect to the Christmas bonus--about which I hope my hon. Friends and I will make considerable public fuss--will draw attention to the asymmetry at work here. It will emphasise that wrong state of affairs in which an individual feels that as a claimant his or her deepest preoccupations are not admitted by the state.
<P>
The removal of the right of appeal cannot cause the giving of the Christmas bonus where it should not be given. To claim that would be to be over-pessimistic about the appeals procedure. All the appeals procedure does is allow the claimant to try to establish a right where one exists. Surely to goodness it would be reasonable of the Government to remove paragraph 2 from schedule 2 and return it to its proper place in schedule 3, as amendments Nos. 164 and 173 would provide. That is no more than the Government themselves will shortly ask the Committee to accept, in relation to paragraph 5. That paragraph perhaps has wider implications, but it is certainly not as poignant for ordinary individuals as paragraph 2.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> May I make it clear to the Committee that we are not removing the right of appeal as regards the Christmas bonus? That right never existed. It did not exist under the previous Government, and it is not being included now. We are not removing any such right, as the hon. Gentleman repeatedly said when moving the amendment. I hope that he will accept that the conditions that applied under the Conservative Government will remain under the present one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise. I did repeatedly fall into the mistake of speaking of removal of a right, rather than the fact that no right is to be given. I am delighted that the Minister takes the progressive view that two wrongs make a right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Now that we have clarified that we are not removing a right of appeal, perhaps it would be helpful to the Committee if I explained how entitlement to Christmas bonus payments is decided.
<P>
If a customer is entitled to a qualifying benefit in the relevant week--for example, a retirement pension or disability living allowance--he or she will automatically receive a Christmas bonus payment. The reason that the payment is called Christmas bonus is that it is given in recognition that Christmas is special. There should be no confusion on that point. If a customer is not entitled to a qualifying benefit, no Christmas bonus can be paid. I dread to mention it, but the majority of payments of such benefits are made automatically by computer, and the Christmas bonus is paid in the same way. Under the current system, there are no rights of appeal against those decisions.
<P>
There is little point in giving a right of appeal against decisions such as those affecting Christmas bonus payment, where the law is absolutely clear. We all know from our constituency caseloads that one of the things about the current system that frustrates our constituents is being given rights of appeal against decisions that are so clear cut that if they appeal to a tribunal it can do nothing. In the present instance we want to move away from that state of affairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is extremely helpful that the Minister has alluded to the automaticity of the payments--notwithstanding the fact that they are, alas, paid by computer. Could he clarify the matter one stage further, which might enable us to be more relaxed about the question? I know that he believes that computers are never mistaken, but in a case in which either the computer or the official responsible had made a mistake about whether an individual was receiving a qualifying benefit, and was thus due to receive a Christmas bonus, if there could be no appeal, by what mechanism would the problem be dealt with?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The mechanism is clear, and I hope that my explanation will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. The mechanism is that the customer takes the matter up with the Benefits Agency that administers the benefit, makes his case that he should have been entitled to a qualifying benefit at the time and, consequently, to the Christmas bonus, whereupon the matter can be rectified immediately by the Benefits Agency. This would mean that the customer probably would not receive a Christmas bonus but would be given a mid-summer bonus. We are trying to ensure that payment is made when it is required by the mechanism of making the change simple through the Benefits Agency. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that response in the spirit intended, and withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that further clarification. I had hoped to intervene before the Minister concluded his speech. I should be most grateful if he would answer this question. In, I hope, the exceptional case where there is alleged to be a mistake, and the relevant officers do not correct it immediately, is there, in the absence of appeal, some other more brief administrative method by which the decision can be challenged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I find that example difficult to respond to in that if there were a mistake of fact, the payment of benefit would deny that fact, and the situation would not need to arise because it would have been corrected. Benefit Agency procedures would be absolutely reinforced by these legislative proposals to ensure proper assessment of the facts. Changes can be made, and the arrangements being put in place to monitor them will be strengthened. The hon. Gentleman should welcome those arrangements in the Bill as a whole because they tackle the alleged problem to which he alluded.
<P>
I do not believe that there is a problem, but the measures being taken, and the streamlining of single-tier decision making at the earliest opportunity in the Benefits Agency, should afford the hon. Gentleman great comfort. I do not believe that there has been a problem; I have not been inundated with constituency claims to the effect that people are being denied their Christmas bonus. The new arrangement should make certain that that does not happen, but if any hon. Member is aware of cases we shall examine them carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, which does give considerable reassurance--but I am happy to take an intervention from the hon. Member for Northavon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I was thinking that the Minister was not a Minister the last time Christmas bonuses were paid. I assume that that is why he has not had a full case load.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. As I was not a Member of Parliament at that time, I too am not aware that this matter has caused problems in the past. I suggest that streamlining will almost certainly cause more problems. Having had considerable experience of streamlined administrations in many countries, invariably I have found that in their early years they have caused new problems. I warn the Minister that he will be the lucky recipient of many such complaints, whether about Christmas bonuses or otherwise.
<P>
Perhaps I may pursue this point one stage further, then, provided we are reassured, drop it. Can we be sure that in the event of an alleged mistake of fact, it will not be possible under any other part of the Bill for the Secretary of State or his officers to fall back on the assertion that a decision is final, and guaranteed by statute to be so, and hence that it does not need review through whatever administrative procedures are provided for review?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is true that I was not the Minister last Christmas--I do not yet know whether I shall be the Minister this Christmas. But if I am, it may be sensible for hon. Members to table a parliamentary question to discover whether I have had many problems with the Christmas bonus.
<P>
I will again reassure the hon. Gentleman that as the Christmas bonus relies on the qualifying benefit, there is a right of appeal against a person being disallowed a qualifying benefit. He will be able to appeal it, and the Christmas bonus would flow from the consequences of appeal. He will not be without an appeal right, but that right is not specific to the Christmas bonus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> With that reassurance, we can happily allow the amendment to fall. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
