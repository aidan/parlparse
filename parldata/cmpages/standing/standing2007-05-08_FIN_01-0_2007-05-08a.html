						</b> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
the first sitting of the 2007 Finance Bill. For the convenience and
comfort of Members, it may be interesting to note that, as long as I am
in the Chair, hon. Members may remove their jackets if they wish. I
cannot guarantee the same sartorial indulgence from Mr.
Illsley, although I dare say it is likely. That is for him to
decide.</div>
					<a name="07050848000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just before
we start there is one modest typographical error&#151;well not modest
for the hon. Member concerned&#151;that should be corrected. Hon.
Members may note that Helen Goodman appears on the list of Members
serving on the Committee. In fact, it should be Mr. Paul
Goodman&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Yes, well we have been through
all those jokes already.</div>
					<a name="07050848000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also remind hon. Members
that adequate notice must be given of amendments? As a general rule, I
and Mr Illsley will not call starred amendments, including any starred
amendments that may be reached during an afternoon&#146;s sitting of
the Committee. That said, I now call upon the Minister to move the
sittings motion.</div>

like to take the opportunity to say a few brief words. May I begin by
extending a warm welcome to you, Mr. Gale and to your
co-Chairman, Mr. Illsley? We welcome the experience and
knowledge of bothof you and we are confident that you will be
able to guide us through the Committee ensuring that our deliberations
are both thorough and to the point. We look forward to that. May I also
welcome Mr. Doig to his
role?</div>
					<a name="07050848000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a
number of years since I last served on the Committee. I am delighted to
be back. It is the first time for many years that the Paymaster General
is unable to be with us because of a short period in hospital. She is
now out of hospital and doing well. I am sure that the Committee will
want me to send her its good wishes.</div>
					<a name="07050848000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I extend a warm welcome to
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet who will lead for the Opposition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>and to the members of her team, the hon. Members for Rayleigh and for
Fareham and those who will be supporting them, particularly those who
are servingon this Committee for the first time, including
thehon. Member for Wycombe. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;And for Bishop Auckland.&#148;] It did
occur to me to wonder why the numbers of our side of the Committee
looked quite as large as they did on the initial list, but that has now
been explained. I welcome the hon. Member for Wycombe to the Committee.
May I also welcome the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and her
Liberal Democrat colleagues and the hon. Member for Dundee,
East?</div>
					<a name="07050848000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am joined
today and will be supported throughout these debates
by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and by the Economic
Secretary to the Treasury. I am delighted to see them here. I know that
they will want to join me in welcoming my hon. Friends to this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07050848000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could I
just put on record my thanks to the many advisers and representative
bodies that have advisedus in significant ways on the Bill? We
shall welcome further contributions from them as we scrutinise the Bill
in greater depth over the coming weeks. I look forward very much to our
debates as we fulfil together our duty in examining this Bill in
Committee.</div>

						<a name="07050848000336"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I am delighted
to be able to respond on behalf of my hon. Friends to the Chief
Secretary&#146;s introduction, made in his characteristic bipartisan
and friendly manner that we very much welcome. It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale and under your
co-Chairman, Mr. Illsley.</div>
					<a name="07050848000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to offer some brief
opening remarks on behalf of my Front-Bench team, my hon. Friends the
Members for Rayleigh, for Wycombe, for Fareham and for Bexleyheath and
Crayford. It is always a pleasure to serve alongside my colleagues on
the gruelling task that awaits us all over the new few weeks. I know
that my hon. Friends will be applying their usual forensic scrutiny to
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050848000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
also welcome my Back-Bench team: my hon. Friends the Members for
Braintree, for Ludlow, for South-West Hertfordshire, for Rochford and
Southend, East and for Windsor. I am particularly impressed that my
hon. Friends the Members for Braintree, for Ludlow
and for South-West Hertfordshire have volunteered for their second
Finance Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000338"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> And third in the case of my hon. Friend the
Member for Braintree. Such selfless dedication to the proper scrutiny
of the nation&#146;s tax law will not go unnoticed in high places, I
am sure. The hard work of my hon. Friends is much appreciated. I, too,
should like to welcome the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne and
for Member for Dundee, East. I am sure that their contributions will be
very useful.</div>
					<a name="07050848000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
pleased to see the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary, and the
Economic Secretary in their places, and I look forward to debating the
Bill with all of them. We are sorry that the Paymaster General is not
able to take part in the Committee this year, but we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>wish her all the best in her recovery. There are many issues over which
the Paymaster General and I disagree. However, after a decade of
Finance Bills, I think that she deserves a year off. Anyone can deserve
a year off for good behaviour. She has obviously worked extremely hard
on many Finance Bills for many years. No doubt, the Chief Secretary
will be an admirable stand-in for her.</div>
					<a name="07050848000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also look forward to
debating with Government Back Benchers. No Committee on the Finance
Bill would be complete without the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West. After his contribution during the Committee of the whole
House, I look forward to many amendments from him to change all
references to the word &#147;premiums&#148; in the Bill to the more
correct &#147;premia&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050848000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the Chief Secretary, I
look forward to relying on briefing and technical advice from a number
of outside advisers&#151;in particular, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, the Law Society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants for
England and Wales, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG. My hon. Friends and
I look forward to a wide-ranging debate over the next few weeks in
which we will seek to remedy any defects in the Bill and promote
much-needed reform of the tax system to tackle complexity and to move
towards fairer, more rational and simpler
taxes.</div>

						<a name="07050848000339"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): It is a great
privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I
should also like to welcome all membersof the Committee and
say how much I am looking forward to debating with them in the coming
weeks. Like the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, I am sure that we are
all disappointed&#151;not least the Paymaster General
herself&#151;that the Paymaster General is not serving on an 11th and
perhaps record-breaking Finance Bill. I am sure that she can look
forward to coming back next year.</div>
					<a name="07050848000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also like to put on
record my thanks to other organisations that have provided briefings
and technical advice. I should like to dwell for a few moments on the
procedure that we are about to go through in terms of debating the
sittings. On Second Reading, I raised the issue of receiving evidence
at the Committee sittings, as other Public Bill Committees have done
since 1 January this year. The Statistics and Registration Service
Bill, which I sat on earlier this year, was the first to undergo such a
process. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West pointed out that
no organisations had come forward to give evidence to that Bill and
that made me wonder whether any outside organisations would be
interested in participating in such a process here.</div>
					<a name="07050848000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new Public Bill Committee
process was recommended by the Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons in its first report sitting of 2005-06 entitled
&#147;The Legislative Process&#148;. In a summary, it
concluded:</div>
					<a name="07050848000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
a matter of routine, Government bills should be referred to committees
which have the power to take evidence as well as to debate and amend a
bill, and these committees should be named public bill
committees.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
we are still operating under the old system and we do not have that
opportunity.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>
					<a name="07050848000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I took the
liberty of contacting some organisations to see whether they would be
willing to participate. Many of those organisations contributed to the
evidence sessions of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House
of Commons. I want to quote a few of the comments. Given the short time
scale, a not insignificant number of organisations were keen to support
the suggestion: the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group; the Institute of
Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce; the Society of Trust and
Estate Practitioners; the Association of Taxation Technicians and the
Chartered Institute of Taxation.</div>

Chairman:
						</b> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Lady so
early in our proceedings, but I fear that she is now out of order.
However, the Chief Secretary will have heard what she said and if he
chooses to make representations in the appropriate quarter and to the
Leader of the House, it is open to him to do so. There is no timetable
motion on the Bill, so there is no opportunity for the kind of evidence
to which she referred to be taken and no opportunity for the list of
possible contributors to be
heard.</div>

							<a name="07050848000342"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> We are determined to maintain the best possible
environment for business in the UK. With unprecedented economic
stability in the past decade, businesses have been able to plan and
invest more effectively for the long term, which has brought a lot of
benefit, as today&#146;s high rates of employment underline.
</div>
					<a name="07050848000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies have also
benefited from a highly competitive tax regime. Since 1997, the UK has
led the way among its closest competitors in reducing corporate tax
rates from 33 per cent. in 1997. The main rate fell to 31 per cent. in
1998, and to 30 per cent. in 1999. Those reductions have ensured that
the corporation tax rate in the UK has been the lowest in the G7
throughout the last 10 years.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>
					<a name="07050848000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The combination of stability and
a competitive tax environment has proved an immensely fruitful one for
UK businesses. Members of the Committee may last week have seen press
coverage of the latest research from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research on productivity in the UK, commenting on the recent
acceleration in UK productivity growth. The paper by Mary
O&#146;Mahoney in last month&#146;s National Institute Economic
Review shows that</div>
					<a name="07050848000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the UK
has managed to close the productivity gap significantly with the US,
France and Germany&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07050848000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
contrast with</div>
					<a name="07050848000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;poor
performance in terms of productivity growth in the early
1990s&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050848000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That improvement
is a huge prize for the UK economy and reflects steadfast determination
on the part of the Government to tackle the productivity gap, but other
countries are changing, too. There are now new patterns of business
activity and fresh challenges arising from globalisation, and the
clause takes the next step to enhance the competitiveness of our
business environment in the UK.</div>
					<a name="07050848000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause cuts the headline
rate of corporation tax again, enabling it to be charged for the
financial year 2008-09 and cuts the main rate for that year
from30 per cent. to 28 per cent. on non-North sea ring-fenced
profits, leaving the rate for profits within the North sea ring fence
unchanged. That will have a number of positive effects, which the
Committee will readily acknowledge. It will boost the competitiveness
of UK firms and encourage greater domestic investment on their part, it
will make the UK an even more attractive location for foreign direct
investment, and build on the success that we had last year, when we
attracted more foreign direct investment than any other
country.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07050848000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cut is
accompanied by a series of reforms to wider business taxation, which
will feature in later debates in the Committee. As a package, they
represent the biggest set of reforms of the business tax system since
the 1980s. The package modernises a rather outdated system of
investment allowances for plant, machinery and buildings, and gives
further support to innovative businesses by developing the R and D tax
credit. With the cut in the main rate of corporationtax as its
centrepiece, the package is pro-investment, pro-innovation and
therefore pro-growth for the UK
economy.</div>
					<a name="07050848000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
identifies the main corporation tax rate for onshore activities
separately from North sea ring-fenced activities. The North sea clearly
is unique for both industry and Government; for a long time, it has had
a separate tax regime, which is an arrangement that is common around
the world. Our regime seeksto strike a balance between
encouraging investmentand ensuring a fair return for the UK on
itsnatural resources. In maintaining that balance, the
Government have chosen to exempt the North sea from the main business
tax changes in this year&#146;s Budget, leaving the rates and the
capital allowances regime unchanged.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>
					<a name="07050848000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">North sea companies will
continue to benefit from the special 100 per cent. capital allowances,
which have encouraged recent high levels of investment. Some have
argued on behalf of North sea businesses that they also should have
benefited from the rate cut, but othershave wisely
acknowledged that that would have been unrealistic given the current
level of the oil price. Stability is also an important virtue in the
industry, particularly with regard to capital allowances. The Bill does
not include a system of capital allowances for companies within the
North sea ring fence, as it does for other
companies.</div>
					<a name="07050848000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will welcome the cut in corporation tax and the
accompanying package of reforms of business taxation. We want to
maintain the best possible environment for businesses in the UK. At 28
per cent., the headline corporation tax rate will be lower than that of
the US, Germany, France, Japan and all our other G7 competitors. The UK
rate will be firmly established as the lowest of the major economies
and will be below the average of the EU 15. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050848000343"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you to the
chairmanship of the Committee, Mr. Gale. I look forward to
serving under you during our scrutiny of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050848000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is perhaps appropriate to
start our consideration of the Bill on a rare note of consensus. We
supportthe move that the Government announced in the Budget in
March to reduce to 28p the mainstream rate of corporation tax. It was
not as ambitious as the proposal that was set out by my hon. Friend the
shadow Chancellor to cut the rate by 3 per cent., but we congratulate
the Government for making the change. It responds to the concerns that
businesses had highlighted that the mainstream rate had become
uncompetitive when compared with the rate in other major industrial
countries.</div>
					<a name="07050848000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior to
the Budget, the UK&#146;s corporation tax rate was about 1.4 per
cent. above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
average, having been 3.6 per cent. below it in 2000, so there had been
a gradual deterioration in our rate in comparison with other major
industrialised countries. In 2005, only 12 OECD countries had headline
rates above that of the UK, compared with 20 in 2000. The Chief
Secretary pointed out the cuts that had been made to the corporation
tax rate prior to 2000, but no cuts were made subsequent to that date.
Between 2000 and 2005, however, 25 of the 30 OECD countries cut their
corporation tax rates, so we were lagging behind our industrial
competitors in that respect.</div>
					<a name="07050848000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth reflecting for a
moment on the impact that that had on the UK economy. A number of
businesses chose to relocate their headquarters overseas. The Economic
Secretary will know as well as I do the cases of Hiscox, Omega and
Catlin in the insurance sector; they relocated from the UK to Bermuda
for tax and regulatory reasons. When businesses undertook corporate
transactions, it was interesting to see where they chose their domicile
for tax purposes. So, when Experian de-merged from GUS, it decided to
relocate its headquarters to Dublin, although it remained a UK-listed
company.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>
					<a name="07050848000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Articles in <i class="I">The Sunday
Telegraph</i> have suggestedthat Colt Telecommunications,
which moved to Luxembourg in the first half of last year, chose to do
so for tax-related reasons. Also, according to an article in <i class="I">The
Times</i>, in the summer of last year, 40 major companies were said to
be considering a move because of the uncompetitiveness of the UK tax
regime. Indeed, the Government&#146;s skills envoy, when he was
director general of the CBI,
said:</div>
					<a name="07050848000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A lot of
our biggest businesses are now looking at whether they want to be
domiciled here, because of the tax
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">KPMG, in a
submission to the independent Tax Reform Commission,
said:</div>
					<a name="07050848000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not uncommon for groups to move unskilled and back-office activities
overseas, but we are aware that some organisations are also actively
considering moving white-collar jobs, and even the group holding
location, for reasons which include tax
considerations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are complex reasons why companies seek to relocate overseas, but there
tends to be a trend towards a low-tax jurisdiction. I am sure that
Ministers have had the same discussions that my hon. Friends and I have
had with major UK corporates and their advisers about the impact that
high tax rates have on the choice of jurisdiction and on
competitiveness.</div>
					<a name="07050848000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also have some quantitative analysis; it is not just anecdotal evidence
that underpins the sense that the Government have allowed the tax
competitiveness of the UK economy to deteriorate. In a recent
survey,60 per cent. of businesses said that the UK tax system
was having a negative impact on the UK&#146;s international
competitiveness, and only 10 per cent. of the businesses surveyed
disagreed with that statement. So there is a consensus within business
that the Government have allowed the tax system to get out of kilter
with our
competitors.</div>
					<a name="07050848000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, when a company chooses to relocate overseas, it is not just the
corporation tax revenue that we lose, but other business taxes, such as
VAT, employers&#146; national insurance contributions and rates on
property that they occupy. Indeed, a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers
estimated that, in 2004-05, FTSE 100 companies contributed &#163;9.1
billion of corporation tax revenues and another &#163;9.1 billion in
other business taxes. So there is an important knock-on effect; where
businesses locate in the UK, not only do they pay additional
corporation tax, but they pay a significant amount in other corporate
taxes, to the benefit of the Exchequer and the public services that are
funded by these taxes. Of course, that analysis by PWC does not take
into account PAYE, employees&#146; national insurance contributions
and other such taxes.</div>
					<a name="07050848000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">This process is not just about
companies leaving the UK because of uncompetitive mainstream
corporation tax rates; it is also about inward investment going
elsewhere. Google, Microsoft and Intel, among others, have chosen to
set up significant operations in Dublin in Ireland as a consequence of
the low tax rate
there.</div>
					<a name="07050848000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Dutch
Government are also mindful of the way in which lower corporation tax
rates can act as a magnet to businesses, such that businesses will
choose to go the Netherlands rather than locate to a high-tax economy.
So they reduced their headline rate of corporation tax to 25.5 per
cent. this year, to makethe Netherlands more attractive to
international businesses. Part of the challenge that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>have responded to here is that, because other countries were reducing
their corporation tax rate, it was making the UK unattractive to those
businesses when they made decisions about where to locate. Perhaps the
lower rate of corporation tax in the Netherlands is one reason why
Barclays might move its headquarters to the Netherlands if its bid for
ABN Amro is
successful.</div>
					<a name="07050848000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
sense, therefore, what I am trying to set out is that the rate of
mainstream corporation tax has an impact on business decisions more
widely and we cannot look at those decisions in isolation. As a former
Internal Revenue Service commissioner in the United States
said:</div>
					<a name="07050848000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
cannot, absolutely cannot, hope to compete in a global economy by
setting corporation taxes in
isolation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important factor to bear in mind, and it is why we support the move by
the Government to reduce the mainstream rate of corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="07050848000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept,
however, that maintaining tax competitiveness is not simply about
reducing the rate of corporation tax; it is about the complexity and
stability of the tax code, too. By the time the Bill concludes its
legislative process, the UK will have a longer tax code than India.
Indeed, we shall have the longest tax code in the world, and that
complexity will bring its own costs. I am sure that my hon. Friend the
shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury will be able to use that fact
again later in our considerations, although I do not want to come to
that yet. There are strong arguments for supporting the Government in
their aim of reducing mainstream corporation tax. When the Government
do the right thing, we are prepared to support them. That is the
principle of an Opposition who take their duties
seriously.</div>
					<a name="07050848000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chief
Secretary touched upon the other consequential changes to tax and
capital allowances, which are being used to fund the reduction in the
mainstream rate of corporation tax. We have some concerns about how the
Government have sought to fund that reduction, so we shall explore
those issues at some length when we reach the appropriate
clause.</div>
					<a name="07050848000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
grateful that the Chancellor sought to respond so positively and
enthusiastically to the representations that my hon. Friend the Member
for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), the shadow Chancellor, made just
before the Budget and to the compelling case for simpler, lower
corporation tax that was set out in a report by the independent Tax
Reform Commission chaired by our noble Friend Lord Forsyth. It is good
that the Government listened to and understood those arguments, and put
them into practice, because they are to the benefit of all large
businesses in the UK paying on profits of more than &#163;1.5
million. That is why we support the Government in clause
2.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050848000344"></a>
							<b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I rise to speak to clause 2
largely from a business and economic perspective. The clause is
certainly to be welcomed. In a competitive tax environment&#151;to a
certain degree, a global market in corporation tax, as it
were&#151;the United Kingdom needs to look at its corporation tax
rates, particularly those for larger businesses, whose relocation would
perhaps disproportionately affect their employees. I also welcome the
recognition by the Government, and by the Chancellor in particular,
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>tax competition does exist, that there is a market and that we are part
of that market, whether we like it or not.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000345"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend share my concern that it is
those very businesses, such as Google, which are growing fastest and
creating jobs, that are seeking to flee this country and set up in the
Republic of Ireland and elsewhere, notwithstanding the moves by the
Government and the Chancellor in the Budget? Ultimately, that will cost
jobs in this country, particularly in the high-tech
sector.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000346"></a>Adam
Afriyie:
						</b> I do not disagree with my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments. It is not only Google that has been affected&#151;we have
heard about Hiscox and many other organisations. It is particularly
those cutting-edge organisations in high technology or information
services&#151;organisations that can relocate almost at the drop of a
hat&#151;that would have been threatened if something had not been
done to the corporationtax rate.</div>
					<a name="07050848000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I particularly welcome is
that someone whom one might argue is a socialist Chancellor has clearly
and unambiguously embraced the concept of markets. I have several
concerns, however. There is no doubt that business is the engine of the
economy. It generates all the jobs, all the taxes, all the income and
all the livelihoods for everyone in Britain, and that includes
Government employees and the voluntary sector. Without small and
medium-sized enterprises and large businesses, there would be no jobs,
no salaries and no incomes at all to support any of the good things
that we want in society. I therefore welcome the reduction, but it
raises many questions.</div>
					<a name="07050848000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, why is the reduction
being introduced in the tax year 2008? We can see from clause 3 and
many other clauses of the Bill&#151;without straying into them
now&#151;that many of the other tax increases have been introduced in
2007, with immediate effect. So the question has to be answered: why
2008? Why are we waiting for a year to introduce the reduction in
corporation
tax?</div>
				
					
					<a name="07050848000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second
question also needs to be answered. Clearly, by reducing corporation
tax overall, we are reducing the Treasury&#146;s tax take in the
short and medium term. On the other hand, again without straying into
clause 3, small business taxation is being increased. The question is:
how does the Treasury estimate that the tax reduction&#151;what is
recovered in corporation tax&#151;will compare with the tax increase
on small and medium-sized enterprises? I have said that business is the
engine of the economy. I would argue that the faster revving
engine&#151;the faster growingarea of the economy&#151;is
small and medium-sized businesses, so why has the Chancellor chosen to
increase taxation on small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby
dampening that engine, and reduce taxation on corporate enterprises? It
is important that we have an answer to that, given that small and
medium-sized enterprises have been encouraged to change mode over the
past several years.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>
					<a name="07050848000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Another
concern arises because, having scanned through the publications and
documentation behind the Bill, I have not yet managed to spot a figure
for the number of organisations that will be affected by the
corporation tax change. Again, I should be much obliged if the Chief
Secretary would make it clearhow many businesses&#151;and,
therefore, how many employees&#151;will be affected by the changes.
If the Treasury has embraced the notion that there is tax competition,
why 28 per cent.? Why not 27 or 26 per cent.? Again, perhaps the right
hon. Gentleman will explain the reasoning behind the choice of 28 per
cent. rather than another figure.

							<a name="07050848000347"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s indulgence
in giving way. I heard the Economic Secretary muttering under his
breath from a sedentary position, &#147;How are we going to pay for
it?&#148; If he understands the Laffer curve and looks at the example
of the Republic of Ireland, he will see that tax competition and the
lowering of corporation tax have increased the revenues that the
Exchequer has managed to collect in
Ireland.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000348"></a>Adam
Afriyie:
						</b> The Laffer curve is a fascinating curve; it is
not to be laughed at. However, there is a slight problem with it in
that there is a delay between the reduction in a tax rate and the
eventual increase in the tax take. Therefore, there is an issue about
the timing of the introduction of tax reductions. Certainly there is
little controversy about the fact that the Laffer curve brings about a
more vibrant economy and a better environment for business in the long
term. It increases the tax take in the longer term because there is
more enterprise, and more profit is generated in the economy.</div>
					<a name="07050848000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a background question
that is conceptual rather than ideological. What sort of tax system is
the Bill trying to create? We originally had the classic systemcompany
profits were taxed and dividends were not. Now it seems that we are
halfway between an imputational tax system and the classic system. Can
the Chief Secretary explain towards which tax system clause 2 is taking
us? Are we looking for an amalgam&#151;a fudge in the
middle&#151;heading back towards the classic system, or just
dilly-dallying before moving back to the imputational system? What is
the general direction of the change? Perhaps he could explain on which
model this particular corporation tax reduction is based.</div>
					<a name="07050848000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no doubt that all
parties welcome the reduction in corporation tax on large businesses.
We can argue about the levels and the timing, but there is no question
that the reduction is to be welcomed. Personally, I welcome it because
it demonstrates a shift in the mentality of the Government and shows
that they recognise that markets, international markets and
competition, particularly in relation to taxation, are important.
Government should not try to control the levels of profit as it is for
the Government to remove the obstacles to wealth creation and to ensure
that Britain is a vibrant place with which to trade and do business. On
balance, the changes are welcome, but I would like a few answers to the
key questions: how many businesses are affected; what level of revenue
change is expected; and what direction are we taking in clause
2?</div>

in the proceedings on this year&#146;s Finance Bill. The Liberal

rate of corporation tax from 30 to 28 per cent. starting at the
beginning of the next financial year.</div>
					<a name="07050848000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two questions to which I
hope the Minister will respond. First, why will ring-fenced profits
forthe first time be separated off from other
profitsand charged at a different rate of corporation tax?
Secondly, will he confirm whether, because of the other changes to
capital allowances, the tax changes in the clause will move the tax
burden around rather than cut it overall? Has he assessed who the
winners and losers of the tax changes will be in terms of types and
sizes of company? There has not been an overall net reduction in the
tax burden for many businesses because the headline cut will be offset
by changes to the capital allowance system
elsewhere.</div>

clause relates to.</div>
					<a name="07050848000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
paying attention to the detail of the Bill, I picked up the explanatory
notes as soon as I heard the Chancellor&#146;s speech because I was
interested to hear that he was cutting the corporation tax rate, which
is always a good thing. In the summary, the explanatory notes
state:</div>

					<a name="07050848000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">which I thought
was fair enough; the Chancellor was putting things off for a year to
give people time to sort things out. However, on clause 3, which
relates to small companies, the explanatory notes
state:</div>

					<a name="07050848000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wondered why the Chancellor was so keen to halt the reduction in tax
rates by one year for big companies, but was in a rush to increase it
for small companies. I then looked at the Red Book and onpage
281, table C8, it states that the estimated receiptsare due to
go up by &#163;5 billion, from &#163;44.9 billion
to&#163;50 billion. Is the real reason for the delay in
reducing the main rate to avoid forgoing the increase
of&#163;5 billion from &#163;44.9 billion to &#163;50
billion? My first question concerns timing. Why was there a difference
in timing? Was it to do with the extra &#163;5 billion that the
Government are seeking to grab from companies?</div>
					<a name="07050848000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second question has to do
more with the point that I raised with my hon. Friend the Member for
Windsor. What are the projections for 2008? We did not see much about
that. Has the Treasury has conducted a study of the Laffer curve effect
of the dropping rate of taxation and the anticipated receipts that will
result? Is there a sensitivity analysis? The Economic Secretary, who
has similar economic training to me, has no doubt spent many hours
burning the midnight oil and carrying out a sensitivity analysis, as I
would in his position.</div>
					<a name="07050848000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a great believer in and
proponent of the Laffer curve, I suggest that the Economic Secretary
considers the real-life example of the Republic of Ireland. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>more that that country reduces the tax rate for companies, the more tax
revenues it collects. That is an interesting conundrum, which the left
traditionallyhas a hard time grasping. However, the Economic
Secretary is an intelligent man and he looks for evidence-based
examples. If he has considered Ireland, it would be interesting to know
what sensitivity analysis he has done. As my hon. Friend asked: why did
the Government chose the 28 per cent. rate? If they dropped it to 26
per cent., would they collect more tax
revenues?</div>

complexity of our tax system, which seems to be getting more and more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>intricate? There is a study called the &#147;Burdens Barometer&#148;
which I watch avidly as the complexity and cost seem to increase year

							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): There are strong arguments for
cutting corporation tax. I am delighted to hear the Chief Secretary
pitch this cut as an attempt to increase economic growth. That is
something that we tend to call for in Scotland. In the25 years
since 1980, we have seen a 1.8 per cent. growth in Scotland as opposed
to 2.3 per cent. in the UK as a whole and an average increase of 1.3
per cent. in a small European country. Our worst position in the past
10 years was a large gap of 2 per cent. in Scotland, around 2.8 cent.
in the UK and approaching an average of 4 per cent. for the small
European country. The cut in corporation tax is an essential driver of
economic growth. It provides one of the bases of business and national
competitiveness.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000356"></a>Adam
Afriyie:
						</b> The Chief Secretary said that this cut would be
pro-investment, pro-innovation and pro-growth for large businesses.
Does the hon. Gentleman have any idea why that same principle does not
apply to small and medium-sized businesses, which it appears is where
the money is coming
from?</div>

							<a name="07050848000357"></a>Stewart

						</b> I have no idea what goes through the minds of
Treasury Ministers, but I think I agree in principle that small
businesses provide the essential driver of local economies. All it
takes is one verysmall business to become a Microsoft and the
whole economy benefits. The hon. Gentleman is right in principle, but
it is up to the Treasury team to tell us how they have reached their
conclusions.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000358"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. Is
it not ironic that while the Government are reducing tax rates for big
businesses, they are trying to increase it for small businesses and
therefore reducing the incentives for those very businesses that should
be the drivers of our
economy?</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000359"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I think it is more paradoxical than ironic. It is
also the wrong thing to do, particularly when there are other pressures
on small businesses, not least the pressure of local business rates,
which in many local economies remain a massive burden, taking a far
larger share of turnover and profit than they should, certainly
compared with large stores or large businesses in and around
cities.</div>
					<a name="07050848000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
welcoming the tax cuts, the Chief Secretary said that this was part of
the biggest ever set of reforms in tax and allowances. He is absolutely
correct. My worry is that however welcome this modest cut is&#151;it
could be more ambitious&#151;the &#163;3.7 billion that will be
taken in 2008-09 and 2009-10 from the change to plant and machinery
capital allowances alone outweighs the &#163;3.6 billion that will be
given back to businesses in the reduction in corporation tax
yields.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>
					<a name="07050848000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the fact that the
Government have recognised at last that tax competition is important. I
am concerned that the overall package, which sees more yield coming in
from one change to allowances than is given back in the tax cut, may
not deliver its objectives, and as part of the overall change
intax and allowance reform, particularly for small
businesses&#151;we have heard concerns about that&#151;I may allow
us not to see the competitiveness and the increase in economic growth
that I am sure the Chief Secretary wants; we certainly want it for
Scotland.</div>
					<a name="07050848000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
performance of the cut will be measured carefully over the next year or
two, but I suspect that if we are going to be serious about using the
taxation system, particularly the corporation tax system, to drive
business competitiveness, to stop companies leaving the UK and to make
them competitive without putting downward pressure on wages, the
Government will have to be far more ambitious in the changes that they
make to the
tax.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): May I say
what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Gale? May I also apologise to the Chief Secretary for missing his
opening remarks because I was otherwise engaged?</div>
					<a name="07050848000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is undoubtedly a
consensus in the Committee that in 1997 the UK was in a very strong
positionin respect of business tax rates. Over the
following10 years, that competitive advantage has been eroded,
not because business tax rates have gone up, but because many of our
competitors in the rest of the world have cut business tax rates
substantially. Our corporation tax rates are by no means exceptionally
low; indeed, they are higher than many
others.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000361"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> My hon. Friend refers to the fact that overall
corporation tax rates have not gone up. He will be aware that other
types of taxation on business have increased
significantly.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000362"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, which I was
about to raise. Corporation tax ratesare only one of the range
of taxes that businessesface. Some research suggests that
corporation tax constitutes at most 50 per cent. of the taxes that
businesses pay.</div>
					<a name="07050848000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
logic of the change announced in the Budget and implemented in the
Finance Bill is to reduce the rate, but it does not reduce the burden.
That is not a criticism, because there is something to be said for
reducing the headline rate regardless of reducing the burden. Will the
Chief Secretary confirm that an objective of Government policy is to
reduce the rate itself, almost regardless of the burden, and that it is
worth while achieving that in any event? Does he agree that a reduction
in the burden is also important, and that that has not been achieved in
this announcement? </div>
					<a name="07050848000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think we all acknowledge that businesses are mobile. The chance of
businesses moving to a country, or a jurisdiction, that has a lower
rate of taxation has increased in the past 10 years as the world has
become more global, as shown in the good examples given by my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham. First, does the Chief Secretary accept
that that argument might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>apply to other types of taxation. I am thinking in particular of
research published recently by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing
that income tax can also be competitive and can cause businesses and
people to move from one jurisdiction to another. Secondly, if he
accepts that argument for corporation tax&#151;that mobility exists
in a globalised world&#151;would it also apply to other taxes, such
as income
tax?</div>
					<a name="07050848000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the
proposal appears to simplify corporation tax. Do the Government
recognise that simplification of the tax system itself is a worthwhile
objective? Fourthly, if they do recognise that that is a good thing,
how does the Chief Secretary assess the Government&#146;s success or
otherwise in making the tax system simpler?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000363"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> There has been an interesting exchange on the
clause. The hon. Member for Fareham started very well by congratulating
the Government. I hope we will hear more of that as the Committee goes
through its work. However, his contribution deteriorated after that,
when he gave us an unduly gloomy account of what has happened in the
British economy of late.</div>
					<a name="07050848000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind him of what I said in
my opening remarks: there was more foreign direct investment into the
UK last year than to any other country on the planet, which reflects
the point that companies can more readily choose to locate almost
anywhere in the world. The UK continues to be a very big gainer from
that development. We must ensure that that continues, and it is
important that we maintain a competitive tax regime. As I said, we have
had the lowest headline rate of corporation tax in the G7 throughout
the past decade. The change ensures that that position is maintained,
but we must be competitive in other respects,
too.</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050848000364"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Will the Chief Secretary
clarify what proportion of the statistic that he just quoted on the
record level of inward investment was accounted for by a single
transaction in the reorganisation of Shell?</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000365"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Quite a substantial proportion, so it is
instructive to look at the figures when the transaction is removed. I
do not think that it should be, but if it is, the UK is second in the
world, with &#163;91 billion of inward investment. The US is in first
place with &#163;99 billion. The UK&#146;s achievement on foreign
direct investmentlast year was pretty extraordinary,
reflecting thestrong competitiveness of its tax system and
every other aspect of its business environment.</div>
					<a name="07050848000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Fareham
made some remarks about complexity in the UK, of which we will no doubt
hear more. I remind him that the tax law rewrite project is
successfully simplifying tax legislation with all-party support.
However, implementing the changes that arise from it will require
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07050848000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne and one or two others asked me what we
thought would be the package&#146;s economic impact. We have modelled
its impact on the marginal cost of capital and on effective tax rates
for a variety of investments. As I have said, the indication is that
the package will increase the trend rate of investment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>
					<a name="07050848000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire asked whether I agreed that having a low headline rate of
corporation was a good thing in itself. The evidence suggests that the
answer is yes. A lower corporation tax headline rate attracts foreign
direct investment, which is one reason why the provisions are
important. One would need to look at separate evidence for other
headline rates, but there is no doubt in my mind andin the
Government&#146;s mind that tax competition is a
reality.</div>

undertake to assess the impact of reducing the headline rate on inward
and other forms of investment?</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000367"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman well knows, we have a
well-developed model that is accessible to others. We have carefully
modelled the impact of the proposed change on that basis and, to pick
up another point that was made from the Opposition Benches, our
modelling shows clearly that although the Bill will not change the
overall burden of taxation&#151;the amount taken from large
companies&#151;over the next few years, the overall impact will be an
increase in the trend rate of investment.</div>
					<a name="07050848000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne asked about the differential arrangement that we are
introducing for the North sea, and it is not currently possible to make
even a partly compelling case for reducing the level of taxation on the
oil industry. Medium-term oil price predictions remain high, companies
continue to generate very high returns on capital employed pre- and
post-tax, and we recognise the importance of stability for the
industry. It would not be appropriate to change the levels of taxation
imposed on the North sea at the current time. I expect the very high
recent investment in the North sea to be maintained.</div>
					<a name="07050848000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Windsor
and for Braintree asked why the Bill gives a year&#146;s notice of
the change. The answer is that large companies pay their corporation
tax in quarterly instalments, often in advance, throughout the year.
Therefore, we need to set the main corporation tax rate a year in
advance to give large companies certainty about their
affairs.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07050848000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Windsor also asked how many companies would be affected. Some
41,000 large companies will pay corporation tax at a lower main rate as
a result of the change. The hon. Member for Braintree asked where we
stand compared with others. I can confirm that our corporation tax rate
will again be the lowest in the G7, as it has been throughout the past
decade. It will also be lower than the EU 15 average. After the change,
that will be just over 28 per cent., so we will come in just under it.
A wide range of studies shows that, on all sorts of bases, the UK
continues to have a competitive tax and regulatory regime for business.
This change will help to ensure that that continues to be the
case.</div>

						</b> I appreciate the Chief Secretary&#146;s answer
on the timing issue, but I am curious to know whether he&#151;or the
Economic Secretary or the Treasury&#151;considered the Irish example
of lowering corporation tax by 1 per cent., 2 per cent. or 3 per cent.
Has he done any sensitivity analysis on the Laffer curve about the
collection of tax revenues to see whether lowering the rate would
enable the Treasury to collect more taxes? I am trying to help the
Treasury out; it clearly wants to collect tax
revenues.</div>

frequently quote the example of the economic growth in the Republic of
Ireland. Certainly, the reduction in corporation tax has been a factor
there. However, is it not the case that there have been other factors,
not least the significant sums of money that have been received from
the European Union, which have been used very effectively? We all know
the attitude of Opposition Members towards the European

estimate of the cost of a further 1p reduction in corporation tax. He
said in answer to an earlier intervention of mine that, according to
the Treasury&#146;s model, the reduction in this Budget would lead to
an increase in investment. Does his estimate of the &#163;1.5 billion

surprised that there is no amendment seeking to reduce the rate
further, given the proposals made by the shadow Chancellor. I do not

last year&#146;s Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
announced that the figure will rise faster than forecast inflation in
the coming years to &#163;312,000 in April 2008 and to
&#163;325,000 in April 2009. The clause provides for a further,
above-inflation increase in the nil rate band to &#163;350,000 for
2010-11.</div>
					<a name="07050848000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the nil rate band allowance is twofold. First, it ensures that every
individual can leave a substantial sum of money or assets to whomever
they choose entirely free of inheritance tax. Secondly, it ensures that
the tax is progressive. For estates above the nil rate band, the
effective rate of tax increases according to the size of the estate, so
in the current year a taxable estate worth &#163;400,000 would pay
&#163;40,000 in inheritance tax, which is an effective tax rate of
just10 per cent. In contrast, an estate worth &#163;1
million would pay &#163;280,000, which is an effective rate of 28 per
cent. I hope the Committee accepts that it is right for those estates
that are in a position to do so to make a greater proportionate
contribution.</div>
					<a name="07050848000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been widespread discussion about how many estates will be liable to
pay inheritance tax, and I am afraid that some of that discussion has
been misleading. In the past year, 35,000 of the 600,000 estates
attracted an inheritance tax liability. The proportion of estates
liable for inheritance tax is just6 per cent. The remaining 94
per cent. pay no inheritance tax
whatever.</div>

the average size of an estate that ends up paying inheritance tax? The

tax and that smaller estates, which are just over the threshold, are
caught because of poor tax
planning.</div>

Timms:
						</b> I do not have the figure in front of me, but I hope
I can give the hon. Lady some reassurance, particularly about the link
between rising house prices and the payment of inheritance tax, which
is where much of the discussion tends to focus. During the last quarter
of 2006, the mean house price in the UK was &#163;199,000. The median
price, which I guess one might regard as the price of the typical
property, was &#163;175,000. In the south-east and London, the
corresponding prices were &#163;250,000 and &#163;292,000
respectively. All those figures are within this year&#146;s nil rate
band.</div>
					<a name="07050848000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">One often reads
comment in the press that misunderstands the position that we are in.
When a home is owned with a mortgage, the mortgage debt will reduce the
size of the estate as well. The truth is that the vast majority of
property ownership falls well within the inheritance tax nil rate band.
By fixing the band for 2010-11 at &#163;350,000, we are continuing to
provide certainty for families about the allowance in future years. I
should like to underline my view that inheritance tax is fair,
progressive and well targeted. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

2006 Bill&#151;by talking about inheritance tax. However, everyone in

					<a name="07050848000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
are obviously broadly supportive of the proposal to increase the
threshold for inheritance tax. However, given the controversy
surrounding inheritance tax, its rates and its thresholds, I should
like to address the rates and bands in the clause. However, in case my
remarks instantly prompt lots of interventions, I should make it clear
before I start that I am not in a position today to put forward
proposals to increase the threshold further or to amend the rate. I
know that many would like me to, but I am unable to do so. That is
partly because it would be foolish for my hon. Friend the Member for
Tatton (Mr. Osborne) to write his 2009 Budget now, but it is
also because the Opposition fear that when we win a general election in
2009 or 2010, the public finances will be in a pretty poor state. That
means that we feel that the nation may well not be able to afford tax
cuts in 2009. We believe that economic stability is more important tax
cuts. Because we adopt that fiscally responsible approach, our priority
on first being elected to Government is likely to be repairing the
public finances. That is why we are not making up-front promises of tax
cuts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000385"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> That commission put forward a range of
interesting ideas on inheritance tax and other taxes. It proposed a
significant reform of inheritance tax, which involved replacing it with
a modified form of capital gains tax. That is one reform that I would
hope hon. Members on both sides of the House would consider. That
proposal is not the policy of the Conservative party; it is simply a
proposal that we will consider, among the other ideas set forth in the
Forsyth commission report.</div>
					<a name="07050848000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are always open to ideas to
reform the tax system, whether they concern inheritance tax or any
other sort of tax. Although we are not proposing tax cuts, it
nevertheless remains important for both sides of the Committee, in
assessing the merits of the rates and bands that the clause sets out,
to reflect on the concerns that many of our constituents have about
inheritance tax.</div>
					<a name="07050848000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should consider four points: first, the fact that, like previous
clauses, clause 4 proposes to legislatefor the future;
secondly, the controversy surrounding house prices and inheritance tax
thresholds, to which the Chief Secretary has adverted; thirdly,
concerns about the general operation of inheritance tax and how the
thresholds can affect some vulnerable groups; and lastly, the
interaction between IHT thresholds and the pre-owned assets tax
regime.</div>
					<a name="07050848000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can deal
briefly with the first point by asking the Chief Secretary a question.
Why does the Chancellor wish to legislate for the future in this area?
As we have heard, the clause focuses on the financial year 2010-11. I
am struck that he is legislating that far ahead, and I should be
interested if the Chief Secretary can provide precedents. It seems odd,
as the Chancellor prepares to move from No.11 to No.10, that he should
be so keen to tie the hands of his successor. I should be interested to
hear the rationale and whether it makes sense to set thresholds this
far in
advance.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point
is more substantial and concerns the impact of rising house prices on
the thresholds that we are considering. Increasing concerns have been
raised about the expanding impact and reach of inheritance tax. I have
received many representations on the subject. Inheritance tax is no
longer a taxonly on the rich. For example, in May 2002, the
distinguished accountant John Whiting wrote in the <i class="I">Financial Times
</i>that inheritance tax
is</div>
					<a name="07050848000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;increasingly a tax
that affects Middle Britain.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>
					<a name="07050848000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">IHT has expanded in recent years to cover
people on modest incomes, which is due in no small part to the fact
that the threshold has not kept pace with house price inflation. The
value of many family homes is edging over the current &#163;300,000
threshold.</div>
					<a name="07050848000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In March,
the Halifax published figures on the interaction between house prices
and those thresholds. Since 1995-96, house prices throughout the UK
have increased by 199 per cent., which is more than double the increase
in the inheritance tax threshold. The Halifax estimates that the number
of properties valued above the IHT thresholds has nearly doubled in
five years; it believes that the number of owner-occupied properties in
the UK that are valued at more than the 2007-08 threshold of
&#163;300,000 stands at 2.3 million, or 12 per cent. of all
owner-occupied properties. In 2001, only 1.3 million properties, or 7
per cent. of owner-occupied properties, were valued at more than the
then IHT threshold of &#163;242,000. The Halifax went on to project
that the number of properties valued at more than the IHT threshold
throughout the UK could rise by a further 88 per cent., or 2 million,
to 4.3 million properties by
2020.</div>

							<a name="07050848000386"></a>Adam
Afriyie:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend share my concern that
inheritance tax is a burden for middle England and the middle classes?
Those who are very wealthy can always come up with schemes and ways to
get around paying it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000387"></a>Mrs.

middle incomes can be tougher than it is on those with high
incomes.</div>
					<a name="07050848000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chief
Secretary has given us the figures for estates that are currently
caught by inheritance tax, but the real anxiety is over the projections
of how many people will be drawn into the inheritance tax net in the
future. On the basis of the Halifax figures, the number of postcode
districts in England and Wales with an average house price above the
IHT threshold would more than double from 236 in 2006 to 480 in 2020,
which would account for 23 per cent. of all postcode districts. That
would be mitigated by the changes, which the figures predate, but the
problem will continue to occur. The Halifax figures for February 2007
show that the average house price in greater London had increased to
&#163;287,000 by the end of 2006, taking it above the &#163;285,000
threshold then in operation. Although the national average house price
is still below the threshold, average house prices in London and the
south-east are edging above the rates that are in
effect.</div>

						<a name="07050848000388"></a>
							<b class="B">Ian
Lucas</b> (Wrexham) (Lab): The Chief Secretary has already
indicated that the proportion of estates on which the tax is paid will
remain static at 6 per cent. Does the hon. Lady have any evidence to
suggest that that proportion will
increase?</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000389"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> Grant Thornton produced a good report on the
subject, which estimated that if asset prices continue to grow at their
long-term average rate between now and 2009, the number of tax-paying
estates could rise to 45,000 or 50,000. Again, that figure will be
slightly mitigated by the increases that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>might see in the future, but Grant Thornton is talking about 2009
figures. There is some evidence that the reach of inheritance tax will
expand over the next few years.</div>
					<a name="07050848000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at the mitigating
effect of the threshold that we are examining today&#151;the
&#163;350,000 threshold&#151;the delay in its implementation will
mean, of course, that it will not necessarily address my concerns. That
is because one can expect house prices to keep increasing; there is at
least a significant chance that they will keep increasing and a
significant chance of an increase in the number of estates that have to
pay tax.</div>
					<a name="07050848000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
expanding scope of inheritance tax is illustrated by the amount that it
raises. The Halifax research examined cumulative inheritance tax
revenue over the five years to 2007-08 and calculated it as
&#163;16.4 billion, up more than 50 per cent. from the &#163;10.8
billion raised by the Government in the previous five years. As we have
heard, revenue raised in 2006-07 was &#163;3.6 billion and that was
up 12 per cent. on 2005. The Government project a significant increase
in annual IHT revenues, which are expected to top &#163;4 billion in
2007-08. There are serious issues to be addressed regarding the
interaction between house prices and the
thresholds.</div>
					<a name="07050848000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
set of issues to which I would like todraw the
Committee&#146;s attention concern the general operation of
inheritance tax and the threshold that the clause amends, and the
impact on certain vulnerable groups. The impact of the current
threshold would have been significantly more controversial were it not
for the spouse exemption for inheritance tax. As we all know from last
year, that exemption enables husbands and wives to pass property
between one another free of inheritance tax. In assessing the
appropriate thresholds and rates, the Committee should take into
account the scope of that exemption, since it has a significant impact
on how the overall tax operates and upon whom the burden
falls.</div>
					<a name="07050848000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were it not
for the spouse exemption, many more people would have had to sell the
family home to pay their tax bill. That is why the Government&#146;s
proposals to limit the spouse exemption in the Finance Bill 2006 were
so controversial and why their turnaround on that issue was so widely
welcomed. Another significant change is the Civil Partnerships Act
2004, which expands spouse exemption to gay couples entering a civil
partnership.</div>
					<a name="07050848000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another matter that all parts of the House should consider, in a
completely bipartisan way, in respect of inheritance tax and how it
should be reformed: the question of long-term dependent cohabitees who
do not have the option of using the spouse exemption via marriage or a
civil partnership. They might be long-term carers of elderly parents,
adult disabled children living with their parents or, as illustrated by
a case in my constituency, sisters who have lived with one another for
many years. My constituent, Ann James, wrote to me on several occasions
to set out her grave concerns about the impact of inheritance tax on
her and her sister. She expects to have to sell her home if her sister
dies before she does, and vice versa.</div>
					<a name="07050848000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who cannot use a spouse
exemption can often be harshly treated by this legislation,
particularly in a constituency such as mine, where house prices are
high. As well as the position of dependent cohabitees, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>Committee should also briefly consider&#151;I promise that I will
raise this matter briefly, Mr. Gale&#151;the after-effects
of last year&#146;s changes to inheritance tax and trusts, and their
impact on another vulnerable group: the disabled. We had a lengthy and
controversial debate on that issue, and I will not repeat the
arguments, but it is worth noting that those affectedby the
changes that were introduced still have real difficulty working out how
the system operates and affects the disabled.</div>
					<a name="07050848000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an incredibly complex
system and I turn to the effects of the thresholds that we are
considering in the clause. As I am sure you are aware, Mr.
Gale, trusts for disabled people often exceed the &#163;300,000
threshold that is currently in place and the &#163;350,000 threshold
that we are considering putting in place for 2010. That is because sums
of money devoted to caring for disabled people often have to cover a
lifetime of care. Trusts are frequently used in such a situation,
particularly where personal injury damages are received as a result of
litigation. However, settlements resulting from damages or compensation
payments could easily exceed &#163;350,000. Under the current
schedule 20 regime, such trusts are frequently affected by inheritance
tax. Before last year, that was never a problem because people used
life interest trusts, but that option has broadly been shut down by the
Finance Act 2006. I have received representations about the framework
that resulted from the 2006 Act as it is a complex system with
considerable confusion about trusts for disabled
people.</div>

							<a name="07050848000390"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I am listening carefully to what the hon. Lady
says, but, as a former personal injury lawyer, I cannot quite
understand her point about damages for those who have a major
disability as a result of an accident. Those damages are sometimes
transferred into trusts to provide compensation for an individual
during the course of their life, not for their heirs and successors.
Without going into too much depth, perhaps she could explain how that
type of trust for someone with a disability comes into
play?</div>
					
					<a name="07050848000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000391"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The problem occurs when the trustis set
up because, as a result of schedule 20, an inheritance tax charge will
automatically be incurred unless the person for whom it is set up is
covered bythe limited disabled exemption. As we discussed, the
exemption for disabled people is quite narrow and depends on
someone&#146;s entitlement to disability living allowance. Therefore,
a significant range of people who have important disabilities do not
fall within the definition. That is one of the key issues. The other
issue relates to the complex interaction between income tax, capital
gains tax and IHT rules. Essentially, the problem is that it is
difficult for a disabled person to get the allowances to which they are
entitled under all three taxes. There are occasions when the two taxes
are doubling up and a CGT charge and an IHT liability is incurred in
the same situation, which makes the system tougher than it was before
the Finance Act 2006. That probably was not intended to be a result of
the 2006 Act and, on the record, I ask the Chief Secretary to look at
that issue. I believe that the 2006 Act was not meant to have such an
effect and I am sure that the Government did not mean to penalise
disabled people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>for using trusts. People are concerned about that problem and there is a
strong case for reform and a simplification of the rules. I hope that
the Chief Secretary can say today whether it is a matter of interest to
him and whether the Government are prepared to consider the issue with
a view to introducing reform of the legislation next
year.</div>
					<a name="07050848000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
trespassed on the Committee&#146;s patience for too long already, so
I lastly mention that the Government&#146;s ferociously complicated
pre-owned assets tax regime interacts with inheritance tax. The regime
was created to prevent people from avoiding inheritance tax and I will
not anticipate the discussion that we will have about clause 25, but it
is unfortunate that the Government have failed to resolve the problems
with section 80 of the 2006 Act. They have also failed to deal with the
problem of elections between inheritance tax and the harsh pre-owned
assets tax regime.</div>
					<a name="07050848000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, as we have heard, inheritance tax continues to be a matter
of deep controversy for a range of different political commentators and
hon. Members. I hope that the Minister will consider some of the points
that I have raised, particularly the expanding reach of inheritance tax
on middle Britain and whether we need to reform the system to deal with
the position of dependent cohabitees. In relation to schedule 20, we
must ensure that the system doesnot operate to the
disadvantage of disabled people, many of whom find trusts useful and,
as a result of schedule 20, may have an increased inheritance tax
bill.</div>

Member for Chipping Barnet that, if that was an abridged version of her
speech, it was rather like reading a version of &#147;War and
Peace&#148; in which the only abridgement has been to get rid of all
the excess names and titles. On inheritance tax, I understand why the
Conservatives will not put forward any figures at the moment. Their
only slim chance of getting into office in 2009-10 will be if public
finances are poor. In those circumstances, were the electorate
misguidedly to put them into office, they would be able to do nothing
about inheritance tax, so she is at least being honest.</div>
					<a name="07050848000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It always interests and saddens
me that the Conservative position on inheritance tax is basically a
defence of the rich and scaremongering. For almost everybody who pays
inheritance tax and who is not very rich, it is a tax based on a
windfall gain due to the increase in the value of property. In most
cases, that occurs not because of any action taken by the individual
but because the market has risen. Secondly, it is paid only on death,
so in almost every case except that of the super-rich, it is a tax on a
windfall gain that is paid on death, which seems to me a reasonable
tax.</div>

Inheritance tax is a capital tax. The idea of middle income is rubbish.
People on an average income, unless they are incredibly hard savers,
will never get to the threshold unless they buy a house and it goes up
a lot in value. The hon. Gentleman, who is a very successful business
person, may not realise it, but for those of us who have been on decent
incomes for most of our working lives, the concept of being able to
save anything like &#163;350,000, apart from through a house, just
out of a bit of income is completely alien. With &#147;middle

sake of their families? Is that the sort of society that he wants, or
would he prefer a society in which people, having put money aside, see
some benefit accruing to their
families?</div>

						</b> First, I was born and raised in this country and
have lived all but nine years of my life here. I have always been a
European and I shall remain a European. Secondly, in terms of
people&#146;s savings, I do not accept the intellectual constraint of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. People work hard in this country,
and people save money. People buy houses. For a lot of people,
including me, the value of those houses&#151;in my case over 23
years&#151;has gone up about tenfold. That is not because of anything
that they have done but because the market has gone up. I have no
objection to people paying inheritance tax on that windfall gain. Most
of the people whom we have discussed have benefited from the general
rise in house prices, not from their thrift in building up a business.
Those who have built up a business above the threshold or saved money
have done very well. Good luck to them. I do not think that they should
object to an inheritance tax that has to be paid on death.</div>
					<a name="07050848000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Grant Thornton figures that
were cited by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet&#151;35,000 to
40,000 or even 50,000&#151;represent, in round terms, an increase
from 6 per cent. to 8 per cent. of estates. Given that fewer than 10
per cent. of people in the United Kingdom pay higher-rate income tax,
we are talking about the well-to-do, including every hon. Member and
right hon. Member here, because we quite properly pay higher rate
taxes, even though by some standards we do not earn a fortune. I am
very well paid for being a Member of Parliament, and I have no other
source of income. I am happy to pay tax at the higher rate. I do not
regard myself as wealthy, and I should be quite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>happy to pay the inheritance tax were my estate valued above that
threshold. As far as I know, our estate&#151;that of my wife and
I&#151;will not be valued above that threshold. We do not live in
London. Some people in London who have very high house prices because
of rising house prices will pay inheritance tax.</div>
					<a name="07050848000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet has a point, however, about&#151;in shorthand&#151;the
sister situation. The Government will have to consider that. In that
situation, there should not be an exemption from inheritance tax in the
same way that there is for transfers between spouses upon death, but
the Government should consider a deferral of inheritance tax. I stand
to be corrected, but when one sister dies, having lived with the other
in the same house for 40 or 50 years because neither of them married or
entered a civil partnership, the inheritance tax that is payable on
their death should be deferred, so that the second sister can carry on
living in what is essentially the family home.</div>
					<a name="07050848000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, I have a
couple of minor technical queries for the Chief Secretary. First, the
wording of subsection (3) is, to say the least, opaque. For a lay
person like me, it does not appear to bear much relation to explanatory
note No. 4 on clause 4, so I urge the Chief Secretary to look at it
again.</div>
					<a name="07050848000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
will not surprise Members to know that I strongly
object to the wording of subsection (4), starting as it does with
&#147;But&#148;. In that context, the word is completely redundant.
However, the wording is also opaque to the lay person, and it does not
appear to bear any relation whatever to explanatory note No.
5.</div>
					<a name="07050848000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
&#147;that section&#148; in subsection (4) may refer to</div>

1984&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07050848000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						which subsection (3)
mentions. However, grammatically, the sudden appearance of &#147;that
section&#148; means that it does not necessarily refer to any
particular section. The parliamentary draftspeople need to have another
look at it. There is opaque wording in subsections (3) and (4), there
is the anathema of &#147;But&#148; at the beginning of subsection
(4), and &#147;that section&#148; in subsection (4) does not appear
to relate to any specified section therein.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The clause sets out the rate of inheritance
tax at &#163;350,000 for 2010-11. The Chief Secretary echoed the
words that were used when the provision was set out in the Budget,
saying that the threshold change would be introduced to continue to
provide a fair and targeted tax system. I do not think that anyone
would go against that intent, and to give credit to the Government, the
change raises the inheritance tax threshold in real terms for six
successive years.</div>
					<a name="07050848000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an issue about the
fact that the Bill sets the rate for 2010-11. We have already had a
debate about the corporation tax and income tax changes that will kick
in next year. The provision under discussiongoes one step
further, showing perhaps that the chancellorship will move to No. 10
along with the current Chancellor. Owing to the announcement of other
significant tax changes and the headlines that they grabbed, the change
before us perhaps slipped by the wayside.</div>

						How will the
real terms growth involved in lifting the threshold fit with the
current and projected growth in house prices? I should also be
interested to know the average size of the estates that pay inheritance
tax. If we are serious about providing a fair and targeted tax system,
our chief concern should be about what happens to very wealthy estates.
We have been discussing people who largely fear inheritance tax. They
live in their property, and it is more difficult for them to dispose of
their asset than it is for people who are incredibly wealthy and have
all kinds of assets that are easier to dispose of in the lifetime gift
system. If the tax system is to be fair and targeted, we must recognise
that there is an inconsistency between the treatment of lifetime gifts
and the inheritance tax system. The concern is that it is easier for
people with higher value assets to dispose of them in a way that avoids
inheritance tax than others&#151;I do not mean those on an average
income. As we have heard, a significant number of people are involved,
but when we talk about averages, a large number of people fall below
the average. The concern is that the people at the level above the
average will find it easy to dispose of their assets; they have seven
years to do so and do not live in their assets in the way in which the
people who are concerned about inheritance tax do. Not dealing with
that inconsistency means that the system is not targeted or
fair.</div>
					<a name="07050848000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">My constituents
have brought the issue to my attention. I live in a part of the country
where average incomes are probably 20 per cent. below the national
average, but some houses have seen price rises among the highest in the
country. Fishermen, who live in family cottages and have a family
business have children who will not be able to stay in their property.
Fishermen live in the area to do their job, but because properties are
bought as second homes and house prices are going through the roof,
there is no way that someone doing that job can continue to live in
that property.</div>
					<a name="07050848000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue that is regularly
brought up in my surgery concerns people who fall into the inheritance
tax boundaries because they have not had proper advice. The wealthier
someone is, the easier it is for them to employ an accountant or lawyer
for advice on how best to make use of the allowances and the spouse
exemption and on how to maximise the use of the thresholds. People come
to me who failed to do that through their own error, but then saw
themselves and their families caught by inheritance tax. What can the
Treasury do to ensure that such people understand and can make the best
use of the system?</div>
					<a name="07050848000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">What comparisons has the
Treasury made between the projected rises and the increase in house
prices? For many people, inheritance tax is a stealth tax. As the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said, people live in their asset,
and so they might not know the value of the property until they have to
realise the estate. There is a lack of understanding and a fear that
thresholds will not keep pace with house price inflation, which will
mean that people will unwittingly be caught by the system. People do
not understand what they need to do to make the most of their
allowances, as they are entitled to do.</div>
					<a name="07050848000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">My key concerns are about the
lack of understanding and about whether the tax is consistent with the
Government&#146;s taxation of wealth. The poorest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>20 per cent. pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the
richest 20 per cent. What can the Government do to inheritance tax to
ensure that they capture the growing wealth, especially among the
richest 1 per cent.? If the idea is to make the system fairer and more
targeted, the Government need to go far beyond the clause.
Fundamentally, the treatment needs to be consistent not only for
properties but for other assets. The Government must also be consistent
in how they deal with lifetime gifts, which are the easiest way for
people who can easily dispose of their assets to get out of paying
inheritance tax. The situation is difficult for those with a property,
and people are getting confused. They are unwittingly getting caught,
and that is where the chief concerns lie.

Afriyie:
						</b> They say that there are two certainties in life:
death and taxes. The Government&#151;I am not sure that they should
be commended, because it is rather alarming&#151;have managed to
combine the two for about 50,000 people. In 1987, about 18,000 were
caught by the inheritance tax threshold, and by 2009-10 up to 50,000
people could well be caught.We were having a little debate
earlier with thehon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, who
observed that the people caught in the inheritance tax trap are
relatively wealthy. I argued that they are not necessarily wealthy but
can easily be people with a middle income who have been doing the right
thing for most of their lives.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reports
that we have been talking about and the projections for estates caught
in the inheritance tax trap extend only to about 2010 or perhaps 2011.
If those forecasts are rolled forward 20 or 30 years, far more people
will be caught in the trap. It is self-evident that most people with
mortgages in this country have repayment mortgages, or the value of the
mortgage compared with the property falls gradually over a long period.
That will of course have an impact on their estates at the unexpected
time when they pass
away.</div>
				
					<a name="07050848000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other thing to remember is
that inheritance tax is not just about house prices. Many people on
average salaries amass enough during their lifetime to cross the
current threshold, perhaps not by 2010, but certainly by 2015 or 2020
as they gradually pick away at their mortgages and, hopefully, save for
their pensions funds. All sorts of assets are built up over a longer
period. I have concerns about the very long term and the number of
people who will be
caught.</div>
					<a name="07050848000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned about people who are self-employed and owner-managers of
small family businesses. They may make a small profit each
year&#151;perhaps &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000&#151;and when
those businesses are sold on death, their value may be in the region of
between five and 15 times net annual income. People who have worked
hard all their lives, perhaps with family members, and built up an
asset in a business are caught within the inheritance tax threshold. It
is not just house prices that affect the number of people caught in the
trap.</div>
					<a name="07050848000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">A wider debate
that is of interest concerns what sort of tax we want to raise in the
United Kingdom. There is a strong argument for income tax to be lower
during our lifetime while we are working hard and generating 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>
						prosperity for the nation. There is also an argument
that inheritance tax should be higher. We should not dismiss
immediately any concept that what we have today should be fixed in
stone. The matter needs consideration, so I am not blinkered about
inheritance tax and am not saying that it is inherently a dreadful and
bad tax, but it is certainly double taxation. In 1997, we did not
expect to see what has happened by 2007, but we should not be too rigid
in our view of exactly what sort of taxation is right or wrong in the
economy.</div>
					<a name="07050848000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd
and bizarre that we talk about corporation tax on small businesses only
one year ahead&#151;although we have been talking about two or three
years ahead&#151;and all of a sudden we are told out that in 2010 the
inheritance tax threshold will be &#163;350,000, marginally above the
rate of indexation if it were indexed. Why have the Chancellor and the
Treasury chosen to do that now when in so many other areas they have
covered their hand to hide or obscure what the tax regime may be in a
few years&#146;
time?</div>
					<a name="07050848000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking
about inheritance tax rates in 2010. What sort of behaviour is that
supposed to encourage? Is it to encourage us all to live longer than
2010, or to die sooner than 2010? What is the objective of making the
announcement today rather than indexing the allowances? Why choose to
announce today what will happen in 2010? What is the rationale behind
that?</div>
					<a name="07050848000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I have
a general question for the Chief Secretary. What is the
announcement&#146;s objective? Is it to stop people growing the value
of their estate by spending money during their lifetime? Is it to stop
hard-working families with owner-managed businesses passing them on, or
selling the business early and spending the money? Or is it a
straightforward tax-raising mechanism, albeit indexed marginally higher
than the rate of inflation today? I should appreciate clear answers to
my questions.</div>

archaic, deeply regressive, immoral tax, not least because it amounts
to a double taxation. I am not here to incur the wrath of my

probe and to question.</div>
					<a name="07050848000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not need to read the

2007-08, but, blow me, the heading continues, &#147;for
2010-11&#148;. Why do the general public, who have concerns about the
motives behind inheritance tax, have to wait for 2010-11 for the band
to be raised to
&#163;350,000?</div>
					<a name="07050848000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chief Secretary did a good job of answering the question on corporation
tax, which I appreciated. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and
my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor asked why we had to wait for
2010-11, and I may have an explanation for them: inheritance tax is
another example of the Government&#146;s commitment to taxation
promoting behaviour change by encouraging people to live long enough
for them to leave office. But who knows? The year 2010 is a long way
off and there is much damage that the Government can continue to do
with the tax
system.</div>
					<a name="07050848000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chief
Secretary said that roughly 6 per cent. would pay inheritance tax, yet
my hon. Friend made the point that in 1997, roughly 18,000 people paid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>inheritance tax. I do not have the projected figures, but in 2005,
37,000 paid inheritance tax, more than double the 18,000
figure.</div>
					<a name="07050848000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also have
figures from research carried out by the analysts Lombard Street
Associates, who indicated that the number of people whose wealth stands
above the inheritance tax threshold is set to rise from 2.1 million in
2002 to approximately 4.5 million in 2009. How does that square with
the 6 per cent.
figure?</div>
					<a name="07050848000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not for
me to make suggestions on tax cuts, or on where savings can be made,
but I shall slightly provoke my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary
and make the minor suggestion that money wastedon the tax
credit overpayments alone amount to&#163;1.8 billion, which
is only 50 per cent. of the&#163;3.6 billion estimated to be
collected in inheritance tax receipts. Perhaps the Government could
consider some flexibility in that small
area.</div>

what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said about our
having a due to society and our obligation to leave something behind. I
would therefore encourage the Government to think again about where
savings could be made, so that they could perhaps raise the threshold a
little more, so as to encourage people to save for the future and give
to their

That was a striking and noteworthy
contrast.</div>

the nil rate threshold for 2010-11 so early. She then talked about what
house prices would be like in 2020, and I thought that she was going to
ask me to announce the threshold for then, too. In fact, setting out
the threshold a few years ahead, as we have done consistently over the
past few years, is helpful in giving families confidenceabout
how things will be over the period ahead. The threshold for the current
rate was announced in the 2005 Budget, while the threshold for the
following two years was announced in last year&#146;s Budget. We are
simply maintaining that practice.</div>

only fractionally below what it is now. The rate was 6 per cent. in
2004-05, 6 per cent. in 2005-06 and 6 per cent. last year, and I expect
it to be 6 per cent. consistently over the next few
years.</div>

prefer&#151;I think it is the right approach&#151;is to uprate the
basic nil rate band for all taxpayers, rather than to introduce a

taking some estates out of the tax altogether. It may be helpful to
make the point that where inheritors do not wish to sell a house,
inheritance tax that is due on that house can be paid in instalments
over 10 years, provided that the house is not sold. In some instances,

ensure that people pay their fair share. In addition, we keep
inheritance tax under close review, and people looking at our record
will be in no doubt that we will act against unfair tax avoidance in
this or any other
area.</div>
					<a name="07050848000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked what will happen given future house price increases. As I said,
we believe that the threshold that we have set will keep consistent the
proportion of estates paying inheritance in the next few years. The
thresholds take account of expected increases in house prices over that
time.</div>
					<a name="07050848000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Windsor suggested that inheritance tax might be set at a higher
rate. That is an interesting suggestion, and one which may commend
itself to his hon. Friends. To respond to his point on owner-managers,
&#163;350,000 is a substantial sum in that instance. There is
specific relief, however, for qualifying privately owned businesses,
which can reduce, or in some cases eliminate, inheritance tax, which
may be helpful in the circumstances that concern
him.</div>
					<a name="07050848000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">To describe
inheritance tax as double taxation,as the hon. Member for
Braintree did, is to make a completely specious argument. It is rather
like saying that VAT is double taxation because people have already
paid income tax on their income. As he knows, double taxation is a
pretty well-defined concept and I certainly do not think that it
applies in this
instance.</div>

your chairmanship during our proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07050848000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5 increases the rates of
excise duty charged on beer, wine, made-wine and cider in line with
inflation. Excise duties on alcohol provide an
important&#163;8 billion annually to invest in essential
public services. This inflation-only increase in duty, which, together
with VAT, is equivalent to around 1p on a pint of beer and on a litre
of cider, 5p on a bottle of wine and sparkling cider, and 7p on a
bottle of sparkling wine, is necessary to maintain this important
source of revenue to the public purse.</div>

							<a name="07050848000416"></a>John 
Healey:
						</b> It is a revenue measure, and one that is entirely
consistent with the convention and the usual approach to excise duties,
which is that, generally, this Government and previous Governments
would, at first blush, look to increase duties in line with inflation,
at least to maintain their real value.</div>
					<a name="07050848000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a modest
increase&#151;a freeze in real terms&#151;which comes after actual
freezes in beer and still-wine duty in three of the previous 10
Budgets. In addition, cider duty was frozen in the previous four
Budgets and sparkling wine duty was frozen in each of the previous six
Budgets.</div>
					<a name="07050848000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been concerns about alcohol-related harm, its social impact and the
quite serious problems that it causes in some areas; that may have been
what the hon. Member for Windsor was driving at, and I look forward to
hearing any contribution that he would like to make to the discussion.
As a result of those concerns, and as a proposed response to those
problems, there have been calls for significant increases 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>in duty. However, the view that the Government take&#151;it is the
view that we have consistently taken in the Treasury&#151;is that
that sort of social harm and social concern is best tackled by social
legislation and by working with the trade in self-regulation, rather
than by taxation, which, in this circumstance, is an instrument that is
not best suited to deal with the social problems that we are
discussing. In fact, it wouldbe likely to penalise the vast
majority of responsible drinkers rather than affecting the minority who
cause us concern.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> Will the Financial Secretary concede that
there might be one exception&#151;super-strength lagers? People with
significant addiction problems buy such lagers because they are the
strongest and cheapest drink, so the price contributes to their
decision. Generally, they are drunk by people with problems. Does he
not think that changing the price might go a significant way towards
tackling that specific
problem?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050848000418"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Not entirely, because the generalcase for
using taxation as a means of regulating consumption has not been made.
It is not best suited to this area of policy. In addition, concerns
have been expressed by some in the alcohol industry who argue that
higher energy and raw materials prices, and their impact on consumer
demand, have created a difficult trading environment for them over the
past year. We recognise that the industry makes an important social and
economic contribution to the life of this country. I would argue that
the modest inflation-only increase in the duty on beer, wine and cider
recognises those concerns, while providing the important stream of
revenue that is necessary to maintain our commitment to public
services.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): May I make it clear at the
start of my contribution that I have not changed gender today? I was
about to add that I am not aware of having done so at any other time,
but members of the Committee, being as sharp as ever, beat me to it. I
have not crossed the Floor to join the Labour party today, or at any
other time. Nor have I improved my looks and intelligence by a factor
of at least 100. That was all by way of saying that I amnot
the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), in case any member
of the Committee is in any doubt. She would doubtless have made a
significant contribution to the Bill had she been a member of the
Committee, because she makes very good contributions to
debates.</div>
					<a name="07050848000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that I have served under you before, Mr. Gale. In
welcoming you to the Chair, may I say that I am sure that if you are
ever told that you have joined the Labour party, changed your gender or
improved your intelligence&#151;not that I am willing to admit that
that is possible&#151;you will bear all those complimentary remarks
with the fortitude that I associate with you?</div>
					<a name="07050848000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having welcomed you in that
way, Mr. Gale, I turn naturally to the clause and to alcohol
duty. As I do so, I think of last year&#146;s debate, at which you
were notable to be present, although other members of the
Committee will remember it&#151;the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>Wolverhampton, South-West certainly will. Last year&#146;s decisions
were spread across two main clauses, one about beer and a separate one
about wine. This year, the two of them are packed into one clause. I do
not want to start the more serious element of my remarks on a pedantic
note, but I am curious to know why they have been rolled together. Is
there a significant reason for that? Although I suspect that there is
not, perhaps the Financial Secretary will wish to clear that up later.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="07050848000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear a remark from a
sedentary position about the length of the tax code. I do not think
that I should like to comment on that. I would, however, like to
comment on the issues that face Ministers in deciding the balance of
duties. They have to take into account a number of considerations. The
duties have to be high enough to raise the revenue necessary to fund
public services and all the causes that Ministers traditionally commend
to us, but low enough to ensure&#151;as with tobacco, about which we
heard so much last year and I am sure we will hear more as the
Committee goes on&#151;that the law of unintended consequences does
not apply. In other words, they must ensure that smuggling is not
encouraged and revenue subsequently threatened. They also have to take
into account the needs of domestic producers and have to be as fair as
possible across the different drinks. It can also be argued&#151;a
case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor&#151;that duties
on alcohol should play a part in improving public
health.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07050848000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07050848000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary said that such mattershad been treated in the same
way by the previous Conservative Government as by the present
Government and that taxation may not be best suited to bringing about
the health results to which my hon. Friend referred, and that the case
had not been made. It would be fair for him to be a little puzzled by
that in principle because, after all, taxation is used in several other
circumstances to encourage or discourage behaviour. Perhaps he may wish
to contribute to the debate later on that point when we shall listen
carefully to what he has to
say.</div>
					<a name="07050848000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not saying
that the objectives are easy to reconcile. Having made it clear that we
are not inclined to oppose the increases on the basis of what we know,
I wish to ask the Financial Secretary specific questions about beer and
some general questions about the Government&#146;s strategy as a
whole. Casting my mind back to last year&#146;s debate, I recall that
he referred to concerns in the wine trade, which was arguing at the
time that demand for wine was beginning to weaken. He referred
specifically to that
point.</div>
					<a name="07050848000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Noting that
duty on beer had fallen by 6 per cent. in real terms since 1997, the
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said that there
was</div>
					<a name="07050848000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;clear evidence that
alcohol, particularly beer, plays a large part in some of the
antisocial behaviour, not least binge drinking, that we experience from
time to time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raised
that issue not to disagree with or criticise what the hon. Gentleman
said, but to give the Committee the flavour of last year&#146;s
debate. Although that debate was brief, it is fair to say that it was
rather more sympathetic to the cause of wine than to the
causeof beer.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>
					<a name="07050848000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The context this year is a bit
different. The smoking ban in pubs and clubs is due to come into effect
in July. The British Beer and Pub Association argues that the ban will
have a disproportionate effect on beer sales and, in particular, on
smaller, more traditional and out-of-town and city centre pubs for
which beer represents a larger percentage of sales. Members of the
Committee will have received representations from the association and
their local brewers in the same
vein.</div>
					<a name="07050848000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument put
forward by the association is worth considering in some detail. Beer is
mainly a home-grown product; 90 per cent. of the beer drunk in the
United Kingdom is made in the UK. The brewing and pub industry
contributes more than &#163;28 billion to the UK economy&#151;some
2 per cent. of GDP&#151;and exports more than 1.5 million pints of
beer a day to more than 120 countries, generating
nearly &#163;300 million in export revenues. It employs roughly
20,000 people directly and creates more than 600,000 jobs
indistribution, pubs and bars; 45,000 landlords run their own
businesses and brewers buy more than 40 per cent. of the malting barley
crop, thus helping to sustain the rural economy and rural
communities.</div>
					<a name="07050848000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, the case that the industry has made this year&#151;rather more
vociferously and with more force than it made last year when the clause
on beer went through pretty quickly&#151;is that beer is under some
pressure from rising energy costs that drive up the direct costs of
beer production and distribution, and from changing consumer
preferences, including some for products that are mainly imported. The
example of wine is almost too obvious to state, but I shall do so none
the less. The industry is also under pressure from changing patterns of
consumption, such as the trend towards drinking cut-price beer that is
available from supermarkets at home. Since 1997, beer consumption is
down by 11 per cent. and continues to fall; 35 British breweries have
closed in recent years with the loss of about 5,000 jobs. The
association says that the total profits of Britain&#146;s four
biggest brewers fell by 50 per cent. last year, which is a considerable
fall.</div>
					<a name="07050848000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
therefore is whether, as the association claims, the industry will soon
be hit by a double whammy of the effects of those pressures plus the
effects of the smoking ban. In Ireland, sales fell by7 per
cent. in the aftermath of the ban, and I should be interested to know
whether the Financial Secretary has a more up-to-date figure. Does he
know whether the Treasury has made any calculations as to the combined
effect on beer sales of the forthcoming ban together with the rise
prescribed by the clause? Has it made specific studies of the
experience in Ireland or elsewhere, and what is the combined effect on
pub closures of the ban and the rise set forth in the
clause&#151;particularly in relation to the smaller, out-of-town or
out-of-centre, traditional pubs to which I referred earlier?
Furthermore, what assessment has the Treasury made of the effect on
pubs of the availability of cut-price beer from
supermarkets?</div>
					<a name="07050848000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
association has got into the business of trying to calculate what
happens to revenue, and claims that further tax rises will raise little
extra money but willhit the industry hard. It says
specifically that price elasticity of demand, a key measure of how
price affects sales, is minus 1.5 per cent., and that that is three
times higher than the Treasury estimates. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>summary, it says that duty rises produce falling consumption and less
revenue. It cites an alleged so-called &#147;black hole&#148; of
&#163;70 million to &#163;100 million in Treasury finances. The
Financial Secretary furrows his brow, but the figure is on the
association&#146;s website and I should be grateful if he would clear
the matter up in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07050848000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Financial Secretary spoke last year about the long-running freeze on
spirits, he
said:</div>
					<a name="07050848000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reason for the decision on beer duty compared with that on
spirits&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050848000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other
words, the
freeze&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050848000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is that
spirits are significantly more heavily taxed than beer and we have in
place a long-term policy of a fairer balance of taxation across all
alcohol products.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
</i>
						<i class="I">Standing Committee A,</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>9 May 2006; c.
56.]</div>
					<a name="07050848000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reference to
a fairer balance of taxation over a period of time suggests
equivalence: taxing drinks solely on alcohol content. That would imply
a continuing increase in duty on spirits, and an increase in wine
duties. New world wines are stronger than old world wines, because the
alcohol content is higher,so arguably a revision of wine
duties would be necessitated. Is that what the Financial Secretary
meant by a fairer balance? If so, has the Treasury calculated the
effects of such a rebalancing on public
health?</div>
					<a name="07050848000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
this year&#146;s changes, duties on sparkling wine were, as the
Financial Secretary said, raised by3.4 per cent., having been
frozen since 2000-01. Duties on cider and perry have been raised by 3.4
per cent, having been cut by 2 per cent. in 2003. Those are quite
significant changes. After what was effectively quite a long period
without any change in duties on sparkling wine, there has been an
increase and, after a cut in the duty on cider and perry in 2003, there
has now beenan increase on them too. That seems to be quite a
considerable change of
approach.</div>
					<a name="07050848000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary said last year
that</div>
					<a name="07050848000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sparkling wine is
the most heavily taxed of all alcoholic drinks. That is part of the
reason why the decision that we took in previous years to freeze the
duty on sparkling wine was taken again this
year.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050848000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">One is inclined to
ask: what has changed in the year since those comments? He went on to
say, in a moment of levity that he might&#151;who

					<a name="07050848000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

whether they have simply given up champagne as a result of the current
atmosphere in the Treasury. However, I would be grateful for the
Financial Secretary&#146;s comments on what changed his
officials&#146; drinking behaviour in a
year.</div>
					<a name="07050848000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on
smuggling, the Government published their UK alcohol strategy on
spirits in 2005. It aimed to reduce the illicit spirits market to 3 per
cent. by this financial year compared with a range of 0.8 per cent. in
2004-05 and 9 per cent. in 2001-02. HMRC figures duly showed the
illicit spirits share smoothly declining in each year since 2001-02 and
the estimated tax loss falling from &#163;1.1 billion to &#163;300
million. There has been a steady decrease, but the figures are not
easyto reconcile with the fall in the amount of spirits
seized. We learned from a parliamentary answer that the amount fell
from 2.1 million litres in 2000-01 to 0.24 million litres in 2004-05.
For wine, the amount fell from 0.61 million litres in 2000-01 to 0.29
million litres in 2004-05. Again, I would be grateful for the Financial
Secretary&#146;s
comments.</div>

						</b> I have some brief remarks. I commend the hon.
Member for Wycombe on his thoughtful comments. I was not contacted by
the brewers, although one of the country&#146;s largest brewers is
headquartered in my constituency. It used to be called Banks&#146;s,
then Wolverhampton and Dudley Brewery and is now Marston&#146;s. It
is known to many hon. Members, and is led by its excellent chief
executive, Ralph Findlay. It has been very successful and its profits
have gone up markedly in recent years. However, I note from the
explanatory notes that the duty on beer, wine and cider has been raised
this year in line with inflation, but the duty on spirits is frozen
and, in fact, is 27 per cent. lower than it would have been if it had
been increased in line with inflation since 1997. The corresponding
fall for beer is 3 per cent. in real terms; for cider it is 19 per
cent.; for still wine it is 3 per cent.; and for sparkling wine it is
16 per cent. Can I tempt the Financial Secretary to say a little more
about the fair balance, as he did last year?</div>
