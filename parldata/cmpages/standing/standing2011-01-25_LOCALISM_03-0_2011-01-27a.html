point of view, and taking a quick step back in terms of the
macro-economic climate at a time when we are looking at the private
sector to drive the economic recovery and to create jobs, we would say
that our main question is how a localism Bill drives the economic
recovery. The key message that we have had from our members up and down
the country over the past 12 months—it does not
matter which sector, where they are based in the UK or what size they
are—is that infrastructure has to be upgraded to underpin the
economic recovery, and that therefore the planning system has to be as
robust as possible to ensure that there are going  to be the
right signals for business
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000043">&#160;</a>

We have concerns about the Bill. We do not want it to become simply a
nimby charter that gives powers down to the level where people will
just stop development. We want it to be pro-growth, and we have
certainly heard the Government’s voice on that. However, our
theme through this is that the Bill does not mention business once. We
want businesses to have a voice—certainly on local referendums,
neighbourhood development orders and neighbourhood plans—so we
want to see that in the Bill. Also, we are looking for a lot more
clarification and further guidance about the Bill, because our
businesses throughout the country do not understand how it will work in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000045">&#160;</a>

my colleagues. There are parts of the Bill that, from the overall look
at it, we would endorse, inasmuch as we in the federation believe in
localism, but large amounts still have to be clarified. Likewise, we
are very concerned about the lack of a single mention of the word
“business” in the whole Bill. It is business that drives
the economy, and that is nowhere more the case than for local small
businesses. They are the heart of all the localism that there
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000046">&#160;</a>

the importance of infrastructure and needing a robust planning system.
The Bill includes a duty to co-operate. Do you think that that duty is
sufficiently strong to bring about the level of strategic planning
needed for the growth that you have talked about? Will it be effective?

duty to co-operate will be enforced. We do not want it simply to be the
case that when politics gets involved, local authorities choose not to
co-operate. We want it to be a strong duty. We also take the view that,
unfortunately, a chance has been missed in the Bill to enable local
enterprise partnerships to be brought together with the duty to
co-operate, and potentially for them to have a role in enforcing it. We
understand that they are not on a statutory basis, but we would like
some consideration that local enterprise partnerships should either
have scrutiny of the duty to co-operate to ensure that a
larger-than-local element is brought back, or have recourse to the
Secretary of State on enforcing the duty to co-operate. At present, we
are being told that you can use judicial review to enforce it. Things
happen quickly in the business world, and if we have to wait for a
judicial review, businesses will simply invest
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000050">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Perhaps I can start with your second question.
On the extra layer of uncertainty, this is the CBI listening to our
members. Their response to the Localism Bill at first reading was not
good. Any changes to the planning process and system—the IPC has
been up and running only since last March—adds uncertainty,
particularly for the major infrastructure that provides energy security
and low-carbon energy at affordable prices for the UK, which we all
need and want. The signals in terms of business confidence are
negative. Therefore, we would defend any provisions in the Bill to
encourage development in favour of the public interest, such as with
energy security, and we would want to see them
enforced.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
on LEPs—these are not currently in the Localism Bill—our
approach, coming back to the main principles and positioning of the
CBI, is that businesses want to hear what local communities think. We
agree that there should be a robust system early on for local
communities to be consulted, but I come back to the point about
ensuring that there are not delays to the planning system.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000063">&#160;</a>

our members have only really just got round to understanding the
Planning Act 2008, and we are now starting again with the new Localism
Bill. With the IPC—something we very much supported—we
wanted the politics taken out of major decisions. With national policy
statements being debated on the Floor of the House, we see that you
have that democratic accountability in the system, but we are worried
about ministerial decisions now being brought back in. We are not
necessarily against that, but where NPSs are decided by the House and
the major infrastructure planning unit makes a decision but
the Minister goes against that recommendation—that would be
Government policy—we would want there to

recommendation, we would want them to make a statement to the House
that would be debated, or we would want the decision to be
scrutinised.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
your second question, we certainly feel that there should be a role for
LEPs. What we are worried about is that they become a talking shop. We
are already hearing from some of our members that high-level business
men who are involved in LEPs are worried about what exactly they are
there to do. LEPs are meant to set up a strategic vision. If they
cannot enforce the duty to co-operate, that would really raise the
question of what they can do.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000065">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I agree completely on the planning aspect,
but may I raise one other little point about the Bill? We think that
the Bill presents an opportunity to enshrine a power for local
authorities somehow to protect high streets—that comes with
planning, as well. The local high street is obviously very important to
local communities and small businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000066">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning to
the LEPs, I can only share my colleagues’ concern. We have been
heavily involved in setting up LEPs, but they vary enormously across
the country. The Government have asked that they be a 50:50 partnership
chaired by business, but we are finding that quite difficult to achieve
in some areas, with all due respect. The wider problem they face is
that they have no funding. It is not clear how they will pay for their
secretariat—they will need one—and things like that. It
is unfair—this seems to be the indication at the
moment—that the local authority, or even business, is expected
to pay for this. LEPs are a great idea, but there is a lot of work to
do if they are really to function
properly—<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000067">&#160;</a>

issue—certainly at the moment—is clarification on
neighbourhood plans. One question we get asked consistently is what a
neighbourhood is. We do not want the plans to become a mechanism for
anti-development, and we need urgent clarification of them. However,
neighbourhood plans also present opportunities for businesses on
business parks and industrial estates. Can businesses—again this
goes back to my theme of the lack of mention of the business voice
throughout the Bill—set up neighbourhood plans and therefore
neighbourhood development orders to allow growth on those business
parks and industrial estates to get around the planning systems? We
want to ensure that there is less bureaucracy. Planning is not an
impeder of growth but an enabler. Certainly there are opportunities
with neighbourhood development orders that are business led.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000070">&#160;</a>

echoing my colleague, but I agree with him absolutely. On the size of a
neighbourhood, if a developer comes in and says that he wants to build
3,000 houses, how many people do we have to consult to find out whether
or not that is agreeable in the neighbourhood? Three thousand is a lot
of houses as a population of more than 6,000 will occupy them. There is
a vision in the Bill that neighbourhoods mean quite small areas, but a
lot of developers are looking at big developments. That might be
accelerated—in fact it has already been slightly accelerated
with the abolition of strategic spatial strategies—because there
is a gap, and I know that developers have put in outline applications
for some very large developments, particularly on the
housing

of State the power to make a new small business relief scheme and that

a lot of nervousness about opening up the issue of uniform business
rates across the country. At the moment, businesses value the business
rate system because of the predictability, certainty and uniformity
that it offers them. Any stepping stone to relocalising business rates
implies extra costs for businesses in calculating what those varying
rates might be. A business with an operation in more than one locality
will have varying rates of business to contend with, and that will be
costly, too. Again, there is nervousness in terms of business
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000073">&#160;</a>

relief, we are certainly very happy about that, but the Bill does not
go far enough by suggesting that it is automatic. Small businesses are
not necessarily aware that they should apply for business rate relief.
It should be automatic to assist them, especially if we are

potential relocalisation of business rates, which the Bill does not go
so far as setting out, is certainly something that we are very
concerned about. There is predictability and certainty in business
rates at the moment. Businesses can plan over a four or five-year
period because the rates go with inflation. If that was to be taken
away, we would be very worried that businesses could effectively be
priced out of areas, or that they would choose to invest elsewhere
because one area’s rates were higher than another’s. We
would like to keep it
uniform.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000075">&#160;</a>

years, including by supporting a private Member’s Bill in the
previous Parliament. We would like to see a duty placed on local
authorities to review their rating list at least every five years,

the recession would be slow and that the new planning changes might add
one or two years to the length of time it would take to get back to the
2007 output of housing. In fact, he estimated, given the changes, that
it would probably be seven or eight years before housing output got
back to 2007 levels. Will you give us your view about what the impact
of that is likely to be, not just on the housing sector but on business
as a whole? Do you, to come back to Richard Lambert’s comments
earlier in the week, feel that this is an area where growth, or the

looking at construction more broadly, there are signs of nervousness in
the construction sector about being able to invest. Bearing in mind
that just under 40% of infrastructure investment is foreign-owned, we
are competing globally for a lot of investment in infrastructure. If we

concerns us, is that businesses are holding back because of
uncertainty. That is certainly happening with the housing market. In

because those involved were not entirely sure about what would happen.
Businesses need certainty, and to have a pro-growth agenda, we need to
be certain of where we can put our investments. At the present time, a

in the Bill. Let me be honest about it; it is sometimes quite difficult
for local authorities when there are empty properties. We have to bear
in the mind that local authorities do not own empty properties. The
empty properties are owned by property developers, who often have very
large companies and who may wish to do nothing. One of the pressures
that has come in, of course, is that the business rates on empty
properties will return to 2008 levels from April. There will be no
relief at the lower level, which will affect quite a lot of smaller
properties and may give impetus to their being let and
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000083">&#160;</a>

developments? With all due respect, the big boys have an army of
lawyers to try to push their cases forward, which makes it very
difficult. I know that steps have already been taken to try to slow
down these out-of-town developments, but they will always find areas.

                           </em> Adding to that, I want to go back to the
neighbourhood plans and our theme of a business voice. In protecting
local areas, localism needs to include businesses and, as I said at the
beginning, the way in which we read the Bill is that it refers to local
electors and that businesses are not included. When neighbourhood plans
are created, we want there to be a duty to consult businesses, to
ensure that they have a role in formulating the plans across local high
streets and, potentially, we want them to have a vote as well. The Bill
says “local electors,” but what about business rate
payers? I think that there is an element there for bringing businesses
in, or at least the duty to consult
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000085">&#160;</a>

could be used as an anti-development tool. One view is that assets such
as land that are put up for development could be given a sort of
village-green status, which has happened previously, especially around
Bristol. The moratorium could impact on the value of an asset that a
business owned, and it might make it difficult for the business to
dispose of or expand on that asset. At the present time, we need

looks partly to central Lancashire but also partly to Cumbria. The

                           </em> I think that what businesses need is that
certainty. What we have had is a haphazard approach to the planning of
major infrastructure. Certainly, we are very encouraged by the
Government’s national infrastructure plan, which will hopefully
be complete by the end of the year. That will certainly help businesses
know where to invest. Fundamentally, if we are looking for investment,
we need to know where public money is going to be spent. As I said, I
am very encouraged by that, but planning is hugely important,
especially above local level.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000110">&#160;</a>

a concern about: the community infrastructure levy. It is proposed in
the Bill that local authorities be given discretion over how they spend
that money. Up to now, it was really directed at infrastructure
projects. They might not have been very big, but they were
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000111">&#160;</a>

to housing. I find it quite interesting; I know there has been a
downturn in private sector housing in the last two or three years, but
we have to look at the view that we have had a very low output of
affordable housing. That is a big problem. I do not know what the
figures are, but without going back over the last decade, if you go
back and look at figures over the last 40 years, you suddenly see a big
drop in the number of house completions and planning completions in
those years. It is quite interesting that the private sector market,
until the last three years or so, went along at a fairly stable level.
When we had very high housing completions, the figure was made up of
what is now called affordable housing and was, in the far-off days,
council housing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000112">&#160;</a>

the need for business to have a voice. One suggestion that Mr Elliott
has put forward is that there should be business neighbourhood groups.
My sense from having been in business in the town in which I was a
councillor is that the relationship between the business sector and the
local authority tended to consist largely of paying rates and fearing a
visit from a compliance officer, such as for health and safety. If
business was really lucky, it was consulted on a budget that had
already largely been set. Now, hopefully, we have a few more points of
contact, but how do we accelerate the cultural change needed, so that
those points of contact are not still seen as boxes to tick by local
authority officers, and so that the business sector and the local
authority can have a meaningful relationship where that voice is
heard?<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000118">&#160;</a>

businesses are involved in neighbourhood planning and have a voice in
those structures, we would hope that they would engender that. We have
heard many times about how local authorities engage with businesses,
and four-hour meetings, where the agenda comes up after three hours,
will certainly not bring that about. Local authorities need to look
very much at how they engage with businesses. If businesses have that
voice, that vote and that duty to be consulted in neighbourhood
planning, we hope that things would
improve.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000119">&#160;</a>

further. I understand that business people are busy, but do you think
there would be an appetite for an ongoing engagement with local
authorities—a standing group, rather than an occasional group,
of business people and retired business people in the local authority
structure—so that there could be a continuous voice and a
meaningful relationship, rather than simply points of contact during
the year? With respect, most people who work in local authorities have
not worked in the business environment and vice versa. We need to break

their local authorities. To some extent, local authorities and business
do work together, but that has been unsung at times, because it has
been in areas like promoting sports and football clubs—I am
talking about the local, smaller clubs and things like that. Businesses
do take on a lot of duties and they do help, but that goes unsung to

                           </em> I agree completely. We must bear in mind
what sort of planning application we are looking at. Most people know
that there is the planning officer, but they never get involved and do
not know anything about it. It is only when something lands on our
doorstep that will affect our lives that we suddenly get interested.
There have been big housing developments in certain areas. I live in a
semi-rural area and that issue has had a huge impact. People have said,
“We will not have any houses built here,” but when you
look at the plan, it works out at 80 houses a year in a population of
40,000, which is really hardly noticeable. Likewise, locally, the
national gas grid wishes to build a very big plant in a rural area, and
that has raised huge opposition. In fact, the scheme went through two
appeals before it was approved. Most people, however, just lead their
lives and that is it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000136">&#160;</a>

comment that in the case of major infrastructure decisions, she would
want the Secretary of State’s time frame to be no more than
three months. In your experience, has any decision reserved by the
Secretary of State on a major infrastructure project been resolved
within that period of time? If not—I do not know of
any—is that to do with concern about the risk of judicial review
because of the scale of the schemes and the interests involved,
particularly if it involves a variation from the inspector’s
recommendation, rather than dilatoriness on the part of
Ministers?<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000139">&#160;</a>

is a concern. We certainly want a 12-month period for an application to
go through. We are hearing from members that a lot of the time that
should be within that 12-month period is being front-loaded into
pre-consultation. There is a concern that time limits will effectively
push forward a rejection. That is why I go back to what we suggested
earlier in terms of recourse: if the Minister does make a decision
against the recommendation, that Minister must explain the decision to
Parliament or have it scrutinised. We certainly stick to the fact that
where major infrastructure goes through, it should be in a 12-month
period, including the three-month ministerial
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000143">&#160;</a>

are very encouraged by that. We want to ensure that that area keeps
most of its structure, but at a local level this is still one of the
key areas for business that is a barrier to growth. As I said, we want
things in the Bill, such as neighbourhood development orders, that
could assist businesses by taking them out of the planning process, to
an extent. However, there is a concern that given what is being put on
local authority planners under the new legislation, especially at a
time when 27% of their budget is being cut, we are concerned about the
capacity to deliver. Although we see positives, we want to ensure that
this can work in the long run.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000149">&#160;</a>

One of the interesting things about the planning system we must
remember is that it is based on a 1948 Act, which was passed when the
world was very different. Well over 300 local authorities in England
were responsible for planning—many quite small—and the
world has moved on. For many individual local ones, things can be sped
up, but sometimes authorities have to deal with very big projects and
that takes time, so everything
slips.<a class="bkMark" name="11012758000151">&#160;</a>
