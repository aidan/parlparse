</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): As hon. Members will recall, I was expatiating on the 
wonders of the local government White Paper, which many people now agree marks a genuine move 
towards restoring a necessary partnership between central and local government with regard to their 
respective roles and the best way in which to provide the public with local government services. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the new power to cap local 
authorities that spend less than the SSA exemplifies this new partnership between central and local 
government? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is patient, he will find that that issue is dealt with in a 
subsequent amendment to which I may speak. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> So the hon. Gentleman does not have an answer. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> The issue is contained within the broader question of bringing that new partnership 
about from the position in which local government currently finds itself after a hard swing on the tiller 
towards centralism in the relationship between central and local government. I acknowledged earlier the 
necessity of statute to regulate central and local government relations, but the effect of 18 years of 
innumerable legislative provisions was to build a climate within local government of distrust, despair and 
a feeling that everything was run from the centre. The necessary relationships have thus become distorted 
over that long period. 
<P>
Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley): I find those words amazing. The swing of the tiller is very 
different from the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. One needs only to consider the reserve powers specified 
in the document this morning to recognise that the swing of the tiller is what will happen if the Bill is 
passed unamended. I accept that the hon. Gentleman wants some amendments&#151;I may be tempted 
to join him if he has the courage to put those amendments to a vote&#151;but the swing is quite the 
opposite of the one that he is trying to portray. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I understand the technical difficulties faced by Conservative Members attempting to 
redefine their position on local government in performing an 180 deg mid-air turn while suspended on the 
end of a rope. I sympathise with their problem, but it does not bear analysis to suggest that the 
Bill&#151;and the White Paper and the Government's concerns for local government&#151;somehow 
represent a further swing of the tiller towards centralism. 
<P>
That analysis is unsustainable because of the task that the Government face to bring about that new 
partnership after 18 years of Conservative legislation. Their difficulties could be likened to attempting to 
change the wheel on a car while it is still being driven along the road. The Government need to place 
legislation on the statute book that will allow local government to breathe and find its own identity once 
again, and to play a relevant and important role in the affairs of the nation at a local level. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Christine Butler </B>(Castle Point): Does my hon. Friend agree that the net effect of the Bill will be 
to decrease the Secretary of State's reserve powers, not increase them, as Opposition Members suggest? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Opposition Members take great delight in 
counting the Secretary of State's new powers, forgetting the powers that he will relinquish when the Bill is 
enacted. It would be a crude measure to tot them up, but it would show that, when the Bill is enacted, 
there will be far fewer powers of direct intervention&#151;power to the centre&#151;than there was 
before. 
<P>
Restoring the equilibrium between central and local government will be a long and difficult process, 
and the Government should ensure that that process works as well as possible, in their interests and those 
of local government. That is the key issue. It is understandable that certain reserve powers are held by the 
Government. The amendment poses the question whether the changes that the Bill makes to the 
relationship between local and central Government are an end in themselves or part of a process. If they 
are part of a process, a strong suggestion can be made that the relationship is under constant review. If a 
new relationship is in being, is it necesssary for the Government to keep the reserve powers, or should 
they be amended? 
<P>
The amendment proposes that the schedule shall cease to apply on 1 April 2005. That may be an 
arbitrary point, but the amendment was drafted to fit into the Bill. I want to know whether my analysis of 
the relationship, the end point and the way that the process will work, is endorsed by my hon. Friend the 
Minister, and, if so, whether she could say something about the reserve powers in the Bill. Ideally, reserve 
powers should not be used or, less ideally, should be used only when a local authority has departed 
flagrantly from what is in the interests of a good relationship between local and central Government and 
between the local authority and its people. I shall be interested, and probably reassured, to hear my hon. 
Friend describes how that relationship will work. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and what he wishes, and so does the 
Minister, but what he wishes is not in the Bill. There is no limit to the proposal; it is subjective and could 
be applied to any or no local authority. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> One of the worst things about being the leader of a local authority under the 
Conservative Administration was the atmosphere that pervaded any discussion of local government. The 
attitude of Ministers at those meetings was, ``We are going to tell you what to do, you will go away and do 
it.'' The Bill is about creating a climate in which to forge new ways of doing things. What is written in the 
text concerns a worst-case scenario. As local government comes out of the shadows of the way it has been 
treated for so long, I hope that most of the proposals will be regarded as a worst-case scenario and will not 
even be considered in the day-to-day dealings between central and local government. If that happens, 
there will truly be a new era, and my memory of the oppressive way in which central Government dealt 
with local government over the nightmare period in the middle to late 1980s will be erased. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): Clause 23 repeals the existing capping legislation and, not suprisingly, if 
that was all it did, Liberal Democrats would wholeheartedly support it. But crude and universal capping is 
to be replaced by what the Secretary of State has called ``Prescott's sophisticated and targeted capping''. 
[Interruption.] Yes, that is an interesting concept. This retains many of the features of the existing 
regime and adds some new powers to set different capping criteria for different categories of authority. 
<P>
We have a democracy in this country&#151;allegedly&#151;and in 2002, or before, there will be 
a general election. I cannot believe that the Government are so cast-iron certain that they will win that 
election that Labour Back Benchers are tabling an amendment to keep these reserve capping powers until 
2005 and that a Labour Secretary of State will carry on until then. Do they believe that these powers are 
the worst case scenario, and that it does not matter if they are in the Bill because they will not be used? 
<P>
What if there is a Tory Secretary of State in 2002? The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. 
Whitehead) has similar memories to me when I led a council of the way that the Tories treated local 
government. If there is a Tory Secretary of State, is the hon. Gentleman sure that he or she would not use 
those reserve powers? Would not it make much more sense for this Government to put into action its 
rhetoric during 18 years in opposition when Labour Members opposed capping powers and central 
Government interference in local authorities ability to set their own budgets? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Does the hon. Lady suggest that we should go back 
on our manifesto commitment to replace crude and universal capping and retain reserve powers? Does she 
suggest that we should break our promises? 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I do not think that every Labour party's manifesto commitment has been enacted. I 
will not stray too far from the Committee's business, but I could mention the freedom of information 
legislation. [Hon. Members: ``On its way.''] All sorts of things are on their way. We will have to hope that 
they arrive. Other measures have appeared, such as the draconian Immigration and Asylum Bill, which 
had its Second Reading last night. Many who read the Labour manifesto and voted Labour would not have 
been happy about that. But you will stop me, Mr. O'Brien, if I continue with a list&#151; 
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): The hon. Lady has dried up. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have not dried up at all. The list is of those areas where the Labour party has fallen 
far short of the promises that it made before it got into government. 
<P>
Liberal Democrats are absolutely opposed to capping. I had understood that Labour Members were 
also opposed to it: they certainly made loud noises to that effect in opposition. If the reserve powers of 
capping are to be retained, they should be spelled out in the Bill and not left to the whims of the Secretary 
of State. Whether or not one accepts that a Labour Secretary of State is bound to be benign, it could well 
be me and there is no reason to suspect that I would be any more benign than a Labour or Conservative 
Secretary of State. 
<P>
As we have heard already in Committee, the process of power corrupts everyone. We are living in a 
topsyturvy world where Conservative Members have suddenly decided that there should be no interference 
in local government finance and are now opposed to capping, having had years of practice of putting it 
into place. Labour Members are suddenly in favour of reserve powers for capping because they do not trust 
Labour councils to stay within what they consider to be reasonable guidelines on spending. It is not just 
that they do not trust their own councils, they do not trust local people either. 
<P>
The amendment seeks to retain those powers till 2005 on the spurious grounds put forward by the 
hon. Member for Castle Point (Mrs. Butler) that modernisation would be working well by then. The hon. 
Lady would not let me intervene on her and I wanted to ask for her definition of ``working well''. Local 
government in Britain is far ahead of where the Government think it is. It is time that people in 
Government and in the civil service got out and saw what is happening in local authorities. We can all 
pick on Doncaster, Westminster or wherever&#151;the small number of instances where things have 
gone wrong. Hundreds of councils have been consulting local people by, for example, holding 
referendums on their budget priorities or council tax increases. They are doing all that is in the Bill, and 
are well ahead of where the Government think they are. The Government still distrust them almost as 
much as the Tory Government did.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I appreciate that, as a Liberal Democrat, the hon. Lady has the 
luxury of being able to pontificate, as she has been doing, but will she tell hon. Members the Liberal 
Democrat view? Does the hon. Lady believe that the Government need to retain any reserve powers? 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Our view is that local government should have constitutional independence from 
central Government. We have discussed that in Committee before. I understand that Labour Members 
disagree and view local government's role as subservient to central Government. 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> That is what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said previously. He did not 
accept my definition&#151; 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way? 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall give way in a moment, when I have finished my sentence. He did not accept 
my view of how people in local government and Labour party members traditionally perceived the 
relationship of central Government and local government. If he wants to say that I am wrong, he is 
welcome. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> What I recall is that I attempted to define the present statutory position of local 
government, and said that to change that fundamentally one would have to rewrite the constitution of 
Great Britain completely and introduce a constitution that separated various levels of power. I challenged 
the hon. Lady to explain how that would be done and what it would mean, but as far as I can understand, 
her party has not spelt the matter out. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> About four years ago my party produced a model written constitution which set out 
the relationship between the Government, a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly, regional government 
and local government. If the hon. Gentleman is interested, I shall make sure that he receives a copy. It 
would be rather nice if the Labour party chose to steal and implement one of our policies. 
<P>
As to the question of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas), we are opposed to capping. 
We do not see that the Government should tell local government and its electors what local authority 
budgets should be set. We are also in favour, as I have said many times, of a proportional voting system in 
local elections. That would give local electors far more power to influence the people they placed in local 
government office. In the context of a PR system for local government, where accountability of the elected 
to the electors is much better, we believe that freedom could be given to local government to set its own 
budgets. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> We have just heard the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) in the 
Chamber explain the Liberal Democrats' commitment to adopting the single currency immediately. How 
can the hon. Lady's position be consistent with the need to maintain the convergence criteria for monetary 
union&#151; 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) need not answer that. We are 
straying from the amendment and I ask hon. Members to return to the business. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I was about to say that I am not responsible for my party 
leader, and he probably denies responsibility for me. I am glad that I do not need to answer, but in any 
case I do not see a contradiction between being in favour of close integration with Europe and greater 
powers for local government. 
<P>
When I was a member of Somerset county council and caps were repeatedly imposed, Conservative 
councillors used to say that they did not know why the Tory Secretary of State did not do away with 
capping, because that would put much greater pressure on elected members to decide their priorities, and 
we could no longer get away with saying that the cuts were not ours, but the Tories', or that it was not us, 
but the Tory Secretary of State, who was setting the budget and deciding by how much the council tax 
should rise. 
<P>
That is a strong reason for the Goverment to stop interfering in council budgeting. It would restore 
the link between the electors and the elected. There would be accountability. Continued capping will keep 
the public confused about who is to blame for budget cuts or council tax increases. It also undermines 
local democracy. 
<P>
We will not oppose amendment No. 195. I hope that the Labour Members who were brave enough to 
table it will have the courage of their convictions and press it to a vote. We oppose capping altogether. 
However, amendment No. 195 would at least put an end date on the Secretary of State's reserve powers, 
albeit later than we should like. 
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> We have had an 
interesting debate. Under pressure from my hon. Friends, the hon. Member for Taunton gave the game 
away. She made it clear that Liberal Democrats would not give untrammelled power to local government 
until the modernisation programme that they support was put through. Now we know where the hon. Lady 
stands. 
<P>
We had an interesting debate this morning. Having discussed the amendment with me, my hon. 
Friend the Member for Southampton, Test, made his point most effectively. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) intervened, but I was not sure whether he was 
speaking tongue-in-cheek. He may not have told us about the lobotomy that excised all his memory. 
<P>
My hon. Friends might be interested to learn what the right hon. Member for Richmond, York (Mr. 
Hague) said about capping this weekend. Unfortunately, they have not had an opportunity to consider 
those remarks, as they were not reported in the press. 
<P>
The Conservative Leader spoke about tackling the thorny issue of capping. He said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Conservatives must look at how we can achieve more independence and accountability for local 
authorities, with all the difficult choices that involves, so that we are able to abolish central controls on 
local government like capping.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I suppose that is a step forward from what Conservatives did in government. However, it is not a 
very big step. At least it acknowledges difficult choices and responsibilities. 
<P>
The present Government have confronted those choices and responsibilities and have kept their 
manifesto commitment. Last week, the hon. Member for Taunton told the Committee that I was pathetic 
for going back to manifesto commitments. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I did not say ``pathetic''. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Lady may not have used that word, but she implied that I was pathetic. She 
seemed be querying the point of going back to manifesto commitments. She seemed to be asking what on 
earth manifesto commitments mean, and why they are being dragged in. 
<P>
Manifesto commitments mean something to me. Opposition Members may have forgotten what we 
said at the election, so I will remind them. In the manifesto, we said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although crude and universal council tax capping should go, we will retain reserve powers to 
control excessive council tax rises.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
When I fought the election, I faced the electorate on that promise. I am not reneging on it now. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Which part of the Labour manifesto promises that a Labour Government will 
introduce council tax benefit capping? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are introducing council tax benefit subsidy limitation. I do not see that as council 
tax capping. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> But that was not in the manifesto. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, it was not. However, the Government are doing several things that go beyond 
manifesto commitments. At the same time, we are ensuring that we keep all of the 167 commitments that 
we made in the manifesto. The measure is one of those commitments. 
<P>
The Bill is full square with the manifesto, and I am not at all ashamed of it. Indeed, I remind the 
hon. Lady that a Labour party policy statement including the plan was passed unanimously at conference 
in 1994. This is a Government who deliver on their promises, which were not suddenly made at the 
general election. 
<P>
I have enjoyed the debate so far and am looking forward to the debate on the schedule. I appreciate 
my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test aspiring to the Government's not having to use reserve 
powers by 2005: indeed, I share his aspiration. The Government, in partnership with local government, 
are, as my hon. Friend said, putting in place an ambitious programme for modernising local government. 
Best value, which we have debated at length, is a key part of the programme. We hope that by 2005 other 
aspects of the reform agenda for local government, such as new political management structures, 
improvements in local democracy and a new ethical framework, will be fully in place. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Can the hon. Lady explain how a secret Cabinet Committee of one party, which is 
one of the new management structures that her party is putting forward, will help councils to set a lower 
council tax, so that they will not need to be capped? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I fear that I may stray out of order if I answer the hon. Lady's question. I say only 
that other people in her party do not hold that view, but she will have the opportunity in Committee to 
scrutinise that idea before the Bill comes to the House as a full Bill. A draft Bill will be presented which 
we shall ask a Committee of both Houses of Parliament to examine prior to its introduction as legislation 
on Second Reading. I hope that the hon. Lady and her colleagues will enter into that debate in a spirit that 
demonstrates their interest in finding new ways of making local government effective and of engaging its 
citizens' interest. If she does, she may listen much more openly to the arguments of my party&#151;and 
those of her own party, which is now trying out some of these ideas at local level. 
<P>
Taken together, the reforms will bring about a fundamental change in local government, improving 
and modernising it and ensuring that local people feel that it is working with them and for them. I have a 
feeling that that is not how many people respond to local government at the moment. 
<P>
The other side of the modernisation agenda is the improving of local financial accountability. The 
Government want local authorities to take full responsibility for their decisions on spending and taxation, 
and for local people to have greater influence over decision making. We hope that these 
changes&#151;improving best value and local democracy, and so on&#151;will achieve that, and that 
we shall therefore not have to use reserve powers to limit council taxes and precepts. 
<P>
However, it is important that we retain the reserve powers. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, 
West made a significant point when he intervened on the hon. Member for Taunton. We have said 
consistently that we do not run away from the fact that there is a national interest which&#151;in terms 
of this country ever being ready to adopt the euro and make those changes&#151;is the amount of its 
debt. The amount of a country's public borrowing is one of the Maastricht criteria: it is an aspect of the 
national interest, which is very important.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> The Minister has introduced a new note into the debate. I 
know that you will pay particular attention to it, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, I am watching very carefully. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Currey:</B> The Minister claims that there is a national interest. She also says that she will consider 
whether a council's actions seem to be sanctioned by the electorate, and thus have democratic legitimacy. 
Would the Government ever cap a council that had fixed a council tax after consultation with its 
electorate? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows that we cannot currently take that into account. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins rose&#151; </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will calm himself, I stress that that applies to the present, and 
to existing legislation. No one should be under any illusion that I am talking about the future, rather than 
the current year. 
<P>
In future, we shall take such matters into account. We shall ascertain which questions were asked 
and the way in which they were asked. The right hon. Gentleman may know that Milton Keynes council 
has consulted its electorate this year. The turnouts for the referendum on setting the council tax was 20 
per cent. higher than that for the previous local elections. We cannot legally take that into account this 
year. However, in future, we shall have to consider it. That does not mean that we will agree with every 
result. If a council asked a biased question, and the turnout was only 10 per cent., the result would not 
have the legitimacy of a vote on an independently asked question, for which there was a higher turnout. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> But it is possible for a council to ask an honourable, honest and straightforward question 
to which it receives an honest answer. However, the wishes of the local people, as expressed in the answer, 
might not be in the national interest. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Of course I accept that&#151;it is in the nature of democracy. Those problems 
have to be debated at the time. We shall not run away from that because it is up to the Government to try 
to win support for their perception of the national interest. 
<P>
That has been the case in the past, and will continue to be so in future. We shall not be able simply 
to take a neutral position. We shall have to explain our perception of the national interest. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am intrigued by the explanation, which contains so many ``ifs'', ``ands'' and 
``buts''. If the Minister can influence a decision on whether a local authority's actions are in the national 
interest, will she or the Secretary of State make a statement to the House to enable us to debate and 
question the decision? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is clear that the procedures of the House will remain as they are. If a Secretary of 
State decides to cap an authority, the decision will be put to the House. Such a decision will be made in 
the normal way. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Mole Valley intervened because he will be 
interested in a particular council, which he knows. Its actions show why all the modernisation procedures 
should be in place. That council does not have annual elections. Last year, there was an election, and the 
council reduced the council tax by some 30 per cent. There are no elections for another three years, and 
the council is considering increasing the council tax by 40 per cent. How does that council display 
responsibility? How does it care for council tax payers? It uses a blatant electoral ploy. At the moment, all 
we can do is identify the sort of behaviour in which it indulges. It is not responsible behaviour by a 
democratic body. It has made its decision knowing that it does not have to face the electorate this year. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> So the Minister would doubtless welcome Westminster's bid to set the lowest council tax 
in the country. Can we assume that Westminster is now thoroughly rehabilitated in the Government's 
affection? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot mention Westminster because of 
court proceedings outside this place, and he will not tempt me down that road. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I would be interested to know whether the Government, having increased several 
taxes while in office, are promising a sudden dramatic decrease in taxation during the year in which they 
face the electorate. 
<P>
I want to return to the issue of local government finance and the national debt. The Minister prayed 
in aid the fact that we might join the euro, so that local government finance might need to be taken into 
account. Does she accept that we do not have to measure the public sector borrowing requirement in this 
country as we do, and that most European countries do not count local government debt as part of the 
national debt? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Lady wants so many conditions laid down before we can proceed that she 
continually undermines her argument. We have what we have. The public sector borrowing requirement 
has already shifted. It is not purely in the hands of Governments to change, but depends on how other 
financial interests see and understand the national debt. Our determination is to be responsible with 
national finances, so we will always seek a balance. We will also be honest about the national interest and 
the best way to deal with it. 
<P>
Therefore, because of our recognition of the national interest, it is important for us to retain these 
powers. While we hope and expect that all local authorities will be responsible and prudent, we cannot be 
complacent towards the provision of good services at prices that council tax payers are prepared to pay. 
Certain councils are letting us know that in no uncertain terms. The Government have a responsibility to 
local council tax payers to retain reserve powers to protect them, if necessary&#151;as we promised in 
our manifesto. 
<P>
I repeat that we hope that those powers will be used rarely, if at all. If our modernisation programme 
receives the time and support of the House, the future for local government finance&#151;and the 
partnership between local and central finance&#151;will be secure and a future Government may not 
need to use those powers. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Butler:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Briefly, we want to focus most of the time available for debate on schedule 1 and its 
amendments. However, I want to make it clear that we oppose clause 23 in principle, and that we will vote 
against it as one of our major objections to the Bill. 
<P>
I should like to set out briefly how we should conduct the remainder of our debate. We have just 
discussed a useful amendment exchanging party political points. Now that is behind us I hope that we can 
debate the real issues. However, to make a party political point, this is not the Labour party's finest hour. 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Or the Tories'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Nor indeed was our supervision of local government. I am sure that both my colleagues 
who served as Ministers in the Department, trying to supervise local government, realise that it was not 
the greatest policy success of the Conservative Administration. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Does that translate into an apology? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to make this a pathetic party political exchange I feel rather 
sad for him. Given his position with regard to the Local Government Association, I should have expected 
him to treat the matter as seriously as he pretended to a few minutes ago. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am not given to apologies, as I am about to demonstrate. I agree with my hon. Friend 
that capping had immense disadvantages. The main disadvantage is political: the Government never win 
the argument whoever they are. If the Minister gets to the stage of capping, she will discover that. I would 
therefore be amazed if the Government capped a single authority this year despite the fact that a number 
of authorities will be between two and three times above the notional level that the Government have 
suggested council tax should rise. 
<P>
The development of the role of local government, particularly the development of the enabling 
function, the way services develop, the bringing in of private sector partners, is essential and I am 
delighted that the Government are continuing that evolutionary trend. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend and I would not dream of apologising on his 
behalf. I want him to be assured of that. But let us all agree&#151;this is a complex and unhappy 
business for the relationship between central and local government. We should all want to improve it. 
[Interruption] I am disappointed by Labour Members who are treating this matter with levity. Local 
authorities like Derbyshire and Somerset which have already been capped by the Government are not 
happy. 
<P>
Before the election, we capped openly and, we would say, fairly although Labour Members would 
naturally say, unfairly. They opposed it in principle and were vociferous in that opposition. They were 
joined by the Liberal Democrats. The tables are now turned. The Labour Government are now, some 
would say, intensifying the capping powers available to the Secretary of State. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Plaskitt </B>(Warwick and Leamington): Rubbish. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What is the reality of the powers that the clause gives the Secretary of State? It is that 
the Secretary of State can cap pretty well any authority he or she likes on any pretext yet to be determined. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I draw attention to the ruling made by the Chairman this morning? If 
hon. Members wish to debate clause stand part, schedule 1 will not be debated. It is entirely up to the 
Committee. I allowed the statement to be made because I understand that the hon. Member wanted to 
object to clause 23, but if the debate continues I must reiterate the point made this morning.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not giving way to the hon. Lady.

is about a new version of capping benefits.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not made up his mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We share some of this with the Liberal Democrats in the intelligent way that I invite the 
hon. Lady to look at this. The adversarial relationship between central and local government should not be 
necessary. [Interruption.] The hon. Lady laughs, but she agrees. I am merely using this occasion to 
plead with the Committee to conduct the debates on the powers in the schedule and the schedule stand 
part on a realistic basis. 
<P>
The Minister's opposition to capping for the past 18 years has been rather exposed by the position 
she now adopts. To persuade the Labour party conference to sign up to the abolition of crude and 
universal capping created the impression that the Government were against capping. Yet now we find that 
the words ``crude and universal'' did not describe capping, they were a qualification of the Labour Party's 
commitment. The Government are not abolishing capping per se, but what they consider to be the crude 
and universal part of it.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am glad to have got under the Minister's skin. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton asked whether the amounts raised by small local authorities should 
figure as public expenditure at all, but there is vast expenditure in local authorities around the world that 
is not included in the accounts of national governments. The hon. Lady's point about Maastricht is 
irrelevant. If she wants to discredit monetary union even more quickly than the Government she should 
carry on in that vein; I shall be delighted. Let us have a proper and mature debate about schedule 1 and 
the amendment; in the meantime, I shall oppose clause 23.

</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 209, in page 18, leave out lines 1 and 2. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> In the previous debate, it was said that the Bill would remove univeral capping, 
but instead it will impose central controlling, an appalling form of capping. The amendments aim to 
persuade the Governmemt slightly to alleviate their heavy handed and subjective imposition on local 
authorities in the name of reserve powers. 
<P>
Amendment No. 206 wants the Government to recognise that there are low-tax authorities. One that 
lifted its council tax rapidly in one year is still the second lowest in the country and the second lowest in 
its group. That is in spite of that local authority, which was mentioned earlier, having been clobbered in 
respect of its standard spending assessment and revenue support grant. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman remember a time when that authority was given the level 
of increase that it was given this year? Indeed, does he remember a time when it got the average that other 
London authorities were given without excessive input from a Government trying to protect it? 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I will address the hon. Lady's second point. The previous Government, of course, 
did not do that. I remember being leader of that council when it was clobbered time after time: one year, 
there was a 24 per cent. reduction. Of course, the saving grace for that local authority and, indeed for 
much of London, was the Government rethink on the special grant. I understand that that matter is to be 
debated tomorrow. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What is striking about the unmentionable local authority&#151; 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Unmentioned, not unmentionable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is right to correct me. 
<P>
The way that the Labour party carried on in opposition gave the impression that money was lavished 
on that authority. The Labour Government have allowed that authority to keep much of the grant that it 
received when the Conservatives were in office, which suggests that our allocation of money was perfectly 
fair. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Occasionally, we meander away from the scene. My right hon. Friend the 
Member for Skipton and Ripon has filled his pen, so I shall proceed. 
<P>
Amendment No. 206 would require the Government&#151;who have demonstrated a subjective 
approach throughout the Bill, and especially in schedule 1&#151;to be sufficiently fair and recognise 
that some local authorities have managed to provide quality services, very often top quality services, while 
keeping their council tax down. That is best value by any definition. 
<P>
The Bill does nothing to protect those authorities, which, like all local authorities, have no incentive 
to keep their council tax down. I am not referring to increases, but the overall period of council tax. 
Amendment No. 206 aims to bring that message home and ensure that classes of local authorities are 
recognised. Those that are facing similar problems and conditions should be classed together. 
<P>
Amendment No. 208 would prevent the measure from being subjectively applied&#151;or not 
applied&#151;to individual authorities. It would also recognise that most authorities&#151;with the 
exception of the Greater London Authority, for the moment&#151;are in a class of authorities. 
<P>
The schedule is subjective, so an individual local authority may be selected for capping. Any one of 
four powers may be applied to such authorities. Equally, a local authority may be capped while a 
neighbouring authority&#151;in the same class, under the same conditions, producing the same figures 
and the same service&#151;may not be. The failure to cap in such conditions may be more intriguing, 
and may cause greater concern to local government as a whole. 
<P>
Amendment No. 209 addresses the crunches referred to by Liberal Democrat Members. We touched 
on those crunches on Second Reading. Schedule 1 states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In determining categories of authorities for the year under consideration the Secretary of State 
shall take into account any information that he thinks is relevant.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It is an unfortunate mistake that ``categories'' has been used instead of ``classes''; it is also unfair on 
local government. 
<P>
We may hear placating arguments that certain types of action will not be taken. Liberal Democrats 
will probably remind us that a Conservative Secretary of State may apply the measure. However, the 
schedule's wording is so open that it would be possible for the Seceretary of State to deem that any local 
authority with a name beginning with ``W'' and ending with ``th'' would be capped on those grounds 
alone. That is technically possible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): Does the hon, Gentleman agree that the real danger is that any criteria 
that one wished could be found on which to benefit or disbenefit authorities with shared characteristics, 
that just happened to have the same political leadership? 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I only half agree. The hon. Gentleman's intervention points out another 
difficulty, which is that under the Bill the Secretary of State need not deal with a class of authority. He or 
she could pick just one authority. That is why I chose the ludicrous example&#151;it had better be 
ludicrous&#151;that I did. 
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one of the most 
ludicrous of all criteria for determining capping and spending levels was that of single hotel nights? In 
comparison, the provisions in the Bill for the Secretary of State to make public the relevant criteria 
amount to a much fairer and more transparent system. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Lady should look further than just Westminster because several 
authorities, such as those on the coast, benefited in that way. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Chester, York, Harrogate.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Yes, Chester, York, Brighton and similar places. 
<P>
The hon. Lady ought also to have noticed, if she picked up the paper that was distributed this 
morning, that it states, as item (i) of the four powers that the Secretary of State 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may designate the authority in-year (as is currently the sole option)''.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If the Secretary of State wished to, he would be able to say, ``You have so many hotels, so the streets 
are a bit messier, therefore I shall or shall not designate you.'' It could depend on how he felt after 
breakfast. The point has been reached where there is excessive potential for a subjective approach. 
<P>
In discussing clause 23 and amendment No. 195, which, surprise surprise, was withdrawn, hon. 
Members said that it would improve local government and remove centralising powers. That is patently 
untrue. One has only to look, not even at the schedule itself but at the explanation of it, to see how 
arbitrarily dictatorial it is. ``Prescott's subjective capping'' is what we have been given as a proposal, 
starting from 2000. The measure establishes powers way beyond anything that I would ever have 
imagined. Having been an Environment Minister in the mid and late 1990s I understand why the 
Minister, given the present state and form of local government finance, needs some reserve 
powers&#151;but not the ones proposed. They are way over the top. The opportunity that they present 
for a subjective approach to be taken by any Secretary of State&#151;not necessarily the present 
one&#151;allowing pork barrel politics, is obvious. I hope that this matter will be given serious 
consideration, and that even if the wording of the amendments is not quite correct, it will be accepted that 
local authorities are deeply concerned. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley about schedule 1 
in general and the amendments. In particular, amendment No. 206 seems to have a very reasonable aim 
with respect to factors that would make a council designable&#151;[Interruption.] Perhaps I mean 
designatable. I shall leave that to the Hansard editors. 
<P>
Such a local authority would not be designatable if its band D council tax is less than the average for 
authorities in the same class. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
That seems reasonable. As the White Paper makes clear&#151;I would like to find the reference, 
but I cannot&#151;capping is ultimately about limiting excessive council taxes. Local people need 
protection from excessive taxes rather than from increases as such. The Minister must have many 
interesting discussions with the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) about the use of 
public opinion in establishing the credibility or popularity of a particular budget. She will have to take 
into account what proportion of those who may be consulted as electors actually bear the burden of the tax. 
<P>
If the tax is already low, what is the case for capping? A high tax could be supported by many people 
who do not pay it because of personal circumstances&#151;they may be protected from paying it because 
they are on benefit or because they are not householders. One of the effects of returning to the council tax 
was to place the burden on householders rather than individuals. 
<P>
If there is a large disparity, the Minister will have to ignore a particular expression of public opinion 
and take the national interest into account, as she said. However, how can it be justifiable to use these 
extraordinarily draconian and selective powers against a low-spending authority? That applies to the 
authority mentioned by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. I hope that we shall hear more 
from him about that. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I believe that I have found the reference in the White Paper that the hon. Gentleman 
sought. It is in paragraph 5.12, which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the reserve power were to be used, the main intention would be to limit excessive council tax 
rises.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is what I am questioning. I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is no 
case, in principle, for capping a local authority whose spending is below the SSA. The schedule 
reproduces one of the features of the White Paper. Paragraph 5.11 mentions reserve powers: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``to require councils to reduce their budget requirement to below that in previous years or below 
their Standard Spending Assessment.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Yet the Minister has provided no justification for why that power should be necessary. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister talks about excessive or large increases, but she has used 
percentage increases in her examples. A high percentage increase of a low council tax may still be a small 
rise overall. Consequently, the Minister's favourite local authority in London still has the second lowest 
council tax&#151;if the Minister is right and if the rises notified in the newspapers, which I believe are 
incorrect, actually took place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It has been drawn to my attention that a large increase in a low-spending authority still 
impacts on the rate of inflation. However, if that is so, something must be wrong with the inflation 
calculation, which should take into account the weighted average of council tax increases. The national 
percentage increase in council tax is the volume of tax increases in absolute terms as compared with the 
previous year. That, and not big increases in authorities that are already spending small sums, is what 
impacts on the retail price index. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. The inflation is for the person paying the 
council taxes. Regardless of what a person starts at, having to provide a big rise in one year impacts on his 
purse and his ability to manage his finances. The White Paper makes it clear that we have a responsibility 
to take an interest in that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are moving into interesting territory. The Minister made it clear that the whole basis 
and necessity for the powers was the national interest, in, for example, observance of the Maastricht 
criteria. We found ourselves in the same sort of trap because the Government get it in the neck when 
council taxes rise. The Government are exercising here their prerogative to limit an unpopular increase by 
a local authority, not for national macroeconomic reasons but because they feel that they have a duty and 
obligation as a democratically elected authority to limit the expenditure of another democratically elected 
authority. That has nothing to do with the national interest, it is politics. The Minister's waffle about the 
national interest has just been exposed. 
<P>
That is the nub of the true issue with council tax capping. We live in a unitary state where people 
feel entitled to the same level of service for the same amount of council tax wherever they live. Take, for 
example, education. We do not allow children in different parts of the country to be disadvantaged by 
where they live. We expect to deliver high quality education throughout the country, and our voters expect 
it. At the same time, because we have the area cost adjustment, we do not expect the higher cost of 
providing council services in some areas than in others to be reflected in council tax. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Following that logic, is the hon. Gentleman saying, for example, that Buckinghamshire's 
selective education system, which costs the taxpayer there more, should be scrapped in favour of a 
comprehensive system&#151;in the national interest, and in the interests of efficiency and quality 
education across the land? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> You will be pleased, Mr. O'Brien, to hear that I will not get drawn into that. I am happy 
to debate the merits or otherwise of selective education. The two selective schools in my constituency have 
a beneficial effect on education in the area generally, which is why we have some of the top schools in the 
country, among them comprehensive schools and grammar schools. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman tried deliberately to obscure the real point that I made, which is that people 
throughout the country expect the same basic standard of service at the same basic cost. The Government 
now have a constitutional locus across local authority finance, which is to level the playing field for the 
voter. When things begin to get out of kilter, and the pressure turns on local authorities, the blame is put 
first and foremost on the Government. Local electors hardly bother to vote in local elections. Turnouts are 
low&#151;under the Government they are even lower than they were for the Conservatives; I can make 
a party political point about that&#151;but when local authorities go wrong the finger is pointed at 
Government and the political fallout finishes up in the Secretary of State's Red Box and in the House of 
Commons. Our debates about, for example, sparsity allowances, about the &#163;100 million withdrawn 
from county councils and regions that were previously urban areas, and about how much was given to 
Wandsworth council by the previous Government, are all arguments about national political issues. In the 
long term, we have to find a way of trying to&#151; 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Mediate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We must try to find a way of transferring responsibility downward, to reduce the need 
for Government mediation. The Bill says nothing about that. On the contrary, the Government make 
themselves yet more responsible for the quality of local authority services through establishing 
performance standards and the best value process. 
<P>
Amendment No. 208 would replace subsection (5) of proposed section 52B of the Local Government 
Finance Act 1992 with: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any principles determined for the year must be such that the same set is determined for all 
authorities (if more than one) billing within the same class.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That should not be too much to ask. If we are to have a mediation process, it should treat all 
authorities in the same way. The Minister admitted that the Government respond to political pressures. 
Even if small, low-spending authorities, apply only minor pressures, the Government should not use the 
powers in the schedule to respond to them on a selective, arbitrary basis.

<P>

<B>Ms Keeble:</B> One of Conservatives Members' arguments for retaining compulsory competitive 
tendering was that, even if a council provided reasonably cheap services, it did not necessarily provide the 
best possible value, and that, therefore, councils should be considered individually. The hon. Gentleman 
now argues the opposite: that councils and council taxes should be considered in groups and that we 
should not consider best value on an individual basis. What is his genuine view? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady is floundering, and makes a rather poor point. The central point is that 
the party that she supported, and believed would abolish crude, universal capping, may do away with the 
fairness in that system. It is ironic that the more open handed and level a system, the more quirky it may 
appear in some circumstances. It is being replaced with an entirely selective system, which will operate at 
the behest of the Secretary of State. It is surprising that the hon. Member for Northampton, North, who 
has a track record in local government and is committed to it, is willing to go along with such a system, 
and makes silly, irrelevant points. 
<P>
Amendment No. 209 would omit one of the most pernicious aspects of the arrangement for which 
the schedule provides. Proposed subsection 52B(7) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining categories of authorities for the year under consideration the Secretary of State 
shall take into account any information he thinks is relevant.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is a pretty blank cheque for the Secretary of State. If there is a judicial review, and a Labour 
Member supports a local authority's challenge to the vires of a capping decision by the Secretary of 
State&#151;perhaps a Conservative Secretary of State&#151;that Secretary of State can, in law, use 
any information in his defence as long as he can prove that it is rational and reasonable. I look at the hon. 
Member for Clwyd, West, who is a lawyer, when I say that. In the Minister's opinion, what sort of 
information should be specified? Is she prepared to give examples of information that the Secretary of 
State will take into account? 
<P>
Before we pass over subsection (7), the least the Minister can do is explain its purpose and the reason 
for its inclusion in the Bill. Surely the preceding subsections of proposed section 52B provide sufficient 
grounds for the Government to decide whether local authorities should be capped. The catch-all provision 
of subsection (7) gives further discretion to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can pluck reasons 
out of the air, relevant to that authority, for picking on it to the exclusion of other authorities.

</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> May I reiterate that the other more concerning thing is that the Secretary of State 
may choose to pick on one local authority but a similar authority, that may differ only in its political 
make-up, could be ignored and not capped. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Whereas the motive might be party political, by 
having such a catch-all phrase, the legal pretext given in the intervention would be wide. Any factor 
relevant to the inimical local authority, as opposed to the friendly one, would be available to the Secretary 
of State as a legal pretext for intervention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): While my hon. Friend is on that point, would he agree that 
the capricious powers that the clause endows, are particularly dangerous when one considers the National 
Assembly for Wales? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was not in Welsh mode at that point. I hope that my hon. Friend will illuminate the 
Committee on that later. The powers exercised by the Secretary of State will be exercised by the Welsh 
Assembly. Though it is a Crown body and will be acting in this quasi-judicial capacity, in loco Secretary 
of State, so to speak, it is a political body. Capping powers will be exercised by vote in the authority. The 
political complexion of its decisions will be that much more transparent. That may be an Achilles heel in 
the Bill. 
<P>
Whereas the Secretary of State will be advised on his capping powers by the Department's solicitors 
and ultimately the Attorney-General and schooled by the eminent civil servants so that he may not make 
political mistakes, in some rash political outburst the Welsh Assembly might well make a decision that is 
subject to adjudication by the courts and able to be overturned by the courts. But I will let my hon. Friend 
explore that later. 
<P>
The dangers in the schedule are evident. Our proposals for ameliorating the effects of the schedule 
are perfectly reasonable. There is one amendment that I have not addressed and I am waiting to see 
whether one of the Labour Members in whose name it stands, will raise the issue so that we can discuss it 
as well. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 197. Its purpose is quite apparent. I am 
however reminded of the palaver that surrounded the allegedly carefully organised capping regime under 
the previous Government. As far as I can see, each year the Government looked carefully at who was 
likely to come up for capping, worked out a regime to catch those and not others who might objectively 
have been in the same position but were of a different colour, and declared the rules. 
<P>
Caught up in that charade were the arbitrary swings in the SSA methodology whereby local 
authorities that were apparently relatively good boys and girls one year, could be bad in another year 
without doing anything significantly different. The Government are determined to have a good look at 
that, among other things, during the three year moratorium on SSA formulation. That is upcoming. The 
difficulty of producing up-front rules when methodology changes as it does, should be apparent to all. 
Therefore, in the process by which capping takes place&#151;in the rare circumstances in which it is 
necessary&#151;stating that there will not be such behaviour again is a wise move and a good step 
forward. 
<P>
The amendment, however, would include in the Bill some suggestions about the circumstances in 
which local authorities may consider that the Secretary of State may not be minded to act. That is set out 
in the second part of the amendment, which includes considerations such as whether the local authority 
has a positive record in delivering best value, whether the local electorate supports the proposed 
budget&#151;there was support in Milton Keynes for a level of council tax between the lowest option 
and the highest option; it was not below its spending budget&#151;and whether the local authority had 
attained beacon status. 
<P>
The amendment proposes that the Secretary of State may take into account other factors. It does not 
set in stone a particular series of criteria&#151; 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> On a point of curiosity, the hon. Gentleman mentioned beacon status. There is 
not a beacon anything at present, so it cannot be in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point in principle. We are not discussing whether or 
not beacon status is awarded to local authorities. However, it is difficult to devise a series of criteria which 
does not take into account what is currently under substantive discussion in local government. However, I 
tabled the amendment as I felt that it was necessary to engender such a debate in Committee, but I take 
the hon. Gentleman's point. 
<P>
It might be a good idea for the Bill to include indications of how local authorities might weigh all 
those factors in considering their SSAs, their spending and their overall performance and what, therefore, 
the Secretary of State might determine. That may be a way forward. It may be accomplished by protocol or 
by discussions with the LGA about the circumstances which will determine a capping environment. I 
would be interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister whether she thinks that any or all of those 
options are worth further consideration. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> One problem is that the amendment would give the Secretary of State yet more 
discretion. I believe that the hon. Gentleman instinctively shares that anxiety, even though intellectually 
he has taken a different road. The Secretary of State would have more scope to set principles which may 
exempt certain unspecified categories, which may apply to those with budgets under a level specified by 
the Secretary of State and which only provide services as specified by the Secretary of State. In such cases, 
would it not put more power into the hands of the Secretary of State? The hon. Gentleman wants a regime 
that leaves local authorities with more flexibility, rather than their having to beg the Secretary of State for 
favours? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made some points that the Minister may make in response 
to the amendment. It attempts to look at the atmosphere within which local authorities work. I realise that 
I am about to suggest an intellectual or logical chain of events. If one accepts the principle of capping of 
any sort, but does not accept that it should be universal, and, if we assume that we will not enter into an 
annual charade whereby we try to create classes and rules that are clearly set up for particular purposes, 
there is a danger, given these legislative proposals, that an environment would be created whereby local 
authorities found themselves in difficulty about how to ensure that they worked well in their capacity as 
authorities. 
<P>
I suggest that the Minister, by using this method, or through protocol&#151;which we know has 
already begun to work well in discussions with the Local Government Association&#151;or by 
enunciating in discussion with local authorities how the atmosphere may develop, will be able to ensure 
that authorities do not reach a position in which they apparently work well but become fearful that, on 
account of the effect of standard spending assessments, they may find themselves subject to capping. That 
would not be a particularly good way to proceed towards the partnership that I said was essential for a 
good relationship between local government and the centre in the future. 
<P>
I believe that some way forward should be found. The amendment suggests ways in which that might 
be done, but there are other ways. I offer the amendment to the Committee for consideration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I should like to speak briefly to the amendments tabled by 
my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and others which would mitigate the extraordinary powers in 
the schedule. In my view, there is a real danger of the provisions being a hammer blow to local 
democracy. 
<P>
The Labour party's manifesto, to which I have referred previously, states clearly: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Local decision making should be less constrained by central government, and also more 
accountable to local people.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am sure that the Minister has many things to do at weekends, so she may not have read the 
Oswestry and Border Counties Advertiser. Had she done so, she would have realised the impact of her 
Government's policy on people who have worked in local government for many years. The article states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Oswestry Borough Council looks set for its biggest shake-up in decades, with a third of its 
councillors&#151;some long serving members&#151;deciding they will not stand for re-election in 
May.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Disillusionment with the local government system. . . '' 
<P>
is one of the main reasons. The article continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``County stalwart Trevor Davies of Oswestry, another former borough mayor, said that he was too 
disillusioned with local government. He said:<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`It's 41 years ago since I was first elected and it is doubtful that I will stand for re-election.''' 
<P>
</UL></FONT>[Interruption.] This is the important phrase. The Minister laughs, but the people of Oswestry 
are not laughing about it. Mr. Davis continued 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Local government is now just an administrative arm of the government . . . Now we cannot do 
anything&#151;we are just told what to do and how to do it.'''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is exactly what the schedule is all about. 
<P>
The country was led to believe last year that power would be handed back to the people. I want 
councillors to be able to satnd for election, presenting to the electors a programme with a price, with 
councillors returning to the ballot four years later, having either delivered their programme, and offered 
cheaper local taxes, or failed. That should be the criterion to avoid the huge bureaucracy of which we 
complain. All the Committee is attempting to do is square the circle, because we have taken away the 
connection between the vote and the tax. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I support the hon. Gentleman's comments because he is on the right track. It should be 
left to local voters. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton said this morning, there is a 
problem&#151;the electoral system. A bad council with an entrenched majority cannot be shifted: that is 
a fact of life under a first-past-the-post system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We were in serious danger of agreeing at one point. Having spent much of my life 
travelling around Europe and having seen proportional representation in action, I know that executive 
agencies cannot be removed through PR, which is musical chairs of the same crew. We have seen that 
recently in the federal elections in Germany&#151;but I shall not go down that route, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> On the connection between the vote and the tax, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the 
biggest dislocation resulted from the poll tax redistribution. If local government were made to raise locally 
all the taxes it intended to spend, there would be open revolt. It would be impossible because of the 
distortions introduced by the regime over the past 18 years. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should stick to the amendments before us. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I agree entirely, Mr. O'Brien. I did not intend to go down that road. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned that elections should be every four years. Does he accept 
that one way for councillors to stay in touch with their locality would be to have annual elections? That 
would bring councils much more in touch with their local electorate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I mentioned four years as a suitable period for a councillor to present a programme, 
put it into action and present his record to the electorate. Yet under the schedule, the cost of whatever 
programme a councillor of any party presents to the local electorate is irrelevant. It depends rather on the 
capricious arbitrary powers and subjective judgment of the Secretary of State. 
<P>
The schedule is ludicrous. Paragraph 52B gives the Secretary of State any power to take any action 
on any criteria. There is no reference to local people or local issues&#151;quite the opposite of what was 
promised in the general election. More recently, after they had assumed power, the Government stated in 
paragraph 1.36 of the Welsh White Paper: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a need for improvements in the local accountability for levels of council tax.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Here we are discussing a schedule that centralises decision making and provides no criteria relating 
to which way the Secretary of State may like to jump. That makes it impossible to prepare a case 
beforehand. 
<P>
When I intervened briefly on my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, I mentioned that this was 
a particular problem in Wales because there is a political dimension. As my hon. Friend said, the Welsh 
Assembly will be not only an executive body distributing central funds, in the same way as the Secretary 
of State in England, but a highly political body. We all saw the political excitement over the weekend and 
I have to say that some of us were brought up to believe that 64 per cent. was a larger number than 36 per 
cent.&#151;but were proved wrong. 
<P>
There will be the most extraordinary shenanigans in the Welsh Assembly and there is a strong 
chance that the capricious and arbitrary powers delegated to the Secretary of State will be misused. That is 
a tragedy for Wales, just after the unitary system has been set up. There seemed to be a real chance for 
local government to flourish on the basis of direct local accountability and only one tier, but all that will 
be destroyed and a huge second tier imposed with dramatic powers to overrule local decision and local 
choice. 
<P>
Amendment Nos. 206, 208 and 209 go some way to ameliorating this extraordinary schedule, which 
contradicts everything that we were told in the election campaign and in the White Papers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Whenever I am reflecting on PR, I recall that the most recent German election is the first 
in the post-war period in which the Government changed as a result of the election. We need to recognise 
that there is no such thing as a universal panacea for accountability or voter involvement. 
<P>
I should like to deal with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, who 
is no longer here but I see that his amendment partner is. I wish to disabuse him of two points that he 
made repeatedly&#151;they are happy little myths that are simply not true. The first is that capping 
criteria had to be set in advance. No one asked, ``Who are we going to catch this year? How do we define 
it to catch a particular local authority?'' That would have led straight to judicial review. The world is not 
like that. People are happy to have that conspiratorial view, but the world does not play in those terms. 
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the criteria for capping were not made public 
until a number of authorities, including the one I led, challenged on the point and got the requirement that 
the criteria should be made public. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> All the time that I held that ministerial post we had to announce our capping criteria in 
advance, which seemed perfectly reasonable. This year the Government said that they retained the 
legislation but announced no capping criteria. They still had the ability to cap this year so the hon. Lady 
should be careful before she deploys that argument. 
<P>
The second point concerns the methodology. There was a massive consultation exercise every year. 
The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) will be familiar with the SSA working party, for 
example. The problem is that local government does not agree among itself. That is quite understandable. 
The interests of one local authority do not coincide with those of another. 
<P>
Take our famous area cost adjustment, with which you will be familiar, Mr O'Brien. Some local 
authorities do not want to change it but others do. Your local authority was a member of the Webber Craig 
group which is a band of local authorities in Lancashire and Yorkshire that wanted certain things to 
happen in the SSAs which did not suit others. There is always a choice to be made. Ministers do not sit 
down to work out how to manipulate things. As for day visitors, York, Chester and some of the seaside 
towns were all anxious to get recognition of the additional pressure on services which large influxes of 
visitors brought. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I cannot resist drawing to my right hon. Friend's attention paragraph 5.7 of the White 
Paper under the heading 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Abolition of crude and universal capping''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
which must be of interest to the hon. Member for Northampton, North. The Government are making 
a virtue of the fact that local authorities will not be notified in advance of capping criteria. It states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Government will not in advance tell every single council in the country how much it may 
spend.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That was a travesty of the publication of capping criteria, but it is now under these proposals that the 
Government will cap authorities retrospectively after they have set their budgets, blind to the principles by 
which the Secretary of State might set capping criteria [Interruption]. The hon. Lady says that&#151; 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me some respite care during my speech. The 
hon. Lady's amendment shows how good intentions do not always make good legislation. The problem is 
one of definition. What I like about the amendment is that it tries to firm up paragraph 52B(2) which is 
the catch-all phrase. Some of the principles that the Secretary of State will have to consider are in the Bill, 
some are not. I am sure that when we come to consider the schedule as a whole we will want to ask the 
Minister to be a little clearer about that. That is the real area of debate on the schedule. 
<P>
The other factors that come into account all present their difficulties. Best value makes sense 
ostensibly, but it is a continuing process. The whole thrust of the Bill is to say that best value and the three 
Es should be a normal condition. We should be careful before we establish it as a reward for a particular 
set of incentives or special privileges for local authorities. 
<P>
Support of the local electorate was mentioned. I believe that the local electorate should express its 
views through the ballot box. I am not a great fan of local referendums because of the difficulty in 
defining the question and the choices that are put before the electorate. I am not a great fan of the Milton 
Keynes experiment, nor is Sir Jeremy Beecham, judging from his appearance on local television about 
that question. 
<P>
If beacon status existed, how would councils that had done particularly well be rewarded? All 
Governments have wrestled with that question. Can an incentive system be built into local government? 
That is very difficult, as everyone wants an incentive to spend more. 
<P>
However, local authorities will become beacons or best value authorities by demonstrating that they 
do not need to spend more. They will achieve the best-quality service from money that they already have. 
Therefore, one must be careful about building into the system a mechanism for making authorities want to 
spend more and for rewarding them financially. 
<P>
Eventually, all local authorities may become beacon authorities. However, beacon status may be 
withdrawn from authorities that slip below the mark. It will be more difficult for local authorities to 
remain beacon authorities because getting closer to the top of the scale makes it harder to squeeze out the 
extra percentage needed to maintain a relative position in the scale. 
<P>
Schools are discovering that in relation to the league tables. They may get well up the tables, but 
getting the bit extra that takes them up another couple of points is more difficult and may be affected by 
kids being ill or on holiday. 
<P>
Amendment No. 197 is useful because it invites the Minister to explain the principles behind the 
measure and why some appear in the Bill and some do not. The amendment is a good try and has good 
intentions, but it is a bad measure.

<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> Milton Keynes has been mentioned, so I will give the result of the referendum. Forty-five 
per cent. of the people of Milton Keynes voted in the referendum. That figure is higher than any turnout 
for a local election. The highest turnout for such an election was 41 per cent., which occurred during the 
year that the poll tax was an issue. Last year's local election turnout was 26 per cent. 
<P>
In the referendum, 30 per cent. of voters voted for a 5 per cent. increase in council tax, 46 per cent. 
voted for a 9.8 per cent. increase, and 23 per cent. voted for a 15 per cent. increase. I appreciate that the 
Minister cannot take such information into account this year. However, Milton Keynes council has always 
been innovative, and undertook the referendum as part of a continuing process of modernisation. 
Discussions about local government finance may be progressed by such methods. 
<P>
One of local government's problems is that it has wanted one solution to fit all. Diversity is the key to 
local government, and different local authorities require different solutions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Of course, in any future referendum of that nature, the local authority would have to set 
out the proposed council tax increase and the proposed supplement to be paid in respect of knock-on 
effects on council tax benefit. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> That was done. The Electoral Reform Society conducted the ballot and ensured that it 
was fair. It provided a pack that the local authority used to explain both the effect of every option on a 
band D council tax payer and the impact on services. 
<P>
Earlier, the issue of what questions to ask was raised. It was difficult for the local authority to ask the 
right question. It may not have got the question right. However, it made a very good attempt, which it 
should continue next year. 
<P>
The referendum posed fundamental questions about the nature of local government finance. The 
schedule does something similar. When the Secretary of State considers such matters, he must appraise 
the nature of the question and the nature of support that people give. In Milton Keynes, 70 per cent. of 
voters said that they wanted an increase of 9 per cent. or more. 
<P>
Capping has a most pernicious effect on a local authority. Such an effect does not last for one year 
only, but lingers on. A council that has been capped never wants to repeat the experience. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Plenty did. 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I take that point, but many councils were capped time and again because the rules 
changed. For example, we were capped in 1991, when we introduced an increase that was one third of the 
previous year's increase. In the previous year, the authority had been run by a Tory-Liberal coalition and 
had introduced an increase of 25 per cent. We introduced a rise of 8 per cent. and got capped. The only 
change was that we were in control. We introduced a smaller increase and got capped. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, while capping is intended to be less overt 
under the new arrangements, the regime will loom over every local authority? The White Paper makes it 
clear that local authorities that step out of line will be capped. Although the schedule grants only reserve 
powers, they threaten every local authority. Therefore, the pernicious effect that the hon. Gentleman 
describes remains. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I do not accept that. The year after our local authority was capped, some members of the 
group presented a proposal for introducing a council tax rise of 30 per cent. to challenge the Government. 
That was a political proposal, which was defeated in the group. The reserve powers are valid for dealing 
with such proposals. The current crude and universal capping causes problems for all authorities. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Gentleman explains how he believes that the powers will be used. He is 
not talking about the Bill's contents. The Bill's provisions are broader and more subjective than those of 
any other measure. The four reserve powers can be designated in-year, as currently happens, but they can 
also be designated for the following year. A notional budget can be set and designated for an authority for 
several years. Those provisions are more powerful and subjective than the current system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I was coming to the Bill. However, the current system causes the problems that I 
described. They apply to all local authorities. It is good that the reserve powers can apply to individual 
authorities, and take account of the circumstances. The current universal capping criteria had perverse 
effects. Every local authority spent up to the maximum. Those that did not do that lost out. That provided 
a perverse incentive. Some authorities, such as Slough, which was a low-spending Labour authority, spent 
up to the maximum to benefit from a system under which it had previously lost out. The Bill removes that 
perversity and allows councils to set a council tax that is appropriate to their budges. 
<P>
Under the current system and the SSA cap, councils could make cuts and introduce a council tax 
reduction. Liberal Democrats criticised me for doing that in the run-up to the general election. However, 
the effect of the year's settlement was that we had a council tax reduction at the same time as we made 
&#163;12 million worth of cuts. No one could understand it locally. Again, the new system means that 
such issues can be recognised. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> How can that be recognised? 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I am interested in the Welsh party in exile. But the problem is that when a whole class of 
authorities is considered, the individual circumstances of local authorities are not taken into account. The 
reserve powers enable the Secretary of State to do that and to deal with an individual authority. That can 
help matters. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Where does it say that in the Bill? 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman read out the criteria earlier on. I am sure that he can use his 
intelligence. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's point. The Secretary of State could go down 
those lines if he wished, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that he must and he could go down any 
other line. The honorary Gentleman's problem is that he is seeing it in a benevolent way. He has a 
Secretary of State whom he believes in for the moment&#151;touch wood. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> This needs to be seen in the context of the innovations in local government. The best 
value proposals and the limited use of reserve powers is the way it should go forward. The hon. 
Gentleman seems to argue that I should worry because there might one day be a Tory Secretary of State. 
Well, I would be worried about that, but it is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future. The Bill allows 
local government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test pointed out, to come out of the 
shadow of the past 18 years and to start to show that best value can work. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> In which case, why does he think that swathes of local councillors of all parties have 
given up in Oswestry? It is because they are fed up with the central Government interference in local 
government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I shall treat that with the&#151; 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> No. The point is that the Opposition amendments would offer the worst parts of the 
current system without the benefits of the use of reserve powers and the abolition of crude and universal 
capping, which would return through the back door. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate with a lot of the contradictions in the 
Conservative party coming out. I want to respond to some of the general points that have been made but I 
also want to deal with the specific amendments. 
<P>
Amendment No. 206 seeks to provide that where a council's band D council tax is less than the 
average for authorities of the same class, its budget requirement cannot be considered excessive. We 
should call this the Mole Valley amendment or perhaps the Mole Valley previous incarnation amendment. 
I am surprised that hon. Members have proposed it. They did not consider that such a restriction was 
necessary when they were operating the current inflexible capping system and it is interesting that they 
wish to put it into anything new. 
<P>
I have made it clear that there is a national responsibility and a national interest in representing and 
protecting local council tax payers from excessive council tax increases. Hon. Members shook their heads 
at the last points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The reality is that 
some authorities have few households in band D. 
<P>
The vast majority of households are in band A, therefore the increase in council tax in band D in a 
particular authority will not be commensurate with the increase in the budget because most of the rise will 
come from band A taxpayers. The way in which the previous Government sought to use that average led 
to misunderstanding about how council tax operates. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I agree with the Minister. Earlier, she reiterated the point that the Government must 
protect council tax payers from excessive tax rises. Why does the Government not consider it necessary to 
protect local residents from cuts to services because the council tax cannot be increased? Surely, that 
should be borne in mind too. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman at last understands that the Bill is about ensuring that residents 
get the very best quality of service at a price that local people are prepared to pay. There will be symmetry; 
a relationship between the two. At the moment there is a disjuncture. 
<P>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) was not here when we 
discussed the problem of removing capping altogether. His hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and 
his right hon. Friend the leader of the Conservative party, acknowledged in recent speeches that difficult 
issues are involved. An authority that has been mentioned previously reduced its council tax by 35 per 
cent. last year; that may have had nothing to do with the fact that it was facing the electorate. It is alleged 
to be thinking about putting its council tax up this year by 40 per cent. I may be cynical, but I think it may 
have something to do with the fact that it will not face the electorate for another three years. In such 
circumstances, the Government have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer. In normal circumstances, I 
think the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is not a fair way to treat council tax payers. 
<P>
I am not making any comment about Government decisions this year; I am giving examples of what 
happens when council tax finance is considered separately from the rest of the Government's 
modernisation programme. As my hon. Friends said, the Bill establishes a new relationship between 
central and local government. It is part of a series of measures that will, if successful, mean that no 
Secreatary of State can do what the hon. Member for Mole Valley and his Secretary of State did under the 
previous Administration. Because local government will be more powerful, and local people will give it 
legitimacy, no Government will dare to intervene in that way. The Bill is part of a package which shifts 
the balance towards a partnership which will encourage the better performing councils. That is for future 
measures, so I cannot say much about it now, but I hope that Opposition Members will acknowledge that 
they cannot consider the Bill in isolation. 
<P>
I understand some of the fears of Opposition Members, because they exercised draconian powers. 
The hon. Member for Mole Valley and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon know that under the 
current legislation it is not necessary to pre-announce criteria. Indeed, it is entirely up to the Government 
to decide on criteria and when they will be announced. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
In opposition and in government I have met representatives of several authorities which faced 
capping. Almost every one spoke about budgets in previous years, as well as those in the current year. 
They all asked for the pattern of events since the poll tax, and how their particular budgets had been 
affected by it, to be taken into account. Some made the sort of arguments alluded to earlier by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East when he spoke about his reorganised authority. Milton 
Keynes was in a peculiar position regarding council tax and budget decisions. The schedule has been 
framed because it is important for council's arguments to be taken into account. I shall return to that later. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Mole Valley will recognise that amendment No. 206 will not help 
the Bill and will not enable what he intended actually to happen. It may protect one or two councils in 
their current position, but that is not a means of legislating for the future. I hope that hon. Gentleman will 
acknowledge that and withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> As I said in proposing the amendments, I wanted to point out the subjectivity of 
the provisions and ask the Minister not to accept the amendments word for word but to take the point, 
which was about the draconian nature of the powers. We are asked to take the Minister's intentions on 
faith, but we cannot do that. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from given the way in which his 
Government acted. However, we are taking the relationship with local government on faith and trust. We 
want a trustworthy relationship between central and local government&#151;[Interruption.] I want 
to answer the hon. Gentleman's question fully. That is why we seek to strengthen local government 
through the raft of modernisation measures that we outline in the White Paper. We need reserve powers to 
that we can have confidence in the steps that local government itself will take to ensure that the reserve 
powers will never need to be applied. The various moves and shifts referred to in the White Paper will 
mean that it will not be necessary to use the reserve powers. 
<P>
As I said, I understand where the hon. Member for Mole Valley is coming from, but I come from a 
different position&#151;one that wants a vibrant local government with strength and accountability, as a 
result of which it will not see itself as in battle with the Government, or take the sort of decisions 
mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The LGA believes that under 
the previous capping regime many authorities simply sought to spend at cap. I have visited several 
authorities that have said: ``We do not debate what we ought to be doing; we simply set out budget at cap. 
If we do not do that, we lose out next year anyway''. 
<P>
That is ludicrous and is a negative effect of the previous Administration's implementation of the 
existing measure. We want to move away from that, which is why we are examining more flexible powers 
which, I believe, will be used far less. Local government will take hold of its own destiny, and will work 
towards that objective. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The penultimate sentence emphasises that difficulty that many Committee 
members are experiencing. The Minister used the phrase ``I believe''. However, we have only the Bill to 
go on, and we must discuss it for the sake of local authorities. 
<P>
I agree with many of the Minister's intentions and agree that local authorities with a distinct lack of 
imagination set their budgets at cap. However, the schedule is draconian in its selection of any 
information or factor that the Secretary of State may deem to be relevant. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has now made that point four times, but has not said anything 
new. 
<P>
I am not in control of local government, nor do I seek that control. I am talking about a relationship, 
and any relationship must involve faith and trust. I am not prepared to move in the direction desired by 
the hon. Gentleman and spell out everything in the Bill. That will give central Government levels of 
determinate control that are far greater than those in the bill, once such powers are put in the context of 
everything else that we want to do. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know that we will continue to disagree, so I want to move on and address the rest 
of the amendments. I have dealt with amendment No. 206, and I now turn to amendments Nos. 208 and 
209. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Just one point. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Will that relate to amendments Nos. 208 and 209? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Just one point. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> All right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The LGA&#151;and not the Conservative party&#151;has made a plea. The LGA's 
preference is for all the key principles to be set out in the Bill. Why cannot the Minister satisfy local 
authorities on that matter? Her own proclivity is to acquire more power for the Secretary of State at local 
authorities' expense. 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I knew that I was wrong to give way. The hon. Gentleman is referring to 
amendments that I will address later. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 may be intended to complement amendment No. 206 by seeking to 
remove the powers of the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to determine categories of authorities 
for which different sets of principles will apply. The amendments propose classes of authorities to which 
all sets of principles apply, but they do not define those classes. I can only assume that the classes are 
those in current capping legislation; that is, non-metropolitan districts, counties, metropolitan districts, 
unitary authorities, inner London boroughs, outer London boroughs and so on. 
<P>
I have been asked why the LGA was excluded. It has not been excluded, as it would happily fit into a 
category, but not a class. 
<P>
I have said before that one reason for introducing reserve powers is to increase flexibility. We have 
explained in the local government White Papers that the new reserve powers will enable us to set no limits 
on councils meeting certain criteria. Examples might be those whose council tax is only a small 
proportion of the total council tax bill faced by local tax payers or those that provide particular services. 
Other examples might include councils that have shown strong performance in the delivery of best value 
or that have the support of their electorate. That would not be possible if the Secretary of State could not 
determine categories. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> All district authorities in shire areas have council taxes which are a small proportion of 
the total council tax bill faced by tax payers. Does that mean that all district councils in shire county areas 
will be exempt? 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows that I was saying that we would be able to make 
that decision where the current legislation is quite restrictive. Some shire districts are not in that position 
whereas the vast majority are. The clause would enable us to make precisely that decision. That is not to 
say that it has been decided that the selection would be made. I am simply giving that as the sort of 
example that we could move to. 
<P>
We should not focus on classes of authority as defined in the current capping legislation. There are 
significant differences between local authorities in any such class, not least in the level of budget set and 
the services provided. It is much more sensible to determine categories that will enable us to take into 
account all the circumstances that may arise in future such as those categories that I have just outlined. 
That is one of the reasons for not setting everything out in the Bill. 
<P>
We are living in a rapidly changing environment. Local government is changing too. We would not 
want to have to come back to primary legislation every time there was a slight change. I accept that there 
is a difference between us and the official Opposition on the need for flexibility. That is because of the 
different ways in which we see the relationship. I understand that the Liberal Democrats would like 
flexibility but do not want any capping. I understand their position but the Conservative position is much 
more confused. 
<P>
Amendment No. 197, which was tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Southampton, Test and 
for Castle Point, seeks to set out in the Bill some of the principles and categories of authorities that may be 
used when deciding whether budget requirements are accepted. I assure my hon. Friends that it is 
unnecessary. The amendment suggests that local authorities with budgets below a specified level or which 
provide particular services may be exempted. Section 52B as drafted already provides for that; it allows 
the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to determine categories of authorities taking 
into account any information considered relevant. Therefore if some small districts were at a level where it 
was simply not effective to cap them, that could be a category that would be determined. But it is also the 
same with the factors put forward by the amendment. The Secretary of State or the Assembly will be able 
to determine principles and categories to take into account all those factors and again there is no need to 
include them in the Bill. 
<P>
As yet there is no statutory basis for those factors although I am keen for us to have a debate in the 
House on legislation to introduce those measures. As I explained in response to the Opposition 
amendments, one of the reasons for replacing crude and universal capping with the reserve powers is to 
increase flexibility. It is important that the reserve powers can be used to respond&#151;to changing 
circumstances in future. 
<P>
As I said earlier, local government will be widely reformed and modernised in the next few years. It 
is not possible to predict the exact way in which the Government may need to use the reserve powers in 
future. As I said to my hon. Friends, I hope that we shall not have to use them. However, we do not want 
to risk restricting the powers only to find that to designate a few irresponsible councils we are forced to 
designate others that we do not want to affect. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friends and Members for Southampton, Test and for Milton Keynes, North-East presented 
a powerful case to show that the blanket imposition of capping sometimes had ridiculous, unjustified 
effects that were incomprehensible locally. Our desire to ensure that the majority of councils do not worry 
about being capped because they are in charge, accountable and responsible to their electorate led to the 
measure. We do not pretend that every local authority is as bad as the worst local authority. The measure 
should enable the best to flourish and not be brought down, if only in reputation, by the few who behave 
irresponsibly. That is why the schedule is framed in a particular way. I hope that my hon. Friends will not 
press their amendment. 
<P>
We have already introduced one change. However, the current capping legislation is far too 
restrictive, and does not allow us to reflect the changes in the way in which we operate this year. We have 
stabilised the SSAs for three years and thus provided more stability in financial planning for local 
authorities. That shows that we can consider more than one year and that we can tell a local authority that 
it is running into trouble, give it notice this year, and assure it that it will not get into trouble if it sorts out 
the problems next year. There have been several occasions when we knew that we would not have had to 
impose capping if we had been able to negotiate in that way. We could have had a sensible discussion and 
come to an agreement with an authority after we had notified it clearly of the criteria on which we based 
our judgment. That would have enabled it to put its house in order in the next year without incurring 
billing. That seems sensible rather than draconian.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> To quote Milton, the Minister makes 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . the worse appear the better reason.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We are not considering a premeditated halt for local authorities to reflect. The Government could not 
find an answer to the area cost adjustment any more than we could. Therefore, they intend to call it off, 
and it will be subsumed in some greater review. Pauses are smashing if one is in a good position, but 
people who are in a bad position do not like them. Some local authorities will believe that the pause 
constitutes a marvellous opportunity for long-term planning while others, such as north Yorkshire, will 
feel that they are being taken to the cleaners for the next three years. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> We have put across the point that we have been trying to make. The Minister 
accepts that the Bill proposes capping, potentially in four different forms. I have some sympathy for her. 
She used the term ``national issue'', and said that under the way in which local government finance is 
structured at the moment&#151;that is the caveat&#151;there may be cases where the Government 
need to act. 
<P>
The point behind the amendments is that the Committee is examining the Bill: we cannot look at the 
back of the Minister's head or guess her dreams. We do not know whether she wakes up and thinks, ``I am 
going to do such and such for local government; it is going to be wonderful; and everyone is going to 
follow our line.'' We are examining this Bill, which is horrendously subjective. I accept some of her 
arguments and acknowledged at the start that at least two of the amendments would require changes in 
the wording. I said that the amendments were about making some important points. One amendment 
would take some provisions out of the Bill. The blatant point is that the Secretary of State&#151;no 
matter what the Minister's dreams for local government&#151;can be draconian and subjective. 
<P>
I am intrigued that the local authority to which the Minister referred visited the Minister of State, the 
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) to discuss its situation. The Minister's point 
was made by the Minister of State to that authority&#151;namely that year-in, year-out, the council tax 
was kept down and savings were made, especially in the year before the election. It went up straight 
afterwards. I do not know whether that is fact or fiction. However, I do know that that local authority has 
been under Conservative control since 1978 and that it has a huge majority&#151;so the public have 
backed its approach. The Minister must understand that. 
<P>
Under the schedule, the Secretary of State could pick out that local authority because it started with 
the letter ``W'' and ended in ``th''&#151;or anything that he judges relevant. The debate on this issue 
must continue. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move amendment No. 207, in page 17, line 33, at end 
insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(4A) the Secretary of State shall publish a statement of the set of principles for each financial year 
on or before 31st December in the preceding year''.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I had hoped to speak to the amendment on Thursday: it is a shame that we have so little time now. 
The amendment follows on from this afternoon's debate. It would reinforce the need for the Secretary of 
State to publish his set of principles. Without publication of the information, local authorities would be 
left in the dark. We have heard considerable anxiety about how benign any future Secretary of State might 
be in interpreting these subjective powers, which makes publication all the more important. 
<P>
Where would councils be left as the Bill stands? The Secretary of State is to inform them that his 
prediction for council tax increases is in the order 4.5 per cent. We heard that during the revenue support 
grant debate. However, proposed council tax increases published in The Times on 20 February showed a 
wide variation. It is perhaps not surprising, regarding the proposed county settlement, that Labour-
controlled Cumbria and Durham remain within the Secretary of State's predictions. But what of those 
councils who face double, treble or quadruple rises in council tax? Where will they be left unless the set of 
principles is published? As I said, they will be left in the dark. 
<P>
Two councils that have doubled the predicted council tax increase&#151;Kent and 
Hampshire&#151;are Conservative controlled, but Northamptonshire, which is in Labour control, has an 
8.8 per cent. projected increase. Northumberland's is 9.5 per cent. and in Nottinghamshire, it is 9.9 per 
cent. Those are Labour-controlled councils but they too are left in the dark without a published set of 
principles relating to whether they will be hit by the reserve powers. In truth, that says more about the 
winners and losers in the calculation of revenue support grant. 
<P>
What set of principles will be used to assess Oxfordshire, which will have an 11.8 per cent. increase, 
or Buckinghamshire, with a 13.3 per cent. increase. We cannot help wondering whether the pioneering 
Wandsworth is trying to test the system, with its proposed 22.2 per cent. increase. Where will the axe fall? 
Without a published set of principles the authorities are left totally in the dark. 
<P>
Our amendment seeks to bring about publication of the figures. My hon. Friend the Member for 
North Essex referred to the position of the Local Government Association which is clear. It is a strong 
cross-party voice that calls loudly for the key principles to be set out in the Bill, and for publication. It is 
concerned that without that, the powers will be left entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State. For 
that reason we urge the Minister to reflect on the need to publish. 
<P>
We receive new documentation this morning. On entering the Committee Room I discovered that 
another new document, on the reserve powers, had been presented to the Committee. I read it carefully 
during the Committee's proceedings&#151;unlike this morning's procedure, there was no suspension to 
enable the Committee to read documents&#151;but nowhere can I find a reference to the need to publish 
this set of principles. Therefore I remain convinced of the need for this information to be published. If it is 
not, local authorities will be unclear about where the limit&#151;the new word to be used in place of 
capping&#151;will come. 
<P>
It is important to point out that during discussion of schedule 1, my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Skipton and Ripon made it clear that during his time in office capping criteria were published. There 
is therefore a precedent for publishing this information&#151;another important point to put on record. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I suspect that at least hon. Members sitting behind the Minister will understand 
what we are trying to get at, and why. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East gives a smile of 
affirmation, so I assume that he understands. 
<P>
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I were in the Department, we 
recognised that, within reason, local authorities needed to know where they were as soon as possible. The 
crux of our amendment is that it attempts to persuade the Government to recognise that, and to ensure that 
local authorities have some understanding of where they are, so as to cut down surprises and give them 
the opportunity and sufficient time to take the detail into consideration in their budgets&#151;which 
they should to some degree have done anyway, although many authorities leave this till the last minute. 
This would give them time to assess whether to introduce savings, change their method of approach, take 
some products off their wish list, use a bit of competitive tendering instead of just using the direct labour 
force alone. They could recognise a combination of quality of service and so on by these principles. 
<P>
Part of this derives from the anticipation, pre-empted by amendment No. 197, that there may be 
other types of authority&#151;beacon authorities were mentioned&#151;and a question arose about 
whether local authorities should take a few Blairisms or some political correctness from the back of the 
White Paper on beacon councils and follow that line as it would make for a more benevolent approach 
towards a particular local authority. Authorities need to know far enough in advance that they have this in 
their hands. Hence the amendment, which chooses 31 December as the date by which the Secretary of 
State must publish the statement of the set of principles.
