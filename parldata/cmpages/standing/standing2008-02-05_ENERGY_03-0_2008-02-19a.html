							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): May I begin by asking all our
witnesses their views on the appropriate remit for Ofgem and whether
they believe its remit and its primary duties should be changed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>include a specific duty to reduce carbon emissions? I know the
Sustainable Development Commission has brought forward a range of
proposals on that, but do you believe it should have equal primary
duties, or should one be secondary to
another?</div>
					<a name="08021968000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Andrew
Lee:
							</b>
						</i> Perhaps I could respond to
that. In the Sustainable Development Commission, we think a big missed
opportunity in this Energy Bill is the opportunity to change the
framework within which Ofgem operates, and we think that has to start
from the issue of the primary duty. At the moment, sustainability, or
the climate change imperative, is a sub-duty of a sub-duty in the way
Ofgem works. We would like to see a change in the primary duty as we
think that is the keystone on which a changed approach from Ofgem could
be built in the
future.</div>
					<a name="08021968000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have put forward two options in our report and the first is to put the
current consumer interest and the greenhouse gas duty one above the
other. The other option, which in some ways is the more pure
sustainability option is to say that these should be joint objectives
and that the regulator should be required to deliver a regulated energy
market in the interest of consumers while simultaneously reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from the network. Out of that flows a series
of other things, including what is a key issue for us&#151;creating a
regulated heat market. We think there is a huge missed opportunity that
Ofgem can and should deliver.</div>
					<a name="08021968000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Related to that is the issue of
Ofgem in relation to the price of energy, smart metering and trying to
create an environment in which consumers are well informed about their
energy use and are able to make informed choices and in which
low-income consumers do not pay through the nose for energy because of
the tariff
structure.</div>
					<a name="08021968000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Gordon Edge:
							</b>
						</i> Certainly what needs
to change at Ofgem is an attitude and a culture that seems to think
that it is doing very well when, in fact, it is being quite
obstructive. By its own lights, it thinks it is doing well. We also
need to recognise that it is not just Ofgem, but the whole governance
structure of the energy sector, and particularly the networks and the
number of code panels, that need to change. We see changing
Ofgem&#146;s remit as a last resort. That would be quite disruptive
of the whole system while Ofgem digests a new primary duty, but we are
not counting that out. Unless there are other options, such as changing
the guidance given to Ofgem&#151;if that is really strengthened and
if that does deliver what we want in a short time frame,
fantastic&#151;but maybe, as a last resort, a change in the primary
remit may be helpful. We are working with others on an amendment, which
we may introduce in the House of Lords or later, that brings forward
all four of the Government&#146;s pillars of energy policy, as to
what should be the drivers of Ofgem. That is merely one option and
there are many.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gaynor
Hartnell:
							</b>
						</i> The Renewable Energy Association&#146;s
position is more in line with that of the Sustainable Development
Commission. Although we agree that we all have the same end objectives,
we share the view that, without the primary duty being changed, there
is very little chance of the scale of change and the speed with which
we need to change actually happening in practice. Ofgem is clearly an
extremely effective and strong regulator, and it is doing a very good
job in regard to its current duties. However, it is no longer really
aligned to Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>policy, and we would therefore like to see the Energy Bill grasp the
nettle and deal with that, because we really need to pull out all the
stops, given the scale of the task required to get 15 per cent. of our
energy from renewables by 2020.</div>

							<b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Could one person from each
organisation give us their view of the potential of renewables&#146;
contribution to the energy mix, both in the short term and in the long
term? I am interested in your views on the upper band and on the short
term prospects, as it were, with a fair wind, if you will pardon the
expression. In particular, does the banding of the renewables
obligation help or hinder the potential contribution of
renewables?</div>
					<a name="08021968000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gaynor
Hartnell:
							</b>
						</i> In the Renewable Energy Association, we
believe that a 20 per cent renewable energy contribution is possible by
2020, and we have a paper that shows how that could even be slightly
exceeded. At the moment, we have a renewable electricity obligation and
we are shortly going to have a transport fuel obligation, but we need
to have action across the whole breadth of not just the industry, but
other parts of the economy as well. We really need more involvement
with house building, with industry, and commercial applications. As far
as the renewables obligation is concerned we feel it is extremely
effective at the job it is designed to do, which is large-scale
renewable power projects.</div>
					<a name="08021968000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes
to on-site generation, these are entities whose core line of business
is not developing power stations. It is incredibly complex, and the
arrangements are not suitable to engage the kind of commercial entities
that may want to generate some power for their own needs, but do not
want to tackle all that complexity. So we believe it would be more
appropriate to have something like a basic tariff
structure&#151;people are more familiar with the term feed-in
tariffs&#151;for smaller-scale generation, and I do not just mean
microgeneration or under 50 KW, but you would need to have a boundary
somewhere. That would be more appropriate to reach out to a wide range
of sites that may be available: sites like sewage treatment works,
waste management facilities, or next to warehouses, hospitals or
industrial estates. These are not your typical renewable power station
hilltop sites, but there are a vast number of them and they may well
have advantages when it comes to planning. So the renewables obligation
has to remain in place to give security to the industry. It would be
extremely damaging if it were changed, but we believe that a feed-in
tariff mechanism can coexist with a renewables obligation and widen the
applicability. We also need an effective measure for renewable heat,
and a tariff-based mechanism&#151;clear straightforward and
simple&#151;is much more likely to succeed in following the renewable
obligation tradable certificate kind of route.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Maria
McCaffery:
							</b>
						</i> The BWEA represents the
wind, wave and tidal industry in the UK, but is exclusively concerned
with electrical power generation. So I cannot speak for heat and
transport fuels, where we work closely with the REA. At present, 4.5
per cent. of all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>our electricity comes from renewable sources. Of that, a third is
wind&#151;and that is predominantly onshore wind&#151;and the
balance of 3 per cent. comes mainly from hydropower, with a little from
biomass. At present we have another 7,500 MW, which is equivalent to
about 5.5 per cent. of electricity, stuck in the planning system for
onshore wind alone. If two thirds of that could be consented to in the
short term, we would comfortably achieve the 2010 target of 10 per
cent. of electricity from totally renewable sources.</div>
					<a name="08021968000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the greater
proportion is concerned, I am trying to concentrate on the time scales
that you outlined. The greatest contribution is going to come from
offshore wind and we will see exponential growth from around 2012 to
2020, with the bulk of it coming post-2015 as more
manufacturers&#151;we are confidently expecting more&#151;come into
the turbine-supply
market.</div>
					<a name="08021968000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sarah
Samuel:
							</b>
						</i> Just to add to that, we recently did a big
report on tidal power and we estimated that there is the potential for
5 per cent. of UK electricity to come from each of tidal-range and
tidal-stream sources, so that is up to 10 per cent. of electricity in
the longer
term.</div>
					<a name="08021968000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are supportive of the banding of the renewables obligation; we think
that that will help to develop technologies that are slightly further
away from market at the moment, but we recognise that there are
difficulties with the RO for very small generators and microgenerators
and that an alternative support mechanism might be appropriate for
those. Equally there is a package of measures around renewables that
needs to be tackled, regarding barriers to smaller generators, network
charging arrangements, access to the transmission network, and charging
of generators connected to the distribution network. That is something
that we feel that Ofgem and the Government need to act on
together.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): To follow that theme, do
any of the witnesses feel that the increased banding will encourage the
necessary levels of extra investment for marine energy to prosper? If
they believe that, do they believe that investors will follow, when
there is the safer bet of offshore wind available, with almost as many
renewables obligation certificates available? Do they feel that if
there were higher ROCs banding, and if they were given to emerging
technologies, that that would harm offshore investment, taking into
account the changes to the planning laws being
considered?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Andrew
Lee:
							</b>
						</i> Can I comment perhaps on the
issue of tidal energy, which we have obviously featured heavily in the
Sustainable Development Commission&#146;s work recently? I think that
our assessment of the potential for tidal stream
technology&#151;marine-current turbines and so on&#151;is that
although a banded RO is to be welcomed, it is not the measure that will
be the key issue in the short term because those technologies are still
at a very early stage. One of the technologies, a single turbine, is
being tested in Strangford lough right now and the issue is about
maintaining the level of investment and innovation funding and things
such as the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, where you can
actually plug in these technologies and test them. It is about that
sort of commitment to innovation in technology because we have not yet
got to the stage, as we did with wind, where we know which kind of
technical solutions will deliver 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>in the long term. The RO is perhaps for those technologies nearer to
market. We also need the framework for innovation and
investment.</div>
					<a name="08021968000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
feedback that we got from the tidal industry players and some of the
academics was that actually they were not that dissatisfied with the
current regime; it was more about staying the course, and having very
clear signals from the UK Government, and particularly the Government
in Scotland in this case as well, that tidal technology is going to be
an important part of the UK economy and innovation in the future.
Therefore there is a lot to play
for.</div>

not a very suitable mechanism for smaller-scale generation. Similarly,
it is not ideally suited for emerging technologies where one is
expecting the price to go down fairly rapidly, because it builds in
quite a lot of inertia. A feed-in tariff is more effective for that
kind of technology as well. Our wave and tidal device developers look
with envy at countries such as Portugal and Ireland, which have feed-in

everything that Andrew said in terms of the UK&#146;s strong
technological lead and intellectual infrastructure, the resource and
research base we have for the marine technologies. The Government have
recognised that even the two ROCs that the banding will give to wave
and tidal are not enough for where those technologies are at the
moment. Our concern is to do with the marine renewables deployment
fund, which is struggling to get successful applicants because of entry
criteria and so forth. We would like to see that process becoming
easier, and see that something comes after it. The fund will support
only four different technologies, once only. There is nothing beyond
that. There is a gap between the MRDF and what will work under two

to wave and tidal will be a small proportion of the RO. When we asked
our offshore developer members, they were very pleased with one and a
half ROCs; it was competitive with other countries and their feed-in
tariffs and other support mechanisms for offshore wind; and it
reinforced the UK&#146;s position as the premier offshore wind

<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>That is one of the problems that we have with the renewables obligation;
there have been attempts to make it more effective for microgeneration

Ofgem&#146;s time administrating the obligation is spent dealing with
less than 1 per cent. of the renewable generation in the country. It is
all spent on small applications, which is not very useful for them or
the wider industry. I stress again that it may be up to 1 or 2

						</i> May I pick up specifically on
the link between social objectives and climate change? It is an issue
that we were animated about in the Ofgem report. Our assessment is that
there is a market failure at the moment on two fronts. First, consumers
are not well-informed about the consequences of their energy use; in
fact, they cannot even get the information. Secondly, the market is not
serving low-income consumers well. In other words, the poorest people
are often paying the highest tariffs&#151;unacceptably
high&#151;and that difference has got greater over time: from
&#163;17 difference in an average bill up to &#163;120 over the
past few years. The gap is getting worse. Those things need to be
addressed because, to get where the UK needs to be, we need consumers
to be able to take control of and to be empowered to use their energy
more effectively. We also need to be driving social policy in a way
that disconnects people from fossil fuel dependency in the first place,
through the energy efficiency measures and rest.</div>
					<a name="08021968000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two very specific
recommendations: one is about smart metering&#151;again, we think
that this is a missed opportunity in the Energy Bill. I know that there
is a complex and arcane debate going on, which I do not fully
understand but others here do, about smart metering, real-time displays
and different types of metering options. However, the point is about
the outcome you want. The outcome has to be that consumers are able to
make informed choices about their energy use based on accurate
information at the same time as energy companies are able to get more
information about how they are supplying their customers. Each proposal
should be tested against that. That may be a combination of metering
solutions and, of course, smart billing as well; it is the whole
package that fits together. The second thing is to tackle these
perverse social tariffs. It is unacceptable that some of the poorest
people in society are paying the most per unit of energy. That market
failure has to be addressed.

landfill gas and another 10 to

technologies supported under the renewables obligation, as it now is.

that we would like to see is a more pragmatic approach towards the
calculation of the biomass content of fuels. That does not have to be
done for wind, but it is necessary for the thermal technologies. Those
kinds of measuring and administrative procedures are very onerous, to
the extent that, sometimes, a biomass power station really could not be

content and proving that it is biomass and not contaminated to any

difficulties. So the application process has progressed; very
significant costs have been incurred; and hopes have been increased. It
has got closer and closer, with a high expectation of a decision in
favour, only for the MOD to raise an eleventh-hour objection that kills

rigorous emissions limits than a coal-fired power station would have to

it is one of the most complex areas in the whole of the renewables

from waste plants that use gasification or pyrolysis technology were
eligible to earn ROCs. Not one ROC has yet been earned by such a plant.

them.</div>

at the moment&#151;it is still a work in progress&#151;but the
evidence that we have suggests that that is not really the case. About
8 per cent. of a typical electricity bill is related to environmental
costs, so it is hard to believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>that that actually constitutes the recent 15 per cent. increase in

						</i> In a worldwide context, there are a
number of main players in the carbon capture and storage area. They are
Europe, north America, including both the USA and Canada, and
Australia. Then there are the major opportunities that will come from
the developing world, particularly China and India. I will take those
in turn.</div>
					<a name="08021968000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Europe, of

process.</div>
					<a name="08021968000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the USA,
there is an awful lot of activity in the area of carbon capture and
storage. Recent headlines about the American Government&#146;s
withdrawal of support for FutureGen is not a true indication of what is
going on there. There is tremendous support for carbon capture and
storage, and it will happen. It will be the USA&#146;s engineered
solution to climate
change.</div>
					<a name="08021968000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Canada,
even very recently, the aim has been announced to have a large number
of CCS plants delivering by 2015. The Canadians have particular
problems there, having got themselves into a position of being about
270 million tonnes a year over their Kyoto target, mainly because of
the production of oil from tar sands in Alberta.</div>
					<a name="08021968000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Australia, a number of
projects are under development, and the Government there has taken a
strong lead&#151;as has the UK Government&#151;in the development
of regulation.</div>
					<a name="08021968000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">China
is very well aware of the problem that it faces, and it is by no means
ignoring it. There are some very serious companies that recognise
exactly where they need to stand in the future in the development of
CCS. </div>
					<a name="08021968000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">India is a bit
further behind; but just as an example, our latest recruit into the

India. It knows what is going to happen in the future.</div>
					<a name="08021968000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the notes for this meeting,
you referred to the Stern report&#146;s view that 28 per cent. of the
2050 target could be delivered by CCS. That is the most enormous market
in the future. It is likely to be the biggest single market opportunity
that the energy industry has ever faced. Where is the UK placed? As a
result of the work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>that has gone into the Energy Bill, the UK is extremely well placed in
terms of policy. If we look at where the UK has established itself
because of a policy lead on emissions trading, we can do the same with
CCS. The Government have been congratulated for getting the policy in
place for the regulation of CCS ahead of most other countries. What we
need now is the financial incentive to get on and do it, because there
is a huge amount of enthusiasm in business to get on and install CCS

could be up and running commercially in the UK? Secondly, do you think
the opportunities here are equally great for pre-combustion and
post-combustion? Thirdly, what do you estimate to be the necessary cost
of carbon in euros per tonne, in order for CCS to be economically
viable in this country?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Dr. Jeff
Chapman:
							</b>
						</i> There are four pre-combustion capture
projects under development in the UK. I have to say that they are on a
go-slow now, because of the decision to support post-combustion
capture. All of those four projects are being confidently developed by
very serious organisations that understand the technology. They claim
that they could be in operation sometime in the period of 2011 to 2013.
So we do have projects that are ready to go, and certainly in a time
scale quicker than the Government-supported demonstration plant, which
is talking of 2015.</div>
					<a name="08021968000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
regard to post-combustion versus pre-combustion, pre-combustion is a
technology that is going to be extremely important in the future for
two reasons. First, because of carbon capture and storage, it is a very
good way of generating power. Secondly, this is the start of the
hydrogen economy. If anyone says hydrogen is going to be produced in
large quantities from renewable energy or nuclear power, that is very
unlikely. This will be the most efficient way to make hydrogen in the
future, and with carbon capture and storage, there will be clean energy
using hydrogen as a vector. That is very important for pre-combustion
technology; it is a very important place, and we in the UK need to be
there.</div>
					<a name="08021968000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
denying that we also need to demonstrate post-combustion capture,
particularly as a political gesture, to show China and India that we
mean business. What does it take in terms of money? A lot of figures
have been bandied about, and I really cannot give you a figure. The
lowest-hanging fruit of carbon capture and storage is storing the
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> that is associated with natural gas. Examples of that
are the Sleipner project in the North sea and the In Salah project in
Algeria. In each of those projects, the cost is less than $10 per tonne
of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> put away, because it is already separated. In terms
of power projects for the UK, we are probably talking within the range
of €50 to €100. Until it gets off the drawing board and
we lay down some plans, we will not have price discovery. The good
thing about the competition is that there will be some element of price
discovery. We need more of that to go on in the UK, in Europe and
elsewhere.</div>

you have just said, which was very helpful, my perception is that the
competition that the Government have established has picked a
technology and you are saying that the other technology is very
important, could lead to a hydrogen economy and has been put on go-slow
because of the Government favouring one over the other. Is it your view
that, for example, there should be another competition for
pre-combustion technology? Are you worried that the time scale for the
competition that we have got is unnecessarily slow and that we need to
get on with these things
faster?</div>

						</i> Yes, I am saying that. I am saying that
the time scale for this competition is not in proportion to the
requirement to re-plant the electricity industry in the UK. We will
inevitably have more and more coal-fired power plants coming forward
and they need to be equipped with carbon capture and storage very
quickly; otherwise UK emissions are going to increase. We will have to
build coal-fired plants; otherwise the UK and all the suppliers of
electricity will become over-dependent on supplies of gas. That is not
good for the country or for the electricity

								Chris
Mansfield:
							</b>
						</i> There is a tremendous
window of opportunity in the years ahead. Estimates suggest that
because of the impact of the large combustion plants directive and
because of the retirement of ageing plant, the UK will require
something in the order of 20 GW of new power generation before 2020. I
put to you that that probably represents a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to ensure that these new plants are fitted with carbon
capture and storage technology. That is a very important dimension.
That timing seems to coincide to some degree with the depletion of
existing oil and gas fields and the availability of capacity in some of
that infrastructure, so a tremendous potential for reuse is opening up
and that window of opportunity may not be available to us if we do not
seize it

formations&#151;otherwise known as aquifers&#151;are the two
principal means of storing CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. The Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, in conjunction with the Ministry of
Petroleum and Energy in Norway, undertook an infrastructure study
earlier this year which is publicly available on the
Department&#146;s website. It looked at the storage potential in both
the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North sea. If I recall correctly,
it indicated that the UK has storage capacity of the order of 24
gigatonnes; about 14.5 gigatonnes would be in aquifers and the
remainder in depleted oil and gas fields. To set that in context, if
you say that a very large 1 GW power station will emit of the order of
6 million tonnes a year, you can see that the storage potential the UK
has puts us in a very strong position for many
years.</div>

						</i> What impact will it have on the cost of
electricity? In the short term, the kind of figures I have just
mentioned are not uncompetitive in relation to the cost of other near
zero emission power-generation technologies, such as renewables. CCS is
very competitive in that context, and ought to become more so as
designs are proven and the price falls. In the long term, we all
believe that the EU emissions trading scheme will be the mechanism that
induces people to invest in carbon capture and storage and to that
extent the technology will not have any effect on the price of power
because the power generators would have to buy their allowances in the
market regardless of CCS or other
technology.</div>
					<a name="08021968000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I
will say is that we have the most enormous opportunity, when the
Government are going to receive windfalls of very many billions of
euros from auctioning EU ETS allowances, to return that money for
investment in clean technology in the power industry. Clause 10 of the
EU ETS directive suggests that at least 20 per cent. of these revenues
should be recycled for various purposes, including CCS. That is good,
but what I am saying is, &#147;Government, don&#146;t say that you

						</i> I think that we reflect on
two points. First, as the gentleman on my left mentioned, there is a
timetable for many fields decommissioning. Many fields are now of
mature years and, unless we see new production come through them, they
will be decommissioned. There are still billions of pounds of assets in
the North sea. Many could be used for carbon storage, in part, but will

						</i> The best example that I can think of straight
away is the Brent field. It is not one currently targeted for carbon
storage, but was due to have been closed down and taken away perhaps
even 10 years ago. It still has a productive life, but I know that the
company concerned is beginning to think about decommissioning and the
field could well be gone in the next 10 years. So, what we are looking
at is that, unless we see the new facilities coming within the next
five years, the decommissioning train will then be moving too fast to
stop.</div>
					<a name="08021968000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in good

important.</div>

aspect of carbon storage and, for that matter, gas storage is that we
try to do things in the right order. For many cases, it is actually
good that if we see an oil and gas opportunity, we do that first,
because it both liberates a huge value for the nation but also, on top
of that, discovers things that will make future carbon storage easier
to understand and do, as we see how reservoirs behave. Our plea would
be to do things in the right order, to look at the time scales and to
make sure that we are effective because of

suggesting. I am not sure that I can speak to that. What I would say is
that a number of the new projects coming forward could look at heat
capture. I will quote to you one of the proposed projects in
particular&#151;ConocoPhillips at Immingham. ConocoPhillips has
proposed to build a bank of gasifiers to supply a combined heat and
power plant, which will be the biggest combined heat and power plant in
Europe, a superb, showcase plant of 1,200 MW. The idea is to make
hydrogen out of coal imported into Immingham, and to supply hydrogen as
a feedstock to the oil refinery. In one fell swoop, that project could
decarbonise a quarter of the oil refining industry&#151;that is,
heat, power and hydrogen.</div>

very high carbon content of continuing to supply gas to the UK energy
production market. Bearing in mind what we have heard about time scales
for carbon capture and storage, do you consider any moves from the gas
supply industry to register concern about or action on the fact that,
in addition to carbon being captured, the heat that is
produced&#151;usually wastefully as a result of gas being used in
power station supply&#151;might be regarded as part of the process in
future, particularly in terms of what we have heard about the
development of combined heat and power plants, for

						</i> There are two drivers. First of all, the
drive to produce gas or maximise gas recovery from the nation&#146;s
offshore resource is important, because that has been a major driver to
reduce our carbon footprint as a nation. Particularly in the 1990s,
that really changed the carbon emissions of the UK. I know we are
working closely with DBERR and with industry to find ways to deliver
the west of Shetland&#146;s gas, and there are also some major issues
still to be resolved in terms of making sure there is capacity in the
national grid infrastructure to bring that ashore. There are therefore
some big hurdles to leap over, commercially and physically, to make
sure that it can be brought ashore. Physically bringing the gas ashore,
maximising recovery, is a good first
step.</div>
					<a name="08021968000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, many
of the facilities that are there for the processing of gas into usable
fuel are unlikely to be changed because of any new emerging
technologies, because they are there because of what we have got at the
moment. We have to let the market help deliver the best solutions it
can, such as those that Dr. Chapman mentioned from ConocoPhillips, as
bright new ideas to really move the agenda on. We try to maximise as
best we can from where we are now, and we try to open the best door to
the future with new
fuels.</div>

in the Bill asking to tighten up certain pieces. Licensing has been
going on since 1964, and there are hundreds of licences. Within each
licence, there are tens of part-licences, so the licensing process
today is exceedingly complex. Whenever assets or parts of licences get
traded, an enormous amount of legal work needs to be done to track
where everything is going and the obligations and benefits that result
from those licence transfers. Tracking that is quite a difficult
process, and companies have trust deeds between one another to make
sure that they get the benefits and not the disadvantages of other
parties working on other bits of the licence. So some of the pieces
that have been asked for in the Bill are to help the Government keep
track and to ensure that companies properly carry out their obligations
to keep them informed of changes as part of the consent process. I
think that is fair.</div>

EOR&#151;enhanced oil recovery&#151;with CCS. What we have
increasingly seen for a lot of the North Sea, is that we have used
other tertiary forms of oil recovery already, be it gas injection or
water injection, so that not just the first but the second flush of
youth in terms of oil and gas recovery has already happened on these
reservoirs. So typically, CCS is unlikely to form a great alliance with
enhanced oil recovery.</div>

the economics might change if the carbon happened to be passing their

the current market. Over the last years, we have seen all three forms
of supply available to the UK market and, in many cases, pipeline gas
has started to displace even the UK&#146;s own production because the
cost of production of very major fields in the Norwegian sector or even
Russian gas are actually displacing the more expensive gas in the
UK&#146;s own resources. LNG is in the middle or higher price range
of that, and with the very competitive market we have in the UK, we
will see that continuing, where those are going to fight against each

If the price evolves in the future so we see a more expensive market
rather than a cheaper one, we have access to a global LNG resource. Or
if we see the market relatively low in prices, there may be other parts
of the globe that may be more attracted to LNG. It brings a security of

both the market and the

						</i> Basically, the amount of gas storage that we
have now is part of our historical supply mix because, historically, we
were always reliant on some of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>the shaping that we had from the indigenous gas in the UK. Now that is
declining, and with that decline has come a tighter position in terms

diverse sources of gas supply; we still have a fair bit of indigenous
gas shaping going on. One of the things about the Bill is that it

allowing the market to determine the mixes and levels of different

						</i> I have an additional point. We made clear
in our written submission&#151;if you saw that&#151;that there are
proposals in the Energy Bill that there should be a dual lease and
permit system, with the former issued by the Crown Estate and the
latter by an as yet unidentified regulatory authority. That is the
point that Dr. Chapman made. We are somewhat nervous, as you might
expect, at the prospect of a commercial lease payable to the Crown
Estate. Those of you close to carbon capture and storage projects will
understand the challenging economics of those projects, so the prospect
we face of having to pay a commercial lease leaves us somewhat nervous.
So too does the prospect that some form of regulatory
oversight&#151;for want of a better expression&#151;will be split
between two separate organisations. The risk of miscommunication both
within government and those organisations and with the industry also
lends itself to the argument that we would prefer to see all of that in
one single organisation. For the reasons that Dr. Chapman outlined, we
would prefer that regulatory responsibility to rest with

Committee may know that we are now proposing a new renewable energy
strategy following our support for the European Union&#146;s 2020
proposal&#151; 20 per cent. of all energy in the Union should
come from renewables by 2020. The Commission has suggested that it may
be 15 per cent. in Britain and we are discussing that with the
Commission, but it is going to be a very high figure. We are developing
that new strategy within the Department and will be consulting on that
in the early summer. As an aspect of that, we will be looking afresh at
microgeneration and we are open to considering any proposals to boost
microgeneration, including a feed-in tariff arrangement. I want to look
at all the options, but I want make it clear that that fresh look at
microgeneration is not at all about challenging the mainstream
renewables obligation, which we think is fit for
purpose.</div>

						</b> Minister, I am particularly
concerned about the competition between pre and post-carbon capture and
CCS technology. As a chemist, I am particularly concerned to get
maximum output of chemicals from burning fossil fuels and, therefore, I
support pre-carbon rather than post-carbon capture. I am dismayed that
the competition has not been a parallel one and, as we have heard from
previous witnesses this morning, we may lose the impetus with
pre-carbon capture. Why have we not had a parallel competition between
pre and post-carbon capture?</div>

CCS. It is in interesting area. I confess that when I was Pensions
Minister, I had never heard of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>carbon capture and storage. With the exception of one or two people in
the Committee, that may be the case for other Members. Now of course
everyone is saying why are we being so slow, why only one project, why
not two&#151;any other bidders?&#151;or three or four, and why are
we doing so badly. The reality is that we are doing very well. We are,
with Norway, the leading nation in Europe on this. It is probably only
Norway and the United States that will get a full-scale demonstration
project up and running at more or less the same time as us&#151;we
hope by 2014. It is good that the Government are backing a
demonstration project.</div>
					<a name="08021968000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer your question: we
felt it right, at that stage, to make a judgment between pre-combustion
and post-combustion. I know that there are important voices on both
sides of the argument and I respect those voices, but what swayed
Ministers at the end of the day was the clear advice that
post-combustion technology was most appropriate, if we were going to
make an impact on China and its huge growth in emissions, given its
development of coal power stations. I do not know but if we were just
looking at the United Kingdom from a purely UK commercial point of view
in terms of new technologies, we might have been advised the other way.
But frankly, unless we enable the Chinese&#151;and other nations such
as India&#151;to control their emissions, then all is lost. All is
lost, and what we do will make very little difference. That was the
advice we received and that was the advice that we accepted. Now, I
would also like to see the developments in Europe and elsewhere
obviously of pre-combustion
technologies.</div>

said that he was not mandating new nuclear&#151;he was just trying to
remove hurdles&#151;it is presumably not inevitable that new nuclear
will come on stream. The Government want it to, I believe, and want to
clear the way for it to happen, but could you or your officials tell us

						</i> Let me deal with
that&#151;although, Mr. Amess, I am anxious at some stage
that my experts can join in, because the Committee is going to hear
quite enough from me in the weeks to come, and it would be good to hear
the experts speak, but I think this is one for me. As you know, we
initially undertook an energy review where ministers&#151;both the
then Secretary of State, Alan Johnson, and myself&#151;started off in
a position we described as nuclear neutral. We were then
persuaded&#151;that is another question&#151;that nuclear should be
part of a future energy mix. But, as we were preparing our work on
this, and as the public consultation&#151;which is a very good and
full consultation&#151;proceeded, we looked at the answer to that
question: what would be the alternative?</div>
					<a name="08021968000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alternative would consist of a range of measures; I cannot outline them
all, but I think they might be in the nuclear consultation. I think we
published those in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>the nuclear consultation, so they can be seen there, but clearly it
would mean an enhanced role for renewables. Although, of course, with
the challenge from Europe of maybe 15 per cent. of all of our energy
from renewables anyway, we are going to see a hugely enhanced role for
renewables, but presumably that would have to be taken even further. It
would put yet more emphasis&#151;although there is a huge amount of
emphasis in government anyway&#151;on energy
efficiency.</div>
					<a name="08021968000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think we could have
done more in the time scale about carbon capture and storage, but that
would clearly be part of the picture. I think for me the worry,
however, would be that in any alternative scenario, up to 2030 or 2040,
you still may have had an over-reliance on fossil fuels, and it would
have been more difficult&#151;in my judgement&#151;for us to have
met our demanded targets on CO<span class="Sub">2</span> reductions. That is one of
the reasons. The other reason I think was around national security; why
we felt that civil nuclear should be part of the mix in the
future.</div>

Main:
						</b> I have three brief questions. First, given the
evidence we have heard this morning on carbon capture and storage
particularly from Dr. Chapman, do you feel that there is perhaps a
missed opportunity in the Bill? Given that the retrofitting of carbon
capture and storage facilities is extremely expensive, perhaps there
has been a missed opportunity regarding the meshing-together of
technologies that he seemed to suggest would be worth
while?</div>
					<a name="08021968000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
note you said in response to my colleague that not including smart
metering and fuel poverty in this Bill was not necessarily missing an
opportunity, but that it was just not necessary to do it in the
legislation. Yet we have heard that the various fuel companies
themselves are not being very proactive in operating social tariffs and
ending fuel poverty. Perhaps you would like to reconsider, given the
prominence in the White Paper that was given to fuel poverty and that
its absence from this Bill sends a message to many people who are in
fuel poverty that the Government are not taking it seriously enough,
because they are not dealing with it through legislation.
</div>
					<a name="08021968000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to the
smart meters that you said you were committed to, are we talking truly
smart meters, not the electricity display devices that were
referred to in the Communities and Local Government Committee
when we had a submission from DBERR? Which smart meters are we talking
about, given that there is such a wide
range?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Malcolm
Wicks:
							</b>
						</i> Let me try those out in reverse order. We are
obviously talking about the smartest meters of all, but seriously we
are committed to the roll-out of smart meters, not the other display
devices that you mention. In encouraging householders to be energy
efficient tomorrow and the day after, the other display units may have
a role to play, but in terms of a major investment in the
infrastructure in our own dwellings, it has to be smart meters. The
Government will say more about that next month&#151;in
March.</div>
					<a name="08021968000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">On fuel
poverty, I do not think that my constituents would be dismayed that it
is not in legislation. Many of them do not read Bills in as much detail
as the hon. Lady. The serious issue is how, with rising global energy
prices and steep increases in electricity and gas prices in our own
country, we tackle that problem. I do not think that the Chairman would
allow me to present 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>my verbal dissertation on that, but it might be possible during the
Committee stage. Within a range of measures, including energy
efficiency programmes, and pension and other social security projects,
there is a role for the social tariff. In other words, the companies
must demonstrate corporate social responsibility as they put up their
prices.</div>
					<a name="08021968000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased that we have seen an increase in social tariffs from all the
energy companies, and that the amount of money now going on social
tariffs has increased. I recently met the chief executive officers of
all six major supply companies and urged them to do more, not least
about prepayment meters. The situation is that despite years of
progress in reducing fuel poverty through energy efficiency, social
security measures and so on, we are now seeing it move in the wrong
direction because of prices. It is a challenge for all of us to develop
the strategies to tackle
that.</div>
					<a name="08021968000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">On retrofitting
and back to CCS, we will consult soon on whether the new fossil fuel
power stations being built should have, as part of their design and
structure, the capacity to install CCS. I rather feel that they should,
but we want to consult on that so that we better understand the issue,
the problem and the cost.</div>

the Secretary of State powers to request information about the

switch from large-scale players to an increasing number of smaller
players entering the market. With that comes benefits, but also
additional risks because their financial capability may not be as
strong as some of the big global players. The power allows the
Secretary of State to acquire information about their financial
capability, and their ability to plug and abandon a well properly to
protect the environment at the appropriate time. If the Secretary of

putting up appropriate financial security to ensure that when the times

Normally, you would ensure that, at the end of a well&#146;s life, it
would be properly decommissioned, and that funding would be available.
If a well were to be suspended for an extended period, you might start
to have concerns; you might be concerned that they are not going to
&#147;unsuspend&#148; it and continue to produce oil and gas. At

likely in 2020. I think therefore&#151;although this would be an
answer to almost any question&#151;we have to put a great deal of
emphasis on energy efficiency. The starting point for any energy
strategy now is using less of it. We have to put an emphasis on energy
efficiency in factories, offices, homes, motor cars, and so on.
Renewables will become more important, but we will still be heavily
reliant on fossil fuels. At the moment, although we hear a great deal
about the decline of the United Kingdom continental shelf, the North
sea still supplies some two thirds of our total energy requirement. I
think that is the proportion. Fossil fuels will remain very important
in the future, which is why we are so keen on clean coal technologies
and the carbon capture and storage we have been discussing. It is
through a range of such measures that we will ensure that there is not

having with Steve Webb about nuclear. The Government have made it very
clear that the funding for new nuclear will come from the private
sector. The private sector will have to invest big time to achieve
this, and will need some confidence about financial return. The key to
that is the pricing of carbon, and a carbon market. The carbon market
is still in its infancy. What work have you done to assure potential
investors that, when the day comes, the EU emissions trading scheme
really is going to have a high and sustainable price of carbon
sufficient to bring new investment? Secondly, what about that curious

use of non-energy crop biomass in co-firing in coal-fired power

renewables obligation as a mechanism to inspire confidence in a range
of technologies&#151;wind farms, as we heard earlier from the British
Wind Energy Association and the Renewable Energy Association&#151;and
a range of technologies that the REA supports. Co-firing, while it has
a valuable place in reducing the carbon intensity of coal-fired power
stations, also has a rather volatile place in that market because the
capital investment required is fairly marginal and the industry can
co-fire whenever it finds a biomass fuel that is cheap enough. We are
reducing the level of support we are giving to non-energy crop biomass
because, to date, it has been rather over-supported in the renewables
obligation. The cap has been in place and is in place at the moment to
protect investors in other technologies and we think that, on the
balance of the consultation responses we had, that was an appropriate
thing to

						</b> My questions are to Dr. Walker and Dr. Higson. A
quick one to Dr. Walker: if the Minister was so minded, on reflection,
to think that the Government had made a bit of an error on carbon
capture and storage competition, is there nothing in the Bill that
would prevent that being rethought and
reorganised?</div>
					<a name="08021968000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question to Dr. Higson is on funded decommissioning programmes. A
number of questions to witnesses threw up possible doubt over some of
the liabilities, which followed on from what Mr. Tipping was
saying. There has been the cost of very long- term
storage&#151;and Dr. Roxburgh from the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority said that you will have to ask the Government about
that&#151;and the cost of the decommissioning authorities and the
nuclear installations inspectorate. Are they are going to be recovered
from the funded decommissioning programmes? Then there is the issue
highlighted in your own impact assessment: if the companies concerned
go into liquidation or are restructured, will the funds cease to be
available for these funded programmes? Are these liabilities still
there for the public
purse?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Daron Walker:
							</b>
						</i> Can I take mine first, because I think
that the answer will be quite short? There is nothing in the Bill that
stops that happening. The Bill is basically about creating a regulatory
framework for carbon storage under the seabed offshore, so it makes no
judgments about technology at all. It is
technology-neutral.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dr.
Mark Higson:
							</b>
						</i> On the point about
funds available, there are a number of protections in the Bill,
particularly if the operator goes insolvent. There are then
arrangements to ensure that the fund itself is protected. We agree that
costs are long term and therefore necessarily subject to uncertainty,
so what we are doing is setting up a framework that properly addresses
that, with a number of protections. For example, we must have an
approved decommissioning programme. The money must be progressively set
aside and the funds have to build in a degree of contingency and need
to be managed by fit and proper people. There also needs to be regular
review of the funds&#151;there is provision for that in the Bill
through regular monitoring and quinquennial reviews&#151;and there
must be requirements for providing information where required. We
expect the fund to be built up and completed before the end of the
lifetime of the nuclear station. The investment strategy also needs to
be on a basis of not taking risks towards the end of its lifetime; it
is an offence not to comply with the programme; and, if the funds are
insufficient, the operator must make up the costs. So, overall, we are
setting up a framework that should have substantial
protection.</div>

total protection. If operators are, as you say, dependent on cash flow
to build up a contingency fund, a company could go into liquidation or
be restructured to the point where funds were not available before a
fund was established to protect it against such long-term
liabilities.</div>

operate when you load it with fuel on day one, for example, it still
has the costs of decommissioning. We would expect a prudent, funded
decommissioning programme to make provision for that, such that there
were sufficient funds in those
circumstances.</div>

						</b> I shall spare you, Minister, and colleagues from any
personal nuclear discourse, which I shall save for the Committee stage
proper, when Mr. Horwood and I will go at it properly, I am
sure. However, I think that the Bill is genuinely radical, and many
people, me included, come into politics to push this kind of Bill
through the House. It is exciting; it looks to the long term; and it
looks after future generations in a truly comprehensive way, but it
cannot do that unless it brings into question any doubt about whether
we can do what we say we want to do through the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08021968000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concerns are about CCS. It
appears that we want renewables to work, and we are committed to that.
Yes, we want nuclear to work, and we are committed to that. Yes, we all
want CCS to work, and we are committed to that. However, if CCS does
not work, I do not see how we can secure our twin aims of reducing our
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions and establishing security of supply in the way
that we want. To what degree are we betting the house on CCS
working?</div>

						</i> I do not think that we are
betting the whole house. Earlier, someone gave a figure of about 25 per
cent. for the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>reductions that we need to make. It could
come from CCS, although there will no doubt be different views on that.
I think that CCS is crucial. When I came into the Department two and a
half years ago, my very wise officials said, &#147;Minister,
you&#146;ll hear about all sorts of technologies. Don&#146;t get
overexcited about any of them. It&#146;s your job to put in place the
framework.&#148; For the range of important and weird and wonderful
renewable technologies, that is quite good advice; but for CCS, I see
no alternative at the moment&#151;perhaps one day the scientific
community will develop an alternative of safely eradicating and
disposing of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. But at the moment, CCS is the only show in
town.</div>
					<a name="08021968000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mention China
again, because there is no point in looking at this from just a UK
point of view. Unless we develop this technology as rapidly as we
can&#151;that does not mean that we are going to be there next
year&#151;I think that we are in deep trouble as a planet, I really
do. I think that this is very important. You can argue about this, but
at the end of the day, it is partly about resources. I am proud of the
fact that the UK is actually ahead of the game
internationally&#151;along with only a few others at the moment. I
wish there were more rivals developing demonstration projects. There is
the US; there is Norway and other countries have an interest, but the
UK should commercially become a centre of excellence.</div>
					<a name="08021968000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my
colleague said, all the Bill does is set up a regulatory framework, so
that we can get storage, transportation and all these things right. We
as a Government&#151;and taxpayers&#151;are backing a demonstration
project, but there is nothing to stop other projects developing in the
future. We heard from the association about different companies with
different interests in CCS. I think that my challenge to some of the
big companies&#151;quite well-off companies internationally,
operating in Britain&#151;is &#147;Why don&#146;t you come
forward with your own demonstration project? As part of your
environmental and corporate social responsibility, don&#146;t just
talk the talk and place the nice adverts about how you are turning
green, but actually yourselves fund a CCS project.&#148; I do not
believe that it is so extraordinary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>to think that they should do that. They know climate change is a big
challenge to industry, in terms of fossil fuels.</div>

with regard to the announcements on new build, but why could we not
have a neat package, saying yes for new build to go ahead? The

them that you did not mention was generic design assessment, which is

energy efficiency commitment, about to become CERT&#151;the carbon
emissions reduction target&#151;the Warm Front scheme for poorer
people and our longer-term policy of incentivising supply companies to
persuade householders to use less of the stuff&#151;less gas and
electricity. That is becoming of energy service companies. I shall not
legislate for the sake of it. We will legislate only where we think
that such things are necessary. We do not think that such new measures
are needed in this
Bill.</div>

						</b> Can I pursue that point further, Minister? Some 40
per cent. of our housing stock in this country is properly insulated.
We have not made much progress in that area. Earlier on, the Minister
spoke about new build and the Government&#146;s zero-carbon programme
in 2016. However, new build represents 1 per cent. of the housing stock
every year. If we are really going to make progress on energy
efficiency, we must do much more about the existing housing stock. Is
he really saying to us that nothing more is needed to drive that
programme
forward?</div>

						</i> At this stage&#151;things might change in
the future&#151;I am saying that I have not seen the case that new
legislation is needed in the Bill. We have a raft of ideas and measures
that are developing. I think that Mr. Hendry is right to say
that we need to do far more. We are in a better position than we were,
say, 10 years ago. In recent years, as a result of the energy
efficiency commitment&#151;the Warm Front scheme and so
on&#151;some 2 million households have benefited from new energy
systems, loft insulation and draft-proofing. That is very substantial.
But the point that I made earlier is about how we transform the supply
companies that have a vested interested in persuading us to use more
electricity and more gas. It is about how we persuade them to become
part of the solution in terms of reducing CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;I think
that they are up for it, by the way. They are incentivised financially
to do that. We are now involved in that major development with the
companies. Smart meters are another aspect of
it.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> But in other parts of the world&#151;notably the
United States&#151;supply companies are required by law to work with
their customers to reduce energy demand. If they reduce demand, they
share the dividend, so the customer gets lower bills and some of the
saving goes back to the companies. Does the Minister believe that there
is some merit in looking at a legislative approach to require the
supply companies to do more than they are currently
doing?</div>

						</i> I agree very much, but we
must be careful. At the moment, the supply company supplies gas or
electricity; it sends round a meter man&#151;often very early in the
morning at a weekend in my experience&#151;and it sends a bill, which
we pay. That is more or less the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>end of the relationship. How do we move from there to a situation where
the company will come at our invitation, look at our house and talk
about thermal efficiency, renewable technologies, the importance of
smart meters and all those things? That is where we are going to move
to, and we are on that journey. I have not been advised that that
requires legislation. We are certainly not there yet in terms of
suggesting that there is a need for that in the
Bill.</div>

Southern Energy, although they have low prices, do not do very much on
social tariffs. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State made it clear
that he was still open-minded about whether social tariffs should be
made mandatory. Is that the still the position? Are you saying to the
companies that you meet regularly, &#147;Look, unless you perform and
do more, we could introduce
legislation.&#148;?</div>

					<a name="08021968000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not convinced that we need legislation at this stage. We would far
rather talk with the companies, as we have done. I have met the CEOs
individually over the past six to nine months. Only a week or two ago,
I asked all the CEOs to come to see me and said, &#147;Look, we have
a problem now.&#148; We have got a problem with rising energy bills,
and it is one we take very seriously. We have made some steps forward,
as I said earlier. The companies are now spending more money on social
tariffs than ever before. They are making advances. I have said to them
that we have to do more. In particular, it is up to the companies, not
the Government, to look at the problem of prepayment meters, because it
cannot be right that some of the poorest and most vulnerable people are
paying far more per unit of electricity and gas than most of us in the
Committee. That is an aspect of how the poor pay more, which is quite a
familiar theme in terms of social injustice. Two companies have now
moved in a reasonable direction on this, and I would like the others to
understand parliamentary concern about it.</div>
					<a name="08021968000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that there is a danger
if we did mandate social tariffs. What would we say? Should we tell
companies to spend a certain percentage or to help this group or that
group? All that might happen is that they would do the minimum and no
more and think that they have discharged their responsibilities. It may
be that, by having a non-mandatory approach, we are encouraging more
innovation.</div>

Whitehead:
						</b> We have heard a great deal about the idea that
perhaps new gas or coal-fired power stations would be required to be
CCS-ready if permission is given for them to proceed, presumably on the
basis that if one simply contemplated a whole new generation of gas and
coal-fired power stations coming on line without any mitigation
whatsoever, we would simply miss our CO<span class="Sub">2</span> targets by a mile.
You have recently given permission for two power stations to go ahead
provided that they are CHP-ready. As we discussed in relation to carbon
capture and storage, are there any other measures that you think should
be undertaken to make the idea that power stations might be CHP-ready a
reality?</div>

						</i> I am very interested in the CHP issue and very
sensitive to the fact that our policies have perhaps lacked a heat
dimension. I think that that is a reasonable charge, and I put my hands
up to it. The new Office of Climate Change&#151;a cross-departmental
agency&#151;has recently produced a report on this, and we want to
move forward on heat in general.</div>
					<a name="08021968000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been to Copenhagen.
Greenpeace invited me to see the big CHP plant that powers a huge
proportion of the homes and offices of Copenhagen. I accepted that
invitation from Greenpeace, as long as they promised to bring me
back&#151;it was not clear, but they did. I was very impressed by the
plant, and I have asked companies here why is it that, when we build
new power stations, we are not using the heat, even from a commercial
point of view. There are a number of technical and logistical answers
to that question, but I think we have to take combined heat and power
far more seriously, and I am very interested in how we will do
that.</div>
					<a name="08021968000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of Dr.
Whitehead&#146;s train of thought on this, I always think that it is
helpful to think where we might be in the future. I am not putting down
a policy prescription, because I cannot do that for the whole European
Union. However, my guess is that, at some stage, we will simply not
allow companies in Europe to build fossil fuel power stations unless
CCS is an integral part of that. I am not so certain about whether
there will be something similar on CHP. If that is the direction of
travel, I think that it really makes sense for Governments and
companies to think through the implications of that for their own
resources and
activities.</div>

Daron Walker:

						</i> Clause 40 is actually
all about offshore transmission. Shall I talk a little bit about that
in terms of the regime we are setting up? In recognition of the fact
that we are looking to expand offshore renewables massively, we have
committed to &#163;2.4 billion of investment, in effect, to offshore
transmission, by looking to have 8 GWe of offshore wind in place in the
next few years. The clause is part of a broader set of powers that were
taken under the Energy Act 2004, to allow us to introduce competition
in the process of building transmission assets out to these new
developments. The powers in clause 40 will help to facilitate that
process. By introducing competition, we expect and hope to make the
transmission asset build cost much less for the consumer. We estimate
that there will be between &#163;230 million and &#163;400 million
in savings by the nature of the process that we are putting in place
for that.</div>
					<a name="08021968000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
broader question of whether the national grid is fit for purpose,
clearly there are issues being pursued in the context of the
BETTA&#151;the British electricity trading and transmission
arrangements&#151;queue in Scotland, for example, for connecting
renewables, and we are working closely with Ofgem, the companies, the
developers and the national grid. There are things that could be going
better, but if you are asking me whether they are fit for purpose, of
course I would always say that they are fit for purpose, but there are
things that we need to improve, and we are continuing to work to ensure
that those improvements are
made.</div>
