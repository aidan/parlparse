<H4><center>Status</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory:</B> (Wells): I should like us to pause on the clause long enough for the Minister to tell us exactly what Crown status means in relation to employees or members of the Financial Services Authority. The notes on clauses are not particularly illuminating in that respect. Sometimes, such notes are helpful in expanding and elucidating the legal prose in Bills but, in this instance, they simply repeat the words in the clause.
<P>
The notes on clauses should have provided an explanation of what Crown status entails, the position in law of Crown servants and how their powers and responsibilities differ from those of other mortals. Do they have immunities from prosecution? Does the authority for which they work differ from other organisations in that respect? It would be helpful if the Minister could expand the concept of Crown servants. Perhaps she can give examples of other public organisations that fall into the same category.
<P>
I am aware that the clause makes it clear that the FSA is not a Crown body, but it would be useful to know what difference that will make in practice and whether the Bank of England is a Crown body. If powers are to be exercised by a different organisation, that could have implications for its actions and open up opportunities for outsiders to criticise or perhaps sue. The next clause covers immunity from prosecution, nevertheless I should be grateful if the hon. Lady would explain the implications of clause 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb: </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I wish to add my concerns to those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). We are moving away from the concept of self-regulation into the statutory regulation of the financial services industry. If matters are to be put on a statutory basis and fuctions are to be carried out on behalf of the Crown, surely the FSA should be subject to the usual immunities. Where will the FSA stand in relation to Crown immunity? Will the Economic Secretary say whether the civil servants who will be employed by it can be sued for negligence and not merely for acting in bad faith? It would be enormously helpful to the Committee if the Economic Secretary could clarify the fundamental issues outlined in clause 24.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): Good morning, Mr. Butterfill. Welcome to week four of our proceedings.
<P>
I am intrigued by the questions of the right hon. Member for Wells, because the clause will continue the position as it applies under the Financial Services Act 1986 that was introduced by a Conservative Government. It confirms the existing legal status of the Financial Services Authority. Paragraph 1(1) of schedule 9 to the Financial Services Act 1986 provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A designated agency shall not be regarded as acting on behalf of the Crown and its members, officers and servants shall not be regarded as Crown servants.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That provision seeks merely to avoid legal uncertainty--for example, whether Crown immunity applies to the FSA in the discharge of its banking duties.
<P>
The FSA has explicit immunity under the Financial Services Act; it will be given immunity for its banking functions also under schedule 5 of the Bill. That immunity currently applies to the Bank of England, which is not regarded as acting on behalf of the Crown in the discharge of its banking supervision functions. Indeed, it would be very peculiar if the Bill treated the FSA differently from the Act. There is no value in there being unnecessary legal uncertainty about the status of the FSA. The law should be clear.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked what other organisations suffer a similar approach. It is apparently customary to confirm non-Crown status on bodies that exercise such statutory functions. For example, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, operating under the Fair Trading Act 1973, is covered in that way. Such bodies do not attract Crown immunity, but rely instead on explicit immunities laid out in legislation. That is why we are taking on board the previous Government's approach; they made clear the question of Crown immunity in the Financial Services Act 1986. We are merely enshrining in the Bill what the previous Government did under the Financial Services Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary always says how surprised she is when we raise such matters; perhaps she does not fully appreciate what a revolution the Bill heralds. Setting up the Bank of England with significantly new powers, which we discussed at earlier sittings, is an extraordinarily important undertaking, as is the transfer of banking supervision and regulation from the Bank to the new authority. It is no explanation to say that the Bill simply follows what previous Governments have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley North): Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that he wants us to go back to giving some Government bodies immunity in law? Does he want to go back in time? Surely, from his experience in Government, he knows that the modern trend is for Crown immunity not to apply to statutory bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am not arguing against the clause. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman's point about making immunities more explicit is something that we shall discuss later this morning. We shall have something to say about that, because the immunities laid down in later clauses appear to be as comprehensive as if the staff of the FSA were Crown servants. However, we are anticipating later debates.
<P>
It is no explanation simply to refer to previous Acts of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman will concede that something important is happening under the Bill; after all, that is why the Committee is debating it. If powers are transferred from a Crown body--I understand that the Bank of England is a Crown body--to one that does not have similar immunity, we need to consider the implications. Of course, we are going in the right direction; perhaps that is the reason for the hon. Gentleman's comment. Indeed, if the Bill had given Crown status and Crown immunity to a body that previously did not enjoy it, our debate would be rather longer. Nevertheless, it is a significant point.
<P>
I doubt whether many members of the Committee are fully conversant with exactly what Crown status is. That is what I wanted to draw out from the Economic Secretary. A number of powers remain with the Bank of England, which I believe still has that status. If the hon. Gentleman is hinting that Crown immunity is old fashioned and should be replaced, perhaps the same strictures should apply to the powers that remain with a Crown body such as the Bank of England.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could, in the spirit of illumination, say whether the powers that the Bank of England, as a Crown body, will exercise through the Monetary Policy Committee and elsewhere will retain the status that will not apply to the powers transferred to the authority. I do not object to the clause, as it moves in the right direction, but my hon. Friends and I want to know more about this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Can the Economic Secretary explain how it was decided which measures would be included in the Bank of England Bill and which would be covered by the financial services Bill in due course? I find it slightly confusing that, in our discussions on clauses 24, 25 and 26 and beyond, we are talking about some of the functions of the FSA, but not others. We are discussing Crown immunity, the authority's charging powers and whether its employees can be sued for bad faith, but not the whole gamut of its duties, powers and responsibilities. On what legal basis was the division made between what should appear in the Bank of England Bill and what should be in the subsequent Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Further to the questions raised by my hon. Friends, will the Economic Secretary give us a short history lesson? Precisely why will the functions transferred from the Bank of England to the new authority under part III not be subject to immunity, whereas those residing with the Bank will be subject to it? How was it decided which functions would still be subject to it and which would not? The logical distinction is not immediately apparent in the notes on clauses, and I am sure that a short history of the matter would illuminate the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells pulls me up for saying that I am frequently surprised by the Opposition's response. The reason for my surprise is that his complaints are often about measures that were introduced by the Conservative Government before 1997. Given the right hon. Gentleman's behaviour during the closing months of that Government, perhaps I should not be surprised, so I apologise to him for expressing that surprise; I promise not to do it again.
<P>
As to Crown status, the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 provided that, in certain circumstances, the Crown could be sued--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It says here.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, ``It says here.'' He wanted a short history lesson. I am not quite as pompous as he is in assuming that I can lecture the Committee; I try to give the Committee proper information in a proper way. I am sorry if he feels that I am treating him roughly.
<P>
As I was saying, the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 provided that, in certain circumstances, the Crown could be sued. It also provided that the Crown, subject to liabilities in tort for acts of its servants and agents, could be sued as if it was a private person. Under that Act, the Crown enjoys certain immunities and procedural advantages. I mentioned the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as another example of where such immunities had been brought into play.
<P>
The Bank currently has those immunities and would not be regarded as acting on behalf of the Crown in the discharge of its banking supervision functions. That brings me to the point raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) about what will happen under this Bill compared with what will happen under the Financial Services Bill, which will be before the House this time next year. This Bill will transfer the existing regime for banking supervision to the FSA.
<P>
	I thought that we made it clear in our lengthy debates last week--I can reiterate what was said if it will help the Committee--why it was necessary to transfer banking supervision from the Bank of England to the FSA. We believe that in a single regulatory regime, it is appropriate for banking supervision to be the responsibility of the FSA. Given that there has not been a Bank of England Bill for 50 years, we believe that this is the appropriate legislation to remove banking supervision from the Bank of England and pass it to the FSA.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second Bill will provide for the status of the FSA, including its statutory objectives, which have already been outlined both in the launch of the document and in previous debates. That applies to all its expanded responsibilities. The clause is especially concerning with avoiding a conflict between the status of the FSA under the two Acts in the meantime. It is common sense and is aimed at ensuring that there is no legal disparity between the operation of the FSA at present and what will happen in the future.
<P>
Therefore, in response to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, there are no substantive changes to the functions of banking supervision in the Bill; its intention is to transfer existing functions. The clause will enshrine the immunity that was provided under the Financial Services Act 1986 by the previous Government and ensure that it is transferred to the FSA in exercising its banking supervision responsibilities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was much better. I think that the hon. Lady can now see what we are trying to do; we are asking questions and are very satisfied and grateful for her information in this instance. When discussing clauses, we are not complaining about previous Acts--the Minister missed the point entirely about that--nor are we necessarily complaining about the Bill. It is our duty to scrutinise the provisions and to consider their implications because they are important. In her first response, the hon. Lady was rather dismissive of the issue. She has now returned to it and I think I speak for my hon. Friends when I say that we are very satisfied with her clarification and we have no intention of holding up the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 10, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or negligent or otherwise in breach of their duty of care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 57, in page 10, line 32, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or negligent or otherwise in breach of their duty of care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is an opportunity to look at the immunities that will be granted by the Bill. We see that Crown status will be removed and the immunities will be set out in statute. I prefer that. We have an opportunity to avoid simply shrouding the activities and actions of the authority in a blanket of Crown status, which is antiquated, and to make them explicit in statute. I very much approve of that, but I want to question why the liability of the authority is drawn in the way that it is because, apparently, the authority will be liable for damages only when it acts in bad faith. That is restrictive and would be difficult to prove.
<P>
There could be many other ways in which the FSA was incompetent or failed to observe the most elementary duty of care towards the people or the institutions that it regulates. That is an awesome power, because large sums of money could be at stake and people's jobs could be at risk, and it seems inadequately constrained by the threat of litigation or of being sued for damages when the authority acts in a way that is clearly incompetent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that the Banking Act 1987, which his Government enacted, provided that the Bank and the court of directors should be liable only in cases of bad faith? Can he explain why he now wants to take a different tack?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman anticipates the points that I was about to raise. We have all read the notes on clauses; the note for clause 25 is more helpful than those for others because it refers to the Financial Services Act 1986 and to several other Acts.
<P>
The Bill introduces a change. The major changes are still to be discussed in the House when we consider legislation about the FSA--we are promised draft legislation on that some time next year--but the setting up of that authority is a major advance in terms of the means and the scope of financial regulation, which is probably why the Government are introducing it.
<P>
The Bill implements what might be called an interim arrangement, under which the powers and obligations of the FSA are being tackled and temporarily altered. Transferring that important section of banking regulation from the Bank of England to the authority constitutes a change. In law, the Bank of England currently discharges that function, subject to Crown immunity; however, when the Act that the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) instanced was discussed in the House, it was not envisaged that any institution other than the Bank would undertake banking regulation.
<P>
The considerations that appealed to the Government of the day therefore no longer apply. The fact that that was done in the Financial Services Act 1986 is not a comprehensive reason for the validity of the proposals. The fact that immunities were granted in the way they were is a powerful point. Again, I do not necessarily object to the measure being rolled forward, but we need to question it in the light of the new situation and the evolution of the relationship between Government bodies and those whom they regulate.
<P>
In times past, the king did what he wanted to do and no one could call him to account. In her helpful exposition on clause 24, the hon. Lady said that in certain cases the Crown could be sued and that it is not entirely above the law. It is therefore theoretically possible that the new arrangement could constitute a weakening of that principle, in the sense that it is a dimunition of the vulnerability of the Crown body to legal action.
<P>
That is another reason why we want to examine a little whether, in modern circumstances and in view of the FSA's role, it is appropriate for the immunities to be as comprehensive as they have been. For that reason, we have tabled the amendments, which seek to widen the provisions and to make the body liable not just for acts that are conducted in bad faith, but for those that are negligent or otherwise in breach of a duty of care. That is a reasonable position and should appeal to members of the Committee who feel that we have an opportunity to tilt the legal system a little in favour of the public and of those who are regulated and away from those who do the regulating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise to support the amendments. There is a difference between the pre-existing position and that which will follow the passage of the Bill and the financial services Bill, which we expect some time next year. The previous regime, introduced by the Conservative Government, was self-regulatory in essence, albeit under the auspices of a statutory framework. We are now moving towards what is clearly and solely a statutory regulation regime. We need to be sure, therefore, that the people who run the new regime have the maximum incentive to ensure that regulation is carried out properly and that no damage is caused to private sector businesses.
<P>
One can give many examples, which I am sure that many Members of Parliament have encountered, of statutory organisations, such as the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, acting negligently and causing enormous damage to business. Sometimes, the mere suspicion of a raid on premises can cause the bankruptcy of companies. It is essential that we do everything possible to ensure that no negligent slip-ups occur when the new regulatory regime is implemented.
<P>
During my legal studies at university, people always asked, ``What is the reason for Crown immunity? Why is it difficult to sue barristers?'' The reason that is always given in case law is that we do not want professionals looking over their shoulder the whole time in fear of legal action. I have, however, worked in the accountancy profession for 13 years and the threat of being sued provides enormous incentives to ensure that an individual's work and advice are the best that he and the firm can produce. Indeed, an enormous number of procedures are in place at my firm to ensure that at least two people of the correct level of seniority review every letter that contains advice before it leaves the firm. One does not, therefore, find junior clerks giving high-level technical advice and causing damage to the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman's firm considering moving to Jersey to gain greater exemption from the law? Incidentally, I do not follow the logic of his argument. Is he saying that private self-regulatory bodies should have greater exemption from liability than public bodies? Is that the logic of his argument? That matter was litigated at great length in the Three Rivers case and the courts have identified fairly clearly what bad faith means for the purposes of regulation. If we have to relitigate the matter, that would lead to the enormous legal fees that the hon. Gentleman apparently dislikes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises three points. First, he mentioned the moves taken by the accountancy profession to limit its liability. That is a question of limiting the level of damages, not the scope of liability. Whatever procedures a firm adopts--regardless of whether it incorporates in Jersey, for example--it will still be liable for negligence by its employees. The clause removes such liability, so that a firm will be liable only if an act is in bad faith. It does not extend to negligence or to actions otherwise in breach of their duty of care. That is the point: All accounting and law firms will remain liable for negligence and breaches in their duty of care.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not proposing changes to the previous regime for self-regulating organisations, but statutory regulatory regimes should have the maximum duties imposed on them to ensure that private sector businesses do not suffer from the negligence of an employee.
<P>
The clause should be extended to incorporate negligence and breach of duty of care. The organisation, which will employ thousands of people, have a huge budget and be an enormously powerful statutory regulatory regime, must have imposed upon it the maximum incentives to ensure that regulation is carried out effectively and correctly and does not damage the private sector. Such damage would have untold effects on people's wealth and businesses--through no fault of their own. The negligence of a junior clerk or a senior member of the FSA could enormously damage companies that have been built up over many years but suddenly find themselves subject to action by that organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My contribution will be brief and contain a question for the Economic Secretary. What is the experience of America, Germany and other mature western industrialised democracies with regulatory regimes similar to the FSA with regard to the liabilities that can fall upon negligent operatives in such authorities who act otherwise than in pursuance of the duty to act in good faith, and the duty of care under their contract? Has the Economic Secretary looked at their experiences or has she simply said, as the hon. Member for Dudley, North is wont to do, that, ``This is what happened before. We are following precedent and doing what you did''? His is a perfectly respectable point of view, but that is not the thrust of the argument of Conservative Members. I should greatly appreciate the Economic Secretary's comments on that comparative analysis.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I promised that I would not be surprised by what Conservative Members say, but it is hard to keep that promise. Last week, we had difficulty in talking to the Opposition about why we were introducing a single regulator. We heard arguments that we were over-regulating. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) spoke impressively and at great length about that. Now, amendments have been tabled that are aimed at extending regulation even further. It is hard not to be surprised, but nothing should surprise me nowadays.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked specifically about the Bank and its Crown immunity. As I explained while discussing the previous clause, the Bank would not be regarded as acting on behalf of the Crown in discharge of its supervisory function. The Bank has explicit immunity under section 1(4) of the Banking Act 1987.
<P>
I turn to the Opposition's broader line on the matter. The powers will ensure that the regulator is not subjected to the fear of speculative or obstructive litigation. We have had lengthy discussions about fishing exercises by the regulator. This is the other side of the coin--people using obstructive litigation to limit the operation of the regulator. Of course people will have the right to seek damages if the regulator can be shown to have acted in bad faith, but we want the regulator to be free to act as necessary. That is why existing legislation gives immunities to the FSA and the Bank, providing that they act in good faith. The clause simply extends the same sort of immunity to the FSA's new functions in relation to money market institutions and money market settlement services. Fundamentally, the wording follows section 1(4) of the Banking Act 1987, which will apply to the FSA when the Bill comes into force, as the Committee has approved.
<P>
The Opposition amendments would undermine the FSA's ability to supervise in a determined but proportionate way--a supervision that the Committee has discussed. If the amendment were agreed to, Opposition Members would in effect encourage a regime that they railed against last week, which would involve back-watching and over-regulation. If the FSA could be sued for negligence not only in circumstances in which it acted in bad faith, that could encourage it to collect more information than it needs to carry out its purposes. That could result in tougher minimum standards.
<P>
Last week, I had a lengthy discussion with the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) about the regulator's power to collect information under the regulation and the uses to which it would end up being put.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the Economic Secretary suggesting that the new FSA will take important decisions that concern its clients on the basis of insufficient information?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to last week's Hansard. The Committee discussed the matter fully, and it agreed to the relevant clauses. I see little point in going over old ground.
<P>
It is strange that Opposition Members want more intrusive regulation for the wholesale market institutions that the hon. Member for Guildford was so exercised about last week. He appeared to favour less intrusive rather than more intrusive regulation for wholesale market institutions.
<P>
I should have thought that the Committee could agree that the FSA should not be negligent in discharging its functions, and that it should be held to account. There is, however, an appropriate way of ensuring that. Hon. Members have referred to existing powers. It is not clear why the previous Government did not consider it necessary to include immunities in respect of the functions of section 43 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and of section 171 of the Companies Act 1989. It would be anomalous to provide immunities for some supervisory functions and not for others.
<P>
With regard to the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I repeat that the previous regime was self-regulatory. The Government are seeking to begin the process of establishing a statutory regime. We are not changing the application of the Financial Services Act with this legislation, which is not about self-regulatory organisations. The next Bill will deal with that. The Bill will put one part of the Bank of England's functions into the FSA. It will ensure that between now and the passing of new financial services legislation the FSA has proper powers to ensure that it can act appropriately and that no eye is allowed to be taken off the ball. The Committee discussed that last week.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton reminded the Committee of his background in law and accountancy. Law and accountancy firms are not involved in day-to-day financial regulation. The hon. Gentleman did not compare like with like. They have an important compliance role. When hon. Members debate financial services legislation next year, we will have much to say. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will favour the Government with his views during the consultation process, both under the FSA, and under the draft Bill that will be published in May or June 1998. It is important to compare like with like.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley (asked what the position was overseas in relation to negligent behaviour. The Bill has limited objectives in that respect. As I pointed out to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, it is not the aim of this legislation to reform the whole structure of financial services regulation; that will be the aim of a future Bill. This Bill seeks to enshrine the existing structure under a new authority. We will certainly consider the international experience; indeed, as we speak, work is being undertaken to ensure that the Bill incorporates best practice. I have stressed several times in Committee the importance of best practice and of the Government analysing what happens in other countries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My question concerned operatives in other countries who are responsible for the supervisory function of the banking system. I understand that, in this context, we are talking not about self-regulatory organisations, but about the supervisory functions in central banks or other institutions in France, Germany and America. Is their liability limited to acts or omissions in bad faith, or can they also be liable for negligence? That is a specific question to which the Committee would like an answer.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Frankley, the one thing that I know such organisations will not have is Crown immunity. That was unduly exercising the Committee earlier this morning. I will check on that and I will give the hon. Gentleman an answer when we come to clause stand part. The difference between Labour Members and Conservative Members is that we do not assume that we know it all. That is perhaps one of the reasons why we won the election on 1 May.
<P>
 I stress again that the Bill aims to ensure that existing protections are made available to the FSA in discharging its responsibility. I stress also, as I did last week, that it is important that regulation is proportionate to the needs of the consumer and that it is implemented in such a way that the regulator has the necessary freedom and flexibility to act. That view is held throughout the financial community. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tried to suggest that narrowing immunity is bound to lead to information being collected just in case. That is not our intention and I refer him to our interesting and productive debate last week about the information-collecting powers of the FSA and the use to which they would be put. I cannot work out the hon. Gentleman's purpose in seeking to set that hare running again, when the Committee has already discussed the matter and come to a conclusion.
<P>
I ask the Committee to resist the amendments because they would disproportionately enlarge regulatory powers and limit the effectiveness of the regulator, which I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would not want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We had a remarkable statement from the Economic Secretary that our amendment would threaten to set up an over-regulatory regime. That does not follow at all. We are alert to the dangers of over-regulation in international competition and in our domestic arrangements. The proper functioning of a market is inhibited if regulation is too heavy-handed, onerous and expensive for the institutions at the receiving end. The question of over-regulation is sensitive, but how does making the FSA more accountable at law for its actions and mistakes entail over-regulation? The Government's approach is misguided if their only defence against over-regulation is to exempt the FSA from legal action in response to a range of infringements.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Economic Secretary referred to the danger of obstructive litigation. As Members of Parliament, we all know from our constituencies how some members of the public engage in vexatious and frivolous litigation, but that is not true of banks or financial institutions that may be subject to serious incompetence, negligence or bias from an authority to which the duty of supervision has been transferred.
<P>
Regrettably, people often feel aggrieved. We hope that they would not resort to the law. We know the FSA's intentions, and that it is well led and performs its duties in a professional spirit. Even so, the law is a long-stop procedure. The Economic Secretary's response--that the dangers of obstructive litigation should make the authority effectively immune from liability for damages, except where it acts in bad faith--is pretty weak.
<P>
The spectre of over-regulation can and should be dealt with in ways other than by making it subject to a light civil law regime. The Economic Secretary also set off a hare about the dangers of obstructive litigation, but that is essentially irrelevant. The two strands of her defence are therefore rather weak, and unless she can enlighten us further, Opposition members will wish to express their dissatisfaction with her response by pressing the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should like to add a few words to what my right hon. Friend has said. I, too, was surprised by the phrase ``obstructive litigation''. It is not easy, even for a large bank but especially for a small one, to take legal action against the state or a statutory body. The power and infinite resources of the state are not taken on simply in a bid to obstruct matters. That would happen only in cases of clear negligence or actions that are in breach of the duty of care.
<P>
Does the Economic Secretary expect the staff of the new FSA to act negligently or in breach of their duty of care? I presume not, so I do not understand why the Government do not accept the amendment. The FSA is not being set up with the intention that it should undertake its duties in a negligent manner. The amendment would ensure that the FSA would review its work and offer different criteria for levels of seniority. It would also ensure that the authority has the phrase ``risk management'' in its lexicon. Unless there is the risk that legal action could be taken, the notion of risk management will become redundant for the people running the authority.
<P>
It is imperative that it is possible for the authority to be sued for negligent conduct. That is a reasonable request, and the Government should accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I wish to make a brief point. I could have been nastier in my opening remarks, I suppose. It could be argued that the Opposition are trying to make the regulator over-cautious and thus reduce the impact of the Bill. I would hate to think that that was their intention, but be that as it may, they have not put a good case for the amendments. Indeed, everything that they have said over the past couple of weeks has been stood on its head. If we accepted the amendments, we would constrain the efficiency of the regulator to such an extent that we would significantly reduce the strength of regulation in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I find that astonishing. The hon. Lady seems to be digging a bigger hole for herself.
<P>
Yes, we seek over-caution. One must be cautious in every sphere of activity, whether one is a legal adviser, an accountant or a regulator. It is remarkable that the Economic Secretary should say that preventing FSA employees from acting negligently would somehow constrain their activity. That implies that she is expecting FSA employees to act negligently. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells is pressing the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend puts it well. The hon. Lady is getting into some difficulty. Our amendments have nothing to do with making the regulator over-cautious--that is an irrelevance. If Labour Members have any regard for fairness in dealings between the state and individuals, they ought to join us in wanting to ensure that in discharging its functions, the authority exercises normal duties of care, comes up to an expected level of professionalism and is competent in its dealings with the financial institutions that it regulates. Nothing in that would make it over-cautious or over-regulate.
<P>
There are many examples of the state interacting with citizens or the business sector, and it is rightly subject to rules in the same way as a private body which deals with customers has to operate within the law--both the common law and several statutes that ensure a degree of competence and professionalism. No one suggests that the Sale of Goods Acts and other such statutes somehow make shopkeepers over-cautious in their dealings with customers. That is a grotesque misrepresentation of the objects of Parliament and what should be the aims of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has still not explained why, if the provision was good enough for the previous Government, he now objects to the change. Under the existing legislation, which was introduced by the previous Government, there was liability only in the case of bad faith. We are talking about the same functions, but being performed by a different body.
<P>
It is no use drawing a distinction between the self-regulation of the past and regulation now. The existing system was not totally self-regulatory, and the new system will not be totally regulatory. The right hon. Gentleman is taking a totally inconsistent approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I know that you, Mr. Butterfill, would not want us to repeat what we said earlier in the debate. However, the Financial Services Act 1986, which is possibly the Act to which the hon. Gentleman referred, was debated in the House more than a decade ago. It was not in the minds of hon. Members at that time to transfer the banking supervisory function to a body outside the Bank of England. We are now considering a different regulatory structure.
<P>
Furthermore, there has since been a shift in the perception of the duties owed by the public sector to the citizen and the customer. Indeed, the thrust of the citizens charter and all that went with it was to shift the balance in favour of the public whom we serve. It is fully in line with that thinking to revisit some of those immunities and legal structures, perhaps bringing them into line with what we had developed by the time we left office. To express our dismay at this red herring about over-regulation and over-caution, we wish to divide the Committee on the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Economic Secretary was going to respond to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds on similar bodies overseas.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I said that I would come back to that point at some stage in the debate, but the hon. Gentleman obviously wants instant gratification.
<P>
The question was whether overseas supervisors have liabilities limited in this way. It is generally accepted internationally that supervisors must have adequate immunity to allow them to discharge their functions. The form of the immunity varies from country to country. The provisions enshrine the powers of the existing immunity. As I pointed out when I intervened earlier, much work is being done on international examples to find best practice. There is much to be learnt not only from the successes of regulators in other countries but from the areas wherein they have experienced difficulties. I can promise that whenever the second Bill--under whose provisions this discussion would be more appropriate--is considered in Committee, it will be with some body of knowledge as to how the existing regulators have carried out their functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> There is not much point consulting on the liability regime in respect of supervisory banking functions when the relevant provisions are already in the Bill. The Government will not be able to consult. I am not, for the purposes of this discussion, talking about the SROs, but about part III of the Bill which relates to the supervisory functions of the banking regime. It is in that context that I pose the question. What system of liability operates in France, Germany and America? Is the liability regime for operatives who supervise the banking system more or less like, or the same as, acts or omissions in bad faith attracting liability to those operatives? I am not talking about future consultation on SROs, but specifically about the liability regime for banking supervision. That is what the clause refers to, rather than SROs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the discussion that we have had endlessly. I am beginning to think that I need a little sign to put up every so often. The purpose of what we are doing at the moment is to reverse the existing structure of banking supervision into the FSA. The next piece of legislation, which will come before us next year, may reform that system of banking supervision, gleaned from the conclusions of our fairly substantial consultation process. The first part of that process is taking place at present, and the next part will start in May or June next year when we put the draft Bill out for consultation.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman would like further details on the structures of immunities that exist in other countries, I will happily arrange for Treasury officials to write to him. But I stress again that the purpose of this Bill is to discuss reversing banking supervision out of the Bank of England into the FSA and to ensure that the FSA has adequate powers and protections to allow it to carry out its work.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to charge fees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 10, line 39, leave out `an' and insert `a reasonable and proportionate'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to consider amendment No. 59, in page 10, line 41, after second `of', insert `reasonable and proportionate'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The clause concerns the power to charge fees. It is most important, because we are really talking about a power of taxation. Therefore, we should be clear about what is being proposed, who will exercise these powers and what restraint will be put on them.
<P>
In our most recent debate, the Economic Secretary referred to the danger of over-regulation. I am glad that she is alert to the danger. In its most obvious form, the fees set would be for the convenience of the regulator and would become onerous for the banks and institutions that had to pay it. The Committee should take this opportunity to set up a countervailing pressure to ensure that the authority uses the power wisely and with full regard to the potential consequences of excessive fees. All fees levied by public bodies are equivalent to taxation and are therefore anti-competitive. Having said that, we realise that these regulations, and the regulator, have to be paid for. Indeed, it is preferable that such expenditure should not come out of general taxation but should be levied on the City and the institutions concerned.
<P>
We have no quarrel with the structure, but we want to ensure that the power is not abused and that the level of fees is not set out in legislation. Doing so in primary legislation would be far too cumbersome, nor should such fees be set out in secondary legislation.
<P>
The House will have no further opportunity to express a view on the level of such fees. We know from the Bill that there is to be consultation about this. Consultation is fine, but it goes only so far, particularly as the form proposed makes no requirement that the submissions should be public or the result published. Therefore, the authority could go through the motions of consultation, no one would know the outcome, and it could then raise its fees regardless of the economic and financial effect.
<P>
It is the Government's expressed intention that the present leaders of the FSA and those involved in the issue should not abuse their position in this way. There should be no empire building, and they will try to run a tight ship. But this piece of legislation may well endure for a good many years.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I referred the right hon. Gentleman the other day to ``Paying for banking supervision'', which he said that he had read. Paragraph 10 says that the FSA considers that the principles on which charges should be imposed include the principle that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The charge should be proportionate to some measure of the size of the bank and the nature and extent of its business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that not have a resonance with the right hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman has helpfully contributed to the debate because he makes my point for me. It is always helpful for the Opposition to have support from Labour Members. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that that phrase is helpful and I agreed with that part of the consultation document. That is why I want it included in the Bill. Long after the document to which the hon. Gentleman referred has been forgotten, the Bill will remain in statute law and people will have to obey it. It is important that the correct objectives in the statement of intent, to which we can all subscribe, should be enshrined in legislation. All our amendments, therefore, are modest, and the amendment would ensure that the words ``reasonable and proportionate'' were inserted into clause 26. With those few words, I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> State-run organisations have a tendency to expand and, to repeat the phrase used by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, to empire build. There are many academic theories that explain why that happens, in particular, the public choice theory and the rational choice theory, which say that the status and pay of a self-interested civil servant working for the new FSA will be determined to a large extent by the number of people employed in that particular sector. The larger that sector, the higher the status of the civil servant and the more his remuneration will increase in the long run.
<P>
That has been the tendency of many state-run organisations and it is one of many reasons why I favour the private sector, which generally carries out functions more cheaply and efficiently than does the state sector. Clearly, regulation must be carried out either by the state sector or under a self-regulatory regime. We are not talking about privatisation, but it is important to recognise that those tendencies exist within the state and public-funded sector. That is because there is no threat of the state going bankrupt and thus no subsidiary of the state can go bankrupt. There is nothing like the threat of looming bankruptcy to ensure that an organisation keeps its costs under control. The FSA will have no such pressures and under clause 26 it will be able simply to pass on any increase in costs to the hapless sector that it is regulating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the regulator will not object if the fees increase too much? Surely it will apply pressure to keep fees low.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> An objection carries no legal weight. The clause says merely that a condition of being regulated could be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``requiring the payment of an application fee''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (b) then states that it could be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``requiring the payment of periodic fees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One could object until one was blue in the face but the wording is clear: to be regulated by the FSA, one will need to pay fees. I have received similar responses to many of my letters to state organisations. They state that it clearly says in the legislation that one must pay fees. They say, ``Our costs are x and we are therefore forced to charge this particular fee''.
<P>
The amendment is modest and would simply require the fees, including periodic fees, to be reasonable and proportionate. It does not require the Government dramatically to change the Bill, but merely to impose on the FSA--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> It is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes, as the hon. Gentleman says, it is a helpful amendment. There are no pressures on state organisations to keep their costs under control. The drafting of the clause means that the FSA's costs can be passed straight through to the banking sector. The banks can complain as much as they or the hon. Member for Dudley, North may like, but they will have no redress.
<P>
The amendment would give banks or other organisations regulated by the FSA a means of redress. They could say that the legislation required that the FSA charge reasonable fees, and compare that with the way in which the FSA has increased its costs and head count over the years. Any court of law might consider that a fee rise of x per cent. over x number of years was not reasonable.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which offers the only way to prevent costs from escalating in the new statutory body that the Government are establishing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I wish briefly to reinforce the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. When the changes were announced, strong theories were expressed about the costs that might be imposed as a result. The chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority, Mr. Durlacher, said that the new SFA was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a very large body. We have to make sure it does not become too bureaucratic.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same could be said of the regulatory framework being devised for the banks. The proposals were also criticised by the head of a European credit ratings agency, who said that the Government were in danger of creating
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a huge and unresponsive bureaucracy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Government have an opportunity to show that they are responsive and prepared to acknowledge the unease that has been expressed. It would not be burdensome for them to accept the amendment; it would be a constructive response to a constructive proposal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> What causes me to raise an eyebrow at the amendment is the Opposition's desire to amend only that part of the clause that deals with fees for money market institutions. The implication is that Opposition Members are not worried about fees in other parts of the sector to be regulated.
<P>
My generosity leads me to believe that the amendment is flawed because of a drafting error, but to change the clause only on behalf of money market institutions would not be acceptable. We must get the matter in perspective. Opposition Members seem to have forgotten last week's debate on clause 21, which details the FSA's control of the fee structure. It was pointed out that the forthcoming financial services Bill will include statutory objectives. The FSA will have a statutory duty, which has already been announced, to be efficient and economic and to ensure that costs and restrictions on firms are proportional to the benefits of supervision.
<P>
As I and the Chief Secretary have explained, and as was outlined on Second Reading, we take the fee structure for regulation very seriously. That is one reason for the present consultation process.
<P>
In addition, because supervision after transfer will no longer be financed with income from cash ratio deposits, there has to be a regime to allow the setting of fees. The new regime will be much more transparent, in that it will allow for consultation on the fee structure. It will not concentrate solely on the setting of fees, which is more abstract.
<P>
At the launch of the FSA a few weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear that the authority must keep to its statutory objectives to be efficient and economic. I do not dispute the importance of the fee levying regime. The cost of regulation must be proportionate to the benefits, but the amendment is so restrictive that it applies only to money market institutions. Therefore, I must ask the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am well aware that the amendment applies only to some institutions. We are trying to establish a principle. If the Economic Secretary accepts our argument, it is for the Government to bring forward the right technical changes to give the amendment effect throughout the Bill. She should accept our proposals in that spirit.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has other, pressing duties in the House, but had he been present for the discussion on clause 21 he would know that the issue has been fully discussed. The Government have made it clear that they want fees to be proportionate and reasonable; in fact, we have gone further in announcing the statutory objectives of the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am well aware that those debates took place, but the Economic Secretary's assurances are inadequate. Even if she could deliver, she will not always be in her current post. The Bill will become binding when enacted, but she has no power to intervene in the detail of the setting of fees. The procedure is set out in the Bill. There must be consultation, but the outcomes of submissions are not binding and results do not even have to be published. Even if the Economic Secretary is determined to keep fees down, she does not have the power to ensure that, in the long term, fees do not rise above what we would consider to be fair and proportionate. That is why we want the Bill to include a safeguard.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The right hon. Gentleman wants that safeguard only for money market institutions. I shall be generous and assume that that is a drafting error, but he should explain why only those institutions should be protected. He should be well aware that the FSA is to have specific statutory duties to be efficient and economic and to ensure that costs and restrictions on firms are proportionate to the benefits of supervision. That is not a personal guarantee; it will be enshrined in the statutory objectives of the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Each time the Economic Secretary intervenes the poverty of her case becomes even clearer. She again makes the point that the amendment is technically defective. That is of no interest. She knows perfectly well that if she accepted the spirit of the amendment, her advisers and parliamentary draftsmen could design a comprehensive amendment that would take account of our arguments. Her objection is trivial and wide of the mark.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> A good case could be made that some money market institutions are among those most vulnerable to overcharging by the regime. We do not intend to limit the proposal to the money market institutions, but a justifiable case could be made for protecting them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point--we have hit the right target. The Economic Secretary should examine the substance of our case rather than the trivia. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, public bodies have a tendency--an impulse--to expand. They do not operate in the marketplace and are not subject to the disciplines of competition. Other disciplines must be placed upon them to ensure that they do not abuse what might, by analogy, be called their market position. That should be done by writing constraints upon them into law. Although the constraints under the Bill may place on such bodies an overriding duty to be efficient and economic, that could not prevent them from increasing their fees and expanding their empire in a way that could be detrimental to the organisations that they regulate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman's case rests on the situation in the wholesale money markets, can he adduce evidence before the Committee that the money market institutions presently object to the level of fees? As he knows, there is no statutory basis at present for the level of fee setting. Does he or his hon. Friend know of any objections to the present level of fees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I can only refer the hon. Gentleman to the notes on clauses, which make it clear that the provision is a new departure. The Economic Secretary said herself that we are going over to a different fee structure to replace the cash deposit system that has funded the Bank of England's duties and its supervisory functions until now. A new system of fees and charging is to be put in place. Whether we support the transfer taking place is a different matter but, given that it will happen, we prefer it to be done by fees rather than under the present system.
<P>
However, in supporting the new system we want to ensure that constraints are placed on the level of charges. Given that the Government want the entire organisation to be run in a lean and fit manner and to discharge its duties efficiently and economically, they should have no objection to making their intention explicit in the clause that relates to the level of charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to make a brief point in response to that raised by the hon. Member for Dudley, North. The voluntary nature of the current cash ratio deposit regime, in itself, provides the pressure for the Bank to keep its costs under control. If costs escalate, the voluntary agreement to pay in the cash ratio deposits will terminate. Given that we are now moving on to a statutory basis with no voluntary element, we are trying to build into the statute a form of reasonableness to ensure that the regime does not allow costs to escalate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has again completely misunderstood the purpose of the clause. I now regret that I mentioned cash ratio deposits, because the phrase seems to have locked itself into his brain. It keeps popping up like a Jack-in-the-box.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to cover the overall funding of the Financial Services Authority. We dealt in an earlier part of the Bill with cash ratio deposits for the funding of the Bank of England, moving it from a voluntary system to a statutory basis. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North about the existing self-regulatory organisations was correct. There is agreement among organisations about the level of costs for regulations. Somebody said from a sedentary position said that there were organisations that want to be covered by regulation, but which are refusing to pay the appropriate costs.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells has evaded the point; the amendment is narrowly crafted and relates only to money market institutions. The hon. Member for Guildford could have let the cat out of the bag but, in the spirit of the season, I shall not pursue his remarks. It could be claimed that there was special pleading for money market institutions. 
<P>
The spirit of the amendment is wrong, in that it would alter the operation of the consultation process. In absolute, practical terms, it would be wrong for the Committee to accept it, as it relates to only a narrow part of the costing regime. 
<P>
As part of the conditions, the Treasury already has to approve any fees set under sections 43 and 171, so that it can ensure that they are reasonable and proportionate. It is regrettable that Conservative members of the Committee have not seen the error in the amendment, and it is important that we oppose it.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 11, line 19, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3C) A condition of the imposition of fees under Schedule 6 is that, in any year following 1997 they should not, taken together with the implied value of the cash ratio deposits for the time being required to be maintained under section 6, exceed the total amount of such fees payable in 1997, adjusted for inflation, unless both Houses, by resolution, have given their approval for that amount to be exceeded.'.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 61, in page 11, line 19, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3D) It shall be principle of the charging of fees under Schedule 6 that no cross-subsidy shall arise between different financial service sectors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Amendment No. 60 would put a cap on the total amount of money raised under the section, which would fit the Government's intentions. The Government and the FSA have said that they expect the total sum--both notional and actual--raised through fees and through the cash ratio deposit will be no greater than at present. It follows that the amount raised through the cash ratio deposit should fall to make way for the new source of fee or tax featured in the Bill. If the FSA enables economies of scale to be made, that is admirable, and we hope that the overall burden will be reduced.
<P>
Through amendment No. 60, we want to transfer those laudable objectives into the Bill. The limit would provide considerable reassurance to the financial sector. Some people in the City and elsewhere believe that Parliament should be much more closely involved in the setting of fees through periodic statutory instrument or secondary legislation, which would enable us to assent to any changes.
<P>
Failing that--it is clearly not part of the Government's intentions--there is much to be said for an overall limit, which would reassure not just those who are currently subject to the supervisory regime, but potential players in the market. This cocuntry is waging a pitiless struggle for international competitiveness, nowhere more keenly than in the financial sector and the City of London. It would help London, and the United Kingdom generally, to remain the preferred location for inward investment and the relocation of foreign banks if Parliament was seen to take an interest in the fee burden and to ensure that, as a result of the Bill, it does not rise and could fall.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 61 seeks to prevent cross subsidy. It is felt in some quarters that it may be easier, or more expedient, for the authority to raise more money from one sector than from another. A large amount of cross subsidy already exists under the present structure; indeed, the cash ratio deposit is a gigantic cross subsidy, which causes some resentment. We should take the opportunity, in schedule 6, to ensure no cross subsidy. The Economic Secretary have well-founded objections, but the intention is surely reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I support my right hon. Friend's amendment. As we said when debating a previous amendment, it is important that the costs of the institution are kept under control. The Government resisted our amendments to clause 6 and schedule 2, in which we sought to limit the level of remuneration for the remaining part of the Bank of England. We are now trying to put similar restraints on the fee-raising ability of the new institution in clause 26 and schedule 6.
<P>
The Library's briefing paper quotes from the Bill's regulatory appraisal, published by the Treasury in October 1997. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is intended that the aggregate burden on financial institutions of both the new Cash Ratio Deposits and the cost of banking supervision (which is already the subject of consultation by the FSA) will be no higher than the present Deposit scheme, and preferably somewhat lower.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary confirm whether that is still the Government's intention? If it is, I hope that she will accept the amendments, which seek to incorporate that expressed desire into statute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I rise reluctantly, but the Opposition do not seem able to grasp what the Government are doing. In our debate on the changes to be made to section 43 of the Financial Services Act 1986, the Opposition did not seem to appreciate that section 43 of that Act deals with the wholesale money markets and the listing system. The hon. Member for Guildford claims to be an expert on the matter; he should have known that clause 26 deals only with a limited segment--admission to a list under the grey book system.
<P>
In this case, the Opposition do not seem to appreciate the purpose of paragraph 1(3) of schedule 6, which makes it quite clear that fees raised by the authority are to be used only on banking supervision. There can be no cross subsidisation. On that point, the amendment is completely irrelevant. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has made it clear that costs will be kept down, and Howard Davies has constantly reiterated the point. The second group of amendments is completely off beam. I wonder what the Opposition are playing at this morning.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Mr. Howard Davies, the new head of the regulatory organisation, was quoted earlier as saying how he met Mr. Paul Volcker in New York, who told him that he hoped that during the setting up of super-SIB he would retain his sense of humour. At least the Secretary of State has retained her sense of humour in our discussions. Given the appearance of her Treasury colleague, the Paymaster General, I thought at one point that we would be treated to the Liddell and Large show, but he has decided to leave us again. Perhaps he feels that he has entertained us enough in the past week through his revelations, which must have surprised the hon. Lady more than anything Conservative Members have said in Committee.
<P>
I congratulate the Economic Secretary on having retained her sense of humour. I imagine that nothing amused her more than our special pleading, in the previous amendment, for a section of the financial services industry. Through that and the present amendment, we seek repeatedly to return to what may well be the Achilles' heel of the Government's proposals--their cost. It is well known that the growth of the London markets after the war owed a great deal to regulatory costs in other centres. For example, President Kennedy's introduction of ``regulation K'', which imposed a cost on deposits for New York banks, started the euro-dollar markets in London--from which a great deal of the City's success grew, as a large oak tree can grow from a small acorn. Our concern is that the large oak tree may be cut down by the new imposts that are being imposed by a Government who are not afraid to dress up taxation under many different guises--as people are learning to their cost, only a few months into the new Administration.
<P>
The issue of cross subsidy has been mentioned. I am not at all satisfied by the suggestion of the hon. Member for Dudley, North that that is sorted out in schedule 6 because, by deeming that the costs of regulating the banking system should be larger, a subsidy to other areas of super-SIB's responsibility and control could be disguised. It is simply not enough to rely on the fact that the charges being levied on the banks relate to their own supervision. How those costs are calculated is at the discretion of super-SIB, and that is a real concern.
<P>
I hope that in replying to our comments, the Economic Secretary will consider the amendments constructively and recognise that the Opposition are returning, with no apology, to the major concern over cost. She cannot do enough to reassure us but she can certainly try in her response to state how the Government will ensure, as a matter of principle, that they endorse the spirit of the amendments, even if the hon. Lady is not prepared to accept them in practice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am glad that I am retaining my sense of humour, although I wish to state that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General is of svelte proportions. I was worried that the hon. Member for Guildford was going to apply the ``Large'' to me.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment because it is inappropriate. I hark back to our earlier debate; we have already discussed at considerable length the role of the FSA, its statutory objective to be efficient and economic, and the continuing consultation on charging. On cash ratio deposits--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> rose --
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I encourage the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to keep calm long enough to allow me to finish the sentence. The setting and subsequent changing of the cash ratio deposit value bands and ratios will require the approval of both Houses by the affirmative resolution procedure. To seek to return to the issue in that manner would be to remove the FSA's responsibility to operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
<P>
As for amendment No. 61, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North was spot on. The amendment is unnecessary; there cannot be cross subsidy from banking supervision fees to any other function of the FSA. Paragraph 1(3) of schedule 6 clearly defines the purposes for which fees can be charged and clearly excludes other regulatory functions. If Committee members read the schedule, they will see how specific it is. In addition, the FSA will not operate in a vacuum; its accounts will have to be audited. Indeed, if there were evidence that the FSA could hide behind discretion to bring in a degree of cross subsidy, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Guildford, that would be unlawful. It could not do that, which is one of the reasons why I say that amendment No. 61 is unnecessary.
<P>
I reiterate that the costs of regulation are an important factor, which is why the Government have been so specific in stating the statutory objectives for the FSA and providing for the establishment of cash ratio deposits on a statutory basis, which will ensure that changes to CRDs can be brought about only by the affirmative resolution procedures of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary was trying to be reasonably helpful, so I think that we are satisfied with her response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Banking Supervision Fees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 39, line 9, after ``them'', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`having regard to the principal categories of undertakings, their size, and the sectors in which they operate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 63, in page 39, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) A summary of the representations referred to in paragraph 2(1)(b) shall at the same time be printed and made available to the public with or without payment, and copies of the representations themselves (other than any representations which the person making them has requested be treated as confidential) shall also be made available to the public during a period and in such manner as may be determined by the Authority with or without payment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The schedule is important in elaborating the procedures to be followed by the authority with regard to fees. The importance of the issue of fees has already been stressed, so I shall not repeat it. However, I wish to explore the form of consultation with which the authority will be bound. It is imperative that all those affected in each category should be informed in advance about the consultation and told its results. In the spirit of openness and accountability, which we are told pervades the legislation, it is vital that unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, the results of the consultation and the submissions made to the authority should be available. On occasion, information may be given to the authority in confidence. We are all familiar with the argument that if everything has to be disclosed, some people are a good deal less candid about what they say. There is always a case for confidentiality, but when that case is not made, everything should be available for the public gaze. Justice will then be done and seen to be done.
<P>
There is a requirement under paragraph 2(1)(b) of the schedule that the authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have regard to any representations duly made''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to it. That is a requirement, but how are we to know that it is being complied with? The best way of achieving that is to ensure that submissions to the authority are publicly available. Outsiders--and, indeed, those making the submissions--could then judge whether the authority had responded properly.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A bank could, for example, write to the authority with a complaint and then find that its entreaties had been ignored. The authority may intimate to that bank that it was alone in its complaint, that everyone was happy with the way in which the authority was going and that it could not possibly change its fee structure simply to suit an individual complainant. The authority's case could be proved if the bank or institution in question could examine the representations to find out whether it was alone. If, on the other hand, it became clear, that many other people or institutions had made the same point, there would be an obvious moral obligation--if no other--on the authority to modify its fee structure. In extreme cases, it could be shown that the authority was breaching the requirements of schedule 6(2)(b) by wilfully ignoring or overturning well-founded objections. For these matters to be open is not only right in principle; it would provide an assurance that the authority was bound by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that he was keen to bear down on costs. Would not the publication of all such submissions add to the cost of regulation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Gentleman glanced at our amendment, he would find that it provides for payment to be required. If the authority wanted to recoup the cost, it could therefore do so. I think that that disposes of the hon. Gentleman's objection.
<P>
I do not anticipate the provision being widely used, but its availability would in itself be a check on the authority. We are not distrusting in advance the authority's motives--indeed, we have paid tribute to the people whom we understand are likely to run it. We are, however, legislating for the long term and it is up to the Committee to look for ways of putting reasonable constraints on the authority to ensure that it does not ignore the wishes of the bodies that it regulates and that it abides by the Bill's other provisions. All that should be done in a non-bureaucratic way without over-regulation. The submissions to the authority will be made anyway; we want them to be made available merely on request and, possibly, on payment of a fee.
<P>
If the Economic Secretary suspected that the authority was not having regard to representations made to it, what powers would she or her successor have to override it in setting fees? She may well have such powers--although that would not invalidate our amendment--but if she could not intervene in the minutiae of the fee structure, that would lend additional weight and importance to our amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am not terribly clear about the aim of amendment No. 62. As the right hon. Member for Wells has said, paragraph 2 of the schedule clearly requires the FSA to bring proposals to the attention of those who are affected. I do not understand how having regard to the different categories of institution that will be affected will change that clear requirement.
<P>
The FSA has already issued its proposals for a fee-charging scheme. It has been made clear that the proposed scheme for banking supervision fees will mean that fees are proportionate to size, which may be the real concern that underlies amendment No. 62. That means that smaller institutions would be required to make a smaller cash ratio deposit than larger institutions.
<P>
The consultation exercise will conclude on 12 December. The FSA must take into account the responses when it publishes its detailed proposals for the financial year 1998-99 early in 1998.
<P>
As I have said on several occasions, the FSA is committed also to much more comprehensive consultation on fee charging. That relates more to the powers in the Bill that will be introduced in autumn next year. As regards that consultation, the FSA has already said that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will seek to allocate costs of regulation over supervised entities in a way which takes account of the costs of their regulation, their size, the range and complexity of their business, and the risks they present to the system''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That relates to some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Wells on amendment No. 62.
<P>
On amendment No. 63, it is important to say that the Bill puts in place merely the procedure that has applied to fees that are charged by the FSA under the Financial Services Act 1986. That procedure has worked perfectly satisfactorily for the past nine years and no further duty needs to be placed on the Financial Services Authority. The Bill will require it to consult and to have regard to the responses that are gleaned in the consultation. The FSA is already aware of its responsibilities in that regard.
<P>
The right hon. Member or Wells made a valid point when he said that, in certain circumstances, institutions would not wish information to be in the public domain. It is also important that all the institutions that are affected are consulted and told the results of the consultation. That will be the case--paragraph 2(1)(a) states that the FSA must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``bring the proposals to the attention of those likely to be affected''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 4(1) sets out the responsibility to make fees public. Once that has happened, bills will start dropping through letterboxes.
<P>
Why have the Government used the expression ``have regard''? The FSA has a responsibility to consider representations, but it must also take into account the fact that they may conflict. It must form a balanced judgment that is based on the nature of the representations that it has received.
<P>
There is nothing to prevent the FSA from publishing the results of the consultation if it sees fit. I am sure that it will be sensitive to the needs of the industry, should it require further reassurance on these matters. It would not, however, be appropriate to include further requirements in the Bill. The Committee is discussing a system and consultation regime that have operated well for the past nine years. They will be enshrined in the FSA's statutory responsibilities. I do not understand why the Opposition are pressing amendment No. 62. It is not necessary, because of the factors that I have mentioned. Amendment No. 63 is therefore not necessary either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In supporting the amendments, it is the Opposition's turn to be surprised. That is because the Government are seeking to usher greater openness into the making of public policy with their proposals for a freedom of information Act. The amendment is sensible and uncontroversial, and it would improve the quality of the legislation, especially schedule 6. Will the Economic Secretary respond to the City opinion, especially as expressed by the British Bankers Association, that there is a need for practitioners to understand the processes that the FSA has gone through to produce a specific set of figures?
<P>
Paragraph 2(1)(b) imposes a clear statutory duty on the FSA. I do not believe that any Committee members--especially lawyers and, in my case, non-practising lawyers--want the FSA to commit the tort of breach of statutory duty. There is a strong possibility that it will do so and open itself up to a civil proceeding, because there is no check on what it considers, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells so ably pointed out. The FSA will have discretion to consider consultations. Clearly, paragraph 2(1)(b) permits it to ignore all of them, and to say that it disagrees with all of them and will do its own thing. In such a case, the FSA would be discharging its statutory duty properly--the Opposition understand that. There is, however, a demand for the matter to be clarified. That has been expressed clearly by the British Bankers Association and by other City practitioners.
<P>
The amendment deserves the Committee's support for another reason. Paragraph 3 shows that the regulations will not be examined by the House. Openness and transparency are therefore all the more important. Hon. Members must satisfy the legitimate anxiety of City practitioners.
<P>
Before the Economic Secretary responds to those practical points, I shall ask a final question. I know that she tries her best, and that she often succeeds in enlightening Opposition Members. To which bodies does the consultation apply? The matter relates to exempt money-market institutions under the Financial Services Act 1986, and to section 171 of the Companies Act 1989, which concerns persons involved in clearing services. It is not immediately apparent in the schedule's drafting that the consultation relates to the relevant two types of institutions. Opposition Members and practitioners would be grateful for clarification of how those institutions are covered by the consultation process that schedule 6 will effect.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds spoke of the need for practitioners to understand the charging regime. We are well aware of that point; it comes through clearly in the consultation exercise and the documents that were released by the Financial Services Authority on the day of the launch, and also in the speeches made by the chairman of the FSA and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the launch on 28 October.
<P>
In a wider context, the Government are anxious to ensure that practitioners have a day-to-day involvement in the operation of the Financial Services Authority. Both the Chancellor and I have invited firms in the industry to consider setting up a process of secondment so that practitioners are involved thereafter for a period of time in the regulation process. That has been seen to be extremely effective in the takeover panel, in which there is an exchange between industry and what could be assumed to be the regulator in that kind of setting.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In terms of the responsibility for practitioners to know the FSA's thinking on fees, the authority can certainly discuss that with the relevant practitioners. There is nothing to stop the practitioners revealing the advice that they have given the FSA on fees. It is not inconceivable that, in the real world in which we all operate, some institutions could claim that their level of fees should be in pennies rather than pounds. The FSA may have to try to instil some common sense into such a discussion. Ultimately, however, it must use its best judgement. That is what is did in its previous guise as the SIB, and that is what I believe it will continue to do in the future. The FSA could not continue to exist profitably or successfully if it put a barrier between itself and the day-to-day concerns of practitioners.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to the consultation proposed under schedule 6. That does not cover money market institutions and settlement services, but the Committee should be assured that the FSA will consult on those as well. The first part of the consultation process was specifically on the matters referred to by the Chief Secretary when he addressed the Committee some couple of weeks ago. The Treasury would not be prepared to approve any inclusion of fees or admission conditions that did not fully take into account an adequate consultation process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Why was there a failure to draft schedule 6 so as to cover money market institutions and clearing services? There is some concern in the City about why they are not in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I would not presume to challenge the decisions taken by parliamentary draftsmen. On money market institutions, however, our primary responsibility in this part of the Bill is the specific responsibility for direct banking supervision. We are also anxious that these consultations should not be unduly rushed. The Chief Secretary outlined our reasoning in moving cash ratio deposits from a voluntary to a statutory structure and the necessity for moving apace with that because of the nature of what was required in relation to the Bank of England's liquidity
<P>
We are anxious to have proper and longer-term consultation across the whole range of fee charging. Early in the new year, that process should come to a conclusion.
<P>
We are arguing about specific points of detail. I do not think that the amendments adequately address the issues that we are here to debate. Both sides of the House should be reassured that the Government take practitioner involvement and the level of fees very seriously. I remind the Committee that the Chief Secretary made it clear some two weeks ago not only that we do not want existing fees to increase but that, through economies of scale, there may be an opportunity to reduce them. As was said during our lengthy discussions on cash ratio deposits, moving from a voluntary to a statutory system allows those institutions that benefit from liquidity--such as the remaining mutual building societies--to play a part in the cash ratio deposit regime. Such institutions may not enjoy that new role, but the fact is that they benefit from the Bank's liquidity operations.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the points raised. I take this opportunity to make the wider point about the importance of the practitioners' role in creating a proper regulatory structure. Regulation will be effective only if the regulators have sufficient street wisdom to know what is possible and operate within the confine of fees that are proportionate to the value of the regulation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We find the Economic Secretary's response inadequate. She made a few pious generalisations and expressed the hope that the fees would not be excessive, but that is not good enough. She refuses to use the weapon of openness and accountability to ensure that the hope will be realised.
<P>
The Economic Secretary is becoming an apologist for Government secrecy. In opposition, the Labour party was always on about the importance of the public's right to know. It said that things should be published unless there were compelling reasons to keep them secret; we were advised to trust the public. The Government have torn up all those promises and forgotten all those speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman was not a Member of Parliament when those promises were made, but I am sure that he has brought to the House a vigorous commitment to open government. I am interested to know how he reconciles what I anticipate to be his beliefs with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> We are talking not about Government documents but about the industry's submissions on the level of fees. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, it is easy for the people who draw up the submissions to make them public. Why impose the obligation on the regulatory agency? I am fully in favour of open government; I only wish that the Conservative Government had been in favour of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is consistent; he always helps Conservative members of the Committee by making our point for us. If this was a question of government, there would be an alternative way of holding the institution to account--through the House of Commons. It is precisely because we are talking about an offshore agency, as it were, which is not under the direct control of the House of Commons, that it is essential that the Bill should regulate its behaviour.
<P>
Once the FSA is established and exercising its powers, we will have no further comeback. We will have no way of ensuring that paragraph 2(b) is being followed--that is my central point. I asked the Economic Secretary what powers she had to ensure that the law is being respected, and I await her answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The paragraph makes it clear that the FSA must take the industry's representations into account. The industry will know what it has told the FSA; it will know whether the FSA has had regard to its submissions and will jump up and down if the authority does not take them into account. I do not understand the right hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Let me put the case to the hon. Gentleman. Let us suppose a financial institution in Dudley, North that is regulated by the FSA gets hold of the draft regulations and makes a submission. How on earth will that institution have a comprehensive view of what the City or other institutions are saying to the FSA unless the authority publishes the submissions and its response to them? It is not realistic to suppose that the hypothetical financial institution should be so well in touch with all other comparable organisations throughout the United Kingdom that it knows the collective view of the banking fraternity. That is a ludicrous proposition.
<P>
It is a modest requirement that the authority should be obliged to publish the result of the consultation exercise, so that everyone can be sure that the law is being observed. The authority is required to have regard to the representations, but there will be no way of telling whether it has carried out that requirement unless practitioners and Members of Parliament can see the representations and the authority's response to them. I await the specific answer from the Economic Secretary about her powers but, even if she replies in the affirmative and says that she will be in a privileged position to override the authority and see the representations and the responses to them, that will be no substitute for the rest of us being given the same opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have heard another bout of synthetic outrage from the right hon. Gentleman. The law is the law; the FSA is under that statutory requirement--as I have said at least six times this morning. If the Government or others consider that the FSA is not abiding by its statutory requirement, a judicial review can be sought.
<P>
During our proceedings, we have heard a fair amount of synthetic outrage to cover up amendments that are not up to the job. It shows the inadequacy of the Opposition Members that they have not even managed to table amendments that could have a substantive impact on the Bill. As I have said, amendment No. 63 is already covered in the schedule and, as for the publication of materials, even the right hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that there were certain instances where institutions would make information available to the regulators based on a guarantee of confidentiality. One of the key requirements with cash ratio deposits is to take into account the size of the institution in levelling the cash ratio deposit.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman has not made a case for the amendments. A simple display of outrage does not constitute a coherent argument for amendments that are not up to the business of opposing the Bill or, indeed, of improving it. I urge the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We are settling into a pattern and, the more that the hon. Lady says, the more the props are being knocked away from her agrument. In fact, she has not advanced any arguments against openness and the publication of the representations. Even if the Labour party had not come into office on the pledge to open up Government, to blow away the cobwebs and to ensure that the people have a right to know, or even if there were no whiff of hypocrisy about the matter, there would still be a good solid reason to accept the amendment. We must be sure--as must the Government--that the FSA abides by the Bill. The hon. Lady's assistants may not be in the position to provide her with an answer, but she has not told us how even she can be sure that the FSA will abide by what we expect will be statute law. I ask the Economic Secretary--perhaps she will grant this courtesy--to write in due course if she does not have the answer now.
<P>
We are a little concerned that we shall have enacted a provision that we cannot ensure is heeded by the FSA. It is not right to say that it will be obeyed simply because it is the law. I am sorry to say that there are many examples of the law being ignored or overridden--by people, institutions and, from time to time, by Government agencies. We propose a tailor-made mechanism to ensure that everyone has regard to that requirement. It is a self-policing mechanism; by making representations public, people will be able to see from the outside whether the authority has responded to valid and well founded criticisms. In the absence of such a mechanism, there is not certainty that the Bill's provisions are anything more than passwords on a bit of paper.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Merely for the record, I can understand that, at the end of a long and tiring morning, the right hon. Gentleman's attention may have wandered slightly. However, I pointed out to him that if the FSA did not hold to a statutory requirement, there would be a right of judicial review. However, that does not discount the fact that the right hon. Gentleman has not managed today to table an amendment with anything more than a most narrow impact or with any real means of improving the Bill. Frankly, I can only assume that the amendments were plucked out of the air because the right hon. Gentleman had nothing better to do with his time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We on the Opposition Benches are not exhausted or tired. We are rather invigorated at having found a serious deficiency in the Bill. It is all very well to talk about judicial review, but how can such a review be launched if no one knows that the FSA has defied or ignored representations made to it? If the amendment is accepted, a mechanism would be set up that made it possible for outside bodies--or even the Economic Sectretary or the Government--to subject the authority to the rigours of the law; but without that information, it will be completely impossible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): If a majority of those making representations had argued for course b, but insisted on confidentiality, what would we learn from the publication of the views of those who had argued for the opposite course of action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have made it clear that if someone writes confidentially, that confidentiality should be respected. The great majority of representations will probably not come into that category. Even if all representations were secret, it would not invalidate the amendment. If the majority of people writing in made perfectly open points, and they were not embarrassed about publication, our modest suggestion is that the FSA should make available to interested parties, possibly on payment of a fee, the documents on which it founds its response.
<P>
In the light of everything that the Labour party used to say about openness, what we have seen this morning is a really startling example of the U-turn--combined with a large dose of hypocrisy. I therefore invite the Committee to divide on the amendment.

<b>The Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 65, in page 11, line 37, leave out `Chancellor of the Exchequer' and insert
<ul><font=-1>
`Governor of the Bank of England'.</font></ul>
<p><b>Mr. St. Aubyn:</b> Before the hon. Member for Dudley, North rises with his usual alacrity, I acknowledge that amendment No. 65 is less than perfect. The notes on clauses set out the changes and paragraph 5 on page 51 makes a further reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer when it might be argued that, for the sake of consistency, the Governor's name should also appear. The purpose of the amendment is to allow us to debate the principle of who should be at the peak of authority. There is also the argument that there should be a twin peak of authority and in that sense the amendment is not incomplete, because it would provide that both offices had an element of authority over appointments of those members.
<p>
The main debate is whether the Chancellor or the Governor should sit at the peak of authority of the new organisation. The Governor was formerly at the head of banking supervision, but it will now be the Chancellor. That is the key to the Treasury's motivation. Many people asked in May why the Treasury should be handing over power. Why did the Chancellor, as soon as he was elected after 18 years in opposition, immediately hand over his power to the Bank of England?
<p>
What has happened, as the Bill and, especially the clause, makes clear is that an element of operational control over interest rates has been transferred to the Bank of England, subject to the reserve powers and some of the other issues that we shall deal with in a moment. However, the Bank got a very poor bargain in return. We shall discuss later how, for the first time ever, it is losing its operation of the gilt market, but above all, it is losing its authority over banking supervision.
<p>
If, as the Government have said is their long-term intention, the country enters the European monetary union, the one area of authority that the Bank has under the Bill--operational control of interest rates--will be transferred to Frankfurt. Clearly, the Bank will be a loser all round. Clause 28, more than any other, will hurt the Bank. If I were the Governor and had considered resigning when I heard the announcement of the transfers of supervisory powers, it would be on this point that I would tender my resignation.
<p>
I am not denying that there are some good arguments for having a separate regulatory agency, one of which is that if the agency fails in its duties, it will not impact the central Bank's reputation and standing in the way in which it has been argued the reputation of our central Bank was impacted by regulatory failures in the past. A counter argument is that such effects are debatable. One of the outstanding achievements of the Bank of England in the time that the Governor has been at the top of the regulatory tree has been its avoidance of any major costs to the British taxpayer as a result of regulatory failures. One of the real concerns, which has been expressed in other clauses but which arises again here, is that under the new regime, with the Chancellor sitting at the top of the regulatory tree, there may be a much greater risk that the taxpayer will somehow end up picking up the tab.
<p>
Before continuing with that point, it is important to have an answer from a Minister. If regulatory failure in the past has been deemed to have affected the standing of the Bank and the Governor, do the Government accept that a future regulatory failure of the banking system will affect the Chancellor's standing? If such a failure occurs, do the Government accept that the Chancellor should consider his position and that he may well be forced to resign? If he is not prepared to be accountable for failures of the regulatory organisation, there is little point in putting him at its head.
<p>
On the other hand, if the Chancellor is accountable for failures, there will be tremendous political pressure to engage in measures to cover up such failures. Unlike the Governor of the Bank of England whose means of doing so are strictly limited, those of the Government may be wide. It could be said that one of the virtues of the system in the past is that the person who controlled the cash--the Chancellor--was distinct from the one who controlled the institution. That separation of powers between the Chancellor and the Governor made for a much healthier system of banking supervision and regulation.
<p>
The danger in the new arrangement is that it will be seen to have politicised the function of bank regulation. The danger of politicisation is that the credit of politicians can be exhausted far more rapidly than that of central bankers. As we have seen under the Government, there is a temptation in politics to say one thing and mean another. Before the election, it was intimated by the Prime Minister that there would be no change in the regime for PEPs and TESSAs. We have now discovered to our cost--it has affected hundreds and thousands of voters--that there will be some real changes to the regime.
