<P>
As it is warm this afternoon, hon. Gentleman may remove their jackets if they wish. Hon. Ladies do not have to ask.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> This group of amendments deals with who should be notified when a child is excluded from school or if a reinstatement takes place. In the Bill, both local education authorities and parents are listed as appropriate people and bodies to be notified, but we believe that social services departments should be informed that something important has taken place which affects the child. The amendments, especially amendment Nos. 346 and 347 to clause 63, provide for the local social services to be informed.
<P>
Amendment No. 335 relates to clause 62(5)(b), which provides that when a child attains the age of 18, the pupil himself--or herself--should be notified, not the parents. When a child of 18 is still in full-time education but is excluded from school, it is likely that one or two circumstances will have arisen: first, the child has a long track record of difficulties in school, especially behavioural problems, and, secondly, something dramatic and unexpected has happened--for example, the child may be involved in criminal proceedings or drugs charges. It is important, therefore, that if that child or young adult over 18 has been assigned a probation officer or a named social worker--notwithstanding that the young person is over the age of majority--the relevant body or person should be contacted. When children are in local authority care, there is no parental home, and in such circumstances there could be serious consequences if an 18-year-old in his final year of full-time school was excluded from school and no one else was notified.
<P>
The House of Commons often debates the subject of children in full-time care who fall through the net. Very often the period of transition from full-time education into the adult world is a critical time. If such children were excluded at that point, they would fall through the net unless another body were notified of a dramatic change in their circumstances. The amendments were tabled by me and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) for that reason, and I hope that the Government will accept them. Without the amendments, there will be a gap in the Bill, which will affect vulnerable young people.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Ms Estelle Morris): I have much sympathy with the amendment and I hope that in most cases what it proposes will take place, because children's social workers have case conferences to which teachers will be invited to attend to discuss the matter.
<P>
I took advice, in the light of the amendment, on how many children were affected, and I am told that there is nothing in law which means that a school would necessarily know whether a child had a social worker. That surprises me. My own experience as a teacher was that one tended to know which children had social worker involvement either individually or as a family. Certainly one was likely to have been involved in writing out the court report that led to the attachment of a probation officer.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the amendment. The Government are anxious to encourage more cross-department consultation and work at local authority level. If that does not take place, we shall not address the wider issues to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) referred this morning. The local authority behaviour support plans will require local council departments to work together and to be aware of what is happening. However, I am told by officials that we cannot accept the amendment, nor would I do so as it is worded, because it would require a social worker to inform a school that he or she was attached to a pupil. It is not for us to introduce such legislation; that is up to somebody else.
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman accept that we are sympathetic to the amendment and wish schools to engage all those who can support children at exclusion? May we reflect on how that might be achieved? There are instances where it may not be appropriate to inform a social worker, especially if the social worker is not attached to the child or the family before the exclusion takes place. If it is a one-off, serious misdemeanour by a child in a family who do not have a social worker, and if that family support and are prepared to work with the school, the matter can often be remedied without referral to a social worker. I would not want to load extra work on to the social services department where no one felt that it was necessary.
<P>
Although I do not accept that in all cases the social services department needs to be informed, we are examining ways of collaborating with social workers where a social worker attachment is already in place. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Lady will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I still have one or two concerns. It is a difficult matter, because we are generalising about a sweep of cases. I take the Under-Secretary's point that some would be short-term problems and others longer term and that more should be put into the structure of the system. I ask her to consider informing a social worker if a named social worker did not already exist and at the possibility of contact at that point with social services. It is a watershed point. Clearly that may be the appropriate time to contact the social services.
<P>
I have not quite understood whether, when the Under-Secretary says that she will examine the matter, she intends to produce something more finite on Report.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Perhaps this is an intervention. I shall take the first point first--a set of circumstances where it may not be appropriate to go to social services for a referral. In the case to which the hon. Lady referred, perhaps a drug incident, any responsible school would not simply exclude and take the child back. There must be stages of action: something needs to happen to that child or young person so that the behaviour does not continue.
<P>
Some schools have strict rules about verbal or physical violence. Sometimes, entirely unexpectedly, a child is verbally violent to a member of staff or another child, and the school would follow the rules and exclude at that point. I have seen instances of the parents being called in at that stage and fully supporting the school; work has gone on with the child and the child has been readmitted after a relatively short time, and perhaps the misdemeanour has never happened again. I would not want that child to be referred to a social worker. That is the sort of discretion that we shall consider.
<P>
As to when we shall respond, I would put that in the context of my remarks this morning about the Government's further work on social exclusion. Therefore, I do not want to make a commitment, because I do not want to mislead the hon. Lady into thinking that we shall come back on Report. However, the Government will respond at some point in the not-too-distant future.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to air these issues. There is clearly common ground on this matter. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 62 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 63 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 64</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeals against exclusion of pupils</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I beg to move amendment No. 186, in page 47, line 44, leave out `either'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 187, in page 47, line 45, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) direct that he is to be reinstated on condition that he complies with such conditions as the appeal panel may wish to impose, or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> These two amendments, principally amendment No. 187, continue from the previous debate and the sensible amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton. If the Government cannot support amendment No. 187 in its entirety, I hope that they will support the important principle behind it.
<P>
The amendment deals with the reinstatement of pupils who the panel has said must be reinstated after a permanent exclusion. The amendment would encourage schools to reintegrate such pupils in stages, as the Minister rightly advocated, and require conditions to be attached to that reintegration.
<P>
We have all witnessed the horrendous cases of students who have been permanently excluded, often for outrageous behaviour, and subsequently reinstated after a decision taken by governors or, under the previous legislation by the local education authority, with that reinstatement seen by the student and his or her peer group as a victory. The reason why that student was permanently excluded in the first place tends to get lost in the publicity that often surrounds the case. It is vital that there are no winners and losers in such situations; when a student has asked to be reinstated, it is often not having been a question of the decision to exclude a student permanently having been wrong, but of the permanency of the exclusion being reconsidered.
<P>
The amendment therefore seeks to provide a third option: to plan for a child's reinstatement in a way that makes clear to the other pupils that it is not merely a matter of a child walking back through the gates as a hero, with television cameras--one thinks of the child who made gestures to the cameras that signified, ``I've won''; the amendment would give head teachers, governors and the LEA an opportunity to make the child's return to school a staged one and would make it clear to the child that conditions, which must be met in full, are attached to returning to school. That seems an important and sensible halfway house between the governors agreeing a permanent exclusion and that being set aside in a reinstatement. I hope that the Minister will agree with the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> I did not intend to speak, but was moved to do so by the argument of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Having heard so much evidence as a member--with the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)--of the Select Committee on Education and Employment about the problems of disaffected children and of those who have been permanently excluded, I am concerned that while schools should have access to permanent exclusion, the Government should carefully think through the consequences of the use of that weapon. That is why I hoped that when the Minister said this morning that she would make a statement on provision for permanently excluded students, she would specify that she would do so on Thursday in the debate on clause 78 and not at a later date. The issue is relevant to our present discussions. In the same spirit, I believe that the amendment would provide a further element of flexibility in regard to how schools and the education service use the instrument of exclusion. The amendment should be supported.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I understand the motives behind the amendment of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, but I shall ask the Committee to resist it; I hope that I can effectively explain my reasons for doing so. First, taking up the staged approach to which the hon. Gentleman referred, clause 64(4)(b) provides for reinstatement over a phased period.
<P>
The amendment raises several issues and I am concerned whether it would prove to be of the benefit that the hon. Gentleman thinks it will be. The effect of imposing a condition is not clear. We do not want a situation where a pupil is reinstated and then proclaims a great victory as a result and, in effect, puts two fingers up to the cameras and the school.
<P>
<H5>4.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, Government would prefer an approach that is based more on the home-school agreement concept. Although it will not be a condition of accepting a pupil back into a school, the home-school agreement can be couched in such terms that the future conduct of the individual pupil can be made clear and respective responsibilities can be plainly stated.
<P>
The amendment raises questions whether unreasonable conditions could be imposed by the appeal panel and whether, as a result of a condition being imposed, the parents or the pupils then lose the right to appeal if they are excluded again because they are in breach of the condition. It is not clear whether a breach of the condition would lead automatically to exclusion or whether there would be a right of appeal against exclusion if a condition were breached. There is a need to clarify what the powers would be if a condition were to be attached.
<P>
It would not be appropriate legally to give an appeal panel the power to impose a condition as it would lead to the practical difficulties to which I have referred. The home-school agreement would be a better vehicle by which to give a clear demonstration of the sort of conduct that the school would regard as suitable for the individual child. Most importantly, the home-school agreement is an agreement between the school and the parents of the child, which we consider to be far more appropriate than a condition being imposed by the appeal panel, where the control and decision-making process is taken away from the school. Obviously, the school has the prime interest in such matters. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will reconsider his amendment and agree to withdraw it. If not, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's response, especially his reference to home-school agreements. It is clear from clause 98(1) that the agreement is intended to be an agreement between the school and all the pupils. It is not intended to be an individual agreement between the school and an individual child. The Committee can imagine how extremely difficult it would be for a school of 1,600 to 1,800 students to sustain 1,800 separate agreements.
<P>
We are discussing students who have caused exceptional difficulties. The purpose of the amendment is to try to deal with them positively. When I was reading the background to exclusions, I was horrified to find that, for example, in one local authority area, the Afro-Caribbean youngsters represented 23 per cent. of excluded pupils, although they represented only 3 per cent. of the school population.
<P>
We must try various different ways of dealing with those youngsters. An agreement that is worked out between the student, the family and the school would be an important halfway house. I am disappointed that the Minister rejected the proposal. We shall need to look at it again and will gain some benefit from doing so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 64 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 18 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 65</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duty to secure due provision of religious education</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 319, in page 48, line 27, after `is' insert `to be'.
<P>
This is a minor technical amendment. It is forward looking. Clause 65(4), if amended, would require a list to be drawn up of schools with a religious character and the religious education that is ``to be'' provided, instead of the present ``is'' provided. It will ensure that we can look forward to such provision rather than having a snap-shot view at a particular time.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Minister explain subsection (3)? It seems to give a sweeping power to the Secretary of State to designate whether a foundation or voluntary school has a religious character. How does he envisage that power being exercised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That provision is included at the express request of the Church authorities, who regard it as helpful to state clearly whether a school has such characteristics. The reason is that many schools' characteristics are based on trust deeds, some of which are opaque. The Church would welcome a clearly stated list--I referred to it earlier--of schools in that category.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> One assumes that, in making his determination, the Secretary of State will be always guided by the views of the Church authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I confirm that will be the case.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the Government amendments Nos. 228 to 248 and 322 to 327.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The amendments would make it clear that land acquired through the use of public funds includes land acquired with funds provided by the Funding Agency for Schools. It is argued in some quarters that, because of its constitution, the agency may not be regarded as having used public funds for the purchase of land or property. The amendments make it clear that the money spent by the agency would be so categorised.

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> This is an exploration point. Clause 72 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The governing body of any maintained school shall be responsible for determining whether or not to provide''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
either part-time or full-time education for people over the age of 19 who wish to avail themselves of it. But, for community or foundation special schools, the governing body will not make that determination without the consent of the LEA. I wonder why there is a difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That is a very good question--and I am struggling to find an answer. I guess that it is because of the special position of special schools. I cannot give the hon. Lady an immediate reply, but if she is agreeable, I can provide her with information very soon--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an awful lot of chatter going on. However much I appreciate the interventions of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, to let me get my breath back, we should listen to the Minister in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam. The information that I have received confirms my first comment. There is a different approach simply because they are special schools.
