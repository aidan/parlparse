<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000112"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Jones. I hope
that our proceedings will be relatively short, but we shall
see.</div> <a name="06062337000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
would repeal section 43 of Criminal Justice Act 2003, whose purport is
to allow non-jury trials in fraud cases, so it is entirely relevant to
our discussions. Let me say from the outset, however, that I do not
intend to press it to a Division, and my purpose in putting it on the
amendment paper is simply to set out clearly our position on section 43
and allow the Solicitor-General to repeat the assurances that were
given in another place about the Government&#146;s intentions. That
is a sensible thing to do and simply makes the position
clear.</div> <a name="06062337000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
a lot of discussion about section 43 since the passing of the 2003 Act
and there have been what we might describe as misunderstandings along
the way about various party&#146;s intentions and the degree of
consultation inherent in taking such issues forward. I shall not
rehearse those arguments again today, but simply say that the Liberal
Democrats are utterly unpersuaded of the need to proceed with
implementation of the section 43.</div>
<a name="06062337000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill is enacted, the
measures in it will go a long way towards simplifying and clarifying
the laws on fraud, and that is indeed the intention. In so doing, the
Bill will, I hope, assist with the presentation and management of fraud
cases and at least partially remove whatever pressure there is on trial
juries. Juries are an important part of the justice system, and
although we accept that some trials take place without them, we are
unpersuaded that cases involving the serious crime of fraud should be
included. In a perfect world, therefore, section 43 would be
repealed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div><a name="06062337000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course we accept the
assurances given by the Attorney-General in another place, where he
made it plain that the Government intended not to use section 43, but
that if they did proceed with changes to the arrangements for jury
trials in fraud cases, they would do so through primary legislation. Of
course, I accept those assurances and I am grateful for them. Given
that they are in place, however, it could be argued that there is no
need for section 43 and that repealing it would make no difference.
Equally, if section 43 is not to be used, there is no mischief in it,
which is why I do not intend to proceed to a Division. I simply ask the
Solicitor-General to repeat the assurance about the Government&#146;s
intentions.</div> <a name="06062337000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government have formed the view that there may be a need to proceed
through primary legislation, I invite the Solicitor-General to consider
that there should be time for the Bill, if enacted, to take effect and
for some assessment to be made of its impact on the duration of trials
and the prevalence or otherwise of failed trials under the new
offences. It would be absurd to discard a basic building block of
English justice without that objective assessment or evidence to
suggest that the changes would have a beneficial effect. That is the
position of Liberal Democrat Members, and it may well be the position
elsewhere on the Opposition Benches. I invite the Solicitor-General to
make any comments that he feels appropriate about the new
clause.</div>
<a name="06062337000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062337000113"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I am grateful to the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) for bringing the new
clause forward. He will know that his views on the subject are
identical to mine and my party&#146;s. We sought to resist section 43
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 when it was introduced. There was a
stand-off between the Lords and the Commons and its eventual
introduction was accompanied by a double-lock mechanism that required a
resolution of both Houses of Parliament&#151;which, it became
apparent, the Government were unable to secure.</div>
<a name="06062337000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make the position quite
clear: I do not think that the Government, in seeking to put that
provision in the Criminal Justice Act, were attempting a ruthless
undermining of trial by jury. However, I happen to believe that they
were profoundly mistaken. Jury trial is a very good system, and I
believe that it is possible to have jury trial in long and complex
fraud cases. Indeed, from the few fraud cases that I have done, my
experience is that the jury appear to have absolutely no difficulty
understanding the key elements of the offence or the allegations being
made. As I mentioned earlier in our proceedings, the basic problem that
emerged in virtually every case in which I was involved was that the
case had been badly presented and the indictment poorly drafted. Those
cases tended to fail, quite often at half-time after a submission of no
case to answer. Sometimes&#151;as with the case in which my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) was
involved&#151;cases ran into the sands because the case management
was extremely unsatisfactory. That has nothing whatever to do with the
jury.</div> <a name="06062337000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government wish to return to the topic in future, they would be well
advised, as the hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div>for Somerton and Frome said, to allow for a little delay to see how the
new Fraud Act works. I have some confidence&#151;clearly, so, too
does the Solicitor-General, as he is presenting the Bill to the
House&#151;that this Fraud Bill has the potential to make the
prosecution of fraud easier. Certainly, in terms of the problem of
comprehensibility to a jury, this Bill, as it stands, can only be an
improvement. I hope that the Government do not, as a result, run off
and hastily introduce new primary legislation&#151;that is what they
say they want to do&#151;to implement section 43 in some new or
variant form. Of course, if they do that, we will listen carefully to
their proposals, and if they have any merit, we will give them careful
consideration.</div><a name="06062337000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
course of the passage of this Bill through the other place, I was
pleased to learn that the Government were prepared to give an assurance
that section 43 would never be used to implement restrictions on trial
by jury in long fraud cases. However, the suggestion that there might
even be primary legislation in the next Session of Parliament clearly
raises the possibility of yet another serious difference of view
occurring in this House and, I suspect, the other place on the subject.
I make this plea to the Solicitor-General: if the Government&#146;s
intention is to proceed in the next Session, perhaps they should delay
it a year and just see how the new fraud provisions work. It might be
possible to provide enough reassurance to the
Solicitor-General&#151;and, I dare say, the Attorney-General, who
seems particularly exercised about the issue&#151;that a change to
the right to jury trial is not needed.</div>
<a name="06062337000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I welcome the spirit
of the new clause, I certainly shall not press it to the vote; that
would appear churlish, in view of the assurances given by the
Government in the other place. However, I am grateful for the
opportunity that this Committee has had to touch on the subject, as now
the Government know where we stand on it. Perhaps we can also have a
short response from the Solicitor-General, telling us how the
Government&#146;s thinking on the subject is
developing.</div>
<a name="06062337000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000114"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b><b class="B"> </b>On Report in
the other place, my noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General,
said:</div><a name="06062337000084"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government, while remaining committed to the policy contained in
Section 43, have taken the view that we need to separate this issue
from the passage of the Fraud Bill. We therefore propose to bring
forward fresh primary legislation to give effect to that policy as soon
as parliamentary time allows rather than bringing forward an order
giving effect to Section 43.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords, </i>14 March 2006; Vol. 679, c.
1130.]</div><a name="06062337000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, I hope, gives
Opposition Members the reassurance that they need that section 43 will
be dealt with in primary legislation, rather than by means of an order.
That, at least, is the way in which we propose to
go.</div><a name="06062337000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not give a
long rehearsal of the arguments on non-jury trials, but there were
29,000 jury trials last year. If section 43 had been implemented, there
might have been 29,000 less half a dozen or perhaps 20, and most of
those non-jury trials would have been very long fraud trials. Between
2002 and 2004, there were 19 fraud trials lasting longer than six
months; six lasted more than a year. We are primarily talking about
long fraud trials dealing with very complex issues. In a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>number of fraud trials, judges expressed concern. For example, in the
Blue Arrow case, Justice McKinnon, the trial judge,
said:</div><a name="06062337000085"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No jury
should be asked to cope with what this jury have had to
endure.&#148;</div><a name="06062337000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned that justice should be done in fraud cases. We broadly
support juries dealing with the vast majority of fraud cases, never
mind general cases of criminal culpability. In 2003, of the 2,978
people tried for fraud, 2,258 were found guilty, 1,879 of whom pleaded
guilty. The vast majority of those cases would still be tried by a
jury, even after implementation of section 43&#151;although,
obviously, in the case of a guilty plea, a jury would be unnecessary,
in terms of finding guilt. That is our broader position.</div>
<a name="06062337000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that both the hon.
Gentlemen who have spoken say that they are speaking to the new clause
in order to hear a rehearsal of the Government&#146;s position in
this place, which is a fair and proper thing to do. However, with the
reassurance that I have given, and having repeated the words of my
noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General, I hope that the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome will feel able to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06062337000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000115"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for what he said, and
we are grateful for it, although it was entirely expected, because it
follows on from what the Attorney-General said in another
place.</div><a name="06062337000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could dispute
parts of what the Solicitor-General said. The fact that a case was
unendurable for a jury may not owe anything to the difficulty of
understanding the evidence or the pressures put on the jury, but may
simply be because the case was managed in such a way that absurd time
pressures were put on jury members, in terms of the trial&#146;s
duration. I know that the Government have been working on the improved
management of complex cases. We must wait and see whether
that&#151;and, indeed, this Bill&#151;has the desired effect; I
hope that the Bill will simplify indictments and legal arguments and
reduce the length of time needed.</div>
<a name="06062337000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, I juxtaposed
a British trial with an American trial, although I freely admit that
the British one was not a fraud trial. It was the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International
litigation.</div>
<a name="06062337000089"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06062337000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
the trial took two years and that the two opening speeches alone took
200 days of court time is a disgrace to the operation of our legal
system and our courts. Possibly the biggest fraud case of modern
times&#151;the Enron case, which was heard by a Texan court in
Houston before a jury&#151;was completely finished in 15 weeks. That
suggests that management and having a firm control of the presentation
of cases are key issues, and that the ability or otherwise of a jury to
cope with the complexity of fraud trials is not. Indeed, there is
plenty of qualitative evidence that that is the
case.</div>
<a name="06062337000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062337000116"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Geoffrey Cox</b> (Torridge and West Devon) (Con): Merely to
reinforce what the hon. Gentleman is saying, with every word of which I
agree, in the Jubilee line case, which the Government have used as
evidence of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div>the need for change, the jury displayed astonishing diligence and
attentiveness to its duty. It kept up constant attention, with a series
of pertinent questions, and at no stage, until the trial eventually
drifted into the sands for entirely other reasons, gave any indication
of wanting to do anything other than reach a conclusion. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s words are exactly right and felicitous&#151;the
problem is one of
management.</div><a name="06062337000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
engaged in another case&#151;also a major fraud trial&#151;in which
the Americans managed to bring the related defendants to trial by 2004.
The parallel proceedings, concerning exactly similar issues, will not
be brought to trial in this country until 2007. There is a clear and
instructive comparison to be drawn between the American and English
systems.</div><a name="06062337000034"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000118"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06062337000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I do not
intend to press the new clause to a Division, but it is important that
the Committee at least consider whether we should have jurisdiction for
fraud beyond our national jurisdiction. The issue was discussed in the
gestation of the Bill and there are conflicting views on it. I do not
advocate international jurisdiction other than in clearly defined
cases. When we debated the previous amendment, we discussed US
jurisdictions, some of which claim extraordinary extraterritorial
scope, way beyond what is reasonable in either law or common sense,
particularly in commercial law.</div>
<a name="06062337000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">With fraud, there is great
cause for concern in some areas, as it can easily be perpetrated on
British citizens from outside our national jurisdiction. It is not like
knocking someone on the head; one is unlikely to be standing in another
jurisdiction&#151;except, perhaps, Gretna Green&#151;and knocking
on the head someone within the confines of England and Wales. Fraud is
an offence of a different sort, which can easily be perpetrated from
abroad.</div><a name="06062337000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
there is much collaboration and co-operation between law enforcement
and prosecuting authorities in other countries to deal with this
worldwide phenomenon, and I certainly do not propose that the English
and Welsh prosecuting authorities should seek to investigate and
prosecute fraud wherever it happens in the world, which would be
absurd, but there are occasions on which fraud has an international
dimension, which might obstruct the successful prosecution of a fraud
perpetrated on someone in this country&#151;possibly by a British
national who is in another jurisdiction. There might be difficulties
because of the clear territorial limits on the offences as they stand
in securing a successful
prosecution.</div><a name="06062337000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
give a few brief examples. The first is obvious: multinational
corporations. We live in an increasingly multinational, global,
commercial world, which means that bodies corporate often work in many
countries and jurisdictions and have subsidiaries that might not trade
in this country. A company with an office in the great state of
Delaware, or, worse, in Liberia, might perpetrate fraud against an
individual or company in the United Kingdom. I want it to be clear that
there will not be a defence that allows a company operating in this
country that has committed an offence to avoid successful prosecution
by arranging its business so that the fraud is effectively perpetrated
by a subsidiary company that is not registered or trading from this
country, but is nevertheless under the control of that British company.
I hope that that is covered by the Bill, but I am not confident that it
is.</div><a name="06062337000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second example
is unsolicited mail. We and our constituents receive torrents of
unsolicited mail, some of which I believe constitutes fraud. A few
years ago, I brought to Parliament&#146;s attention a case in which a
clairvoyant was threatening vulnerable people with consequences through
her enhanced psychic awareness. She said that major events would occur
if the targeted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>person did not secure her protection by virtue of an amulet or other
device, which would protect her from the inevitable consequences of not
paying over money to an address abroad so as to secure that
protection.</div><a name="06062337000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
abhorrent correspondence was carried through the Royal Mail from a
business address in the Netherlands, and was of great concern to the
people who were vulnerable to that sort of material. I think that that
fraud would not be prosecutable under the Bill. Perhaps the Minister
will say that it would be, but I do not think that he can. I think that
other measures need to be
taken.</div><a name="06062337000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, it
appals me that despite the fact that these matters are drawn to the
attention of Royal Mail, it, as a carrier, is still prepared to take
bulk mailings of extremely questionable material, but that is by the
by. I want to ensure that when fraudulent materials that are sent
through the post are involved, the matter can be prosecuted if it is
possible to secure an extradition and an
arrest.</div><a name="06062337000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
unsolicited mail is sent electronically. We are all familiar with the
famous west African scam, which seems to have gone global&#151;it is
no longer just relatives of President Abacha who will have untold
amounts of money available if they can persuade people to part with a
small amount to establish a new bank account. Relatives of President
Marcos in the Philippines, or any recently deposed despots who appear
to have many relatives with access to large amounts of money, say that
all they need is a British bank account so as to secure untold riches
for the unsuspecting recipient of their
communication.</div><a name="06062337000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
people are aware that this is a scam, but there must be some who are
not or it would not continue. Some unfortunates must lose a lot of
money as a result, and it is important for us to provide as much legal
protection as possible for those
people.</div><a name="06062337000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to something that was brought to my
attention in my constituency surgery last week, and it is a new one on
me. A gentleman came in outraged because he had applied for death
certificates on the internet and had been charged in euros. His
original outrage related to the fact that a Department&#151;part of
the British Government&#151;was charging in euros rather than pounds
sterling, which is the sort of complaint that we get in my part of the
world. He thought that an extraordinary state of
affairs.</div><a name="06062337000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
investigated the matter because I thought it sounded odd and I
uncovered the fact that a website purporting to be a British Government
website&#151;it even has the appellation .gov&#151;is selling
Government certificates to people who do not know better. It appears in
the search engines above the Government&#146;s own websites and sells
certificates at a higher cost than they do. The person concerned buys
forms for &#163;7 from the Government and sells them for &#163;21
as a private enterprise while purporting to be a
Department.</div><a name="06062337000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The view
of the registrar&#146;s department was that there is no illegality in
such transactions, although it obviously deplores and would like to
deal with them. I hope that they will be illegal under the new measure,
because it would be a misrepresentation if a person purported to be
connected with the Government when they were not. Even so, I am not
convinced that such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div>thing could successfully be prosecuted under the Bill because the person
involved in the case that I cited is based in France, in spite of the
fact that he has a .gov.UK
website.</div><a name="06062337000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are strong arguments for international jurisdiction. The
Under-Secretary&#146;s argument at the conclusion of the debate on
Second Reading drew a distinction between corruption and fraud. I would
like the Bill to have included corruption, but my amendments were out
of order in that respect, which is right. He
said:</div><a name="06062337000086"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
resource implications for &#145;policing&#146; UK nationals
worldwide for fraud are therefore much larger. The cost would need to
be carefully examined before any party committed itself to
it.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 12 June 2006; Vol. 447, c.
580.]</div><a name="06062337000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes, of course.
The same applies to sexual offences in respect of international
jurisdiction, but we cannot police every transaction and investigate
every
allegation.</div><a name="06062337000090"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="06062337000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
capacity to indict and successfully prosecute is an important part of
the armoury of our national jurisdiction on the offence because it can
so easily be perpetrated by someone outside our territorial boundaries.
I invite the Solicitor-General to comment on my remarks, explain the
reasoning that has led the Government to believe that we should seek no
form of international jurisdiction in the Bill, and say whether they
will keep that position under review or whether they will return to
it.</div><a name="06062337000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000119"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a number of
issues, some of which touch on points made earlier, particularly the
question of where we draw the line between what is and ought to be a
crime of fraud, and what is a commercial relationship that we decide
should not be criminal, in which the buyer needs to beware, but where
there are various safeguards through advertising regulations and other
means, and where there are civil rights. The hon. Gentleman also asked
what we should be prepared to prosecute in our courts, where actions
are committed by persons
abroad.</div><a name="06062337000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK does
not have jurisdiction over foreign companies, wherever their ownership
is, for acts carried out overseas that have no impact in the UK.
However, if the fraud results in a loss of property in the UK, we have
some jurisdiction. Part I of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 confers
jurisdiction over certain crimes of dishonesty if a &#147;relevant
event&#148; occurs in England and Wales, which is defined
as:</div><a name="06062337000087"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any act or omission
or other event (including any result of one or more acts or omissions)
proof of which is required for conviction of the
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062337000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
24 of schedule 1 to the Bill amends definitions of offences for the
purposes of the jurisdictional provisions of the 1993 Act, deleting
references to offences that are repealed and adding references to new
offences. Those changes ensure that the wide jurisdictional provisions
of the 1993 Act apply to the new fraud offences so that, in a phishing
case, for example, where a false representation is made in the UK, it
does not matter whether the offender is operating from abroad, because
he may be caught by the offence in clause 2.</div>
<a name="06062337000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, paragraph 25 of
schedule 1 amends section 2 of the 1993 Act to ensure that the offence
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div>fraud in clause 1 can be prosecuted if the only event that takes place
in this jurisdiction is the gain or loss of property. That provision
covers cases where fraud committed entirely overseas leads to the
removal of funds from a bank in the UK. I hope that with those
reassurances, such as they are, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="06062337000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ambition of the new clause
is extraordinary. It seeks to broaden our courts&#146; jurisdiction
over fraud offences committed by anyone located anywhere in the world
where fraud is a crime. The new clause is so extraordinarily wide that
I dare say that it would collapse under the weight of its own ambition,
as it would require anybody&#151;not just UK nationals who live in
jurisdictions where fraud is a crime&#151;to behave in accordance
with UK fraud law. A citizen of the USA or France, or anyone else for
that matter, who commits acts while in their home country or anywhere
where fraud is a crime, would face prosecution by UK prosecutors, even
if the crime had no impact in the UK. The hon. Gentleman indicated that
that is not his intention, but it would be the effect of the new clause
as drafted.</div> <a name="06062337000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
to ensure that fraudsters, where they can be properly dealt with in our
courts, are so dealt with. They can be located in any number of places
all over the world. We have all heard about the number of sinister
scams over the years involving Spanish lottery frauds or African
advanced fee frauds. Such cases already have some coverage under the
1993 Act. If it is the case that proof of any act or omission if is
required for conviction&#151;for example, if the deception or gain
takes place in the UK&#151;our jurisdiction will cover
it.</div>
<a name="06062337000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000120"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am extremely grateful to the
Solicitor-General for his helpful comments. He admonished me a little
on the drafting of my new clause. The provision is analogous to that
set out in the Sexual OffencesAct 2003 and uses almost exactly
the same terms. It is not such an extraordinary provision, as the
British Government already have the jurisdiction or ability to
prosecute for any sexual offence carried out by any person anywhere in
the world on the exact same basis. That is the section that I have
lifted, effectively en bloc. Of course, the limiting factor is the
decision to investigate and prosecute. It is completely impractical to
investigate and prosecute every offence that occurs anywhere, and we
would not wish to. The new clause would allow there to be no blockage
to procedures against any person.</div>
<a name="06062337000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share some
of the misgivings about extra-territorial jurisdiction. Indeed, I often
criticise the ambitions of the United States in that respect and the
fact that that its jurisdiction applies to British citizens as a result
of the extraordinary asymmetric extradition arrangements we have with
it, but that is another matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000121"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I was not going to intervene, but I have to say
that, as drafted, the new clause is even more ambitious than the
wildest dreams of a district attorney in
Texas.</div>
<a name="06062337000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000122"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Possibly the great state of New York already has
such a provision in place. Texas tends to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>rather introvert rather than extrovert with its legal system&#151;it
is about the only thing that it is not extrovert
in.</div>
<a name="06062337000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the
Solicitor-General. He has covered some of the ground that I wanted to
cover. We have to be a lot more astute in protecting our citizens
against the predations of those operating from outside the country,
particularly on the internet, which makes it too easy for people to be
defrauded. It occurred to me in the example that I gave that we might
need provision for misrepresentation of a position under the Crown or
something of that sort. If people honestly believe that someone is a
Government official, they are far more open to being defrauded than
when someone is purporting to be carrying out a commercial transaction.
We might like to consider that. I was very surprised to hear that the
scam that I described&#151;I think it is a scam&#151;was not an
offence, as his legal advice seems to suggest. Having said that, I have
no difficulty in begging to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000123"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Mr. Jones, I thank you and your
colleague for your sterling chairmanship of this Bill, which is very
important, given the impact that it will have on many of our
constituents and in ensuring that fraud will be dealt with. The Bill
was potentially legally quite complex, but it has benefited from proper
scrutiny, provided by Opposition colleagues with care and diligence in
a way that I hope means that the public have been well served. You have
not had to intervene to quieten us down too much. We got on with the
business, answered the questions, dealt with the issues, raised the
difficulties that might be presented by the wording of various clauses,
and got through the Bill. We did the business of Parliament, assessing
the legislation in a proper way that does credit to this Committee and
the chairmanship of you and your colleague. Hopefully, in due course,
that will lead to good
law.</div><a name="06062337000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000124"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> May I join the Solicitor-General in thanking you,
Mr. Jones? Please pass on our thanks to Mr. Amess for his chairing of
Committee on Tuesday. It has been a very pleasant and short Committee.
In the nine years that I have been in the House, this is the first time
that I been on a Bill Committee in which we completely scrutinised
everything that we wanted to consider. In the past, I am afraid, the
guillotine and the programme motion have usually left some
things&#151;albeit small things, sometimes&#151;not considered, so
this is a first. It bodes well for the future passage of the Bill
through the House.</div> <a name="06062337000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Solicitor-General for his response to our points, and I thank
other members of the Committee. It has been an enjoyable experience, as
I thought it would be when I first came into the
Room.</div><a name="06062337000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000125"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I concur with those sentiments, and thank you, Mr.
Jones, and your colleague Mr. Amess, for your chairmanship of
proceedings. I also thank hon. Members for their contributions. I
particularly thank the Solicitor-General, who was at pains to give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div>us the fullest replies possible, ably assisted by his officials, and
that is not always the case.</div>
<a name="06062337000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the view that we have
done justice to a Bill that has its complexities. It is not a
particularly simple Bill, but it is largely good, and we have had the
opportunity to raise the issues of concern to us. I hope that the
brevity of our proceedings will not be confused with lack of diligence.
I would say, never mind the width, feel the quality. We have had some
substantial debates in a brief time. Overall, I commend the Bill to the
House.</div><a name="06062337000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000126"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It was remiss of me not to thank the
officials who helped to prepare the Bill. I am grateful to them for the
way in which they have advised me, and my colleague the
Attorney-General in another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div>place, throughout. I also thank my colleagues on the Labour Benches, who
have done their duty here, too, when need be.</div>
<a name="06062337000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has been
dealt with expeditiously, and no doubt those who deal with such issues
will need to consider whether a full day might not be necessary for the
Bill on Report. That matter will, no doubt, be dealt with through the
usual channels, but I just want to put my view on the
record.</div><a name="06062337000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062337000127"></a>The
