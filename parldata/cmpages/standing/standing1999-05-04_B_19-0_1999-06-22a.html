(a) it takes the form of the payment of a sum of money,
<P>
(b) it is not subject to a condition as to repayment,
<P>

(4) If an individual makes a qualifying donation he shall be entitled, on making the payment, to deduct and retain out of it a sum equal to basic rate tax thereon.
<P>
(5) Where a sum is deducted under subsection (4) above the sum deducted shall be treated as income tax paid by the person to whom the payment is made.
<P>
(6) Any person by whom a qualifying donation is received shall be entitled to recover from the Board, in accordance with regulations, an amount which by virtue of subsection (5) above is treated as income tax paid by him; and any amount so recovered shall be treated for the purposes of the Tax Acts in like manner as the qualifying political donation to which it relates.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I apologise to hon. Members for bringing them back into the Committee Room to debate the new clause. It is important, however, as it goes to the heart of our democratic process, and of our two-party system, as I see that it is this afternoon. The new clause would introduce tax relief at the basic rate of tax on political donations of up to £500 a year. It would also ensure that the relief would be introduced only when the rest of the recommendations in the Neill committee report on the funding of political parties in the United Kingdom have been implemented. That is why new subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The provisions of this section shall be brought into effect from 1st April in the year in which the Home Secretary certifies that the recommendations in the Fifth Report of the Committee on Standards of Public Life has been substantially brought into effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wording is based on MIRAS and the gift aid scheme, so it has some precedent in the Taxes Act. The reason for the caveat at the end of the new clause, which, as I said, states that it will come into effect when the recommendations in the Neill report have been substantially implemented, is that the Opposition do not believe in cherry picking those recommendations. Our view is that they should be implemented in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): While the hon. Gentleman is checking up for his next paragraph, will he tell the Committee what use the new clause will be to the Conservative party? I thought that it had only one donor, Michael Ashcroft. I did not know that it had donors who contribute less than £500 a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is unkind; there are significant numbers of smaller donors to the party, and their number has increased in recent years. Labour Members are wrong to denigrate a member of the public who makes substantial donations to a political party. There is nothing wrong with donating substantial sums to the political process, which is a worthwhile activity. I always deprecate people who condemn such engagement in that process. Everybody contributes in different ways. Some wealthy people need to contribute in the manner to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): There is nothing wrong with giving money to political parties, but is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is right for the Government and for taxpayers to subsidise political parties to the tune of very large sums?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman has reached the crux of the debate, to which the Committee will come in a moment. This country faces a choice between whether we want political parties to be directly funded by taxpayers, or whether we want to implement procedure that will encourage more voluntary donations from members of the public. The new clause goes a long way towards encouraging more voluntary donations from members of the public.
<P>
In the evidence that it submitted to the Neill Committee, the Conservative party stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Rather than call for state funding we would welcome the Committee's views about how more individuals could be encouraged to donate. We note that in some countries individuals are offered tax relief for political donations, elsewhere tax credits or matching grants are provided. We believe that the Committee should give serious consideration to the practicalities of these approaches in the context of the UK's voluntary system''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was our submission to the Neill Committee, and its recommendation is set out in our new clauses. It is important in the interests of democracy that the funding of political parties is as broadly based as possible.
<P>
<H5>4.35-4.40 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Neill report cites evidence from Germany that since
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a system of tax relief was introduced in 1974, the pattern of giving to political parties has changed in favour of many small donations and against large donations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Was not that in 1945?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, it was in 1974. Political giving is a worthwhile contribution to the democratic process, and should be recognised by the state through tax relief, as is the case with charitable giving. Being involved in the political process is a worthwhile activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I am always saddened when the Prime Minister tries to denigrate political activity by refusing to give honours to those that undertake it. That is a great pity, because many thousands of people partake in local political activities as chairmen of their local parties, councillors and, indeed, Members of Parliament. It is a worthwhile activity, and should be raised, not lowered, in the public's esteem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman a question about the wording of the new clause. Subsection (3) defines an eligible political party as one that has either two Members of Parliament or one Member of Parliament and 150,000 votes. It seems increasingly likely that we are to retain a first-past-the-post electoral system--[Interruption.] Whether we are or not, it seems extremely unfair that a political party could get 150,000 votes or more but, because they are spread evenly across the country, not get parliamentary seats and therefore not be eligible for the benefit that the clause would establish. The Green party is an obvious example. How did the hon. Gentleman arrive at that definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The definition derives from the definition of a political party that is used in the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. The matter was carefully considered in the Neill report, and the Green party was specifically mentioned. The reason why the inheritance tax definition was used rather than, for example, mere registration as a political party, was to avoid people using the registration procedure to obtain tax relief on their donations.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that having MEPs, members of regional assemblies or Members of the Scottish Parliament might be an equally proper way to judge that a body is a political party? It would have representation in a decision-making forum elected through the democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes, the hon. Lady makes a valid point. The definition in subsection (3) could be changed at any point in the future, but for simplicity's sake I took the definition in the Inheritance Tax Act, which has worked well in determining what is a political party when a person leaves to a political party money in his or her will that is free of inheritance tax. I believe that it is a suitable definition, but it could be amended in future to take account of the new Scottish Parliament and the European Parliament.
<P>
The Government say that the Neill report will restore public confidence in politics, which I believe to be a worthwhile aim. They should therefore implement the report's findings in full. If they choose to ignore the recommendation on tax relief for political donations, they will be acting in a purely partisan way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that the tax relief that he is proposing on voluntary donations to political parties means a loss to the Exchequer, which in turn means that money is taken away from the general public? Why should they pay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. It is a pity that it has come to this, but because of all the controversy about political donations in recent years,  the country now faces the choice as to whether we fund political parties directly from the taxpayer or encourage more voluntary donations from the public. The alternative is to have political parties that are not funded. That would be damaging to the democratic process, because the Government are one part of the system that is not underfunded. If we want to hold the Government to account and ensure that our democratic process functions properly--with properly researched scrutiny of the Executive and properly researched policies presented by political parties--we need to ensure that there is proper funding.
<P>
In his oral evidence to the Neill committee, Lord Parkinson said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think that is a very attractive idea. I think anything that encourages people to participate in a political process, to get involved in political parties, to broaden the base of their membership is to be welcomed because I think politics is a very honourable profession and supporting a political party is a very worthwhile way of spending one's time and money.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is absolutely right.
<P>
It is not just the Conservatives who believe that tax relief can achieve those goals. Lord Razzall, the Liberal Democratic party treasurer, also saw its benefits. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think that as a weapon for the political parties to build up their membership base in particular...as part of that armoury as long as it was structured in a way that was designed to benefit the small donations, I wouldn't be against it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted to see that the Liberal Democrats are now in the Committee. I hope that they will support the new clause, because it has the support of the Liberal treasurer. It is in the interests of all political parties that we accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, although there is nothing wrong with people opting to give money to a political party, the issue is whether people who do not opt to give money to a political party end up doing so through tax relief?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The alternative is that they will all end up giving money to the political system through direct grants. That is the state that we have reached in the funding of political parties. There is a clear choice between providing tax relief for political parties, the state funding them directly, or their being denuded of funds.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that state funding of political parties would be transparent and that people would give objectively and consistently? The system in the new clause will, however, benefit wealthier people who donate. People on low incomes will not get tax relief because they are unlikely to claim tax relief on their £10 or £20 subs. Wealthier people, however, who have £500 knocking about, which they can give away, will benefit from the provision--it is an extremely regressive way of funding political activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady is wrong. The Neill committee discussed the issues that she raised. She says that some people in the country are not taxpayers and will be discriminated against, but the Neill committee's research shows that most party members are taxpayers. Therefore, her argument does not hold water. Most political activists and most of those who contribute are taxpayers. The new clause does not discriminate against them, but simply provides tax relief to those who want to give.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): Many trade unionists pay a political levy. Is my hon. Friend's understanding that they would receive tax relief under the new clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, it is not. My understanding is that the new clause applies only to parties that have a Member of Parliament and receive 150,000 votes in an election.
<P>
The second point that the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) made was that the new clause would give a greater advantage to wealthier people. However, it gives relief only at the basic rate of tax. Again, the Neill committee considered the hon. Lady's point. The way around her concerns was to confine relief to the basic rate of tax. That is not the case for the gift aid scheme, where it is available at the higher rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) asked a rhetorical question about whether trade union subscriptions would accrue tax relief, and the hon. Gentleman said no. Is he now advocating that trade union subscriptions should accrue tax relief?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not have a view on that; I am not a member of a trade union and do not intend ever to join one.
<P>
The conclusion reached in the Neill report was that the balance of arguments, which it considered very carefully, is in favour of allowing tax relief on donations to political parties by deduction at source.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Before the hon. Gentleman moves too far away from the earlier point about checking the Executive, I should say that I am intrigued by his proposal. Does he not consider the Select Committee process to be an adequate means of doing that? Might a review of hon. Members' office cost allowances be another way of enabling researchers to be employed to check the Executive? Why should that be arranged only through political parties--why not through parliamentary procedures?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Political parties are essential to our democratic system. I live during the week in the City of London. What is noticeable about elections in the City, where there are no political parties, is that it is difficult to decide for whom to vote: the manifestos say almost identical things. That teaches one that political parties are essential to the political system--parties must make an effort to distinguish themselves from one another. The essence of the public debate is thus boiled down; that process works extremely well. To deny political parties funding would mean an effective end to the party-political system and would be damaging to democracy.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am sorry to pursue the point, but the hon. Gentleman now seems to be advancing an argument that convinces me of the need for lessons in citizenship in schools, but does not really answer how his proposal would enable better checking of the Executive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> A candidate standing as an individual with no party machinery or philosophy to back up the general thrust of his or her policies would not be effective in holding the Executive to account. The party-political system is essential to ensuring that people have a true choice at election time. I genuinely believe that to get rid of the party-political system would be to get rid of that clear choice; one would end up with a system that was not truly accountable to the public.
<P>
It is hard to explain in a debate such as this, but we have had a two-party system for many centuries--[Interruption.] It is, essentially, a two-party system. Other parties, such as the Liberal Democrats, are really a spare for circumstances in which either of the two main parties fails to respond to the genuine public debate and becomes atrophied. In the early 1980s when the Labour party stood on the extreme left, we saw the rise of what was essentially the Liberal party, through the Social Democratic party, which began to lead to the replacement of the Labour party as the second choice in our two-party system.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is extraordinarily gracious in giving way again. I am intrigued by the philosophical debate, but wonder how a tax bribe to the rich advances his argument. Surely that would introduce such a skew into the debate that the proposition could hardly be seen as fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The proposal does not represent a tax bribe for the rich because it is confined to the basic rate of tax; the vast majority of people in this country are basic rate taxpayers. It would encourage donations from a broader donor base than any of the three political parties currently have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> How can the hon. Gentleman argue that the proposal is not a tax bribe for the rich when he has said that he has no view on voluntary contributions from workers through the political levy included in union subscriptions? How can he have no view about individual workers' donations, but have a strong view in favour of those from large corporations?
<P>

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should like to bring my remarks to a conclusion by quoting the remainder--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman answer the question that I posed before the suspension of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I cannot remember what it was.
<P>
The Neill report concludes that limited donations of up to £500 in any one year is the right sum. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This sum is within reach of a moderately well-off party activist, and not just the rich. We believe that it also represents a balance between setting the level so high that it loses its purpose of encouraging parties to seek large numbers of smaller donations or setting it so low that the benefit of tax relief is not worth pursuing.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why the committee concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We believe that our proposal is sound in principle and should act as a spur to democratic participation in the political process.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I posed a question to the hon. Gentleman before the suspension. He has not answered it, so I will remind him what it was and then ask him a supplementary, if you will permit me, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The question was, why should it be okay for very rich people to benefit from tax relief, but not individual workers who pay trade union subscriptions and have an element allocated for a political levy? The hon. Gentleman said that he had no view on the latter case.
<P>
Secondly, if the hon. Gentleman has no view on that, but has a view on tax relief for rich people, is he a member of a professional association, and does he accrue tax relief for that purpose? If so, why should he be treated differently from other individual workers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The point is that a subscription to a trade union is a service provided for that member, so there is no reason for tax relief. People who wish to receive tax relief on political donations should pay such donations directly to the party, rather than have it paid through the trade union barons and the trade union system. That would be the way round it.
<P>
We are not talking about tax relief for the rich--donations are limited to £500 and to the basic rate of tax. The hon. Gentleman's point was echoed by David Pitt-Watson, finance director of the Labour party, who said in a very partisan way:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Tax relief is of value only to people who pay tax and where the donations given are of significant size. It would be of little value to the Labour Party, which has 400,000 members who are paying an average £20 each to the Labour Party's coffers. It would be of enormous value to our opponents.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very partisan approach to the issue, and I hope that the Committee will listen to the Neill committee rather than to the Labour party finance director.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, but I shall give way briefly to my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown).
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Is my hon. Friend aware that the turn-out at recent elections has continued to drop? At the general election, for example, the turn-out was only 72 per cent. and in the Leeds by-election, at which I spent a little time recently, it was as low as 19.6 per cent. Does my hon. Friend agree that if turn-outs keep dropping, the democratic system will be irrevocably damaged and that anything such as the Neill committee recommendation, which should encourage people to vote, must be good for democracy? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If the parties are denuded of funds, they will not be able to engage in some of the high-profile advertising campaigns that encourage people to turn out to vote. Reducing the level of advertising would, I suspect, reduce the turn out as well.
<P>
In conclusion, the political process and political parties are crucial to the smooth functioning of a democratic country. Mr. Geraint Davies: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind. They facilitate debate and ensure that the electorate has a proper choice at election time rather than facing an array of candidates, who all claim to be acting in the public good, but have no guiding programme or philosophy. If a party is to function, it needs funding. The new clause would provide all parties with broad-based funding on a voluntary basis, which would obviate the need that would otherwise arise for state funding of political parties. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I do not want to bore the Committee for too long. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has made some valuable speeches during our proceedings and has shown his in-depth knowledge of the tax system. That is helpful to right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and I hope that other members of the Committee feel the same.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman undersold himself, however, in his latest contribution, because he did not perform as well as he has in the past. I say that not because of the rather snide and cheap remarks that he made about the Liberal Democrats, which were graceless and far from charming, but because of his arguments for using tax relief. At the beginning of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman said that the new clause was drafted in a similar way to the clause on mortgage interest tax relief. Perhaps he was trying to score a technical point.
<P>
I am pleased to say that the Bill will abolish mortgage interest tax relief with good reasons. Generally, tax reliefs are a bad form of subsidy. It would be an odd Bill that ended a subsidy for home ownership only to introduce one for political parties. We should be seeing less of such tax reliefs. The hon. Gentleman read out the evidence given by Lord Razzall, the treasurer of the Liberal Democratic party, to the Neill committee. Lord Razzall expressed an ambivalence on the subject--while not being completely opposed, he linked his remarks to the question of building up the membership--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a certain end of term atmosphere in the Committee. I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), as, I am sure, is the Official Reporter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
Lord Razzall linked his remarks to the question of building up the membership of political parties. That comment contained a grain of truth and was relevant to the debate on the health of political parties in our democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman talked about tax reliefs and their removal. When can we expect to see the definitive list of the tax reliefs which the Liberal Democratic party will tell the public they plan to cancel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman would obviously benefit from receiving a copy of the alternative Budget, launched by my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) prior to the Government's 1999 Budget. It listed some of the reliefs that we propose to abolish, including mortgage interest tax relief and the married couples allowance, so our position has been on the record for some time.
<P>
Unlike the Conservative party, we have not shied away from advancing our support for that policy. We have been honest and said what reliefs and allowances we want to phase out. That party, when in government, often acted by stealth during Budgets when they had not admitted to a policy in their manifesto, including during the time when the right hon. Gentleman was a Treasury Minister. To cite a popular phrase of Ministers, I shall take no lessons from the right hon. Gentleman. I shall return to the subject of the noble Lord Razzall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to be quick.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Tempted as I am, I shall return ``comme un mouton'' to the point in question. The point of the noble Lord Hazzall was that we needed to look at the health of the political parties and at how they involve people in decision-making. We need more participation in politics: that is an important goal, regardless of political persuasion, but it is not an objective that can be tackled effectively through the tax system.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats do not support the new clause: we think that there are many other more effective ways to fund political parties. The proposal would be low down the--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The proposal was your idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the proposal was our idea, but that is not the case. We have many other ideas for the funding of political parties, which the noble Lord Razzall put to the Neill committee. Unfortunately, the Government and Lord Neill were not minded to take up all of them.
<P>
It is important that political parties are properly funded, but in a way that limits the element of subsidy. As the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, funding should be transparent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has made all of the points that must be made to justify the new clause. I wish to reply to one of the Government's objections to the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for a new tax relief. They argued that other people would be paying for the relief for political parties. It is notable that, during our earlier proceedings, the Government were happy to introduce a tax relief in respect of children, paid for by married couples--through the abolition of their allowance--and by childless couples, so their objection to my hon. Friend's proposal falls by virtue of their own actions in Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> We have had an extremely entertaining debate to mark the end of this Finance Bill Committee. Like my hon. Friends, I shall long treasure the remark of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who suggested that the Liberal Democrats fulfilled the function of ``a spare'' in the political system. Henceforward, we shall think of the Liberal Democrats as the spare tyre of the British political system.
<P>
In his opening remarks, the hon. Gentleman made an important point, which echoed a comment made by the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor) in the debate last November on the Neill committee report. He said that there should be no cherry picking of the Neill committee's recommendations, yet the new clause would do precisely that. It cherry picks one proposal from the Neill committee report and seeks to enact it in this Finance Bill.
<P>
The Government warmly welcomed the Neill report. In the debate on the Neill report, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department, (Mr. Straw) said that the committee had,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shown considerable wisdom and balance in addressing the issues.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the integrity of the democratic process is to be upheld, we must ensure that the whole system of party funding and election expenditure is open, transparent and fair . . . I am on record as saying that the Government strongly welcome the report''.--[Official Report, 9 November 1998; Vol. 319, c.47.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of us would endorse the general remarks made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the importance of the democratic process and the position of political parties within that process. Indeed, it was refreshing to hear the hon. Gentleman speak from the heart, as a Member of Parliament, rather than as someone who was once an accountant. We prefer him in that mode, even if the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) was less charitable.
<P>
As announced in the Queen's Speech, we propose to publish a draft Bill before the summer recess, with a view to putting in place new laws on donations to political parties and campaign expenditure before the next general election. The new clause would pre-empt that process by singling out one of the recommendations in the report for implementation now. The Government do not believe that that is the appropriate way to respond to the Neill committee, which proposed a package of recommendations that should be considered together. That is why I shall ask the Committee to reject the new clause.
<P>
The question of whether there should be tax relief for donations to political parties--and, if so, how it should operate--must be considered alongside all the proposed measures that we intend to publish in the draft Bill before the summer. We should not try to deal with this one aspect in isolation.
<P>
It is also necessary to consider the issue of tax relief for donations to political parties alongside the review of tax relief for charitable donations--something that we are already working on with the charitable sector. It would be most unfortunate if the system appeared to be more generous in relation to smaller donations to political parties than in relation to smaller donations to charities.
<P>
The Neill report also draws attention to the difficulty of establishing a system of tax relief for donations to political parties but not extending equivalent reliefs, or reliefs such as those that are now available to charities and to organisations, such as Amnesty International, that do not qualify for tax relief. That organisation is not a charity because its work is seen as political, but it would not qualify for the relief recommended by the Neill committee because it is not a political party.
<P>
I urge hon. Members to await publication of our draft Bill on donations to political parties and campaign expenditure. I hope that, in the spirit of fraternity, which characterised at least some of his responses to my earlier requests of this kind in Committee, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will agree to withdraw the new clause. He might do so in the spirit of fraternity that has characterised at least some of his responses to similar requests that I have previously made of him. However, if he does not withdraw it, I must ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is the one part of the Bill that relates to matters that are raised in the Neill report. That is why we proposed the new clause. Proposed new subsection (2) of the new clause contains the caveat that the proposals will come into effect only when the majority of the recommendations in the Neill report are implemented. We shall press the new clause to a vote because of the importance of the tax relief and in an attempt to assess the Government's determination to implement the proposals.

<P>
(b) under Schedule 15 to this Act (bearer instruments).
<P>

<P>
PART II

<P>
Charge to tax
<P>
2.--(1) There is a charge to stamp duty reserve tax where--

(a) a person authorises or requires the trustees or managers under a unit trust scheme to treat him as no longer interested in a unit under the scheme, or
<P>
(b) a unit under a unit trust scheme is transferred to the managers of the scheme, and the unit is a chargeable security.
<P>
Those events are referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a ``surrender'' of the unit to the managers.
<P>
(2) The tax is chargeable--
<P>
(a) whether the surrender is made or effected in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and
<P>
(b) whether or not any party is resident or situate in any part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
(3) The persons liable for the tax are the trustees of the unit trust.
<P>
(4) This paragraph is subject to the exclusions provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7.
<P>
Rate of tax
<P>
3.--(1) Tax under this Part of this Schedule is chargeable at the rate of 0.5 per cent. of the market value of the unit.
<P>
This is subject to any reduction under paragraph 4 or 5.

(2) The market value of a unit means whichever is higher of--
<P>
(a) the price the unit might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market at the time of surrender, and
<P>
(b) its cancellation price, or if it is redeemed its redemption price, at that time, calculated in accordance with the trust instrument.
<P>
Proportionate reduction of tax by reference to units issued
<P>
4.--(1) The amount of tax chargeable shall be proportionately reduced if the number of units of the same class as the unit in question that are surrendered to the managers in the relevant two-week period exceeds the number of units of that class issued by the managers in that period.
<P>
(2) The ``relevant two-week period'' in relation to a surrender is the period from the beginning of the of the week in which the surrender occurs to the end of the following week.
<P>
For this purpose a week means a period of seven days beginning with a Sunday.
<P>
(3) The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to the amount otherwise chargeable--
<P>
I / S
<P>
Where:
<P>

<P>
S is the number of units of the class surrendered to the managers in that period.
<P>
(4) If a consolidation or sub-division of units affects the comparison of the number of units surrendered and the number of units issued, the numbers shall be determined as if the consolidation or sub-division had not taken place.
<P>
``Consolidation or sub-division'' includes any alteration of the number of units of the class in question otherwise than in consequence of an increase or reduction in the trust property.
<P>
(5) This paragraph does not apply if on the surrender of the unit the unit holder receives anything other than money; and for the purposes of this paragraph no account shall be taken of a surrender or issue that is not entirely for money.
<P>
Proportionate reduction of tax by reference to assets held
<P>
5.--(1) The amount of tax chargeable after any reduction under paragraph 4 shall be further reduced if in the relevant two-week period the trust property is invested in both exempt and non-exempt investments.
<P>
(2) The reduction is made by applying the following fraction to that amount--
<P>
N / (N + E)
<P>
Where:
<P>
N is the average market value of the non-exempt investments over the relevant two-week period, and
<P>
E is the average market value of the exempt investments over that period.
<P>
(3) In this paragraph ``exempt investment'' has the same meaning as in section 99(5A)(b) of the Finance Act 1986; and ``non-exempt investment'' means any investment that is not an exempt investment.
<P>
Exclusion of charge in certain cases of change of ownership
<P>
6.--(1) This paragraph applies where in pursuance of arrangements between the person entitled to a unit and another person (``the new owner'')--

(c) the Trustees of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, or
<P>

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> We now reach the end of our deliberations. I should like to start by thanking you, Mr. Butterfill, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Cook, for all the kindness, patience, evenhandedness and, in particular, humour that you have demonstrated throughout the Committee's proceedings. We are extremely grateful, and await your invitation to drinks on Thursday with eager anticipation. I should also like to thank the Clerk, the Hansard staff--who, as always, have coped magnificently--the police, the Badge Messengers and everyone who has supported our efforts so well.
<P>
I should like to thank all our officials from the Treasury, the Revenue and Customs, who have helped so much. I should also like to thank Parliamentary Counsel, who work behind the scenes but are essential to everything that we do. I also thank my ministerial colleagues. I think that we have made history as three women Ministers serving on a Finance Bill Committee, and we are proud of that. I also thank our Parliamentary Private Secretaries, who have all done a magnificent job, and Labour members of the Committee for supporting the Government so well. On behalf of all Labour members of the Committee, I should also like to thank the official Opposition, and the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee. [Hon. Members: ``Spares.''] This is harmony; I would not dream of saying anything of the kind. This has been an extremely lively Finance Bill Committee, and many excellent contributions have come from both sides. Our debates have been conducted in great good humour.
<P>
We must say goodbye to some long-standing members of the Finance Bill Committee--the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), who leaves for a silent but important role, and the hon. Member for Cotswold, who leaves for an even more silent role, if that is possible. To paraphrase the song, we do not want to lose them, but they do have to go. We have enjoyed their contributions very much.
<P>
It was difficult to decide on the highlights of our deliberations. At one stage, on hearing the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I thought that we would all start singing ``The Wheels on the Bus''. Like most of the Committee, I recited it daily at one stage. As for the real highlight, the bearded vulture will live forever in my memory.
<P>
I shall conclude as I started by thanking you, Mr. Butterfill. You and Mr. Cook set the tone for our proceedings. The Bill has received the scrutiny that our parliamentary colleagues would wish, and we have had a great deal of fun in the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I thank the Financial Secretary for her kind words about the official Opposition, and I would like to reciprocate the compliment. I should also like to echo her thanks to you, Mr. Butterfill, and to your co-Chairman, Mr. Cook, for the authoritative and fair way in which our proceedings were chaired. We tried some procedural arbitrage early in the Committee to try to find out who would be more tolerant if we were to wander slightly off the true path into the realms of political knockabout. We found that both of you were equally strict, but you tempered that with a great deal of fair-minded latitude where the requirements of the debate merited it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have subjected the Bill to a good deal of scrutiny, although we are only part of the way through that process. I should also like to thank Mr. Proctor and his assistants for their excellent work, both during our proceedings and in assisting hon. Members in tabling amendments. I should like to thank the Official Reporters for turning our proceedings into not exactly literature, but at least something that can be read by people in the outside world.
<P>
We did not win many votes--or, indeed, any of them--although my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) has, to his credit, achieved a legislative milestone in that he altered part of the Bill. However, we did something more important: we won most of the arguments, so that long after the electoral arithmetic has been forgotten, the ideas and arguments advanced by the Opposition will, one day, triumph again.
<P>
We shall re-engage on these important issues on Report, and I look forward to debating the issues with hon. Members and with Government Front-Bench Members, who have been courteous and generally constructive throughout our proceedings. My particular thanks go to both Chairmen, who carried most of the procedural burden. I should be grateful, Mr. Butterfill, if you would pass on those sentiments to Mr. Cook.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> May I add my thanks to you, Mr. Butterfill, and the Clerks? It has been instructive to serve on a Committee chaired by you and Mr. Cook. Thank you for the way in which you have helped along our proceedings and admonished us kindly when we strayed too far.
<P>
I should also like to thank my hon. Friends the Members for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) and for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) for their support. I should also like to thank some of our staff who rarely receive a mention. The staff in the offices of Opposition Members work extremely hard--I see the Financial Secretary nodding--so I should especially like to mention Sonia Sodha and Naomi Hilliar, to whom I shall be sending a copy of Hansard so that they can see this contribution.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have been called the ``spare'' party. However, with the wheels coming off the Conservative party, that spare will soon be used. It is already being used in Scotland, where the tyre has completely fallen off the Conservative car, and we hope that it will soon be used in many other parts of the country.
<P>
One of the delights of serving on this Committee has been the Chancellor's wise decision, no doubt in consultation with other Ministers, to keep the Bill short. Of course, that has reduced our proceedings, because the Finance Bill Committee usually continues until July, but I suggest that it is a development that could be repeated in future years. I am sure that those who use the legislation that we pass would like to see fewer and less complicated laws.
<P>
It is a shame that the Paymaster General is not in her place--I know that she has other responsibilities on the Floor of the House--because she has added greatly to the Committee's proceedings. For me, one of the highlights of our proceedings has been when the Paymaster General promised to write to various hon. Members. At one stage, she even promised us drinks. I have not yet received my drink, but I hope that I shall in due course. I also understand that we shall be at your pleasure later,  Mr. Butterfill, so thank you in advance for that invitation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Committee for those kind words, which I shall certainly pass on to my co-Chairman, Mr. Cook. We have both greatly enjoyed chairing the Committee. I should like to congratulate all Committee members on a constructive and interesting series of debates that have been in the best traditions of the Finance Bill Committee, which I personally believe is the best Standing Committee in the House. Thank you all very much indeed. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday evening at six o'clock.
