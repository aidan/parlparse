<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000431"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
discussing amendment No. 77, in schedule 2,
page 22, line 26, leave out from
&#145;requirement&#146; to end of line 39 and insert</div>
<a name="0811142000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;such requirements as specified by
virtue of section
147(1A).&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000432"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b><b class="B"> </b>I welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Atkinson. At the end of our previous sitting, I was
explaining why we needed to give the commission flexibility. I hope
that the Committee will be reassured to know that the commission is
required to publish guidance on how it will use the civil sanctions
before it is given the power to impose them. We expect that guidance to
be issued at the same time as the guidance on the investigatory powers
in January 2009. Should our expectation of the delivery of that
guidance change, we shall, of course, let the Committee
know.</div><a name="081113104000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance will provide information that will be set out in the order
that the amendment would require. That approach would allow the
commission the necessary flexibility to operate the civil sanctions
regime effectively. It may also give those regulated the sort of
discretionary requirement that the commission would impose and in what
circumstances. Amendment No. 77 would amend the definition of a
discretionary requirement. In practice, it would remove the legal
definition of a discretionary requirement and, because discretionary
requirements are a key element of the suite of civil sanctions provided
to the commission by the Bill, I hope that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discretionary
requirements are defined as a monetary penalty of an amount to be
determined by the commission, a requirement to take such steps to
ensure an offence or contravention does not continue or reoccur, or a
requirement to take steps to resort to what would have been the
position if the offence or contravention had not taken 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>place. The amendment would remove those definitions and amend the
proposed new paragraph to remove the legal definition of a
discretionary requirement. I know that the Committee has been under
considerable pressure and I do not want to labour the point, but we
could not find section 147(1A)&#151;it does not seem to
exist&#151;with which the amendment would replace the proposed new
paragraph under schedule 2. For all those reasons, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div>

Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): We are happy to hear
confirmation from the Minister about the guidance, and a reconfirmation
of its importance. As for the discretionary requirements, the purpose
of deletion was not because they need to be deleted, but to have a hook
on which to hang a debate about what they should be. On the basis of
the Minister&#146;s explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000436"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I join other members of the Committee in welcoming
you to our deliberations, Mr. Atkinson. I am sure that the
Minister will be pleased to know that we are about to discuss a probing
amendment. It provides an opportunity to deal with the theme that runs
through the Bill: the move from civil to criminal sanctions. The
penalties under section 147 of the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 are clearly civil, and are calculated on the basis
of the period in which a person has failed to comply with the
requirement to produce documents. The sanctions range from
&#163;500  to, ultimately, &#163;5,000 if the individual
fails to comply within 12 months. However, in clause 3(3), which deals
with the failure to comply with a stop notice, instead of civil actions
and penalties, we have criminal actions. On indictment, an individual
could be subject to a fine or imprisonment up to two
years.</div><a name="081113104000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said during an evidence session on the Bill, one of my concerns is
that while I understand the need for deterrents for those who hold
important positions in respect of the responsibilities that are covered
by it, I fear that it contains another element of deterrence: the one
that will affect volunteers who could face not only civil but criminal
sanctions if they do not comply with the legislation. This is a hook on
which we can hang that
debate.</div><a name="081113104000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that in this part of the Bill and elsewhere we may well be
introducing penalties and sanctions that are not proportionate. I would
be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that, and also
what he has to say generally on how we can ensure that the volunteers
who are an essential part of all political parties will not be put off
from taking important positions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>in those parties because they fear that they may be subject not only to
a civil penalty but a criminal penalty because of an error, poor advice
or whatever it may
be.</div><a name="081113104000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think particularly of treasurers of local parties and organisations,
and agents for MPs, MSPs and Members of the Welsh Assembly and even
elected local government officials. I would be interested to hear what
reassurance the Minister can give to members of all political parties
that if they do find themselves in a position where they are subject to
the regulations set out in the Bill, they will at least face penalties
that are proportionate if they are found to be in the
wrong.</div><a name="081113104000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000437"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 133 seeks to remove the summary
conviction and indictment penalty tariffs for an offence under
paragraph 14 of proposed new schedule 19B, which deals with failure to
comply with a stop
notice.</div><a name="081113104000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considerable concerns about the powers to be given to the
commission in respect of stop notices. On a fundamental level, giving
the commission the power to prevent people from doing what is a lawful
act is unsettling and something that we will wish to explore at a
relevant point when discussing the schedule. We do not support the
imposition of one-size-fits-all penalties and are concerned that the
amendment, while well-intentioned in that it would reduce the maximum
penalty, would be arbitrary and, in some cases,
disproportionate.</div><a name="081113104000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
was made during the lead-up to the Bill of the role of better
regulatory regimes and the use of flexible tariffs. Professor
Macrory&#146;s review entitled &#147;Regulatory Justice: Making
Sanctions Effective&#148; was published in November 2006. At the
Government&#146;s instigation, he reviewed the entire system of
regulatory sanctions in law at that date. One of the main findings of
the report was the existence of the so-called compliance deficit, which
arises where the sanctions available to a regulator are not
sufficiently flexible to allow them to respond proportionately to
offences, the consequence of which is that regulators are reluctant to
take enforcement action. One of the stated aims of schedule 2 is to
give effect to the proposals in that report and provide the commission
with a wider set of sanctioning powers that would allow it more
flexibility and proportionality when sanctioning those committing
offences under
PPERA.</div><a name="081113104000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are concerned that, under the amendment, we could take a step back from
that level of flexibility. Having a range of sanctions will always
require there to be a significant option available; it may not be used
at all, but its existence acts as a deterrent. I am afraid that the
amendment would remove that option and possibly undermine the
seriousness of the offence. Having said that, we have more sympathy
with the Government on whether this should be an indictable crime in
the first place. We will be looking at our position in that regard,
leading up to Report. We do not support the amendment as currently
proposed.</div><a name="081113104000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 82 and 83, tabled in my name, deal with the level of penalties
involved in breaches of stop notices. Paragraph 10 of part 3 of
schedule 2 proposes to give the commission the power to impose stop
notices on people to prevent them from carrying on an activity that the
commission reasonably believes is likely to involve committing an
offence or contravention under PPERA. Furthermore, the commission may
impose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>such a notice where it believes that a person&#146;s activity is
likely to lead them to commit an offence or contravention. In both
situations, the commission must also reasonably believe that such
activities are damaging to public confidence in the PPERA controls on
income and
expenditure.</div><a name="081113104000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 82 and 83, which are probing amendments, would amend clause 3(3).
They were tabled to discover why the Government feel it necessary to
increase the penalty for failure to comply with a stop notice to
&#163;20,000&#151;far more than the statutory maximum and the usual
penalty throughout the rest of this Bill. We will discuss our
objections to stop notices more generally later
on.</div><a name="081113104000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081113104000438"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I am sympathetic to the remarks
of the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, who
moved the amendment, about the difference between criminal and civil
sanctions. One might add regulatory sanctions, as well. It is important
that proportionality be maintained in looking at what consequences
there should be in respect of failures to comply with the requirements
of such a law.</div>
<a name="081113104000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the stop notice, I have more sympathy with the Government&#146;s
position, because the stop notice is the equivalent in civil law of an
injunction; it is saying to the person concerned, &#147;You must stop
doing this now.&#148; The only way in which such a notice should be
complied with is by those concerned stopping doing the thing itself. We
should not be in a position where, effectively, a person not in
compliance with a stop notice&#151;not in compliance with the
law&#151;can buy themselves out of compliance by paying the fine. It
is not right that, when someone faces the equivalent of an injunction,
they can simply pay a small amount of money and carry on doing what
they were doing
before.</div><a name="081113104000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important question is not the size of the fine or penalty, which is
also crucial&#151;if someone disobeys an injunction in ordinary law
the penalties are at large and they can go to jail until they
comply&#151;but the conditions under which the stop notice can be
issued. That is the crucial question. Are the conditions under which
stop notices can be issued serious enough to justify an equivalence
with a civil injunction? I should like the Minister to explore that in
his
reply.</div><a name="081113104000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
present draft of the schedule talks about serious damage to public
confidence. In the Electoral Commission&#146;s view, serious damage
to public confidence is enough to justify a stop notice. I want the
Minister to say whether that is enough. What circumstances are imagined
as leading to serious damage to public confidence? Will it be relevant,
for example, that non-compliance happens during an election? Will that
make the issuance of a stop notice more or less likely? I am perfectly
willing to accept that there are conditions in which a stop notice will
be justified. We will get to that point later, but I am not yet
entirely clear about exactly what is envisaged as serious
damage.</div><a name="081113104000398"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="081113104000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000439"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Again, the Government clearly recognise all the
concerns that have been expressed. I am glad that all the members of
the Committee who have spoken on the matter have recognised the need
for flexibility and proportionality. That is exactly what the Bill is
designed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>to introduce. One reason why we introduced it was to deal with the
inflexibilities that have transpired in the 2000 Act. We have been
guided throughout by our desire to introduce greater flexibility and
proportionality into the
system.</div><a name="081113104000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all agree that the sanction is serious, and it will be used only in the
most serious circumstances. The hon. Member for Cambridge asked what
those circumstances might be. In the end, of course, that will be a
matter for the Electoral Commission&#146;s judgment. However, we
cannot allow the sanctions that might follow serious transgressions to
be considered an occupational hazard by someone who is absolutely
determined to break donation rules, for example, on a large scale. Such
activity during an election could have a decisive outcome on the
result. We simply must give the commission the ability to stop such
activity, which could decisively turn the outcome of an election. It is
important to realise that the power is to be used only in such extreme
circumstances, although we can talk about the nature of the
penalty.</div>
<a name="081113104000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
address the amendments in some detail, because I recognise that concern
was raised about the sanction on Second Reading. It is important that I
put on the record a detailed account of how we have come to our view.
The figure of &#163;20,000 was imported from the Regulatory
Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, and we saw no reason to vary it. It
is worth pointing out that the court will have discretion in imposing a
fine for the breach of a stop notice. It does not follow that fines of
&#163;20,000 will be automatic or customary for a breach of a stop
notice.</div>
<a name="081113104000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to put on record the circumstances in which a stop notice may
be served. The commission must reasonably believe
that</div><a name="081113104000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
activity as carried on by the person is seriously damaging public
confidence in the effectiveness of the controls in this Act on the
income and expenditure of registered parties and others, or presents
significant risk of doing
so&#148;.</div><a name="081113104000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, public law principles of reasonableness will require the
commission to consider whether its other sanctions would be appropriate
first. Only having considered all the other sanctions available to it
and decided that they were not appropriate in the circumstances could
it consider using this sanction. That is intentionally a very hard
test. As with the use of stop notices under the Regulatory Enforcement
and Sanctions Act, the person or party concerned will of course retain
the right of appeal to a county court, or in Scotland to a sheriff,
against the imposition of a stop notice. To support the use of stop
notices, sanctions for non-compliance must be available, and they are
provided for in clause
3(3).</div><a name="081113104000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have significant reservations about the alternative sanctions suggested
in the amendments. I take it that they are probing amendments, but it
is important for me to put on record why we are concerned about them. I
do not believe that the sanction proposed in amendment No. 133 would
take into account the potential scale of an offence or provide for the
flexibility that may be required when a sanction is applied for on
indictment. We have deliberately ensured the possibility of a weighty
financial sanction, because the sanction ought to be
serious.</div><a name="081113104000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the transgression revolved around a wealthy donor spending huge sums of
money where that was prohibited, a fine of &#163;1,000 would simply
not be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>sufficient deterrent, but merely be taken as part of the business. There
may also be a case where circumstances are so serious that more than
one stop notice had been deployed in respect of the same person or
organisation, and those notices would not have been complied with. We
should not seek to limit the discretion of the Crown court in this way.
Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 would change the financial penalty imposed,
reducing it from &#163;20,000 to a statutory maximum of
&#163;5,000, for much the same reasons. A fine at such a level would
not be sufficient deterrent in circumstances where a severe sanction
should
apply.</div><a name="081113104000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
significant concern that I have with all three amendments is that they
would be making quite an exception to the framework laid down in the
Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act, which sets out penalties for
a breach of the stop notice in identical terms to the Bill. Again going
back to the strictures laid down by the hon. Member for Cambridge at
the start of the Committee&#146;s proceedings, we have to be careful
about how the public perceive us as proceeding in the Bill. We must be
careful about seeking to make exceptions for
ourselves&#151;politicians&#151;from other people who are regulated
by public bodies, unless there is a genuine distinction to be made. In
these circumstances, I find it hard to make such a
distinction.</div><a name="081113104000044"></a>

Howarth:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation of the clauses. It occurs to me, having heard him, that
&#163;20,000 might not be enough. If people are willing to give
donations of millions of pounds to political parties&#151;it is worth

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000441"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> That is open to argument, and the hon. Gentleman
may have decided to table an amendment to that effect. However, as I
say, we have been guided by an Act that is already in force&#151;the
House had plenty of time to reflect on it and came to a conclusion, so
we thought it appropriate to follow the conclusions in that Act. Of
course, as with all such things, the House is always at liberty to
revisit the situation in the future. Anyway, on that basis, I hope that
the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="081113104000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000442"></a>Nick

and his assurances about proportionality, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

Bill.</div><a name="081113104000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000443"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I make it clear at the outset of the debate on
clause stand part that the Conservative party accepts that there may be
cases where the use of civil sanctions may be more appropriate than the
heavy-handed use of criminal sanctions under the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000. To that extent, we welcome the
clause conceptually. However, we wish to ensure that any use of the new
sanctions is proportionate, risk-based and fair, which is why we need
to review the effects of the
clause.</div><a name="081113104000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill provides the commission with a wide  range of sanctions to
enable it to be a more effective  and robust regulator. The
January 2007 Committee on Standards in Public Life report picked up on
the problems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>of the penalty regime available to the commission, noting that the only
sanctions that the Electoral Commission has if the parties do not
comply with the legislation is to name and shame or, if the offence is
sufficiently serious, to refer it to the Crown Prosecution Service.
Section 147 of PPERA created a civil penalty for failure to deliver
specified documents to the commission. Subsections (3) and (4) are
modelled on the financial penalties to which public companies are
liable for failure to submit accounts, providing for a range of
penalties depending on the length of the period of
non-compliance.</div><a name="081113104000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
148 created general offences intended to guard against tampering with
documents or with information to avoid the provisions of PPERA. The
section specifically singles out the alteration or suppression of
relevant documents, or the withholding or falsifying of information.
Section 150, in schedule 20, set out the penalties for all the criminal
offences created by the Act. Those are entirely prescriptive and allow
for no variation or flexibility to provide for the penalty to be
tailored to the
offence.</div><a name="081113104000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
sections 151 to 153 were concerned with summary proceedings and
offences committed by bodies corporate and unincorporated associations,
section 154 required the courts to notify the commission of the
conviction of any person under the provisions of the Act, or under any
other enactment relating to elections. Such notifications were designed
to enable the commission to check whether a person registered as a
party&#146;s treasurer, as the treasurer of an accounting unit or as
a deputy treasurer was disbarred from holding such
office.</div><a name="081113104000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a nutshell, those are the powers and sanctions that the commission
enjoys. The Committee on Standards in Public Life summarised them in
its report and concluded that the only sanction available to the
commission where parties did not comply with the legislation was to
name and shame or, if the offence was sufficiently serious, to refer
the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. That has resulted in the
commission seeming to be reluctant to refer matters to the CPS, because
it may be disproportionate to prosecute such an offence and it would
not be taken forward by the CPS on the basis that that was not in the
public interest. That is the so-called compliance deficit. We have not
yet got to the bottom of the further question, which is
whether the unwillingness to prosecute is due the lack of legal
powers or the lack of management initiative on the part of the
Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="081113104000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the eight years since its inception, the commission has prosecuted only
29 people for crimes under the PPERA. Even then, only 23 of those ended
with a conviction. The need to fill the perceived gap in sanctioning
powers with a more proportionate penalty system was understood and the
commission was one of its main advocates from the outset. In his 2006
submission to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Peter Wardle,
the chief executive of the commission, expressed just that
idea:</div><a name="081113104000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think the question of administrative penalties is the other area we
would be looking for change in the
law.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was picked up by the Committee on Standards  in Public Life,
and it formed the basis of recommendation 7 in its
report:</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div><a name="081113104000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government should consider introducing a system of financial penalties,
with an appropriate appeal mechanism, that could be applied by the
Electoral Commission for non-compliance with the regulatory
requirements. Responsibility for prosecution... should continue to
lie with the Crown Prosecution
Service.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill therefore aims to provide the commission with a wider range of
sanctions to enable it to be a more effective and robust
regulator.</div><a name="081113104000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sanctions are based on those recently set out in the Regulatory
Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, which made provision for a wider
range of administrative sanctions to be available to regulators,
thereby giving them more options and greater flexibility. The
provisions of clause 3 will give the commission new powers to apply a
range of civil sanctions to offences committed under PPERA. The clause
will substitute proposed new section 147 for the existing section 147
of PPERA. The new section 147 will insert new schedule 19B to the Act,
as set out in schedule 2 of the Bill.</div>
<a name="081113104000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
schedule makes provision for the range of new civil sanctions available
to the commission, which includes fixed monetary penalties,
discretionary requirements, stop notices and enforcement undertakings.
The new schedule goes on to explain when and how the commission can
apply the sanctions and what appeal processes are available. I have
reviewed the schedule in the run-up to today&#146;s
sitting&#151;all 15 pages of it&#151;and I must confess that it has
left me unclear about what someone has to do to ensure that they do not
become subject to one of its many
sanctions.</div><a name="081113104000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we come to the amendments, we must spare a thought for those volunteers
in local party offices who will be the ones to implement these new
legislative requirements and bear the full force of any penalty that
might be incurred. Will they understand the new schedule? I hope so. It
might be helpful if the Minister explains how he will ensure that they
can understand
it.</div><a name="081113104000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission, rather unsurprisingly, has welcomed the proposals and notes
in its memorandum on the Bill that it
believes</div><a name="081113104000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
proposed changes to its investigation and sanctioning
powers&#148;</div><a name="081113104000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">will
allow it to
take</div><a name="081113104000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;proportionate
enforcement
action&#148;</div><a name="081113104000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">within</div><a name="081113104000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
well recognised framework of good regulatory
practice.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support the general principle behind the new sanctioning powers that
are to be given to the commission. It must be hoped that the new
sanctions will allow it to fulfil its new role as regulator and monitor
of party funding, both effectively and proportionately. I would,
however, like to put some questions to the Minister on the provenance
of those
powers.</div><a name="081113104000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">House
of Commons Library research paper 0874 notes that the sanctions are
based on those outlined in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act
2008, as the Minister said. That Act has recently been enacted on the
back of the Hampton review, which was commissioned by the Government in
2004, and the Macrory review of the following year. The Hampton review
looked specifically at how the administrative burden of regulation on
businesses could be reduced at the same time as preserving regulatory
outcomes. It looked also at the work of 63 national regulators and 468
local authorities. Will the Minister address the question whether the
commission was included as one of those who were consulted? I cannot
see that it was, but the Minister may put me
right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div><a name="081113104000399"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="081113104000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Macrory review was far more wide-ranging, with the Government asking
Professor Macrory to review the entire system of regulatory functions.
The major theme of the recommendations in the Hampton review was to
call for a risk-based approach to regulatory enforcement, involving
greater and more consistent use of risk assessment techniques. Risk
assessment is an essential means of directing regulatory resources
where they can have maximum impact and outcome. Will the Minister tell
hon. Members whether a risk assessment was undertaken when reviewing
the proposed new powers of the commission? If it was, will he give
details of how the assessment was made and what the results
were?</div><a name="081113104000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
in the Conservative party feel that a far riskier area is that of
electoral malpractice and fraud, which is not dealt with under the Bill
or covered by the commission&#146;s new powers. Our admittedly
non-scientific risk assessment is that the Government have made a
glaring error in not including such provisions in the Bill. Will the
Minister explain how that was not picked up in the Government&#146;s
risk assessment? If it was, why did the Government choose not to
include those powers in the Bill?</div>
<a name="081113104000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Macrory&#146;s findings were published in November 2006 and were
aimed at balancing the needs of workers, consumers, the environment and
compliant businesses with the need to take effective action against
those businesses that intentionally and knowingly fail to comply with
regulatory obligations on
time.</div><a name="081113104000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government were quick to accept the conclusions of the review which at
its heart had two key concepts. The first is the concept of restorative
justice, which seeks to change behaviour and redress the harm caused,
as much as simply to punish wrongdoing. The second is the so-called
compliance deficit, which arises where the sanctions available to a
regulator are not sufficiently flexible to allow it to respond
proportionately to offences. The consequence of that is that regulators
are reluctant to take enforcement
action.</div><a name="081113104000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
ideas manifested themselves in what Professor Macrory called the six
penalties principles. A sanction should first aim to change the
behaviour of the offender. Secondly, it should aim to eliminate any
financial gain or benefit from non-compliance. Thirdly, it should be
responsive and consider what is appropriate for the particular offender
and the regulatory issue, which can include punishment and the public
stigma that should be associated with a criminal conviction. Fourthly,
it should be proportionate to the nature of the offence and the harm
caused. Fifthly, it should aim to restore the harm caused by regulatory
non-compliance where appropriate. It should sixthly aim to deter future
non-compliance. The better regulation section of the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform website summarises the
review&#146;s recommendations and the implementing measures in the
2008
Act.</div><a name="081113104000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government accepted the report&#146;s recommendations in full and
without question by taking them forward as the central core of the 2008
Act. They have taken the same approach in the Bill. From what I can
see, they have simply provided for the wholesale inclusion of those
recommendations, without specific regard to the unique position of the
commission. Will the Minister address that important
issue?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="081113104000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister tell us what consultation process was undertaken as a
precursor to the inclusion of these powers in the Bill? How have they
been tailored to fit the remit of the commission? Were equivalent
systems in other countries looked at as part of that
process?</div><a name="081113104000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I want to touch on the question of safeguards and proportionality. We
are being asked to grant the commission what it asks for: a package of
flexible sanctions that provides them with an arsenal of wide-ranging
enforcement powers. However, what have we had from the commission to
show that it knows how to use such powers? What safeguards are in place
to stop the powers being abused further down the line by commissions of
the
future?</div><a name="081113104000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wish to investigate that through our amendments to schedule 2. How
often can we expect to see stop notices falling through the letter box
of party donors up and down the UK? Will the commission continue to
show the same unwillingness it showed with its sanctioning powers under
the PPERA? Will the Minister give hon. Members any research that has
been done on the need for these news
powers?</div><a name="081113104000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission&#146;s memorandum on the Bill stated that it was able to
use these powers only when satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an
offence or contravention of PPERA had occurred. It went on to state
that the commission need have only reasonable belief to issue stop
notices, with the added element that the action they are stopping poses
significant risk of undermining public confidence in the effectiveness
of the law on party and election
funding.</div><a name="081113104000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister agree with the assertion that the
Bill</div><a name="081113104000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;rightly
applies high thresholds to our use of these
sanctions&#148;?</div><a name="081113104000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not entirely convinced. Given our debates on the amendments, I am
not sure that the assertion is correct. I would like to know the
Minister&#146;s position on the
matter.</div><a name="081113104000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000444"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I suspect that it will not be popular to say so,
but I support the clause on the basis of what I said earlier. As
referred to several times by the Minister, politicians must not give
themselves arbitrary exemptions from regimes of the kind that they
impose on others. It is perfectly possible to object on principle to
the idea of administrative fines and regulatory sanctions of this sort.
An objection could be made on the grounds that it is wrong for a
regulatory body to be the judge in its own cause. For example, the
regulatory body is effectively the investigator, the prosecutor and the
imposer of fines, which are subject to appeal. However, on many
occasions, that principle has been given away in other legislation with
regard to other members of the public. That goes to back to the Inland
Revenue, which is the original governmental organisation that was given
the power to impose such administrative fines on
citizens.</div><a name="081113104000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that the clause must be right in principle. It sets up a
regime for politics that is the same as that used generally in
regulatory enforcement. The hon. Member for Huntingdon is quite right
that the principles in the 2008 Act have been applied to the areas
covered by the Electoral Commission. That is absolutely the right thing
to do in the clause, although there is room for debate about details
and specific applicability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="081113104000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
understand what the hon. Gentleman was getting at when he suggested
that there was a commission enforcement deficit because of management
failure to invoke criminal sanctions via the CPS, as opposed to the
commission&#146;s argument that it did not have proper flexibility in
the range of sanctions available to it. If that is his position, he is
advocating the greater criminalisation of political activity, which is
quite the opposite of what we both want in this
field.</div><a name="081113104000080"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000445"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No. I made it quite clear at the start of my
remarks that we support a proportionate civil response procedure. That
does not mean that we should not look at how the Government came up
with that procedure, whether it fits the Bill exactly or whether
lifting it is
adequate.</div><a name="081113104000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000446"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not think that is an explanation of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s implied attack on what the commission is doing,
which was wrong. The commission is correct to say that it has lacked
proper flexibility in what it can do in the light of breaches of the
legislation. It needs greater flexibility, and it is right that the
kind of regime that is applied in other areas of regulation is at least
the starting point for dealing with such
breaches.</div><a name="081113104000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to ask questions about specific
examples and particular sanctions. It is clear that the reason for the
proposal is the applicability to this area of what is now the normal
way of dealing with regulatory sanctions. That seems perfectly proper
and I support the
clause.</div><a name="081113104000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000447"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> When we published the White Paper on party funding
on 16 June 2008, we announced our intention to legislate to make the
Electoral Commission a more effective regulator. An important part of
achieving that aim is to provide the wide range of more flexible civil
sanctions set out in the clause. Empowering the Electoral Commission
better to fulfil its mandate of regulating the political field has been
the subject of numerous independent reviews. It was recommended in the
2007 Committee on Standards in Public Life report, and it was supported
by the Sir Hayden Phillips report on party finance and
expenditure.</div><a name="081113104000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a strong and emerging consensus that, under the new approach, the
commission should be a proactive regulator and that there must be civil
sanctions that can be applied directly so that the commission can
enforce the framework laid down in the 2000 Act more
effectively.</div><a name="081113104000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
looked at international comparisons and jurisdictions, and we decided
that UK domestic experience was more important, so we largely
transposed the 2008 Act, although we have tailored it where we thought
that appropriate. The stop notices that we have been discussing, for
example, show how we have tailored its provisions.</div>
<a name="081113104000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon talked about the perceived need for the proposal,
and wondered about the unwillingness of the Electoral Commission to
prosecute, but the Electoral Commission does not prosecute&#151;the
CPS does. We cannot blame the Electoral Commission for not proceeding
in an area in which it does not have competence to do so. I refer to
schedule 2 in this stand part debate because its detail supports and is
linked to clause 3. Clause 3 substitutes section 147 of PPERA and gives
effect to a proposed new schedule&#151;19B&#151;which is set out in
schedule 2 of the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="081113104000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
and schedule give the Electoral Commission access to a flexible range
of civil sanctions that may be imposed in relation to certain offences
and contraventions under the 2000 Act. Proposed new schedule 19B sets
out the range of new civil penalties available to the commission when
it is able to apply those sanctions. It also sets out to whom they may
apply and what appeal processes are available to an individual or
organisation subject to a sanction. The civil sanctions made available
mirror those set out in the 2008 Act: fixed monetary penalties,
discretionary requirements, stop notices and enforcement
undertakings.</div>
<a name="081113104000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked, as he often does, why the Bill is not tackling
electoral fraud. He knows that we take this matter&#151;it is a
problem&#151;as seriously as anybody else
does.</div><a name="081113104000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000448"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister does not take it as seriously as
us, otherwise he would have put provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="081113104000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000449"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect, the hon. Gentleman needs to
recognise the fact that not every Bill has to tackle every single
issue. As he well knows, we have already taken significant measures to
deal with electoral fraud. I hope that he will now tell me what
measures we have reasonably taken, because he persists in intervening
and making statements that suggest that he is completely unaware of
them. Can he tell
us?</div><a name="081113104000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000450"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I repeat that witness after witness came to the
Committee a couple of weeks ago saying that the Bill should deal
primarily with electoral
fraud.</div><a name="081113104000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000451"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he may be
referring to the evidence of Sir Christopher Kelly. If he bears with
me, I will read out exactly what was said.
<i class="I">[Interruption</i><i class="I">.</i><i class="I">]</i> All right, the hon. Gentleman does
not want to hear it, but I will address the point directly. As he
cannot tell us what measures we have taken, let me mention some of
them.</div><a name="081113104000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have introduced a system of personal identifiers for postal voters to
ensure that postal votes counted in an election are valid. The
evaluation reports produced by the Electoral Commission on elections in
2007 and 2008 show a reduction on previous years in the number and
scale of allegations of electoral offences. The reports concluded that
the action taken had a positive impact on the safety and security of
the electoral
system.</div><a name="081113104000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that of course we take these matters
seriously. We cannot be complacent about any instance of electoral
fraud. We have taken action, are taking action and will do so in future
should it be necessary. The Electoral Commission reports seem to
suggest that the actions we are taking are proving effective. That is
not to say that we will not return to the matter in future legislation.
However, we are dealing with important measures in this Bill, and as
the entire Committee will be aware, they are causing considerable
concern and are taking considerable time. It is important that we deal
with them
properly.</div><a name="081113104000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far, the hon. Gentleman has not suggested for one second that any
single measure in the Bill is unimportant and should not be dealt
with.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000452"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hope that the Minister thinks that we are
dealing with the measures in the Bill. I have been taking the Committee
seriously. I want to return to the single measure that the Minister
claims to have brought in to deal with electoral fraud&#151;the
introduction of personal identifiers. Yes, that measure ended up with
the introduction of signatures, but that can hardly be called
significant in the context of what should be done, which is to use
national insurance numbers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000453"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000454"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am sure that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will
seek to repeat his refrain frequently. When we return to the subject, I
hope that Opposition Members remember what I have had to say and the
conclusions of the Electoral Commission, and that they read the
evidence with more care than they appear to have used so
far.</div><a name="081113104000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was endeavouring to respond to comments, but I will now address clause
3. As members of the Committee will be aware, the Bill does not set out
which offences under the 2000 Act could attract civil sanction in lieu
of criminal prosecution. That will be done through secondary
legislation. I believe that the new powers will allow the Electoral
Commission to become a more robust and effective regulator, enabling it
to intervene more rigorously when the rules of the 2000 Act are not
observed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000457"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This schedule specifies the various civil
sanctions proposed in the Bill. The amendments relate to paragraphs 1
and 5 of proposed new schedule 19B to the 2000 Act, which schedule 2 of
the Bill introduces. Part 1 is entitled &#147;Fixed monetary
penalties&#148;. The commission is empowered to impose a fixed
monetary penalty on the person, registered party, recognised third
party or permitted participant if it is satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that an offence under PPERA has been committed or, more loosely,
that there has been a contravention of a requirement imposed by that
Act. Paragraph 1(6) of the proposed new schedule states that where an
individual is issued with a fixed monetary penalty for an offence, that
could be</div>
<a name="081113104000113"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;punishable on
summary conviction by a
fine&#148;.</div><a name="081113104000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
penalty must not exceed the maximum of that fine.</div>
<a name="081113104000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person who
has been served with a fixed penalty notice may appeal in writing to
the commission within 28 days. The recipient also has the opportunity
to discharge their liability by payment of a sum less than or equal to
the full penalty. After that 28-day period, the commission must decide
whether to impose a penalty&#151;in which case a further notice will
served&#151;or not to proceed if it is no longer satisfied that an
offence has been committed. If the person is served with a fixed
penalty, they may appeal to a county court against the
decision.</div><a name="081113104000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 31 to 34 and Nos. 73 to 76 are probing and seek they clarification
on the Government&#146;s use of the words &#147;prescribed
restriction or requirement&#148;
and</div><a name="081113104000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
virtue of this Act&#148;</div>
<a name="081113104000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">in paragraphs 1 and 5
respectively. The latter amendments are essentially consequential on
the former, as the same wording is applied to discretionary
requirements as to fixed penalty
notices.</div><a name="081113104000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
two civil sanctions form the core of the new flexible powers that the
commission will be granted under the Bill to enable it to deal with
enforcement in a more flexible and proportionate manner. Fixed penalty
notices require a person, a registered party, a recognised third party
or a permitted person to pay an amount, specified in the notice, to the
commission as a penalty for an offence under PPERA. Likewise, a
discretionary notice places such persons under a duty to comply with a
requirement placed on them by the commission to avoid further
penalties.</div><a name="081113104000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are slightly concerned at such broad terms and at the loose manner in
which they may be interpreted by the commission. This is a complex and
difficult area of law to understand and legislate on&#151;that has
been self-evident in our proceedings&#151;and we believe that the
drafting of these paragraphs is too broad. The possibility for wider
interpretation makes the possibility of abuse
high.</div><a name="081113104000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should ensure that we clearly set out the parameters of the powers and
the circumstances in which they may be used&#151;not necessarily for
the current commission,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>which has been privy to much of the debate, but for the commissioners of
the future, who might not be so rational in their use of the
powers.</div>
<a name="081113104000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
having this discussion because of the broad remit given to the
commission in previous legislation. In the past, there has been a
tendency to interpret the commission&#146;s broad powers as an
invitation to limit its role as a regulator. We must ensure that we
give the commission a precise and coherent pointer as to its role.
Unfortunately, that is not the case with the drafting of these
measures.</div>
<a name="081113104000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lack of
clarity also impacts on implementation. How can the individuals, groups
and associations covered by the powers be expected to know what they
should or should not do? They could be penalised if they get it wrong.
The phrase</div>
<a name="081113104000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a...requirement...by
virtue of this
Act&#148;</div><a name="081113104000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
simply too opaque for practical
purposes.</div><a name="081113104000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also fear that the drafting may produce several unwanted outcomes. A
less scrupulous commission could see it as giving free rein to use the
powers, if it can squeeze its actions in under the broad headings.
Press coverage of one heavy-handed or botched case could lead to a fall
in the number of volunteers, who might fear being heavily punished for
small mistakes. Then, in another six years&#146; time, we could be
forced to review the commission&#146;s powers again in another
attempt to refocus its role.</div>
<a name="081113104000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 71 would delete paragraph 4, which deals with criminal proceedings
and convictions in relation to fixed penalties. It is a probing
amendment to try to discover the rationale behind the provisions. We
are not entirely convinced that it is necessarily a good course of
action to prevent the use of criminal proceedings as the ultimate
weapon against non-compliance with earlier civil sanctions. We are
concerned that the measure is too blunt in how it addresses the issue
and would like to hear the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="081113104000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 72 would insert in paragraph 4 a new sub-paragraph, which would
expressly exclude paragraph 4 from preventing any criminal proceedings
being taken for any other offence under PPERA, or any other Act. The
amendment is a consequence of our probing of this provision with
amendment No. 71 and it would ensure that there was no confusion or
possible grounds for a person to wriggle out of the
offence.</div><a name="081113104000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a number of different offences relating to elections and political
funding, not least in the Representation of the People Act 2000. Our
amendment would make it clear that there was no overlap that would
prevent a person from being prosecuted under such Acts where relevant.
We should be careful not to encroach accidentally on other Acts,
thereby reducing their punitive effectiveness or the offences under
them.</div><a name="081113104000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 46 would strike out paragraph 8, although it is probing. Paragraph
8 deals with the imposition of criminal convictions for offences that
have also involved the award of a discretionary requirement penalty.
The Government&#146;s attempts to prevent double jeopardy and the
possibility of double penalties could be seen as too opaque and
confusing. There is no reference to any time limit for the application
of the provision, nor does it cover the possibility of what happens
when there is non-compliance with earlier  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>sanctions. In addition, the carve-outs under sub-paragraph
(2) seem to leave little for the provision to bite on. We would welcome
the Minister&#146;s clarification on that
aspect.</div><a name="081113104000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 47 comes as a consequence of our probing amendment No. 46, and it
would ensure that there was no confusion or possible grounds for a
person to get out of the offence. There are a number of offences
relating to elections and political funding, not least under the RPA.
We have to be careful not to tie the hands of the commission when that
is not
necessary.</div><a name="081113104000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 56, which is also probing, would strike out paragraph 20, which
deals with the extension of the time limits laid down in the schedule
for the commission taking criminal proceedings. Will the Minister
please shed some light on why the commission will need to extend the
time for taking criminal proceedings: under what circumstances is that
likely to happen? Given that the commission must be able to show beyond
reasonable doubt that any sanction is required, is it not unlikely to
be necessary&#151;indeed, it might be unreasonable&#151;to grant it
additional time if it has not made full use of the investigatory powers
granted to it by schedule 1? We must end investigations at some point,
otherwise we will be in danger of their running on for years, which
could be unfair and
unjustifiable.</div><a name="081113104000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
if the Minister can convince us of the need for the power, should it
not be subject to judicial consent so as to safeguard against abuse by
the
commission?</div><a name="081113104000132"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000458"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Amendment No. 1 might seem to be a complete
contradiction of the argument that I was advocating earlier when we
were trying to prevent a move towards criminal sanctions rather than
civil sanctions. However, it seems that the process under schedule 2
means that an individual who believes himself to be innocent of a
charge brought by the Electoral Commission has to go through a long and
drawn-out process, and that no alternative to that process is set out
in the
schedule.</div><a name="081113104000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment suggests that an individual can make a representation to the
Electoral Commission and
may</div><a name="081113104000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
notice require the Commission to withdraw the notice and pursue the
matter as a criminal offence under the relevant
provisions.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
an alternative provision to the procedures under the schedule could
deal with one of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Huntingdon.
Many people are concerned about the fact that someone might be accused
of an offence and, that a long time will be taken to resolve such
matters during which time the individual is under an extremely dark
cloud. In such circumstances, a penalty might have been imposed on an
individual who may not be guilty of an
offence.</div><a name="081113104000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us suppose that an individual could say to the commission, &#147;I
believe that I am innocent and I want my chance to prove it as quickly
as possible. If you believe that I am guilty of such offences, let us
argue them out in court where the provision of proof is beyond
reasonable doubt rather than proceedings taking place on the balance of
probabilities that the commission will use.&#148; That option would
be fairer on the individual and possibly address the speed with which
an accusation is properly addressed and ultimately
resolved.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="081113104000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081113104000459"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): On a point of accuracy,
although the commission would not be a court of law, it would have to
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the civil breach, just as
much as if it thought that an offence had
occurred.</div><a name="081113104000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000460"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s
point.</div><a name="081113104000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to deal with delay. We know of examples of
hon. Members still awaiting resolution of serious issues, and whose
careers have been blighted as a result of a significant delay. This is
not the place to discuss that, but it is clear that, because of a long,
drawn-out process, justice might not have been done in certain cases. I
am suggesting a way in which to address that problem, but I should be
interested in what the Minister has to say about the length of time
that the processes take. In all circumstances, it is far better to have
such matters aired as quickly as possible, and resolutions found as
quickly as
possible.</div><a name="081113104000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="081113104000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000461"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I shall deal first with amendment No. 1. The hon.
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire is right that a
delay in the proceedings is a problem. It certainly is for people who
are innocent and find it difficult to establish that. However, although
the particular mechanism proposed is interesting, it has a number of
difficulties. The main problem is that it allows someone to raise the
stakes and go through procedure that the Electoral Commission would
find more expensive. One can imagine that very well-off people who are
accused of breaching the legislation in particular ways would use that
method to, in effect, intimidate the commission and say,
&#147;You&#146;ve not got enough resources to pursue me in the
criminal courts.&#148; That would therefore be a way for them to get
the accusations against them dropped. There has to be a way to speed up
the process because the legislation should not give an unfair advantage
to well-off people who are accused over people who are not well off.
However, I fully accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that speed in
the proceedings is
important.</div><a name="081113104000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000462"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman suggest a mechanism that
would do just
that?</div><a name="081113104000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000463"></a>David
Howarth:</b> No, I cannot. That is why the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire is right to raise the issue
and ask the Government to think through these
matters.</div><a name="081113104000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that the hon. Member for Huntingdon said that his amendments
were tabled on a probing basis. That means I need not spend the time
that I was going to spend dismantling them. However, I shall put a
couple of points on the record. The schedule allows for civil sanctions
not only to be used where the commission thinks a criminal offence has
been committed, but where there has been some contravention of other
requirements. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to say, as he
did, that there is a question about the clarity of that and where it
would apply. However, there is no doubt that there are some instances
in which that would apply and where it would be useful for the
commission to have such a power.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div><a name="081113104000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example
the commission gives in its latest briefing is worth putting on the
record. It talks about the regulations on accounts and reports of
donations. There is a requirement on parties to give full and accurate
quarterly reports of donations and loans. It is a criminal offence to
make those reports late, but it is not a criminal offence to make them
inaccurately. The question is what to do about that situation. One
possibility is to make that a criminal offence as well, which I think
the hon. Gentleman might have been suggesting. However, that would
simply increase the number of criminal offences created by the statute.
The other possibility is simply to say that this is a regulatory
requirement and there needs to be some sanction for missing it. What
should the sanction be? The sanction that the schedule allows is not
just monetary; it relates to more appropriate things, such as requiring
the party concerned to submit accurate accounts. That should be the
first port of a
call.</div><a name="081113104000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was going to spend a lot of time arguing against the second set of
amendments, but I now think that they can be disposed of quicker. Those
amendments would basically remove the safe harbour created by being
subject to the civil sanction regime. The way in which the schedule
works means that if a person or organisation is subject to the
sanctions in the schedule, criminal proceedings cannot be taken against
them. That seems to be a wholly useful provision that adds to legal
certainty&#151;it is generally a good idea to avoid uncertainty. The
measure also fulfils a principle that is important to me and my
party&#151;although perhaps less to others who voted for other
legislation some years ago&#151;that there be no double
jeopardy.</div>
<a name="081113104000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
really understand why the hon. Gentleman has proposed what seems to be
a backwards step, but if his point is merely to ask the Government to
be clearer about the circumstances in which the measure will apply,
that is fair. That goes back to the point we tried to make earlier in
the week about the need for clear guidance. I am still entirely
unconvinced by the Government&#146;s position, which seems to be that
the commission should be given the power to give guidance, but that it
should not be required to give guidance.</div>
<a name="081113104000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman rightly pointed out that these are complex provisions and
difficult for lay people to follow. It therefore seems right to require
the commission to give guidance. That guidance should be not only about
what is necessary for compliance, but also about what is sufficient.
That would help to enforce the law and allow a greater degree of public
confidence in the way that the law works.</div>
<a name="081113104000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081113104000464"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I would like to say a
word in response to the proposal by the hon. Member for Carmarthen,
West and South Pembrokeshire on amendment No. 1. The issue goes to the
root of the behaviour of organisations such as the Electoral Commission
and the Standards Board for England. The example I will give comes from
the Standards Board, but it applies equally to any other organisation
that requires a response and which, with a long effort, gets people to
change their needs. In other words, the action can last not just for a
year, but beyond. The example comes from my constituency, and if hon.
Members wish to read about it in more detail, they can do so in the
debate from Westminster Hall last Tuesday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div><a name="081113104000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Six of my
constituents were referred to the Standards Board. They told it that
they understood that their case needed to be examined, and that that
would take some time. The Standards Board says that in general, 90 per
cent. of cases will be looked at within six months, but after 13
months, it was still working on this one. That is the problem. Cases go
on far too long, the board discusses things for too long and, in this
instance, that made it impossible for my constituents to continue. One
of my constituents has spent &#163;14,000, which was hard to come by.
The Standards Board is still working on the case. Four of my
constituents need to find sums of up to &#163;8,000. One of them is
dead.</div>
<a name="081113104000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now find
these provisions being proposed for organisations such as the
commission&#151;I am aware that the Standards Board is not the same
as the Electoral Commission, but the performance is exactly the same.
The rights and remedies of the Standards Board are the same as those of
the Electoral Commission.</div>
<a name="081113104000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that after x months, or even x years, the right to raise an issue would
collapse and should be withdrawn. If the problem has not been sorted
out after a year, the case should stop. That is the only way in which
we can force organisations such as this either to act or to withdraw
the
case.</div>
<a name="081113104000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000465"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> These are important matters, and I am glad to see
that the Opposition have taken the issues seriously enough to have
tabled so many amendments. I am grateful for the opportunity that that
gives me to address them. I shall respond at some length, partly in the
hope that we can avoid a lengthy stand part debate covering much of the
same territory.</div>
<a name="081113104000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
points have been raised and I shall address those before I come to the
detail of the amendments. They are general points of principle. The
problem of delay has been mentioned several times and we all recognise
that that can be an issue. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight has given
some graphic examples, of another regulator, but he is right that the
principles can apply to all regulators. Everyone shares an interest in
a speedy&#151;not hasty&#151;resolution of the
issues.</div><a name="081113104000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must seek the Electoral Commission&#146;s reassurance on the matter,
and are doing so. We hope that the commission will recognise that in
its guidance and in how it approaches the case. The hon. Member for
Huntingdon mentioned guidance, but I should stress that the commission
is already producing guidance&#151;in fact, the commission is
required to produce guidance on the operation of civil sanction powers.
That is a requirement. What we are not doing is to introduce a blanket
requirement to produce guidance on every single aspect of the 2000 Act,
as that would make the guidance extremely
unwieldy.</div><a name="081113104000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000466"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The irony in what the Minister has just said is
that, if there is to be comprehensive guidance on the use of civil
sanctions, it must include guidance on the rest of the 2000 Act,
because the schedule applies to any requirement in the Act and,
therefore, to understand those requirements, one must have had guidance
on them.</div>
<a name="081113104000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000467"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman may well be right but, with all
respect, he was not quite listening. I was talking about the
requirement. Of course, it is for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>Electoral Commission to interpret for itself the scope of the guidance;
it may well go into some, if not all, of the area he just talked about.
He may well talk about that, but the question is about what duty we
place on the commission. We must allow it some flexibility. In earlier
discussions, we all agreed that flexibility and proportionality were
good things, and it is those two principles that we seek to apply to
the production of guidance. However, on this issue, the commission is
required to produce
guidance.</div><a name="081113104000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
other point, which has come up a couple of times, concerns complexity.
We have all experienced the complexity of the Bill&#151;inevitably
so, as it is a complex and sensitive area. However, it is worth
pointing out that most people will not need to understand the
intricacies of the sanctions regime. The requirements on regulated
people have remained largely the same since the 2000 Act. As far as we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000469"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall give way, because I have become completely
distracted.</div><a name="081113104000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000470"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> If it helps, my right hon. Friend was in the
middle of something about
complexity.</div><a name="081113104000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the Minister is gathering his thoughts on that point, I shall go back
to his first point, which was the general issue of delay. I was
concerned on Tuesday, when the Minister resisted an Opposition proposal
that the Electoral Commission should not go back further than five
years in finding faults with people&#146;s behaviour in the past. We
are now being asked to pass a law that says the Electoral Commission
can go as far back in time as it wishes to raise something, and can
take as long as it likes into the future to investigate. The period
that could be encompassed by an Electoral Commission investigation,
which involves a person being accused of something, could be many
years.</div><a name="081113104000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this country&#146;s court system, there are limitation periods in
both criminal and civil cases, occasionally there are time limits
within which courts must deal with a case and, generally, there is a
power to get a case kicked out if it does not seem to have been
prosecuted with sufficient vigour. As the Bill passes through
Parliament, will my right hon. Friend consider whether there should be
some kind of limitations in the statute on how far the commission can
go back and on how long it can take to finish an
investigation?</div><a name="081113104000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000471"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have to retain some flexibility. I understand
the concerns&#151;real concerns&#151;and, after this Committee, we
shall talk to the Electoral Commission and see what its view is and
what reassurance it can give. However, we have to be careful in trying
too rigorously to prescribe time limits, backwards and forwards. I am
aware of the limits in the law and so on, but it cuts both ways. If we
give the Electoral Commission flexibility, we could be allowing it too
much time, and the statutory limitations may be too long and not
encourage a speedy resolution of the issues. We have to be careful.
Equally, if we set too short a time limit of weeks or months rather
than years&#151;the period that most hon. Members who have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>spoken so far would like&#151;we might in some serious cases be
prescribing the ability of the Electoral Commission to act as an
effective regulator. There is a balance to be struck, and we must be
careful how we do
it.</div><a name="081113104000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="081113104000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000472"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Minister says that we may be setting a limit
that is too long, so it is better to have no limit at all. That does
not add
up.</div><a name="081113104000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000473"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With respect, that was not what I was saying. I was
saying that we need reassurance from the Electoral Commission that it
will act in a timely and speedy&#151;not hasty&#151;fashion. That
is not a precise limit set in terms of months and years, but most
people would accept that it is a limit. For example, 12 years would
not, by any stretch of the term, be regarded as
speedy.</div><a name="081113104000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that, if we go to the sort of limitations that exist in
other areas of the law, most members of the Committee would be
horrified to think that investigations could continue for, say, six
years. If we start specifying a limit, we would almost certainly get
the balance wrong in some cases. Although, as always, we are willing to
consider the matter again, we believe that it is better to allow some
discretion&#151;but discretion that is constrained by reasonable
expectation of what timely would mean. General prescriptions of such
matters probably go back to the Human Rights Act 1998, but we need to
consider what reassurance the Electoral Commission can give the
Committee, after which we might be prepared to revisit the matter.
However, my firm instinct at present is to avoid setting fixed time
scales. We would get ourselves into more trouble than we would
want.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000474"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Minister is moving in the right direction, but
without saying that there is a target. I understand why a target is not
right for all circumstances, but I hope that he can say that certain
misbehaviour would be regarded as bad and dealt with in, say, one year,
while other types of misbehaviour would be more complicated and take
three or four years to deal with. Such limits must be written down;
they cannot be made up and be in the Electoral Commission&#146;s
view. To be understood, they must be written
down.</div><a name="081113104000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000475"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman thinks that I am
moving in the right direction. I hope that he will forgive me if I move
no further in any direction on this matter. I have said as much as I
can reasonably say at the moment. We are pretty resistant to setting
time frames, and specifying particular periods for particular offences
would complicate the matter and increase the likelihood of our missing
something and fettering the Electoral Commission in a way that would
not be
desirable.</div><a name="081113104000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have now remembered what I was endeavouring to say earlier about the
difficulty of understanding the regulations. The actual requirements on
people have not essentially changed since the 2000 Act, but the notices
that impose a sanction will explain to the person in question what they
are required to do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="081113104000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon referred to the opaqueness of when double
jeopardy would apply. It is clear that it will not apply, except when a
non-monetary penalty is imposed, but there is failure to comply. In
those circumstances, because non-monetary penalties are preventive, the
Electoral Commission must be able to punish
non-compliance.</div>
<a name="081113104000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
provisions are based on the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act
2008. That is why we have not imported the requirement for judicial
consent, which I think the hon. Gentleman referred to under amendment
No. 56. The Act provides that secondary legislation is the correct
route. As with everything else, we are happy to consider this, but we
have taken the fundamental view that we should apply the 2008 Act
except where there is good reason not to. We do not see any reason to
depart from that view in this case, but we are open to argument if good
reason can be found. The same applies to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about the drafting being too broad. Of course we need flexibility
in each case, but the requirement must be precise, otherwise it could
be appealed as being
unreasonable.</div><a name="081113104000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 1 addresses an important issue, and I understand the concerns of my
hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire. He
says, I think, that the intention of the amendment was that forcing a
case to be pursued as criminal would offer greater procedural
safeguards to the person on whom the penalty was to be imposed. We can
all agree on the principle of safeguarding the rights of all those
subject to the regulation of the commission. However, we believe that
the amendment would undermine the fundamental objective of making the
commission a more effective regulator, which is in part achieved by
giving it access  to this range of more flexible and
proportionate  sanctions, as the Committee on Standards in
Public Life recommended. That addresses another of the points raised by
the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="081113104000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the amendment is unnecessary because the Bill already
includes important safeguards for the person subject to the sanction. A
key safeguard is that a fixed monetary penalty can be imposed only when
the commission has evidence that satisfies it beyond reasonable
doubt&#151;subject to that criminal standard of proof&#151;that an
offence or a contravention has taken place. That sets a high bar for
the imposition of the sanction and ensures that the commission&#146;s
investigations are thorough and rigorous. That is a serious test for
the commission, and leaves no room for complacent application of the
sanctions.</div><a name="081113104000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that the commission will act in what anyone would
consider a heavy-handed or unthinking fashion. A key element of the
Bill is that the commission is required by law to publish guidance on
how it will operate the new regime of sanctions, before the regime can
commence. The commission will need to set out in detail how it will use
the sanctions and in what circumstances. The amendment is technically
flawed because it assumes that all cases that may be subject to
monetary penalties are open to the criminal route in the first place. I
understand that it is a probing amendment, but technically it is not
correct. Monetary penalties are also available for breaches of
prescribed restrictions and requirements, which may not be criminal
offences. In such instances, the effect of the amendment would
be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>that the recipient of the monetary penalty would be able to block the
sanction and avoid censure, effectively rendering the application
unenforceable.</div><a name="081113104000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment because it would
neuter the effectiveness of the sanction as part of the new regulatory
regime, undermine the principle of flexibility and effective
regulation, and not give effect to the Committee on Standards in Public
Life recommendations, including a recommendation that was supported by
Sir Hayden Phillips and which we believe has considerable
support.</div><a name="081113104000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
practical effect of amendments Nos. 31 to 34 would be to prevent the
Electoral Commission from applying a fixed monetary penalty to any of
the four entities concerned&#151;a person, a registered party, a
recognised third party or a permitted participant&#151;for
contravention of a prescribed restriction or requirement. The
amendments also miss an important point: the ability to prescribe
regulations or requirements in the 2000 Act is provided to enable us to
replicate the present system under that Act where a small number of
breaches of the Act are subject only to the graded system of financial
civil penalties set out in section 147(3) of that Act. For example,
where a party fails to inform the commission of a change of treasurer,
as required by section 31(4), importing into the Bill the concept of
prescribed requirements or restrictions is technically necessary to
allow us to continue that approach, and that is sensible.</div>
<a name="081113104000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment goes against the flexibility of the system we are trying to
introduce. Indeed, the Committee on Standards in Public Life recommends
that civil sanctions be available in instances that could be considered
more minor and where it considers administrative penalties more
appropriate. We believe that it must be for an independent electoral
commission to determine when a fixed monetary penalty, or any other
appropriate civil sanction, should be used where a prescribed
restriction or requirement has been contravened and it must use its
expertise to determine what mitigating or aggravating factors might be
taken into
account.</div><a name="081113104000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 71 would remove paragraph 4 from proposed new schedule 19B, as set
out in schedule 2, which relates to fixed monetary penalties. Paragraph
4 stipulates that criminal proceedings cannot be instituted against
persons subject to a fixed monetary penalty during the period available
for discharging liability by payment of the penalty. It also provides
that criminal conviction cannot take place for an offence when the
commission has issued a non-monetary penalty for the offence and it has
been complied with. I am not sure why it should be thought desirable to
remove those safeguards. Paragraph 4 offers important protection
against penalising someone twice for the same behaviour. It cannot be
right that a person is potentially subject to a criminal penalty having
already been given a fixed monetary penalty. Removing the paragraph
would leave an individual or organisation open to being sanctioned
twice, with a civil sanction and a criminal prosecution, so we hope the
hon. Gentleman will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 72 would add to paragraph 4 the
provision:</div><a name="081113104000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this paragraph prevents any criminal proceedings being taken for any
other offence under this Act or any other Act.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div><a name="081113104000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, paragraph 4(2)
already makes it clear that that is the case; it states that a person
on whom a fixed monetary penalty has been imposed may not be convicted
of an
offence</div><a name="081113104000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
respect of the act or omission giving rise to the
penalty.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
double penalisation provision prevents criminal proceedings being taken
only in relation to the same act or omission. It does not provide
protection from criminal proceedings with respect to a different
offence, or an omission or offence under another Act, so we believe
that the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="081113104000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000476"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Could someone be prosecuted under a criminal
provision in a different Act for the same offence for which someone
gets a civil order as set out in the
Bill?</div><a name="081113104000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000477"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> No, it does not provide protection from criminal
proceedings with respect to a different offence, or an omission or
offence under another Act. There is one sanction, except in the case of
non-compliance to which I have already referred. I hope that reassures
the hon. Gentleman. I am reassured by the
provision.</div><a name="081113104000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 46 would remove paragraph 8, which relates to discretionary
requirements and stipulates that criminal conviction cannot take place
for an offence for which the commission has issued a non-monetary
penalty that has been complied with. For the same reasons I outlined in
relation to amendment No. 72, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not
press the amendment.</div>
<a name="081113104000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.47 would add a new sub-paragraph to paragraph 8
stating:</div><a name="081113104000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this paragraph prevents any criminal proceedings being taken for any
other offence under this Act or any other
Act.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is no principle in law that prevents criminal proceedings for
another offence in the Act or another Act, so the specific provision is
unnecessary. In any event, in the context of discretionary requirements
generally, paragraph 8(1) already makes it clear that that is the case.
It states that a person on whom such a discretionary requirement has
been imposed, and with which they have complied, may not be convicted
of an
offence</div><a name="081113104000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
respect of the act or omission giving rise to the requirement.&#148;
</div><a name="081113104000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="081113104000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 56 would remove paragraph 20 from the proposed new schedule. The
paragraph currently allows a supplementary order to be made to extend
the period available for opening criminal proceedings in certain
circumstances. If the amendment were adopted, in theory a person could
string out a discretionary requirement or enforcement undertaking until
criminal proceedings could no longer take place. I know that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight would be horrified if such a lengthy time
scale were to be implemented, but it could happen in theory. The
procedure could be strung out until criminal proceedings could no
longer be taken, thereby enabling people to escape the sanction and
frustrating the commission in its wish to enforce the 2000 Act. The
removal of the paragraph would create a loophole for avoidance. That is
undesirable and I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will agree
and withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000478"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This has been a full debate on what we believe
are important concepts. I thank the Minister for his detailed review of
the double jeopardy provisions. We included the amendments to initiate
such a debate. It has been helpful, and I will look at what has been
said. I am pleased that the Minister said that he was open-minded on
the point about judicial consent, and I hope that he will look at
that.</div>
<a name="081113104000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still
have an issue about general clarity. The Minister said that he does not
want to bind the hands of the commission and the guidance mentioned by
the hon. Member for Cambridge will be important.  However, we
are concerned about the wording of the provisions and would like it to
be reviewed.</div>
<a name="081113104000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various
Members spoke about timing and said how important it was to have an
element of speed to the process. All members of the Committee will have
had experience of dealing with the Electoral Commission and of the
delays that investigations can sometimes involve. Both sides of the
Committee expressed the general concern that processes should not go on
for ever and that decisions must be made to allow people to move on.
The example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight was
about a different agency, but it was very pertinent. Such circumstances
are relevant to the Bill. We shall probably return to the need for
deadlines.</div>
<a name="081113104000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
pleased that the Minister said that he understood the concerns raised,
and that he would discuss them with the Electoral Commission. However,
this is the sort of situation in which we should tell the Electoral
Commission how Parliament expects it to behave, as much as listening to
its views. I understand that it is right for the Minister to take the
views of the commission into account, but ultimately we should tell it
what sort of response we want to see.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000479"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman might like to reconsider the
verb. These are people who regulate us. We need to guide them and set
the legal framework, but we must be careful about how far we go in
telling them how to regulate us. I refer again to the wise words of the
hon. Member for Cambridge at the beginning of the
proceedings.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000480"></a>Mr.

how to regulate us, I said that we should tell it within what period of
time it should make decisions. We will look at the issue in later
stages of the Bill. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000483"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 35 would amend paragraph 1(5) of
proposed new schedule 19B, by inserting a 28-day time period in an
attempt to specify the time frame within which the fixed penalty notice
must be paid.</div>
<a name="081113104000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 36 would amend paragraph 2(2) to tie in the information given in
the notice under paragraph 2(1), about the ability to
discharge one&#146;s liability by payment within the specified 28-day
period, as set out in such a notice. In essence, it is a consequential
amendment, designed to tie off any loose
ends.</div><a name="081113104000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 37 would amend paragraph 2(3) by reference to a 28-day period in
paragraph 3(2) specifying in what time frame an appeal must be made
against a fixed penalty notice. The aim is to add clarity to the
provisions. As the Bill stands, the only clear indication of the time
limits for responding to notices is tucked away at the end of what is a
bit of a legal maze. Even when we get to paragraph 3(2), we
see:</div><a name="081113104000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Neither
period may be more than 28 days beginning with the day on which notice
is
received.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is simply not clear enough for compliance when the cost of getting it
wrong can be so high. We must remember that the people who will have to
react to the new provisions are likely to be volunteers with little or
no legal training. We need to make things as clear as possible. Vague
concepts of reasonable time limits may be acceptable in certain
circumstances, but not here, especially when non-compliance can lead to
individuals and groups quickly climbing up the penalty tariffs. We must
be careful not to penalise innocent mistakes or administrative
oversights. A number of other amendments were tabled with a similar aim
in mind. We shall address them as the selection and grouping
allow.</div><a name="081113104000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 67 and 68 refer to paragraph 3, which sets out the requirements
for the information that must be included in a notice issued by the
commission of the intention to impose a fixed monetary penalty. That
includes the grounds for the issuing of the notice, the right to make
representations, the period in which the liability may be discharged,
the right of appeal against the penalty and the consequences of
non-payment. During the period when the person can discharge their
liability for the penalty by making a payment, the commission cannot
bring criminal proceedings against them. Moreover, a person on whom the
commission has imposed a fixed monetary penalty for an offence under
PPERA may not be convicted for the same offence again&#151;the basic
rule of double jeopardy is seen with

power to impose discretionary requirements on the person and so
forth.</div><a name="081113104000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 67 and 68 would amend paragraph 3(1)(b) to prevent the
commission reducing the amount of penalty notices for early payment.
Our aim is to clarify exactly what is required to be notified to an
individual or group. The paragraph allows for the person or group
subject to a fixed penalty notice to discharge their liability under it
by paying the specified amount within the time limit. The sum required
to be paid to discharge that liability may be less than the full amount
of the penalty, so it is important that the potential payee understands
both that and the incentive that such a mechanism provides. The
information should form part of the notice with which they are
presented. Our amendments would do just that, by amending the relevant
sub-paragraph to set out, at the start, what payment of that sum will
do and when it needs to be paid for that to apply. As legislators we
need to signpost clearly the way in which people can and should comply
with the Bill&#146;s provisions. In doing so, we not only make it
easier for people to comply, but we encourage early compliance because
people understand the incentives in the
Bill.</div><a name="081113104000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 69 deals with sub-paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) of paragraph 3.
Amendment No. 44 applies to paragraph 7(2). Both look to

the wording of the provisions, which relate to the information
contained in notices issued in relation to fixed penalty notices or
discretionary requirements. The amendments follow the themes of the
vast majority of our amendments in this group, which is to satisfy the
need for clarity. Furthermore, our supporting arguments echo almost
completely those that I have just made for amendments Nos. 67 and
68.</div>
<a name="081113104000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill
stands, the two sub-paragraphs set out information on the period of
compliance that must be included in the notices issued with the
imposition of a fixed penalty. There are too many questions about what
they mean for them to provide a useful guide for either the commission
or the subject of the notice&#151;&#147;the period within
which&#148; is simply too vague a phrase. For instance, is it
inclusive of the first or last days of the period? If the period is 28
June to 28 August, can one make payment to discharge a liability right
up to midnight on 28 August, or does the period end at midnight on
27 August? Such matters may seem trivial in the context of
some of our debates on the Bill, but they could form the basis for
serious legal disputes, and contract law books are littered with cases
on just such points. Our amendments would do away with all that by the
inclusion of one simple
phrase,</div><a name="081113104000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
date of commencement of
the&#148;</div><a name="081113104000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">inserted
at the start of the provision, which would ensure that there is no
confusion. To continue with the example to which I referred earlier, we
think that it would be clearer to say, &#147;The period of 28 days
will commence on 28 June&#148;. It would be a simple change, but it
is an easy way to prevent future confusion that could end in legal
action.</div><a name="081113104000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 45 and 55 would delete &#147;early payment discounts&#148;
from paragraphs 7(3)(b)(iii) and 18(1)(a) in relation to the payment of
monetary penalties. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>We appreciate that the aim of the proposed new schedule 19B
is to provide an incentive for a speedy conclusion of the enforcements,
but it misses the point that the amount in itself is the penalty.
Having to make sacrifices is a necessary consequence. The amount is
decreased for late payment because the person is not subjected to the
full impact of the penalty. To reduce it for early payment is not the
same thing. Instead, it would suggest that the seriousness of the
offence had in some way been
reduced.</div><a name="081113104000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not want to turn the commission into some sort of traffic warden, or
its financial penalties into parking tickets, but the Government could
be providing for just that with the provision. It undermines the
position of the commission as a regulator. Instead, it would be a
reactive enforcer such that while it might incentivise early resolution
of an offence, it could diminish its authority. We believe that the
commission has a more significant role than an enforcer of financial
penalties. It is a regulator and provider of guidance first and
foremost. The amendment would do away with the provision that could
detract from that role.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000484"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 35, 36 and
37, which would impose a time limit for various stages in the process
of imposing fixed monetary penalties&#151;payment of the penalty,
representations to the commission about the penalty and appeals against
the imposition of the penalty. The amendments are unnecessary. The Bill
already provides that the commission must specify the exact period for
payment of the fixed monetary penalty when it imposes it, and that the
period cannot exceed 28 days. Amendment No. 35 would ensure that the
commission cannot require payment in a period that is less than 28
days. That additional constraint is unnecessary, given the requirement
that the commission acts in a reasonable manner in its exercise of its
civil sanctions
power.</div><a name="081113104000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a demand from the commission allows an unreasonable period, it may
provide grounds for an appeal. It may be asked, quite reasonably, why
the commission might need to have a shorter period than 28 days, which,
after all, is not that long. There could be situations when sanctions
had been imposed repeatedly so it might be necessary to have a shorter
period to put the point to the person in question more forcefully. I am
sure that the Electoral Commission will note our debate and reflect in
its guidance some of the points that have been
made.</div><a name="081113104000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000485"></a>Mr.

35, 36 and 27 are set

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000486"></a>Mr.

20 of the Bill and would

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000487"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> What I meant is: where do we find such a provision
in the Bill now? I am not referring to what my hon. Friend the Member
for Huntingdon put in our amendment. I am asking where it is
now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="081113104000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000488"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As I was saying, the Bill already
specifies&#151;</div><a name="081113104000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000489"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b>
Where?</div><a name="081113104000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000490"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall come on to that in just a moment. I shall
make the argument and then direct the hon. Gentleman to where precisely
we find it. I was just making the point that there may be occasions
when the Electoral Commission will want to impose a shorter time period
for the payment of these penalties, such  as when someone
repeatedly ignores the sanctions. Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 add in time
limits of 28 days for the payment of the penalty,
representations or appeals against it.</div>
<a name="081113104000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that is unduly prescriptive. This sort of detailed provision is better
suited to secondary legislation. Moreover, I do not believe that it is
necessary or desirable for us to set statutory time limits of this
nature. There is a requirement for all civil penalties to be reasonable
and I believe that that is adequate protection. I direct the hon.
Gentleman to paragraph 3(2)(a). I hope that I have said enough to
persuade hon. Members not to press those
amendments.</div><a name="081113104000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to amendments Nos. 67, 68, 69 and 70. Amendments Nos. 67 and
68 relate to the information that must be given by the commission when
giving notice of an intention to impose a fixed monetary penalty on a
person. I agree that the notices should include this information.
However that is already required. Again I draw attention to paragraph
3(2)(a) of the schedule. I do not believe that this amendment is
needed. I should like to talk about amendments Nos. 69 and 70 together
as they both relate to information on the period for discharging
liability that must be included in the notice that the commission
intends to impose a fixed monetary penalty. I should stress that this
is the notice of the intention to impose the penalty, rather than the
final penalty itself.</div>
<a name="081113104000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision closely follows sanctions laid out in the Regulatory
Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. Again, we see no reason for
changing the operational design of the sanctions regime or why it
should be different for the areas regulated by the Electoral Commission
compared with the areas regulated by other regulators. We also believe
that this amendment may compromise the rights of the recipient of the
penalty, for example if there were any delay in receipt, which is why
the model in the Bill in which the relevant periods begin upon receipt
is
preferable.</div><a name="081113104000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 45 and 55 both relate to early payment discounts or late payment
penalties for monetary penalties. Of course I understand the point made
by the hon. Member for Huntingdon, but we do not believe that it
diminishes the importance of the sanction. There are some cases in
relation to stop notices where the size of the sanction is important.
In many cases we have to strike a practical balance. What is important
is that the sanction is imposed. We do not want to put the Electoral
Commission to unnecessary effort to pursue the discharge of those
sanctions if there can be put in place a relatively simple and
straightforward encouragement for it not to do so. Parliament had a
chance to debate all this during the passage of the Regulatory
Enforcement and Sanctions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>Act through both Houses. This is the approach that was taken there and
we have imported it here. We think that it is
proportionate.</div>
<a name="081113104000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000491"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am trying to think of circumstances in which
fixed penalty notices would be appropriate. I can see how they might be
appropriate under the previous legislation, in which businesses can be
fined set amounts for set things. Will the Minister give an example of
a fixed penalty notice being appropriate in the context of this Bill,
given the limited number of people whom it would presumably apply
to?</div><a name="081113104000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000492"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman refers to fixed
monetary penalties. We are talking about encouragement for early
payment, and that principle applies whether there is a small or a large
number of people to whom the measure applies. In all circumstances, if
we can find a simple and effective way of encouraging people to pay up
quickly we should do so, otherwise the commission will have a lot of
problems pursuing the debt. Where we can simply and easily avoid that
difficulty, and provide some encouragement to pay up quickly, we have
done so. We see no reason here not to bring across the requirements of
the 2008 Act. If the hon. Gentleman can make a compelling case for why
Members of Parliament and other people who would be subject to the
sanctions should be excluded from that general provision, we will, as
always, consider
it.</div><a name="081113104000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000493"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I find it strange that any fine under the
legislation could be subject to a discount for early payment. That
seems
bizarre.</div><a name="081113104000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000494"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Gentleman finds it bizarre. I have just
invited him to give me a reason for that. We have given the reasons why
the principle is appropriate. It has already been established in
legislation. The 2008 Act was so consensual that it went, I think,
through the House of Commons without a vote. If the hon. Gentleman
thinks that there is a good reason to except this form of regulation
from the other forms that the House has already agreed should include
this sort of provision, I am happy to hear it. Simply to say that he
finds this bizarre, is not as compelling an argument as I would
require. I am always happy to hear further representations on that
point.</div><a name="081113104000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000495"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I note the Minister&#146;s desire for
flexibility with the timing of notices, and I will consider the
amendments in that regard. The Minister also replied comprehensively on
the timing of the period of service of the notices; I thank him for his
response and I will go away and look at it. I still maintain that the
concept of discounts for quick payment of fines
is&#151;</div><a name="081113104000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000496"></a>Mr.

Bizarre?</div><a name="081113104000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000497"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes. It is bizarre, in the context of the Bill.
The Minister mentioned the previous legislation, on which the Bill is
based. That relates to the regulation of companies, and presumably
where there are mass problems and lots of notices being handed out,
discounts can be offered. That is not relevant to the Bill, and we will
look again at the parts of the schedule that refer to discounts. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 64, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000499"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000500"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> These are both probing amendments. They inquire
of the Minister what the rationale was behind a second decision-making
process. Amendment No. 64 seeks to leave out proposed new paragraph
2(5) and amendment No. 40 deletes proposed new paragraph
6(4). Both those sub-paragraphs permit  the commission to
review its actions in issuing notices for a second time. We query the
need for the commission to have a separate review of its decision to
issue the notice. That is an additional administrative step; the basis
for issuing the notice should be under ongoing review. Furthermore, we
are not convinced that the inevitable delay in the enforcement
procedure is justified. Our only thought as to the rationale behind it,
is that the Government anticipate that, under proposed new paragraph
2(1), the commission could be issuing fixed penalty intention notices
without much forethought. To avoid embarrassing judicial scrutiny on
appeal or the inevitable negative press coverage, they have placed a
formal &#147;second glance&#148; mechanism in the Bill to protect
the commission from embarrassing gaffes. The commission should ensure
that when issuing such notices it is happy with the reasons that it is
doing so&#151;it should not be done as a matter of course. As such,
we are reluctant to give it a get out of jail free card in the form of
proposed new paragraphs 2(5) and 6(4). We fear the potential for
abuse.</div>
<a name="081113104000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000501"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am slightly surprised by the grounds on which the
hon. Member for Huntingdon moved the amendment. I thought he was going
to suggest something else, such as the view that a court rather than
the commission should consider the representations. The hon. Gentleman
seems to have constructed rather a complicated rationale, which I am
frankly baffled by. Deleting proposed new paragraph 2 would simply mean
that the commission would not be able to take into account any
representations against the imposition of the sanction, effectively
rendering the representations process meaningless. I had hoped that all
members of the Committee would have welcomed the opportunity to make
such representations to the
commission.</div><a name="081113104000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman is aware, there is already an appeals process built
into this sanction; should the commission reject representations, the
recipient may appeal to a county court or, in Scotland, to the sheriff.
That process is there not to protect the commission from having made a
mistake, but because it is simply a matter of natural justice that
people should be able to make representations against an imposition.
That is set out in proposed new paragraph 6(7). I remind the hon.
Gentleman that the additional representations stage was incorporated
into the 2008 Act in the Lords, as it was felt that it would add an
extra safeguard, not for the regulator but against wrongful imposition
of the sanction. It does not replace the appeals process to the courts;
it is meant to be an extra safeguard, which, I thought, the Committee
were ardently seeking in every area. I hope we can all agree that the
amendment should not proceed.</div>

Djanogly:</b> The amendment looks to insert a 28-day limit
into paragraph 2(6) of proposed new schedule 19B to specify in what
time frame an appeal must be made against a fixed penalty notice.
Amendment No. 107 looks to insert the same time frame for
appeal into paragraph 9(3) under the provisions that relate to an
appeal against the imposition of non-compliance penalties. Amendment
No. 43 inserts the same 28-day appeal limit into paragraph 6(6) in
relation to appeals against penalties in the form of
&#147;discretionary requirements&#148; that have been imposed
pursuant to paragraph
(5).</div><a name="081113104000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to rehash the arguments that I made about amendments Nos.
35 to 37, but they would echo the arguments for these amendments.
Suffice it to say that the aim is to add to the provisions a level of
clarity that we do not believe currently exists. As they stand, the
only clear indication of the time limits for responding to notices is
tucked away at the end of a complicated set of provisions. Co-operation
will be key to much of the enforcement action that the commission takes
on, and we agree that the threat of sanctions will provide a useful
incentive to co-operate. However, co-operation can only be founded on a
strong base of understanding, and for that we need clarity in the
legislation.</div>

pm</div><a name="081113104000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 66 and 50 would amend proposed new paragraphs 2(6) and 9(3). The
amendments seek to change the court to which individuals must go to
appeal against sanctions under proposed new paragraph (1), fixed
penalty notices, and proposed new paragraph (9), discretionary
requirements. We question whether the level of expertise in the county
court is sufficient to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>with what could possibly be a highly complicated case because of this
Bill and the political background. For this reason, we suggest that the
higher level of judicial scrutiny that would be afforded to the case in
the High Court may be
preferable.</div><a name="081113104000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
an action in the High Court could serve as a check on the commission
and make it think twice before opening itself up to public censure at
the hands of the High Court because the basis for its action was too
shaky. If that were the case, the amendment will have done its
job.</div><a name="081113104000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the expectation that this power will be used in only a limited number

that.</div><a name="081113104000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 78 and 44 are consequential on each other in a way similar to many

that so many detailed amendments have been made to its nuts and

No. 78 amends paragraph 6(2) by reference to a 28-day time period in

requirements easier. Our amendments, therefore, propose to put in place
a 28-day time frame across the board. This would add a level of
certainty to the provisions which we feel will be beneficial for all
sides&#151;certainty of time period for the individual and a clearly
signposted procedure for the
commission.</div><a name="081113104000258"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000506"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Rather than make a speech of my own, may I ask
the hon. Gentleman about amendments Nos. 65, 107 and 43? They do not
just impose clearer time limits, which is fair enough; they remove all
grounds for appeal. What does he imagine would be the grounds for
appeal if there were no grounds for appeal specified in the
Act?</div>
<a name="081113104000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000507"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The
drafting would need to be changed accordingly. However, the 28-day time
frame across the board, as a principle, still stands and on that I
would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="081113104000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000508"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Given the size and range of this group, I will, if
I may, address each amendment in turn. We believe that amendment No. 65
is unnecessary because paragraph 16 of the schedule allows the
Secretary of State to make provision supplementing the primary
legislation. We believe that this sort of detailed provision is better
suited to secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="081113104000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be
talking to the courts and the Electoral Commission about appropriate
periods for appeal. They will be appropriate. I make no commitment but
it is unlikely that they will be significantly less than 28 days; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>they could well be more. It is not necessary or desirable to set
statutory time limits of this nature. The requirement for all civil
penalties to be reasonable is adequate
protection.</div><a name="081113104000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendment No. 66&#151;the provision for appeals to be heard in the
High Court rather than the county court&#151;I heard what the hon.
Gentleman said about burdens on the High Court. We believe it may
impose a burden on the High Court. There is precedent, in that
electoral law appeals are heard in a county court. It might be
possible, subject to circumstances, for appeals from the county court
to be heard in the Court of Appeal. So there is a higher level of
judicial scrutiny at the end of the
process.</div>
<a name="081113104000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000509"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Will the Minister advise me what is the condition
for financial assistance when someone is challenged by the Electoral
Commission in a county court or a High
Court?</div><a name="081113104000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000510"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the
conditions in which legal aid might be available. If I may, I will
write to him on that point. It is a complex area and I would rather get
it right, in writing, rather than mislead the Committee
inadvertently.</div>
<a name="081113104000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 107 relates to the appeals process for a person who has been issued
with a non-compliance penalty for failure to comply with a
discretionary requirement. It would amend the process by removing part
of proposed new paragraph 9(3) of the schedule. The schedule currently
allows a person to appeal against a non-compliance penalty on certain
grounds. The amendment would remove those grounds of appeal, and
instead provide that a person served with a non-compliance penalty
would have a period of 28 days from receipt of that notice to appeal,
but the grounds of such an appeal would no longer be clearly set out.
We believe that the grounds of appeal against a non-compliance penalty
should be clearly set out and the amendment would muddy the water by
removing them.</div>
<a name="081113104000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We followed
the drafting of the 2008 Act and the civil sanctions it imposed, and we
cannot see any good reason to depart from that operational design in
relation to the sanctions of the Electoral Commission, in comparison to
other regulators. As always in such matters, when we are talking about
transposing the requirements of the 2008 Act, if members of the
Committee can make a reasonable case for making separate provision in
relation to the Bill, we would be happy to consider it.</div>
<a name="081113104000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 50 is similar to amendment No. 66, but in this case it would
provide for appeals against stop notices to be heard by the High Court,
rather than a county court as the Bill currently provides. As I said
earlier, the Government believe that county courts are a more
appropriate forum for appeal; they are where electoral law appeals are
heard. Using the High Court might place a strain on its resources, when
the county court provides a perfectly adequate opportunity for
appeal.</div><a name="081113104000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 78 and 44 both relate to information that must be included in the
notices issued by the commission when it proposes to impose a
discretionary requirement. I am not altogether sure why amendment No.
78 has been tabled, as new paragraph 7(2) already stipulates the
available period for making representations, which must be no less than
28 days beginning with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>day on which the notice is received. It also clearly states that the
notice must specify this period. Therefore, the amendment does not
change the required contents of the notices and is
unnecessary.</div><a name="081113104000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 44 would alter the wording of new paragraph 7(2). The amendment
stipulates that, in a notice of intention to impose a discretionary
requirement, the commission must include a specific date for the
commencement of the period for making representations against it. As
currently drafted, new paragraph 7(2) requires such a notice to include
information about the period for making objections. It also states that
that period may not be less than 28 days, beginning with the day on
which the notice is received. That provision closely follows the
sanctions laid out in the 2008 Act. We do not see a reason for changing
the operational design of those sanctions, nor why they should be made
different for the Electoral Commission in comparison to other
regulators.</div><a name="081113104000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also believe that the amendment might compromise the rights of the
recipient of the penalty, for instance if there were a delay in
receipt. That is why we prefer the model set out in the 2008 Act, in
which the relevant periods begin on receipt, as that offers a fair
opportunity for all in terms of making objections.</div>
<a name="081113104000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 43 would remove the list of grounds for which appeal against
imposition of a discretionary requirement is allowable. It would also
impose a 28-day limit on the right of appeal. That would be unhelpful
and unnecessary. The grounds for legitimate appeal will help those on
whom a discretionary requirement is imposed to understand when it is
worth them pursuing an appeal. The grounds for appeal are not exclusive
and there is also provision for prescribing other grounds in secondary
legislation, but in reality, a court would be likely to entertain an
appeal only on grounds similar to those set out in new paragraph 6(6).
We believe that stating that explicitly in the Bill will help
people to understand their position in determining whether to
launch an appeal against a commission decision to impose a
discretionary
requirement.</div><a name="081113104000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the timing of appeals, we will need to decide with the commission and
the courts, after further consultation, the appropriate timetable for
appealing against a decision of the commission. That will be a matter
for the rules of court rather than for legislation, as was decided in
the 2008 Act. If it is a matter of pressing concern to members of the
Committee, we will see what we can do to advance it, so that we can
return to it in a meaningful way on
Report.</div><a name="081113104000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the Committee that the Electoral Commission is aware that its
operation of the new civil sanctioning powers needs to be responsible
and clear. We keep coming back to that point, but it is aware of that.
As we have discussed, it is required to produce guidance on how it will
use the powers and set out explicitly what the sanctions that it is
imposing require, and within what time
frame.</div><a name="081113104000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the Committee that the sanctions will be overlaid with a
statutory instrument setting out important procedural matters relating
to the civil sanctions regime. Where it deals with the most pressing
matter in the schedule, it will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, but both routes will offer the House ample
opportunity to scrutinise the detail of the sanctions and their
operation if it so wishes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div><a name="081113104000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of
those reassurances and explanations, I hope that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000511"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me thank the Minister for putting on record
again the fact that he understands the need for clarity. That is
exactly what we are trying to get at through most of our amendments. I
thank him also for going through the amendments on appeals
comprehensively, and we shall review the position further. On amendment
No. 78, I thank him for clarifying what is already in the Bill. I note
what he says about appeals to the High Court, and we will examine that
matter
further.</div><a name="081113104000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the equalisation of time periods, I should add that before this Bill, I
served on the Public Bill Committee that considered the Employment
Bill, and we examined the employment tribunal process. Everyone agreed
that the time limits for bringing various claims to an employment
tribunal should be made the same. The problem was that no one could
actually agree on what that period should be. I see the potential for
different periods in this Bill, and we do not want to be in the same
situation. We should sort it out before the Bill comes into effect,
rather than have a series of different periods for different people,
which is confusing, and then return to the matter in several
years&#146; time. It would be much better to get that right at an
early stage, which is why I have been suggesting equalisation. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="081113104000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000512"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in
schedule 2, page 23, line 31, after
&#145;person&#146;, insert
&#145;immediately&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000513"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 42, in schedule 2, page 23,
line 32, after &#145;is&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="0811142000012"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, how it is to be complied with,
and the exact time period in which compliance must
occur.&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000514"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 41 would insert the word
&#147;immediately&#148; into new paragraph 6(5) of the schedule and
so introduce a requirement for the commission to notify the person in
question of its decision to impose a discretionary requirement under
part 2 of the schedule immediately. The commission should be a beacon
of good practice. If we are to expect prompt compliance on the part of
those subjected to sanctions under the Bill, it is only right and
reasonable to expect the enforcing body to be even quicker in
responding to or notifying them. It is a simple case of leading by
example. If it does not do that, its legitimacy will begin to look
shaky. If the Minister wishes to argue that that would create immense
and intolerable administrative burdens on the commission, I ask him to
give evidence of
that.</div><a name="081113104000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 42 would insert into the same sub-paragraph provisions as to what
notices of discretionary requirements should set out. It echoes
amendments Nos. 44, 69 and 70, and I have tabled it for the same
reasons. There are too many questions about what the notices will mean
for them to provide a useful guide to either the commission or the
subject of a notice. We should dispel that ambiguity and confusion, or
we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>could face a rash of cases in which people are penalised for mistakes.
Such notices need to be as prescriptive as possible. Furthermore, a
more prescriptive approach could be mutually beneficial: the commission
would increase its level of enforcement and results, and people would
be able more easily to comply with sanctions and avoid possible
penalties.</div><a name="081113104000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="081113104000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000515"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We come back to the tension between clarity and
prescription, in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words, and flexibility. We
need to strike a balance between them. We do not believe that amendment
No. 41 is desirable because we are not seeking to limit the commission
in its application of the new civil sanctions regime by requiring it to
act immediately. Varying circumstances in different cases will
inevitably require different
approaches.</div><a name="081113104000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that amendment No. 42 is unnecessary, as new paragraph 5(5) of
the schedule already stipulates that a discretionary requirement
is</div><a name="081113104000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
requirement to take such steps as the Commission may specify, within
such period as they may
specify&#148;.</div><a name="081113104000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
imposing discretionary requirements, the commission needs to be clear
what the requirement on a person is and when it should be completed. If
the requirement is not clear, it will be open to appeal on the grounds
that it is uncertain, and therefore that it is, by its nature,
unreasonable, which is grounds for appeal under new paragraph 6(6)(d),
where non-monetary discretionary requirements are concerned. That is
common sense and there is already provision in the legislation, so I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000516"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification on
amendment No. 42. I am pleased that the point is covered in the Bill.
As for amendment No. 41, the concept was well debated earlier, so I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

3.</div><a name="081113104000289"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000519"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 51 is a probing amendment. It is
based on a speech that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight gave
on Second Reading on stop notices, which are one of the number of new
civil sanctions given to the commission by the Bill. Stop notices allow
the commission to demand that an individual or group cease doing an
activity that they are carrying on, on the basis that it is liable to
result in a contravention of or offence under
PPERA.</div><a name="081113104000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussing the amendment, to the extent that it has basically come from
my hon. Friend, I cannot do better than read what he said on Second
Reading. He stated:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div><a name="081113104000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Paragraph
10 of proposed new schedule 19B...allows the commission to impose
so-called stop notices. These are to be imposed on individuals to
prohibit them from carrying on an activity which the commission
believes is &#147;likely to involve&#148; their committing an
offence under the 2000 Act. The wording implies not &#147;has
done&#148;, but merely &#147;may do&#148;. Likewise, a stop
notice can be imposed if the commission believes the person&#146;s
activities are likely to lead them to commit an offence or
contravention of the
Act.</div><a name="081113104000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">Does
the Lord Chancellor recognise that those measures could interfere with
an individual&#146;s wholly legal actions? An individual could be
treated as if they had already committed an infringement, even if their
actions never led to such an infringement. Is not the Electoral
Commission&#146;s purpose to ensure that elections are run legally
and to punish individuals appropriately once an infringement has
occurred, and not before? Does the Lord Chancellor not also agree that
absolute clarity is needed when qualifying situations that are deemed
&#145;likely&#146; to lead to an
offence?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20 October 2008; Vol.
481, c.
88.]</div><a name="081113104000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister could respond to those concerns and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000520"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We have already debated the principle of stop
notices, and I said at the time that I thought that they were
necessary. They are the equivalent of an injunction. There are
circumstances in which activities need to be stopped and not just
sanctioned in other ways, and it must not be possible to buy
one&#146;s way out of a
requirement.</div><a name="081113104000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that was raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is mainly
about stop notices when the banned behaviour has not yet happened. He
is right to some extent to be worried about that. In civil law, there
are special ways in which to deal with the situation when the forbidden
behaviour has not yet happened. That is the idea of the quia timet
injunction. I should be happy if the Minister could explain to the
Committee how similar considerations might be brought to bear in the
context of the
Bill.</div><a name="081113104000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000521"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I wish to add the sentence that the commission may
serve on the person a notice rather than an outside body, such as the
court, but it seems that someone other than the commission is taking
charge of what is being
proposed.</div><a name="081113104000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000522"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will deal with the matter at some length because
it is important. We have already debated it in a slightly different
context, but I understand the concerns that have been expressed. The
sanctions are severe. The hon. Member for Huntingdon said that the
proposal was a probing amendment and that it would remove stop notices
from the Electoral Commission&#146;s battery of powers, but we should
be clear that it would severely weaken the range of sanctions available
to the commission and its ability to act as an effective
regulator.</div><a name="081113104000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stop
notices were recommended by the Macrory review, to which the hon.
Gentleman has referred. They were recently brought into law under the
2008 Act and are available to several operators. We believe that they
should be available to the Electoral Commission for the reasons set out
by the hon. Member for Cambridge and to which I have alluded, in that
there are certain circumstances when the potential sanctions that might
follow serious transgressions would not be adequate to deter someone
who is determined to break the law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="081113104000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to be
careful to give the Electoral Commission powers to prevent anyone from
having the ability, for example, to buy the outcome of an election.
That is unacceptable, and stop notices are an important part of the
powers that we want to be available to  the commission. As I
have pointed out, a very high threshold must be overcome before the
commission can impose a stop notice. We realise the seriousness of the
matter, and we have set a high threshold. As well as having a
reasonable suspicion that a prescribed offence or contravention of
PPERA has taken place, or is likely to take place, the commission must
reasonably believe that the harm caused by such a breach would
seriously damage public confidence in the controls on party income and
expenditure under the 2000 Act. Stop notices will be available only in
what are likely to be rare cases when the breach or likely breach is
such that it is necessary to impose a sanction to preserve the
integrity of the controls under the 2000
Act.</div><a name="081113104000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
must be absolute clarity about the circumstances in which stop notices
are imposed. They can be used in circumstances when the activity is
likely to breach electoral law. We discussed that with the Electoral
Commission, and it was clear that, if it had information that someone
could be planning to spend a large sum during an election campaign that
might switch the course of the campaign or determine its outcome
decisively, it felt that it was necessary for it to have the power to
intervene and impose a stop
notice.</div><a name="081113104000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the same safeguards and hurdles have to be overcome. They are, I
repeat, very high hurdles. In all circumstances, the ordinary
principles of public law will apply, so a decision to impose a stop
notice, whether on continuing actual activity or anticipated activity,
will necessarily involve the commission first considering the full
range of powers at its disposal, particularly whether any other of its
sanctions are a more appropriate means of achieving its aim. Only when
it has undertaken such consideration can it contemplate the imposition
of a stop notice. That is a high
hurdle.</div><a name="081113104000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
person may also apply to the commission for a completion certificate,
which will discharge the stop notice and release the person from the
obligations imposed, in circumstances where the person believes that he
or she has fully complied with the notice. A refusal by the commission
to issue a completion certificate is subject to a separate right of
appeal to the county court, on the same grounds as an appeal against
the original stop
notice.</div><a name="081113104000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, of course we understand that there are reservations about how
stop notices will work in practice. Members have valid concerns about
that and how such notices may be used incorrectly by the commission.
However, they will be used only in carefully circumscribed
circumstances. There is a wide range of civil sanctions, which we have
been discussing and which is available to the commission, where the
proscribed offence is less serious; in such circumstances, alternative
sanctions should be used. The commission is under an obligation to
consider those sanctions first, before going for stop notices.
Nevertheless, we believe that the notices are fundamental, therefore we
hope that the Committee will reject the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 52 inserts additional wording into paragraph 13(2) in schedule 2,
which sets out the grounds for appeal against imposition of a stop
notice. I am not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>altogether clear what the additional wording seeks to achieve, but it
does not obviously add anything to the existing appeal right, which
enables any person served with a stop notice who has been refused a
completion certificate to appeal on certain specified grounds. Such an
appeal will inevitably require an application to be made. I do not see
how giving a role to the commission in deciding whether an appeal
should be allowed would improve the process. Indeed, such a role could
be thought in some circumstances to restrict the process, which is not
desirable given the serious nature of stop notices. I hope that hon.
Members will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000304"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000526"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The amendment deletes proposed new paragraph 16
in schedule 2, which covers the general powers of the Secretary of
State to make supplementary provisions by order. We are not sure about
empowering the Secretary of State to create more legislation that
is</div><a name="081113104000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;supplemental...consequential...or
incidental to this
Schedule.&#148;</div><a name="081113104000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could lead to excessive powers being
taken.</div><a name="081113104000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule, as I have been highlighting, hands broad and potentially
powerful sanctioning capabilities to the commission. We are also
concerned about some of the drafting of the schedule, particularly on
the limitation of the powers for the safeguarding against abuse. We do
not want to see the creation of yet more legislation empowering the
commission further down the line without proper parliamentary
consideration.</div><a name="081113104000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 54 inserts into proposed new paragraph 16(3) a
qualification that any order may not be more onerous than those
provisions already in the Bill. That is the fallback position&#151;if
we cannot convince hon. Members of the need to remove the provision, we
seek to limit it, so that the Secretary of State cannot provide for
further or more punitive
sanctions.</div><a name="081113104000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="081113104000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000527"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Amendment No. 53 would remove proposed new
paragraph 16 from schedule 2. The effect would be that no supplementary
order could be made. That is not desirable, because it would prevent us
from specifying crucial details to allow the provisions to work
properly. However, I doubt that that is the intention. It is more
likely that the amendment would prevent important details about how the
power would work in practice from being left to secondary
legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="081113104000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that the detail of how the powers will be applied is crucially
important. The way in which a monetary penalty will be calculated, for
example, is very important. For that reason, a carefully produced
order, subject to full consultation with the commission and other
appropriate persons, is the right approach. That will ensure that all
the necessary detail is subject to the appropriate level of scrutiny.
The order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure if it
deals with what offences, requirements or restrictions are to be
prescribed or if it seeks to amend another Act of Parliament. If it
deals solely with other matters, the negative procedure will apply.
Both routes provide Parliament with the opportunity to undertake
detailed scrutiny where that is thought
appropriate.</div><a name="081113104000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be unhelpfully inflexible if details, such as the example of the
calculation of monetary penalties, which might change over time, were
set out in primary legislation. If we are serious about having a
flexible sanctions regime&#151;I return again and again to the
concept and principle of flexibility&#151;albeit one that is certain
and set out in legislation, we need this
power.</div><a name="081113104000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 54 would amend paragraph 16(3), which allows for a supplementary
order to be made by the Secretary of State
to</div><a name="081113104000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
provision amending, repealing or revoking an enactment (whenever passed
or
made).&#148;</div><a name="081113104000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment appears to seek to ensure that such provisions may not be
more punitive than any provided under the Bill. However, the power in
paragraph 16(3) is only intended to be used where consequential changes
are needed to other bits of legislation because of the way the Bill
works. For example, any provisions made about the powers of courts to
deal with appeals may require changes to other legislation that also
deals with that topic. Any such order remains subject to the
affirmative procedure, therefore the amendment is not necessary. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000528"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister&#146;s response does not surprise
me. I have heard such a response on many occasions when discussing the
need, or otherwise, for secondary rather than primary legislation. The
position that I set out previously is fair. We are still concerned
about paragraph 16(3), but at this stage I will not press the amendment
to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000529"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in
page 31, line 2, leave out paragraph
24.</div><a name="081113104000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 57 is a probing amendment that would delete paragraph 24 of
schedule 2, which requires that fines are to be paid out of the funds
of unincorporated associations. Would the Minister expand on what the
purpose of this paragraph is and what mischief it seeks to prevent?
What is the rationale behind the need to prevent
that?</div><a name="081113104000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000530"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have a further question to add to those asked
by the hon. Member for Huntingdon. What happens if an unincorporated
body does not have the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>funds to pay the amount that is required of it? The general law is that,
in those circumstances, the directing committee of the unincorporated
organisation is liable and in certain circumstances, although it is
rarer than people think, the individual members are liable. The Bill
says that the amount &#147;shall&#148; be paid out of the funds of
the unincorporated association, but there seems to be a puzzle, or gap,
as to what would happen in those
circumstances.</div><a name="081113104000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000531"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point.
If the money is not there, does the schedule imply that it should not
be
paid?</div><a name="081113104000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000532"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That seems to be one possible interpretation of
what the Bill says at the moment. The other interpretation is that the
general law applies and, in such circumstances, the members of the
committee or of the association would pay. I will be grateful if the
Minister explains what he thinks the schedule means in this
regard.</div><a name="081113104000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000533"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am glad that the hon. Member for Huntingdon made
it clear that this is a probing amendment. It would remove the
requirement for any fixed monetary penalty imposed on an unincorporated
association to be met from its own funds, and it is unclear how the
costs would then be met. As I have said many times, I understand the
concern, but we must seek not to over-regulate the many volunteers who
contribute to our political system. We are not minded to accept the
amendment. We expect appropriate monetary penalties to be imposed by
the commission. Any penalty must be reasonable, and if it is not, it
can be appealed against. Where it is proven that an offence has been
committed, an appropriate penalty should be imposed, and we see no
reason why the body that has committed that offence should not be
required to meet the cost.</div>
<a name="081113104000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge raised an important practical point about what
will happen if the body does not have the funds. We will look into
that. We think that&#151;as with civil debtors&#151;it would
involve the members of the association, but we will look into that and
come back to the Committee with a definitive answer. Having set out the
reasons behind the clause, I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon
will withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="081113104000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000534"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That raises an interesting question, because
political parties can potentially become insolvent and go bust. One way
of reading the provision could be that in a situation where an
unincorporated association is insolvent, the people behind
it&#151;those mentioned by the hon. Member for Cambridge&#151;would
not be liable. It is an important point, and I thank the Minister for
agreeing to take it up and come back to the Committee, perhaps by
letter. He nods his assent and I thank him for that. On that basis, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="081113104000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Commission shall publish the guidance specified under this paragraph no
later than 28 days after the date of commencement of this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000537"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The amendment inserts a provision that would
give the commission leeway to deviate from its published guidance in
exceptional circumstances. While accepting the need for guidance on the
way in which the commission will look to enforce the provisions in the
Bill, we do not wish to hamstring it by tying it to a course of action
that flies in the face of the public interest and common sense.
Therefore, we propose to insert a waiver&#151;if we can call it
that&#151;which would permit the commission to deviate from the
guidance where it is appropriate for it to do so in order to fulfil its
role as regulator and enforcer of the PPERA provisions in the public
interest. This is a probing amendment.</div>
<a name="081113104000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 58 would insert new sub-paragraph (9) that sets out
provisions on the guidance to be published by the commission in
relation to the various sanctions available to it in the schedule. It
would enable the proper implementation of the Bill, and would require
the commission to produce guidance on enforcement within 28 days of
enactment.</div>
<a name="081113104000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their
desire to push through the Bill, the Government are in danger of being
in breach of their own code of practice on guidance. That states that
guidance should be issued at least three months before any regulations
come into effect. I
quote:</div><a name="081113104000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
give organisations time to prepare for regulations, guidance will be
issued at least 12 weeks before a regulation comes into effect, with
some necessary exceptions... Sometimes more than 12 weeks
will be needed, for example, if a regulation is complex or costly to
implement&#148;</div>
<a name="081113104000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance will be
crucial for effective implementation and compliance by local party
groups and organisations that will be on the front line in dealing with
the legal requirements. Without guidance, they will be operating in the
dark.</div><a name="081113104000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have voiced our unhappiness about the rushed nature of the Bill on
numerous occasions, and we believe that the amendment is important to
ensure that once the Bill is enacted, guidance will follow shortly
afterwards.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000538"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Huntingdon for
raising those concerns; he makes perfectly valid points. Nevertheless,
we think that a statutory commitment to tie publication of guidance to
the date of commencement would be excessive. However, I am happy to
announce that we are making a commitment to commence the provisions
making civil sanctions available to the Electoral Commission only once
it has published its guidance on how it will operate them. That is
certainly not inconsistent with our guidelines, to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. Both the Government and the commission are keen to
demonstrate that these powers will be used fairly and sensibly. I know
that guidance will help reassure hon. Members of that. The commission
is writing the guidance and will publish it as soon as possible, but I
hope that the comments I have made in response to amendment No. 58 will
reassure the Committee. The regime will operate fairly and effectively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>only if guidance is published before commencement, rather than in the 28
days following commencement, as the amendment provides
for.</div>
<a name="081113104000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 59 would explicitly put in the Bill that when considering the
imposition of civil sanctions, the commission would not have to act in
accordance with the guidance. That would mean that the commission could
act otherwise than with regard to the guidance, if it were in the
public interest for it to do so. I understand that these are probing
amendments. If the intention behind the measure is to ensure that the
commission&#146;s hands are not tied by its own guidance when it
would be in the public interest to depart from it, I agree with that in
principle. The commission should be able to operate the civil sanctions
regime in a flexible and appropriate manner&#151;those are the words
to which we keep returning: &#147;flexible&#148; and
&#147;appropriate&#148;&#151;to ensure that it is effective.
However, it is not necessary to put that in the Bill. The Electoral
Commission would be bound only in operating the civil sanctions regime
by the law itself
anyway.</div><a name="081113104000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
contrast, the guidance is precisely that: it is a strong indication of
what will happen in practice, but there is no absolute guarantee of
that. After all, we must recognise that different cases will call for
different approaches and, inevitably, guidance will not be able to
anticipate every possibility. It is right for published guidance not to
bind the commission&#146;s hand in law. However, guidance must inform
what the commission does and the commission&#146;s approach, and it
must be considered carefully and seriously by the commission in
carrying out its
functions.</div><a name="081113104000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite
legitimately, guidance will create expectations among the general
public about how the commission will act. A consistent approach towards
that, which, of course, the guidance is intended to facilitate, will be
key to ensuring that the public and those whom the commission regulates
have confidence in it. That is why we have expressly provided that it
will be necessary for the commission to have regard to the guidance
when considering the imposition of civil sanctions, even if it later
chooses to depart from the approach set out in the guidance. It the
commission does depart from the approach set out in the guidance, it
will need to explain why it thought it was appropriate and reasonable
to do so. If it is unable adequately to defend its departure from
guidance on objectively justifiable grounds, it may find its actions
vulnerable to challenge by way of judicial
review.</div><a name="081113104000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
given that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press
that
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000539"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for his comments. I agree
with him in relation to amendment No. 59, but I am pleased he has been
given the opportunity to set out the nature of how the guidance process
works. On amendment No. 58, we are pleased to hear that the Government
have agreed that the provisions will not come into effect until the
guidance has been published. That is very good news indeed. On that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000341"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000540"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in
schedule 2, page 32, line 10, leave
out paragraph 26.</div>
<a name="081113104000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing. Will the Minister share with hon. Members how the
consolidated fund works, and how it is administered and controlled?
What parties  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>have access to it and what funds are held in it? In addition, on what
basis can funds be removed from it? It is worth while putting an
explanation of that on the
record.</div><a name="081113104000408"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000541"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I accept the probing nature of the amendment and am
flattered that the hon. Gentleman thinks that I carry the body of
academic knowledge to answer all those far-reaching and comprehensive
questions, which&#151;with all due respect, Mr.
Atkinson&#151;might be slightly outside the scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="081113104000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with a full account in answer
to all those questions, and I hope he finds time to read it and return
to me with any further questions. In the meantime, I will give an
account of why we intend to resist the amendment, because it raises
important questions of principle that I am not sure he necessarily
wished to
raise.</div><a name="081113104000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fines and monetary penalties will be paid into the consolidated fund,
as in other examples, because doing so is an important safeguard
against regulators seeking to impose monetary penalties for their own
financial benefit. The hon. Gentleman said that the amendment is
probing, and I take it in that spirit. Otherwise, I cannot imagine why
he would want to remove that important safeguard. If those penalties
were retained by the commission instead of the consolidated fund, whose
workings will shortly be revealed to the Committee in exhaustive detail
by letter, the commission would clearly have a financial incentive to
impose monetary penalties. That would be unwelcome and undermine its
credibility, so on that basis I very much hope that he will withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000542"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000543"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in
schedule 2, page 32, line 20, leave
out from &#145;shall&#146; to &#145;specifying&#146; in line 21
and insert &#145;publish an annual
report&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000544"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 136, in schedule 2,
page 32, line 20, leave out &#145;from
time to time&#146; and insert
&#145;annually&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
62, in

the Commission will not specify the names of those persons who have
been the subject of the cases specified in sub-paragraphs 1(a), (b) and
(c), save where the amount of any penalty exceeds
&#163;1,000.&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000545"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The amendment relates to paragraph
27(1) of the proposed new schedule, which deals with the
commission&#146;s obligation to produce reports on the use of its
civil sanction powers. It proposes that the commission should be
required to produce a report annually, rather than from time to time,
as the Bill requires. That is also the substance of amendment
No. 136, tabled by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="081113104000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
those are entirely new powers and that the commission has shown
reluctance in various areas, it is important that there is a review
mechanism by which the Government, the commission and the public can
assess how it is using those powers. Furthermore, the lack of
statistical data on the actions of the commission has meant that
reports to date and the background to the Bill have often been hampered
by a lack of concrete evidence on which to base decisions. Instead, we
have had to rely on the empirical evidence that the commission supports
the need for greater powers, and something sits uncomfortably with us
when we view it in that way. The annual reporting requirement should
not prove unnecessarily burdensome, given that the commission already
produces an overall report of its work throughout the year.</div>
<a name="081113104000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.62 would insert a threshold test into paragraph 27(2), which deals
with the details of offences committed by individuals that may be
excluded from the commission&#146;s reports published under
paragraph 27(1). We feel it appropriate to set a high
threshold of &#163;10,000 so that only the most serious cases of
abuse would be
captured.</div><a name="081113104000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have no intention to penalise twice&#151;with financial penalties and
public censure&#151;those at the lower end of the spectrum. Having
said that, once the threshold has been passed, there could be
advantages in the details being freely accessible in the public domain
so that the worst offenders were subject to public scrutiny, which
would act as a further
deterrent.</div><a name="081113104000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000546"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Amendment No. 136 is also probing. Earlier, the
Minister moved Government amendment No. 126, which proposed that
information on the investigatory powers of the commission be included
in the annual report. Paragraph 27 of the proposed new schedule implies
that from time to time reports will be produced on the use of the civil
sanctions that the commission has imposed. Does that mean that whenever
a sanction is imposed there will be public report on the case? Is that
why the Bill says &#147;from time to time&#148; or does it mean
that perhaps every 18 months a report will be produced that lists the
series of different issues and cases where civil sanctions have been
used?</div><a name="081113104000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the commission is producing an annual report, either it could put
together all the different reports on civil sanctions that had been
taken in that year and publish them, or it could publish a report once
a civil sanction case had been concluded. Perhaps that is why the
measure is drafted in this way. Should a report be produced each time a
civil sanction issue has been settled or should they all be brought
together in an annual report, in the same way that the investigatory
powers issues are brought together in an annual report? I would be
interested to know the purpose behind the wording of the
measure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000547"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has essentially asked the
question that I intended to ask, but let me put it in a slightly
different way. What publicity, in the normal course of events, will a
fixed penalty notice case have? Will the information about the identity
of the person required to make a payment be discoverable under freedom
of information legislation? Will it be published in the normal course
of events or be treated as essentially a private matter between the
parties?</div>

Wills:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire made compelling arguments. The Government are
persuaded by the arguments that they have heard and would like to
consider accepting the amendments. However, for the avoidance of
problems down the line, I would like to ensure that the drafting does
not cause any technical difficulties. We should also, as a matter of
courtesy and principle, consult the Electoral Commission on
this.</div><a name="081113104000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly,
we are disposed to accept the principles behind the amendments. If I
may, I will come back to the Committee with a proposal to accept the
amendments or something very similar in due course. With that, I hope
that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="081113104000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000549"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are approaching the end of what has been a
pretty full day and that is a welcome thing to hear from the Minister.
I thank him for agreeing to come back to the Committee on these
proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000362"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="081113104000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000550"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in
schedule 2, page 32, line 36, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) the
Serious Fraud
Office,&#146;.</div><a name="081113104000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to the final amendment to the schedule. Amendment No. 63 would
amend paragraph 28(1), which sets out the bodies whose files and
information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>the commission will have a right to access when exercising its powers,
by including the Serious Fraud Office in the list of bodies with which
the commission can share information. It is important that there is
communication between the various agencies. Efficient use of
information can not only save valuable financial and administrative
resources, but will help the enforcement environment as a
whole.</div><a name="081113104000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000551"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> It may well be that the commission would benefit
from a statutory power to access information such as that held by the
Serious Fraud Office, but we would need to consider the wider
implications of such a change and any implications as regards the
framework for other regulators as established by the 2008 Act. I would
be interested to hear more from hon. Members about their reasons for
tabling the amendment, but we will give the point further consideration
if, for the time being, the hon. Gentleman is happy to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081113104000552"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am indeed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081113104000367"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="081113104000368"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Schedule
2 agreed
to.</i></div><a name="081113104000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
consideration adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[Ian
Lucas.]</i></div><a name="081113104000370"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
accordingly at five minutes to Four o&#146;clock till Tuesday 18
November at half-past Ten
