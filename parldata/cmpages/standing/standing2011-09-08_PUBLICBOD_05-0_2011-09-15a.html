                  </span> Thank you, Mr
Amess. I welcome you here on this beautiful, sunny morning. It is very
good of you to join us again; we always look forward to your being in
the Chair. Your presence makes us all feel more secure and safe, and
that we will not blunder into areas where we ought not to go. I have to
say that the porridge was slightly stodgy in the Members’ Tea
Room this morning, but I know you will rule me out of order if we
discuss porridge. From time to time the Bill feels slightly stodgy,
too, but it does raise matters of profound importance.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Mr Amess, you
said that there should not be a stand part debate on clause 1, no doubt
because I ranged quite widely across the piece during my contribution
to that discussion. However, I want to use this opportunity to mention
our worries about the first five clauses, which are not exclusive to
the Opposition: they have been expressed in another place, and outside
the Houses of Parliament by constitutional experts and others.
Constitutional experts and others are not necessarily always the people
one ought to listen to on such matters, but they have raised grave
concerns about the Bill. I will try to address them as briefly as
possible and to ensure that they are on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill
proposes to change the character of a series of institutions and, in
some cases, abolish them. In many other cases, it gives the Minister
wide-ranging powers in relation to their future. I imagine—I do
not know if this is a fact—that every single one of those
institutions has been created by primary legislation. Certainly, all
the most important ones have been created by primary legislation, and
no doubt we will talk about one or two of them today. Primary
legislation is subject 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 152<a class="bkMark" name="Column152">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to the most detailed scrutiny, and there is careful engagement with the
wider public. Although I cannot say that such legislation is, as a
result, always perfect—no one would imagine that that is
so—the parliamentary process is robust and searching. Ministers
who come to the House and into Committee know they have to be sharp and
clear in their arguments, and that the legislation needs to be at least
reasonably robust.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill’s first five clauses allow the Minister or the Executive to
abolish or amend all the bodies named in the various schedules by
order—by secondary legislation. The problem with secondary
legislation is that, even in the form in which it has emerged from the
other place, it is not as rigorous or as searching, and does not hold
the Executive to account as robustly, as the process of primary
legislation. One has to worry that what the Minister might present as
mere administrative changes to save money—perhaps by merging
personnel functions, as I mentioned the other day—are in fact
giving the Executive far more powers. In some cases we are talking
about institutions that deal with our liberty. We talked the other day
about the Youth Justice Board, and there are other examples. For
instance, today we will discuss under schedule 2 the certification
officer dealing with trade unions. One has to worry that the process of
secondary legislation is simply weighted slightly in favour of the
Executive and, I would argue, substantially less in favour of the
legislature. We know there always has to be a balance between the two.
When we talk about institutions such as those that guarantee human
rights to individual citizens—as we shall do in some
detail—almost all experts agree that it is not right for such
measures to be made through secondary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When we
tested the arguments regarding the bodies being included the schedules,
the two Ministers, who are decent people, frequently said that they
were not yet in a position to give the Committee the details. I imagine
that will be the case with clause 2 and schedule 2, and I understand
that, because the process of government is complex and obviously, life
moves on. The details cannot be finally resolved because the
legislation is not yet in place. The problem is, therefore, that the
detail of what will happen to the various institutions in schedule 2
and the other schedules will not be properly scrutinised by the
legislature until the orders are laid.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill is
better now: the orders referred to in clause 2 are better
than the Government originally envisaged, and to be fair to them, they
acknowledged that in the debates in the other place. However, given
that we are talking about constitutional arrangements rather than
administrative functions, surely it would be better not to deal with
this issue through the process envisaged in the orders in the schedules
and clause
2.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said, I do not want to delay the Committee as there is a lot of
business to deal with and we want to see the Bill complete its passage
in Committee. However, it would be wholly wrong to allow the Committee
to proceed without raising these questions. I put it to the Minister
that some of the institutions we are empowering him to deal with in the
way he envisages are central to the way the British constitution works,
others less so. We have not sought to oppose the detail of these
measures; we have accepted those, but asked questions. Can it be right
that some of those major institutions, created after months of detailed
debate of highly contested issues, in Committee in both Houses, should
be subjected 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 153<a class="bkMark" name="Column153">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to the secondary legislation process? As we know, that process is simply
not as rigorous as the one we are currently undertaking.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
those thoughts, which I hope will cause us all to reflect, I wait to
hear what Ministers have to say. We will reflect on the orders when we
reach the precise details later in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  </strong>
Good morning, Mr Amess. The hon. Member for Hemsworth was listening
when you said previously that you were susceptible to flattery. It
flowed over you like the honey that I trickled over my
porridge—which was indeed very stodgy—this morning. I
will start with a few opening remarks about the purpose of clause 2,
and why we consider it to be so important. I will subsequently address
the hon. Gentleman’s important concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 2
gives a Minister the power to make provision by order to merge any
group of bodies or offices listed in schedule 2. Such provision might
involve the establishment of a new body or office—including
provision for constitutional arrangements—to replace the bodies
being merged, or the abolition of all but one body or office in a
group, which would be the recipient of the remaining functions that
were previously undertaken by the group. An order under this clause may
also include a transfer of functions to an “eligible
person”, as defined in clause 1(3), who is not included in the
group of bodies or offices involved in the merger. As with all the
principal order-making powers in the Bill, the use of clause 2 is
restricted by the safeguards described in clause 7 and elsewhere, and
it is subject to the requirement to consult in accordance with clause
10 and the parliamentary procedure set out in clause 11.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Perhaps I can
take this opportunity to address the hon. Gentleman’s central
concern: the constitutional propriety of the Bill and the opportunity
it affords this place to scrutinise substantial reforms to several
public bodies. He and the Committee will be aware that that issue was
of great concern to the other place, and it was the subject of
extensive debate and an extremely constructive Government response. A
very material change was made to the Bill by dropping the original
clause 7 and introducing other safeguards into the scrutiny process. We
feel that the debate has been fully aired in the other place and that
the Government responded in a way that satisfied the other
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is also
worth noting a practical point, which the hon. Gentleman did not refer
to, although I do not blame him for that. This is an enabling Bill that
creates a framework for reforming a large number of bodies, and there
is simply not enough parliamentary time or suitable legislative
vehicles available to make all these changes in primary legislation.
Doing so would frustrate Government priority and trigger a process that
would be disproportionate, given some of the changes being proposed.
That is why we have created an enabling Bill, but one that triggers a
clear and transparent process that must flow for the vast majority of
these reforms to be actioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman perhaps under-weights the debate that is allowed in
Committee. We have had good debates already on some of the most
contentious reforms. I suspect there will be a vigorous debate later
today when we discuss the Welsh question, which will be extremely 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 154<a class="bkMark" name="Column154">&#160;</a>
                  </div>well attended by members of the public who take a great concern in that
matter. I do not think the Government are hiding anywhere in terms of
our need to debate these reforms and to respond to some of the
understandable concerns raised by the Opposition.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Gentleman suggested, the Bill triggers a process whereby
Ministers are required, once they are clear about what they want to do,
to consult properly on their proposals. He did not mention, and he
should have done, that in that process the parliamentary Select
Committees are entirely free and encouraged to scrutinise those
proposals, hold Ministers to account and publish their own conclusions.
Suitable orders have to be laid and debated. Where changes are more
substantial or contentious, Parliament can opt for the enhanced
affirmative procedure, which builds in greater parliamentary scrutiny
to the order-making process. Given the complexity and scale of what the
Government are trying to achieve and the practical difficulties of
seeking opportunities through primary legislation to take through every
single reform, this enabling Bill—innovative as it is, with the
appropriate safeguards that have been put in place and what we believe
is a robust secondary process—taken in the round, is certainly a
constitutionally proper and sensible way of
proceeding.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000031">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government envisage that the power to merge bodies in clause 2 will be
used to simplify the public bodies landscape in the UK, improving
efficiency and effectiveness by combining the assets and expertise of
bodies with complementary functions. For example, the proposal to merge
the pensions ombudsman and the Pension Protection Fund ombudsman would
combine in statute two bodies that already work together to provide a
coherent service. Our intent is underpinned by clause 8, which provides
that a Minister can bring forward an order only if he or she considers
it will serve the purpose of improving the exercise of public
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By removing
clause 2, the types of change I have discussed would be reliant on
primary legislation. As I have argued before, that would slow the
much-needed and widely supported reform of public bodies to which the
Government are committed, and would impose costs on the public purse by
delaying the efficiencies that will result from some of the mergers.
Accordingly, I contend that the power in clause 2 is both required and
subject to appropriate restrictions, and I ask that the clause stand
part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000033">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Before we
debate the group, it might be helpful to the Committee to make
it absolutely clear what the Government’s intentions are. We
intend to abolish the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council
outright because its functions are either no longer required or are
more properly performed by Government. The other side of the coin in
the context of the schedule, which is about mergers, is to restate that
the Government seek to remove the Civil Justice Council from the Bill
because I do not believe that there is a genuine desire in this House
or in the other place to reform it using the powers in the Bill. It was
added solely as a stratagem to make the Government rethink their
proposal to abolish the AJTC and I know that its removal, which we
propose through the amendments, has the support of the senior
judiciary.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful to first set out the issues on amendment 6, the effect of which
would be to remove the AJTC and the CJC from schedule 2. Hon. Members
will recall that clause 2 enables Ministers, by order, to merge any of
the bodies listed in schedule 2. Both bodies were added to the schedule
by a non-Government amendment in the other place. The Government have
no intention of using the powers, which would either replace both
bodies with a single new entity or abolish one with the remaining one
taking some of the other’s
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
jurisdictional terms, the CJC’s remit is confined to England and
Wales, while the AJTC has functions in Scotland. The remits of both
bodies are wide-ranging, and any merged body would be unwieldy, despite
a small overlap in their work. Their focus is also fundamentally
different: the administrative justice system includes not only
appellate courts, but complaints handlers, mediators, ombudsman and
tribunals, which are distinctive in character from the courts. The
remit and workload of a merged body would therefore not be
manageable.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
also constitutional differences between the two bodies. AJTC members
are paid, but Civil Justice Council members are not. Further, the
secretariat that supports the CJC is not in a position to take on more
work without an increase in resources, which cannot be done without
jeopardising other areas of work in the Department. As I have said, the
senior judiciary would not support a merger, which is a particularly
important point, given that the Master of the Rolls is the chair of the
CJC and that there are judicial members in that body.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Before
setting out the Government’s rationale for abolishing the AJTC
outright and retaining the CJC, I want to be clear that the AJTC is not
a tribunal, nor is it any other form of judicial body. Its abolition
would therefore have no direct impact on judicial independence or
judicial decision making.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In reviewing
all arm’s length bodies, we considered their costs and relative
value for money, as well as changes that have taken place since they
were set up. Our concern, which I hope is shared by all Committee
members, was to establish which functions were no longer vital and
where we could avoid duplication of activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In terms of
cost, the AJTC’s budget for the 2010-11 financial year was
£1.3 million. Such a sum could buy approximately 2,900 social
security and child support 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 156<a class="bkMark" name="Column156">&#160;</a>
                  </div>tribunal sessions, or 11,650 cases. The Civil Justice Council’s
budget for 2010-11 was relatively modest at £312,000. It has
unpaid members and little in the way of secretariat support, compared
with the AJTC. With that and taking into account the technical emphasis
of its work, we concluded that the CJC should
remain.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
I accept that the Civil Justice Council’s functions are similar
to those of the AJTC, in practical terms the CJC is still of value to
the civil justice system because it directly supports the courts by
providing advice on the technical aspects of civil costs and 
policy, as well as on pre-action protocols. The AJTC does not have a
similar direct impact on the operation of tribunals.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The proposed
abolition also takes into account what changes have taken place since
the AJTC was set up, the most significant being the establishment of
the unified tribunals service, which is now part of Her
Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service. That service provides a
coherent system of tribunals administration and judiciary for the
tribunals within it, rendering obsolete the AJTC’s tribunals
oversight function.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I acknowledge
concerns that in the absence of the AJTC, the responsibility for
administrative justice policy might be spread across several
Departments, but the Ministry of Justice is committed to maintaining an
overview of the end-to-end administrative justice system and not just
tribunals. As part of that, the MOJ is working with other Departments
that have an interest in this area, and it has built close links with
the Cabinet Office, which leads on ombudsmen policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I now turn to
amendments 7, 9 and 12, which would remove the Civil Justice Council
from schedules 3 to 5. The proposals would take away the following: the
CJC’s powers to modify its constitutional arrangements under
clause 3; its powers to modify its funding arrangements under clause 4;
or its powers to modify or transfer its functions under clause 5. The
Government see no compelling case to utilise any such powers in
relation to the Civil Justice Council.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Civil
Justice Council is sponsored by the Judicial Office, giving it a degree
of independence from the Executive. The Government would not consider
altering that arrangement, for example, by modifying the extent to
which it is accountable to Ministers under clause 3. Additionally, the
CJC’s constitution is one that represents extremely good value
for the taxpayer. It has unpaid members drawn from the senior judiciary
and the legal profession, as well as from commercial organisations and
academia. It has only two full-time staff, and there is one other staff
member, who is shared with the Family Justice Council. I therefore see
no good reason to modify its funding arrangements using the powers in
clause 4.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For similar
reasons of efficiency, economy and effectiveness, the Government do not
now seek to modify or transfer the CJC’s functions using the
powers in clause 5. There is no other public body that could easily
take on those functions, and we would not wish to abolish any of them
without a replacement.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000051">&#160;</a>

the AJTC by putting the two together, knowing that the Government had

by some strange osmotic effect, the clearly valuable, useful and
continuing body would protect the other. It is not for me to
second-guess the motives of others, but it was almost explicitly clear
that that was the case. That is why the amendment will separate the two
bodies. I assure the hon. Lady that it is not through the

                  </strong> The abolition will have no impact on the Civil
Justice Council. The two are separate. The AJTC’s functions will
be absorbed into the Department, partly as a result of the changes to
the structure of the Courts and Tribunals Service effected by the
previous Government, of which the hon. Lady was a member. There is no
impact. If the Committee is minded to accept the amendments, the Civil
Justice Council will remain exactly as it is. It will not take on
additional functions because it does not have the resources to do so,
even if it were desirable. In the present economic situation, I
honestly do not think it is likely that new resources will become
available. The Government’s view is that we should let this
valuable body carry on doing its work in the way that it is doing it
and that we should not try to interfere. That is a widely held view
within the judiciary and the legal

far as I can determine from their debate, to impair, impede or in some
way damage the work of the Civil Justice Council. Their debate was on
the AJTC, and the grouping may have been a rearguard action to protect
the AJTC’s future. I reread those debates, and a case was made,
although it was perhaps not the most powerful case, for continuing some
of the AJTC’s functions in a relatively autonomous body. I did

                     </span>
                  </strong> Little did I know that my disappointment would
change to sheer delight at serving under your
chairmanship.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not intend to take up too much of the Committee’s time, but I
want to press the Minister a little further on the proposed merger of
the Central Arbitration Committee and the Certification Officer. I
understand why merging these two bodies is attractive to the Minister.
They both operate in similar fields: industrial relations. They are
both relatively small bodies. They share the same building. They are
both serviced by staff from ACAS. Given all that, I suspect that the
cost savings of the merger do not amount to very much, although I shall
be interested to hear what the Minister says. However, their roles are
very different.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Certification Officer is a regulatory body. It regulates trade unions
and employee societies. It regulates political fund ballots. Crucially,
it determines whether a trade union is independent; a trade union needs
a certificate of independence in order to operate and the Certification
Officer decides that. So it regulates the internal affairs of trade
unions and employee associations.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Central
Arbitration Committee arbitrates between unions and employees. In
effect it adjudicates on applications relating to statutory recognition
and de-recognition of trade unions for collective bargaining purposes.
There are occasions when proceedings taking place in front of the
Central Arbitration Committee cannot continue until the Certification
Officer has ruled that the union or employee association has a
certificate of independence. To be fair, the Central Arbitration
Committee is generally seen as successful and impartial, which is very
important. It has dealt with around 45 cases in the last
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
two functions are very distinct. One is a regulator. The other is an
arbitrator. I am not a lawyer, but I believe there are legitimate
concerns that merging bodies with two different types of function could
create conflicts of interest. It would not be desirable to have the
same members of staff dealing with an internal dispute in a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 159<a class="bkMark" name="Column159">&#160;</a>
                  </div>trade union, between a member of a union and the union leadership
perhaps, and also dealing with that union and an employer. There are
probably ways in which those differences could be ironed out.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister accept that the bodies have two distinct functions? What
safeguards are in place to ensure that these conflicts of interests do
not arise? I understand that Business, Innovation and Skills Ministers
have been in consultation with both the CBI and the TUC. Are they
satisfied with the arrangements and that these conflicts of interests
would not arise? Can he also confirm that because these bodies are so
small, the savings would be negligible? Indeed, perhaps there could
even be costs involved, because presumably there would be a new name,
new stationery, new branding and so on. At least during the start-up
phase, there would probably be costs involved, not savings. I would be
keen to hear the Minister’s response to those few
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000070">&#160;</a>

briefly respond to the hon. Gentleman, who raised some specific
concerns about what he considers potential conflicts of interest, and
about necessary safeguards. I undertake to ensure that the relevant
Minister is aware of those concerns, and to respond to the hon.
Gentleman directly in writing. I will obviously share that letter with
the Committee once I have had a response from the relevant Department.
We will place the letter in the Library to reassure the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule
2 is an important element of the Government’s proposed reforms
to public bodies and it exists to give certainty to Parliament about
the intended scope and application of the Bill’s powers,
specifically in relation to mergers. Clause 2, which gives Ministers
the power to make provision by order to merge a group of bodies or
offices, applies only to those bodies listed in schedule 2. I remind
the Committee that, as is the case for each of the Bill’s
schedules, a group of bodies can appear in schedule 2 only following
the approval of Parliament through the primary legislative process.
When a group of bodies has been listed in schedule 2, it is subject to
the power in clause 2 for a period of five years. If Departments do not
bring forward an order under clause 2 in that period, the listing of a
group of bodies ceases to have effect, in accordance with the sunset
provision created by clause
12.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Committee will be reassured by that important limitation on
the scope and duration of the powers that the Bill will provide to
Ministers. The use of those powers is further limited, as I have
described in previous debates, by the requirements to meet the
safeguards and procedures set out in the Bill’s later clauses.
The powers are thus subject to the requirement for consultation under
clause 10 and the parliamentary procedure set out in clause
11.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On mergers, I
hope the Committee will be particularly reassured by the application of
clause 8, which makes it clear that a Minister cannot bring forward an
order to merge bodies unless they believe that the merger will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 160<a class="bkMark" name="Column160">&#160;</a>
                  </div>serve the purpose of improving the exercise of public functions. The
Government do not believe in reform for reform’s sake, but are
seeking to create a more effective, accountable and efficient system
for the delivery of public functions. The removal of schedule 2 from
the Bill would, in effect, amount to a blanket removal of the power to
merge, regardless of the policy intent behind it, denying the
opportunity for the Government to remove duplication and increase
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000075">&#160;</a>

assurance? He has talked about a five-year sunset period, but clearly
the Government will want to introduce orders. My experience as a Whip,
both Government and Opposition, is that orders appear quickly and are
considered quickly. Can he confirm that he will ensure that Parliament
gets good notice of when orders will be laid? These are important
matters, and the people involved will want to have some notice of what
is happening in relation to this schedule and the rest of the

                  </strong> I certainly can give the hon. Gentleman that
assurance. As we have shown, the Bill sets out a process that requires
consultation, and in that process adequate notice should be given of
procedure. I certainly take on board the point about advance notice of
orders. I ask him to bear in mind that, for the more substantive and
controversial reforms, the legislation also enables Parliament to

well-orchestrated campaign to hoist the flag of S4C in the Committee.
At times, attempts are made to denigrate well-organised campaigns in

feeling on this issue, and the fact that the e-mails are similar does
not undermine the importance of this debate to Wales and to civic

               <p class="tabbed">We
must be confident that the Welsh language television channel has the
resources to provide a unique service for the community, the editorial
and operational independence required to provide plurality, and the
ability to take bold decisions to provide interesting and diverse
programming for the future and meet the challenges of the multi-media
age. My concern is that we have no plans before us that provide
confidence in a strong future for S4C, which is why we should remove it
from the provisions in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have few
guarantees. The Government have acknowledged through an amendment that
sufficient resources will be provided, but there are no criteria to
define “sufficient”. There are many sentiments about the
preservation of editorial independence but no guarantees, and therefore
amendment 55 seeks to ensure the operational, as well as editorial,
independence of S4C, which is crucial if we are to maintain a focus on
the provision of Welsh-language television.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000095">&#160;</a>

content with S4C providing a bare minimum of Welsh-language content to
satisfy statutory remits. It must continue as a quality broadcaster. In

that of children’s programming and drama. Of course, S4C is not
only a broadcaster but a vital tool for furthering the Welsh
Government’s policies on the Welsh

               <p class="tabbed">For
many Welsh learners—myself included—S4C is an invaluable
tool for learning the language. It plays an integral part in a truly
bilingual Wales, to which all four parties in Wales subscribe, and the
holistic approach adopted by three Assembly Governments of different
political persuasions. This is not a peripheral side issue about a
broadcaster; it is increasingly relevant to anglicised Wales as it is
to y fro Gymraeg—the Welsh heartland. While broadcasting is not
devolved—although some of us may look forward to a move in that

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments 57
and 56 refer to the need to consult Welsh Ministers about any changes
to S4C. The Bill sets out a statutory duty to consult Welsh Ministers
in the making of an order under clauses 1 to 5 where they have
competence or exercise functions. That leaves a significant gap,
however, in areas where they have a significant interest but no
legislative competence, and S4C is obviously in that category. Although
I hope that the Government would consult Welsh Ministers on any
changes, there is no statutory obligation, and any assurances that the
Minister could provide would be extremely useful. I know that my hon.
Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome shows a great interest in such
matters. He was telling me the other day that he can pick up
“Pobol y Cwm” in Somerset. I do not mean to be demeaning

that clarification. “Pobol y Cwm” came up in the Welsh
Affairs Committee discussions because in some quarters there has been
an attempt to denigrate some of S4C’s viewing figures. When a
comparison was made, for example, between the viewing figures of a soap
opera in Wales and one viewed in England, it was clear that the figures
were proportionally much higher in Wales than those enjoyed by English
programmes in the English

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s proposed new governance arrangements raise
fundamental concerns. BBC Cymru and S4C are currently the only national
Welsh language broadcasters, and they are competitors, albeit with some
degree of co-operation—the BBC provides some significant hours
of television for S4C. It is hard to see the Government proposing that
the BBC should have seats on the board of Channel 4, but that is where
we are in the debate about S4C. There is a case for looking at how S4C
is run and funded, but it is hard to escape the conclusion of both the
Welsh Affairs Committee and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that
the process has been
rushed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000103">&#160;</a>

Montgomeryshire has made the point about funding and recognises that it
is an important issue. It is, however, totally misrepresentative of the
situation to suggest that we are discussing comparable cuts. On BBC
funding, for example, the proposed cut to the World Service was 16%,
but suddenly it finds itself with an extra £2.2 million, so it
is a cut of 15.1%. The situation becomes even more serious when one
realises that, while S4C’s total funding of £90 million
for 2011-12 will come from DCMS—this is according to the
Department’s own figures, which many of us contest—by
2014-15, the total funding will be 83%, 7% of which will come from DCMS
and 76% from the BBC, although there is no sense in which it will be
directly allocated to S4C. The BBC’s own funding is being cut by
16%, but it is claimed that, suddenly and miraculously, it will be able
to fund S4C to the tune of 76%. Does that not cause great concern to
the hon. Gentleman? Far from facing a comparative cut, S4C faces a
disproportionate cut and one that could be further affected by the cuts
to the
BBC.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000109">&#160;</a>

that the hon. Gentleman made earlier about the cuts being rushed

point is that they are being rushed through. The reason why we want S4C

consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000114">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman pre-empts a comment that I
will make a little later. Funding is clearly a major issue. The
Broadcasting Act 1996 introduced an increase to S4C’s budget in
line with inflation, a link that the Culture Secretary has indicated
hastily that he wanted to break early in the life of the Government.
Given the financial circumstances facing the Government, it was
inevitable—this relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Montgomeryshire—that questions would be asked of S4C.
Indeed Alun Ffred Jones, the then Assembly Government Heritage
Minister, said when he gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee
that S4C should not be treated as a<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“sacred cow that
couldn’t be touched”.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The funding
tail in this case seems to have wagged the governance dog. The
governance arrangements of the BBC were a quid pro quo for taking on
the funding. We have heard about the haste with which the agreement was
reached, astonishingly without the knowledge of S4C. It was completely
unacceptable that an agreement was reached in that way and that
agreement should not form the basis of discussions about the future of
S4C.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We now have a
new proposal on funding from the Government. I have added my own
proposal in the form of new clause 5, which I hope the Government will
consider before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House. However, we
are still talking about a largely undefined system of governance in
which the BBC could assume a dominant position. The Welsh Affairs
Committee’s report expressed our concern that<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
BBC…will not necessarily have the particular interests of Welsh
language programming as its primary
focus.”<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
focus is the very rationale for S4C. And that is the key
message—it is about ensuring that S4C retains its focus and
expertise. Given that the Government are tackling the issue of funding
separately, I do not see why we need to be wedded to the arrangement
with the BBC.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s new clause may well be an improvement on the lack
of any protection in statute, but it still leaves S4C funding in the
gift of the Secretary of State. Any broadcaster needs significant
notice about how much funding it will receive and what the arrangements
will be, and that is what lies behind my new clause. It seeks to
provide a floor, so that funding for S4C could not crash into oblivion.
It provides what is lacking from the Government’s new clause; it
provides the certainty and stability that S4C needs so that it can
operate effectively and independently.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000119">&#160;</a>

the Government to change S4C funding for any other reasons, nor does it
in any way compromise S4C’s

               </p>
               <p>That
is the key—S4C needs that certainty so that it can plan
“for the future”. But Lord Inglewood also made the point

said, I know that my hon. Friend the Minister, who is speaking for the
Government on these matters, understands the importance of S4C to
Wales. However, he needs to take back to the Government the message
that the unintended consequences of the new arrangements could have a
chilling effect on the independence of S4C. A long lead-in time is
required for the production of programmes and so the decisions that S4C
makes today about commissioning and production will be reflected in
broadcasts possibly a year or two down the
line.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000127">&#160;</a>

independent production sector has been a great success for Wales. The

in those terms, but it is far from clear that the negotiations as they
stand provide for that. It would be helpful if the Minister could
update us on the latest talks, because at this stage it is difficult to
see a positive conclusion that is acceptable to both parties. That is
why I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Clwyd
South.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State set S4C and the BBC the challenge of working out the
detail of the agreement. He outlined a number of features that he
expects to see in the final model. Regrettably, those are not robust
enough to guarantee independence. There are talks 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 167<a class="bkMark" name="Column167">&#160;</a>
                  </div>about S4C retaining its brand identity and editorial distinctiveness,
but I am not convinced that that is the same as independence. There are
talks about there being a BBC and S4C partnership along similar lines
to MG ALBA, the Gaelic broadcaster, to begin by 2013-14, with S4C
coming under a BBC Trust service licence or other operating agreement.
The Select Committee and I went to Stornoway and met the operatives of
MG ALBA. I praise much of the commendable work it has undertaken there,
but the scenario is completely different. When I asked ALBA executives
about editorial and operational independence, the answer was that it
did not apply. There are also talks about there being a combined board
of the authority and trust, a joint management board. The extent to
which the BBC will sit on these bodies causes concern and brings into
question the achievable goal of
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are due to have a communications Bill next year, including possible
changes to broadcasting. This would be an opportune moment for us to
look at what we want from S4C as the national Welsh language television
station, and how we can best provide that service rather than putting
all our eggs in the proverbial basket at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, I will once again refer to the Select Committee report,
which called for a wide-ranging, independent review of S4C,
encompassing its purpose, funding, services and governance. That was
also the position of the four party leaders in our National Assembly in
Wales: Liberal, Labour, Plaid Cymru and Conservative. That is what we
need. These amendments give the Government the opportunity to take that
course of
action.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000131">&#160;</a>

Welsh, and other members of the Committee are in the same position. The
Welsh language has been a huge success story in the anglicised parts of

established. Although I do not want to indulge in any major or tedious

               <p class="tabbed">I support the
amendments in my name and those that are proposed by the hon. Member
for Clwyd South. S4C is not just another television channel. Its
importance to the Welsh language can scarcely be over-estimated. S4C is
the only TV channel in Welsh and that cannot be said often enough.
These changes should not be made without fuller and proper
consideration and
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Ceredigion told us about how the temporary head of S4C
heard about his funding formula on the radio. Clearly, in their rush
towards change, the Government were blinded to the effects of their
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There should
be primary legislation on this matter. Forgive me, Mr Amess, but when I
mention S4C I will sometimes use the Welsh pronunciation. When S4C was
first established, there was a long-running campaign and a huge public
debate about the matter, which is in contrast to what is happening now.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd South said, the Government
intend to bring forward a broadcasting Bill, which is the appropriate
way in which to address the future of S4C. Everyone accepts that the
future of the channel needs to be reviewed, which is why I support

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for that. I will refer
very briefly to the history of the language as I go along. S4C is not
just another TV channel but a unique social space for Welsh speakers,
Welsh learners and even for those who do not speak Welsh because some
programmes are subtitled. On Sunday, there is an omnibus edition of
“Pobol y Cwm”, which is widely watched by people who do
not speak Welsh. “Dechrau Canu, Dechrau Canmol” is
“Songs of Praise” in Welsh and is watched by very many
people, including myself. Some of us enthusiastically join in with the
singing.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
point that I am making is that speakers of English take for granted
these sorts of electronic social spaces. There is a huge output in
English, from America, the United Kingdom and other countries. A huge
amount of television material, be it films or whatever, is produced in
English because there is such a huge audience. Those sorts of
productions are taken for granted. We cannot do that in respect of
Welsh because we have only this one particular channel. People commonly
say that there are so many channels and absolutely nothing to watch. In
respect of Wales, there is one channel and quite a lot to watch and we
do not want to lose that. That point was made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Ceredigion earlier on. It has also been made by many pillars
of the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 169<a class="bkMark" name="Column169">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Welsh community, including the four political parties, the Archbishop of
Wales Barry Morgan and many
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
has been broadcasting in Welsh since the 1920s, but until the
establishment of S4C, broadcasting in Welsh on both BBC and ITV was
somewhat haphazard. That was unsatisfactory for English-speaking Welsh
people and for Welsh speakers alike. The English schedule was different
for Wales from that in England, and there was no consistent Welsh
language schedule. Programmes that were important for democratic
accountability, specifically news and current affairs, were broadcast
late at night, and one had to make a point of staying up to watch news
about what was going on down the road whereas one could access news
about what was happening on the other side of the world at prime
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With the
prospect of a fourth channel being established in the 1970s, there was
a determined and intense campaign for a Welsh language channel in
Wales. I remind the Committee about that because it is easy to forget
the tumult in Wales at the time, and I sincerely want to avoid going
back in that direction. Consensus was eventually reached that the
fourth channel in Wales would indeed be primarily in Welsh. Prime time
broadcasting would be in Welsh but, as some hon. Members know, until
recently some programmes would be in English as well. After a lot of
campaigning, Channel 4 is now available throughout Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consensus has
been reached in 1979, but the newly elected Conservative Government
under Mrs Thatcher decided, in their first enthusiastic charge, that
there would not be a Welsh-language fourth channel. There was an
avalanche of protest. I remember it well. Indeed, I was part of it.
Gwynfor Evans, then president of my party, threatened to fast on his
tour of Wales to raise the profile of the issue. Mrs Thatcher
eventually performed her first U-turn, despite not being for turning,
and S4C was eventually established.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With your
permission, Mr Amess, I want to step back briefly and speak about the
new mass campaign in favour of S4C. The e-mails that you have received
are a symptom of that. The campaign of the 1970s and 1980s eventually
led to a consensus that cut across class, geography, language and
political allegiances. It led to nearly 30 years of successful Welsh
language broadcasting with scarcely a hiccup. That was the net effect,
despite worries beforehand that there would not be enough material to
fill the channel, that we did not have the talent and that we did not
have this or that. Importantly, but tragically for some, the politics
was taken out of these Welsh language concerns. I believe that it has
an intensely political aspect, but although it was once hugely
contentious, after 30 years of relative calm people now see it as being
uncontentious.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some Members
will remember the campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s, led by Cymdeithas
yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh Language Society. Again, I preface my
remarks by saying that I am a dedicated parliamentarian. By their
actions, the Government risk a return to those earlier days, but I
ardently wish to avoid that. One young man has unfortunately already
spent time in jail as part of the campaign, but I do not want to see
that happen again.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I refer the
Committee to the excellent autobiography by Lord Roberts, then Sir Wyn
Roberts, called “Right from the Start”. In it, he
recounts the events of that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 170<a class="bkMark" name="Column170">&#160;</a>
                  </div>time. It is instructive, especially for new Ministers. Crucially, it was
Lord Roberts’s advice that led to Mrs Thatcher changing her
mind. I played a part in that campaign, as did many of my
contemporaries—I was in my 20s then—but many of us are
now highly respectable and prominent people in Wales. Circumstances led
them to take part in the campaign, but it was not only young people who
participated. We might face that again.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If you will
allow me, Mr Amess, I shall tell a very brief story. One night, the
television signal disappeared in the Aberystwyth area. When the police
investigated the mast at Bleanplwyf, they arrested three middle-aged
men, Ned Thomas, Pennar Davies and Meredydd Evans, respectively the
editor of the premier English-language literary language magazine in
Wales, the principal of a theological college and the former head of
light entertainment for BBC Wales. Such people were persuaded to break
the law, and I would not like to see that
returning.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000183">&#160;</a>
               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
were sit-ins, rallies, disruption of TV programmes, climbing of TV
masts and interruption of parliamentary proceedings—the other
day I asked a visiting constituent whether she had ever been here
before, and she sort of coughed and spluttered and said, “Well,
the last time I was here was in the early 1980s and I spent time in the
cell”—which we have below Big Ben, I understand, for
people who cause a disruption. There were court cases, refusals to pay
fines and jailings. There was a clear danger at that time of the law
being seen to be unjust and, I am afraid, held in contempt. I have a
real fear that we will go back in that
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Welsh Language Society is a careful organisation, and the principle
that it employs is that of “dull di-drais”, the
non-violent form of action. We are fortunate in Wales that that is how
we were led at that time. Looking, carefully, over the water, we can
see where less principled ways of action led the tragic island of
Ireland. The method employed by activists was to break the law and
immediately give themselves up to the police, admit their
responsibility, plead not guilty in court, refuse to pay fines and,
often, face prison. Some hon. Members will remember the magistrates who
refused to find against people who were clearly guilty and who paid the
fines of people they had just fined. We do not want that state of
affairs coming back—the contemporary danger is
obvious.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000151">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 171<a class="bkMark" name="Column171">&#160;</a>
                  </div>such matters is to avoid a situation in which pillars of the Welsh
community describe law-breakers as the finest of their generation,

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will make some brief points about public policy on the Welsh language
in general, which are contextual to our debate on S4C. Public policy
for many years has been in favour of the Welsh language. People,
including myself, argue that the proposed move on S4C is contrary to
that longstanding public policy. I will not go through the entire
history, you will be glad to hear, Mr Amess, but the situation we had
over many centuries was that of Welsh being kept under hatches,
including the penalising clauses in the Act of
Union:<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“no
Person or Persons that use the Welsh Speech or Language shall have or
enjoy any Manner Office or Fees within…the King’s
dominions”—<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>that
is, someone who spoke Welsh could not get a job. The language was not
banned, but there was an impediment to people getting on in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
long history of Welsh being under the hatches lasted until the Welsh
Courts Act 1942, which allowed the use of Welsh in courts, and the
Welsh Language Act 1967, which stated that Welsh had a certain, if not
full, equality. The Welsh Language Act 1993, passed under the
Conservative Government, announced the important principle that Welsh
should be promoted and enabled by the Welsh Language Board. Then the
Welsh Assembly passed legislation proposed in 2009, I think, setting up
a language commissioner among other
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
point that I am making is that public policy for many years has been in
the direction of supporting and enabling the Welsh language. Now we
have this proposal, which many would argue—rightly, in my
opinion—is contrary to that statement of public policy. Many
problems remain in respect of the Welsh language, which I will not go
into now, particularly in education and employment rights. Crucially,
however, television is not one of them. For 30 years, television has
been excluded from that hot debate in Wales. During that time,
television has engendered the prestige for the Welsh language that has
been hugely useful in what is little other than its
renaissance.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Welsh
language has been in decline for a very long time. During the 20th
century, it declined from being spoken by around 50% of people at its
high point to around 18.6% of people at its low point. S4C has been
instrumental in raising that percentage. When the census results are
announced later this year, we will hopefully see the classic hockey
stick effect. There will be a reversal—I might term it a Lazarus
effect—and the language will be rising from the dead.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000158">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 172<a class="bkMark" name="Column172">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The location
of those Welsh speakers is even more important and interesting for S4C
than the numbers and the percentage. About 40% of Welsh speakers now
live in the east and in the cities, where Welsh is not spoken outside
the home. It is not socially prominent. In those sorts of
circumstances, particularly for young people who are going through
Welsh-medium education, seeing Welsh on TV is incredibly important.
That is the social space that they inhabit. Welsh also inhabits, by the
way, social spaces on the web. We even have dating sites in Welsh, and
Twitter and Wikipedia—my daughter would be very proud of me for
remembering all those things—so it is all there, except when one
looks at the possibilities for S4C with these enormous cuts. That
social space, which is important for the 40% of Welsh speakers who live
in the south and east, will disappear.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My other
point about demography is that the age profile of Welsh speakers has
changed markedly. When I first looked at the matter in the early 1970s,
Welsh speakers were largely older people. Out of 100 people in the
street, if one wanted a Welsh speaker, one chose the older people. By
now, the profile has been entirely reversed. It is young people who
speak Welsh, and young people who use television and the other
electronic means to live their lives. S4C is doubly, trebly, quadruply
important given the nature of our
population.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000160">&#160;</a>

have detained the Committee long on the history and the context, but I
thought that it would be useful. I reiterate that I am in no way
advocating a return to the ’70s and ’80s, but that was
the mess that we were in at the time. I appeal to the Government to
change their mind on the issue and to take S4C out of the Bill, so that
we can have a proper consideration over a year or more to ensure that
S4C’s function in providing that social space for Welsh people
and contributing to language planning is
safeguarded.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000161">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There is a convention that when Members speak
under someone’s chairmanship for the first time, they make very
flattering remarks about the Chair. I will restrict myself to saying
how pleased I was in 1992 when I saw the results coming through. I hope
that that meets the convention.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000162">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">For me,
thinking about and dealing with this issue has been hugely difficult,
and I intend to support the Government position. That is difficult,
because the words of the two hon. Members who have spoken so far could
so easily have been part of my own speech. I will not repeat everything
that they have said.<a class="bkMark" name="11091583000163">&#160;</a>
