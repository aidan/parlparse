<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Co-operation with police force of Republic of Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again, proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): As I said earlier, it is not my intention to delay our proceedings on the clause. None the less, we have become confused about the meaning of co-operation in an operational and cross-frontier sense with regard to recruiting and other matters. I am sure that, by now, the Minister will have understood our worries, so perhaps he can sort out the confusion for some members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I welcome you, Mr. Benton, to the Chair this afternoon. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) was right. I accept that the two matters have become confused, although that has happened unintentionally. The first issue concerns co-operation between the police forces in Ireland—north and south—while the second issue is of lateral entry under clause 52, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) acknowledged this morning, is a recruitment measure.
<P>
Patten's recommendations 157 to 165 relate to north-south policing co-operation. They cover written protocols at recommendation 157, meetings and conferences at recommendation 158, secondment at recommendation 159, liaison officers at recommendation 160, training at recommendation 161, joint disaster planning at recommendation 162, joint investigations on cross-border incidents at recommendation 163, communications at recommendation 164 and joint databases at recommendation 165. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made clear, there is nothing between us on those issues. We debated earlier the sensible nature of the proposals and how they have been translated properly into the Bill. In some ways, they merely reflect what happens already and promote existing good practice. We have no difficulty with that.
<P>
The Government envisage an agreement with the Irish Government that will set out such matters and other sensible issues of co-operation. The board and the Chief Constable will then work out detailed protocols under the auspices of that agreement. Patten's recommendations 119, 127 and 128 deal with the encouragement of applications for lateral entry, including applications from the Garda. The Government support that, but nothing in clause 52 will enable the appointment of 500 Kerry men or even one Kerry man to be a police officer in Northern Ireland in any other way than such appointments can be made at present, which is through open competition. I accept that we are not currently dealing with such matters, but because of the confusion to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and with your indulgence, Mr. Benton, I thought it helpful to make that point clear.
<P>
I envisage the policing agreement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland dealing with such issues as equivalence in police rank, experience or professional qualifications in a way that would facilitate lateral entry—which would be good.
<P>
The provision deals with issues of co-operation that are common between European states and have a precedent in arrangements between the RUC and the Garda. It will not undermine the autonomy of the police in any way, but will enhance their effectiveness. I hope that, with those assurances and clarifications, the Committee will accept the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 53</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual and other reports by Board</center></H4>
to Secretary of State
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 27, line 2, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(j) the effectiveness of district policing partnerships in the carrying out of their functions; and
<P>
(k) the level of public satisfaction with the performance of individual district policing partnerships.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is a sensible one that takes into account the fact that, if I had had my way, the Bill would not have a part II. However, it does and it is therefore incumbent on us to do what we can to ensure that the clause places some constraint and responsibility on district policing partnerships. The clause also deals with reports and inquiries, and subsection (2)(i) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the effectiveness of arrangements under part II<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the arrangements on DPPs—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in obtaining—
<P>
(i)  the views of the public about matters concerning policing; and
<P>
(ii) the co-operation of the public with the police force in preventing crime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that the clause should take into account the effectiveness of DPPs in acting according to their conscience, and the level of public satisfaction with the performance of individual DPPs. If, as many of us suspect, DPPs become a vehicle for crude and confrontational local politics, rather than relating sensibly to policing at a local level, it should be incumbent on the Policing Board to report on that. In that way, steps can be taken to ensure that there is nothing to inhibit good policing on the ground. The amendment is uncontroversial and helpful and I hope that the Minister will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I do not disagree with the sentiment behind the hon. Gentleman's argument. He and I are not far apart in our thinking on what the clause should provide on DPPs. However, his proposed paragraph (j) has the same effect as subsection 2(i), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the effectiveness of arrangements made under Part II in obtaining—
<P>
(i)  the views of the public about matters concerning policing; and
<P>
(ii) the co-operation of the public with the police force in preventing crime<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be assessed. There is not a great deal of difference between the two proposals. An assessment of the effectiveness of DPPs would be contained in the assessment of the arrangements under part II, as referred to in subsection 2(i). Our wording will, if anything, allow the board a slightly wider remit to report on those matters.
<P>
Paragraph (k) of the amendment reflects subsection(3)(d) of clause 2, which provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the level of public satisfaction with the performance of the police force<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be assessed by the board. There is clearly a greater need for such an assessment for the police service than for the consultative arrangements for the DPPs. As the hon. Gentleman will note, the provision for the police is not tied to individual districts—it could be applied overall, or in some other configuration.
<P>
I am prepared to consider an amendment to require a public satisfaction assessment for DPPs and have confirmed with the Police Authority for Northern Ireland that an amendment along those lines would be helpful. I should add that the absence of such a provision for community and police liaison committees did not stop the authority carrying out attitude surveys of the public in the past. However, what was true in the past may not necessarily hold true in the future.
<P>
On the basis that we are prepared to consider tabling an amendment on Report to cover that point, I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): The Under-Secretary spoke about the amendment that he was prepared to consider. I could not hear exactly what he said. Is he contemplating an amendment that would cover the effectiveness as deemed by the board or measured by the level of public satisfaction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My argument is that paragraph (j) of amendment No. 273 is already covered in subsection 2(i). If the hon. Gentleman compares the two, he will understand that what I am saying is true. However, paragraph (k) of the amendment contains a point that we want to consider, and we would be prepared to table an amendment on Report to cover that point in sensible terms. I hope that, with those further clarifications, those who put their names to the amendment will feel that I have responded fully to their concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That is helpful. None the less, I cannot agree with the Under-Secretary when he says that paragraph (j) is the same as subsection 2(i)(i), which has to do with the effectiveness of district police partnerships in carrying out their functions, but I shall not pursue that issue. I accept what the Minister implies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall not detain the Committee. I said that the clause was drafted widely enough to allay the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the drafting is exactly the problem? The wording is too wide and does not guarantee assessment of the effectiveness of, and level of public satisfaction with, DPPs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which exactly expressed my opinion. However, as the Under-Secretary has taken the point on board and agreed to consider the principle behind paragraph (k), I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The amendments concern the management and the openness of the new police service. In the past, the human rights of many sections of the community have been abused, and others have felt that their rights were abused. That feeling has been compounded by the fact that the openness of legal, administrative, disciplinary, financial and other aspects of the review and revision of police conduct has been poor. The responsibility for creating the unhappiness and unease also lies with the prosecution service and the courts, the inadequacy of the formal and informal complaints procedures and the weaknesses in the police authority, which has statutory responsibility for policing.
<P>
The general duty on the Chief Constable to report and the ability of the board to inquire following a report are cornerstones of any accountable police service, because the powers of report and inquiry go to the heart of police accountability. Paragraph 6.22 of the Patten report says—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Policing Board should have the power to require the Chief Constable to report on any issue pertaining to the performance of his functions or those of the police service . . . The grounds on which the Chief Constable might question this requirement should be strictly limited to issues such as those involving national security, sensitive personnel matters and cases before the courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``personnel'' is important there, because the Bill refers to ``personal'' matters, which are entirely different.
<P>
The Bill does not give due expression to the report's recommendations. In fact, it deviates completely from them. Amendment No. 32 would correct the Bill to reflect the report accurately. The Patten report suggested that the Chief Constable might not have to report on sensitive personnel matters. However, the Bill says ``sensitive personal'' matters, which is much broader than Patten's intention, at least in my interpretation. A personal matter can be anything, but a personnel matter falls within the confines of one's job or employment, or pertains to the force per se. A personal matter may not refer to the force at all. That restriction on the reporting function is excessive, hence the amendment.
<P>
Our amendment No. 33 would ensure that personal—or even personnel—matters did not include information about membership of registrable associations. Last week, the Committee considered the declaration of one's membership of, or involvement with, such associations. The amendment would ensure that the intention of clause 47 was not frustrated, as it might be by clause 55.
<P>
Our amendment No. 34 would exclude the exception, which was not envisaged by Patten, of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a matter which is being investigated by a statutory authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That exception is unacceptably broad and should be deleted. For example, if the Audit Office conducted a value-for-money investigation into the conduct of the police in a case, paragraph (3)(c) could be used to prevent a report on the human rights issues, because the matter was being investigated by a statutory authority—the Audit Office. I would like to think that the Government did not intend that to be the position. The focus of the report or investigation by the Chief Constable could be entirely different from that of the statutory authority, although both reports related to the same case.
<P>
Let us take the Audit Office example a stage further. The report could be refused if the Audit Office investigation contained information relating to the police case, no matter how irrelevant or trivial. Again, we do not think that that was intended. The police service is a statutory authority, thus if a police investigation is established, its report could be refused. That is a contradiction in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 would exclude an exception that was not envisaged by the commission. The clause refers to information that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would, or would be likely to, prejudice . . . the administration of justice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The need for an exception based on the administration of justice is not clear, because the clause already refers to exceptions relating to the likelihood of prejudicing proceedings that have been commenced in a court of law or the prevention or detection of crime, and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Again, the amendment is designed to cover an anomaly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): There is a clear distinction. If proceedings have been commenced in a court of law, it is right that the matter is sub judice. In those circumstances, it would be grossly improper for a report to be produced about it. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on other examples, in which great publicity is given to cases during the time the police are hunting for the criminals. I can think of a recent case from mainland Britain. The prejudicial material that is published about the person is such that it is later argued that he cannot receive a fair trial. If subsection (3)(c) were removed, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, it is likely that prosecutions of police officers would become much more difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) for his intervention. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Surely he will agree that if there is an inquiry by any statutory agency or body in Northern Ireland into something that touches upon a serious police matter that should be inquired upon, it should not exclude, prevent or frustrate the inquiry by the board into that aspect of the police's alleged conduct.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 reflects the fact that Patten made key recommendations on approving the report procedure, which was essential to provide for and ensure real accountability. Subsection (3) provides that when the Chief Constable refuses to make a report, no report is made unless the Secretary of State confirms the board's request. But that provision undermines the effectiveness of the report procedure and should be amended so that there should be a deadline for the Secretary of State to make such a decision.
<P>
We suggest that a month is an appropriate period, save in exceptional circumstances when the Secretary of State would consult and agree with the Policing Board that that month could be extended and that the request should stand unless the Secretary of State overrules it within that deadline. The Secretary of State has to take action to prevent that happening. Where the report contained information that legitimately should not be disclosed, the Secretary of State should be able to direct the Chief Constable to make the report none the less, omitting that vital or inappropriate information. I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Before I talk about amendment No. 91, I notice, somewhat wryly, that amendment No. 32 seems to correct a typographical error between the Patten report and the Bill. I seem to remember that the Patten report discussed personnel matters, which become personal matters in the Bill. Perhaps I have got that wrong. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.
<P>
The amendments moved by the hon. Member for South Down are once again consistent with his party's intention of trying to reintroduce aspects of the Patten report that are missing from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am sorry, but I am stuck on the hon. Gentleman's opening comments about amendment No. 32. I hope that he will forgive me if I ask him to go back to them. Having listened to the hon. Members for South Down and for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik), I am not sure that I see the distinction between the two terms. Sensitivity in the security context implies an element of risk to the individual concerned or a need for future intelligence for security to be maintained. The use of the word ``personnel'' in that context can also be seen as the ``personal''. One is talking about the predicament and position of the individual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I used to be a human resources manager when I still had a proper job and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is a big difference between the definitions of personal and personnel matters. I am a bit concerned that we shall have a semantic debate and I would rather defer the whole question to the Minister. It is not my job to respond to some of these questions. There is a serious question here that needs to be answered and it was adequately expressed by the hon. Member for South Down.
<P>
Before I get myself into more linguistic problems, I shall move quickly on to amendment No. 91. I also want to refer briefly to amendment No. 93, which relates to the same subject although I know that it is not in the group. Amendment No. 91, which my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) and I tabled, would change the onus of the Secretary of State's involvement in the clause. Rather than opting in, giving the seal of approval and confirming the requirements, he would have to opt out. We propose replacing in line 9, page 28,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unless it is confirmed by the Secretary of State,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if within the period specified in subsection (2) the Secretary of State informs the Board and the Chief Constable that the inquiry should not be held.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In simple terms, we are saying that an inquiry should not hang on whether the Secretary of State gives it his blessing. Instead he should have the power to veto—to make an active decision—to prevent an inquiry, rather than letting the need for an inquiry fall through inaction.
<P>
I shall not go into detail on amendment No. 93, but it is similar because clauses 55 and 56 cover the board's powers to call for reports and initiate inquiries. On both powers, there are already considerable restrictions that seem somewhat onerous. They make it difficult to visualise a situation in which the board could initiate an inquiry. Recommendation 26 of the Patten report specified that the Policing Board should have the power to initiate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an inquiry into any aspect of the police service or police conduct. Depending on the circumstances, the Board should have the option to request the Police Ombudsman, the Inspectorate of Constabulary or the Audit Office to conduct or contribute to such an inquiry, or to use the Board's own staff, or even private consultants for such a purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 6.22, the report asserted that the grounds on which the Chief Constable might question such an inquiry would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>strictly limited to issues such as those involving national security, sensitive personal matters and cases before the courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some of that relates to clause 56.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was prepared to allow mention of clause 56 in comparative terms, but the hon. Gentleman is discussing a later group of amendments. He shall have adequate time to refer to it later. Could we please keep to amendment No. 91?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I accept your guidance, Mr. Benton. I was trying to save time by making two speeches in one.
<P>
I hope that the Government will think about amendment No. 91. It would not make a big change in terms of the Bill, but it would bring us closer to the intended role of the board in Patten's words. More to the point, it gives the board slightly more autonomy and shifts the emphasis of responsibility on such matters towards the board.
<P>
Amendment No. 36, coupled with amendment No. 274, attempts something similar, so other members of the Committee feel the same way. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I hope that the Government will at least consider the change, as it would probably be quite important in terms of enabling the board to carry out the inquiry functions that Patten thought sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I listened carefully to the comments made by the hon. Member for South Down on his amendment. As I understand it, the amendment is based on the premise that the Patten report has not been correctly interpreted. Therefore, the clause has to be amended to reflect exactly what the Patten report said.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I start with that basic premise. No one asked the Patten Commission to carry out legal parliamentary drafting. Its purpose was to come up with ideas. I recently sat in this Room to discuss the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, which was influenced by Lord Neill. I found that his ideas were sometimes incapable of being translated into legislation without causing hideous knock-on consequences that he had no reason ever to think about. Looking at the section of the Patten report that is under scrutiny, and what the Government have proposed, it seems that we are having a similar problem.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is in danger of being unable to see the wood for the trees. For example, he wishes to substitute the word ``personnel'' for ``personal''. If one considers the Patten report, it is obvious that it does not relate to personnel only. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Chief Constable . . . should be strictly limited to issues such as those—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it cites examples, not a definitive number—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>involving national security, sensitive personnel matters.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If one substitutes ``personnel'' for ``personal'', it turns it into gobbledegook. I do not know what a sensitive personnel matter is. Far be it from me to try to defend the Government, but they have tried to translate the notion behind that appropriately. If one reads the Patten report, it is clear that a ``sensitive personnel matter'' will relate to an individual who forms part of that personnel, and is of such a sensitive personal nature that it should not be disclosed. Such information would have originally been given, in confidence, to the Chief Constable, in relation to that person's employment. I am at a loss to understand why the hon. Gentleman should be anxious and worried about the way in which Government draftsmen have translated that concept into the clause. I am also at a loss to understand what he fears might have been added that was not intended in the original Patten recommendation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Since the hon. Gentleman has decided to defend the Government, I shall defend the hon. Member for South Down. Would the hon. Gentleman not accept that, strategically, the Patten report was discussing personnel matters? Leaving aside the detailed construction suggested by the hon. Member for South Down, it is a slight misrepresentation in terms of wording—which leads to an important change in meaning—to shift from personnel matters to personal matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> What is a ``sensitive personnel matter'' other than a sensitive matter relating to confidential information that someone, in the course of his employment, has given to his boss, the Chief Constable? If the hon. Gentleman has another explanation of what a ``sensitive personnel matter'' might be, will he tell me? One of my anxieties is that I am not sure that the Patten commission spent long hours thinking through what it meant by a ``sensitive personnel matter''. That is one of the reasons why I become anxious about the slavish adherence to every word of the report. Logically, I do not think that the commission spent hours considering such minutiae, which we are now trying to incorporate into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I do not want to indulge in a long conversation on this point, but it is an important distinction. The simple answer to the hon. Gentleman is that ``sensitive personal matters''—this will be a nightmare for Hansard to report—could be those that compromise the individual. ``Sensitive personnel matters''—which is not the exact phrase that I would use—could be those that relate to compromising an inquiry in a legal or other context. What we are describing is not unfamiliar to those in the human resources sector. In that sense, we are in danger of assuming that an apparently trivial point is indeed trivial, when in fact it is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I confess that I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, I shall add a further point. It is curious that, on the whole, the argument advanced by the hon. Member for South Down, which I understand, has been that, as far as possible, as much disclosure should take place as is compatible with human rights and the administration of justice. However, a phrase such as ``sensitive personnel matters'' is a wider concept than
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>because it relates to an individual and is of a sensitive personal nature.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a wider blanket that would enable the Chief Constable to deny access to a wider category of information. The proposal will not restrict access to material. The same point applies to all the other amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me for a moment, I shall give way later.
<P>
In an intervention during the debate on amendment No. 35, I raised an important point about the administration of justice. Patten makes it clear that one of the limited grounds for refusal to provide information is when a case is before the courts. I suspect that Patten did not, at that stage, pay any attention to the full process of justice: he noticed that an issue needed further consideration and it is for the draftsmen to get it right. To exclude the problem of the administration of justice before a case goes to the courts is to miss out a huge area in which it is vital for sub judice rules to be preserved. Otherwise, the administration of justice will be prejudiced, a fair trial will become impossible, and people who ought to stand trial will avoid it. There must be an additional category to cover those circumstances.
<P>
The clause properly reflects what Patten intended. I say that in the spirit of applying my lawyer's mind to the issue, rather than making a partisan point. I urge the hon. Gentleman to accept that argument and not to be so worried about problems that are simply not there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I must tell the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that he is being more than helpful in explaining the Government's position. His talents are wasted on the Opposition Benches. I cannot make him an offer, but he knows what I am implying. He would be more than welcome to join us on the Government Benches. I disagree with some of his points, as I shall explain later. If we are paid by the hour, we are in for a long session.
<P>
We have had a useful debate. Let me deal first with amendment No. 32, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. It is about a difference in language, and my explanation will also deal with the issue raised in support of the amendment by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. Patten says—and the amendment reflects it—that intrusion into sensitive ``personnel'' matters should provide grounds for questioning whether a report should be held. The Bill says ``personal'' rather than ``personnel''.
<P>
It is worth examining the dictionary definitions. The ``Collins English Dictionary'' defines ``personal'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of or relating to the private aspects of a person's life.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clearly what Patten was driving at. ``Personnel'' is defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. the people employed in an organisation or for a service or undertaking<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. the office or department that interviews, appoints or keeps records of employees<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I remember correctly, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said that a personnel officer was a human resource, so the second definition would apply. When we looked at the definitions, we decided that ``personal'' was the appropriate term to use. There is another stronger reason for that. We felt that it should be consistent with section 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998. I suspect that the Patten Commission did not look at any consequential legal implications, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield pointed out. That section defines sensitive personal data as personal data consisting of information relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject, 
<P>
(b) his political opinions, 
<P>
(c) his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature,
<P>
(d) whether he is a member of a trade union (within the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992),
<P>
(e) his physical or mental health or condition,
<P>
(f) his sexual life, 
<P>
(g) the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or 
<P>
(h) any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
We believe that we should take cognisance of existing legislation that impacts on what we are seeking to do in this measure. I should have expected the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, as a former human resources officer, to be only too familiar with the Data Protection Act. He must have been conditioned by that in fulfilling his functions and should have taken it into account in his comments in support of amendment No. 32. I do not need to rehearse the tight logic advanced by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield as to why we should deal with it in the way set out in the Bill and use the term ``personal'' rather than ``personnel''. I have set out some other detailed reasons for that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 35 would circumscribe the grounds on which the Chief Constable can refer a request by the board for a report to the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 33 would require that information about membership of registrable associations should not be regarded as a sensitive personal matter and must therefore be reported on.
<P>
We have already had a detailed debate about registrable associations. Clause 47 requires the Chief Constable to provide general statistical information. It provides for the board to receive information about senior officers whom it appoints, and we have already said that the Government will enable the board to have access to other information if strictly necessary. The circumstance in which it might be necessary for the board to have such information about an officer will be extremely rare. That is because information about registrable associations is a sensitive personal area. We examined that point in detail. We believe that the Chief Constable must retain discretion to refer the matter to the Secretary of State. What is being sought through amendment No. 33 will already be achieved through clause 47.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 would remove matters under investigation by a statutory authority, and matters prejudicial to the administration of justice, as grounds for referring a request for a report to the Secretary of State. The Government have included investigations by other statutory authorities as a safeguard, to avoid unnecessary duplication of reports. Those who always pray in aid Patten's definition should be conscious that the Patten report said at paragraph 6.23 that it was concerned about avoiding
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a confused proliferation of scrutiny into the police service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Patten was conscious that a number of investigations might be running. The one thing that would hamper a new beginning in policing is a constant encroaching of inquiry, investigation and suspicion into everything. Patten's objective would not be achieved if people had to live in a world of intense suspicion and anxiety, especially if several inquiries are approaching the matter from a different direction, as Patten recognised in his examination.
<P>
Many bodies, including the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, have criticised this aspect of the Bill as over-restrictive, and those criticisms are reflected in the amendments. I do not accept some of the allegations that have been made. We have dealt with some of the criticisms, and no doubt others will arise later in our deliberations. However, on this occasion, having reflected on the matter, we believe that the Bill goes too far in the direction of safeguards, following our approach to the matter on the basis of the representations that we received. I therefore ask the Committee to accept amendments Nos. 34 and 35.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 36 and 274, which were, again, tabled by the hon. Member for South Down, and amendment No. 91, tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would require the Secretary of State to act within a time limit if there are grounds to exempt the Chief Constable from having to submit a report. The Government are willing to accept that a time limit should be specified within which the Secretary of State should act in order to avoid unnecessary delay. We have, after all, placed a time limit on the Chief Constable under subsection (2)(b).
<P>
The Government feel that the time limit should be one month, or longer with the agreement of the board, as suggested by the hon. Member for South Down in amendment No. 274. I should perhaps redefine one month as meaning 30 days, as that may be a better, more precise way to describe it. The period will be consistent over all the months.
<P>
The Government also accept that, as suggested in amendment No. 274, it would be sensible to allow the Secretary of State to modify a request for a report as well as to reject it entirely. That flexibility is welcome, and I propose that amendments Nos. 36 and 274 be accepted, too. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire not to press amendment No. 91, which relates to the same issue.
<P>
I ask the Committee to resist amendment No. 32 and to accept amendments Nos. 34, 35, 36 and 274. I have explained how we believe that amendment No. 33 and the principle in amendment No. 91 are already covered in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> On a personal level, the Minister has definitely convinced me that he has accepted the arguments for amendments Nos. 36 and 274. As those amendments have exactly the same intent, there is no need to press amendment No. 91. I thank the Minister for having considered it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank hon. Members for their contributions to the debate. Obviously, the matter that is subject to the greatest dispute is amendment No. 32 and the interpretation of the difference between the words ``personnel'' and ``personal''. Our interpretation is simply that the word used in the Bill, ``personal'', will expand the exceptions that the Chief Constable could use to frustrate an investigation.
<P>
I listened carefully to the comments made. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield strongly took me to task on defining ``personnel'' and ``personal''. Although he told me that it is almost impossible to define such matters, he went on robustly to defend the wording in the Bill. I shall repeat an expression that I used this morning. He was hiding behind the bush and shaking it at the same time. I was asked for an explanation of that expression some time after this morning's event. That was a perfect example of that cliche´.
<P>
The membership of the international commission included a learned friend, one of the most prominent barristers of law in Northern Ireland, Peter Smith, and the former permanent secretary, Maurice Hayes, who knows the capabilities of Mr. Christopher Patten, having been a member of his party. I do not think that those people used either of those words in the report. I am sure that they thought long and hard about every phrase because they knew that their words would be subject to minute investigation and review. That is why ``personal'' is so different from ``personnel'' in that context.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's response and I shall not press amendment No. 32 to a Division, with the clear caveat that the matter may be revisited on Report. I think that the amendments Nos. 34, 35, 36 and 274 have been broadly accepted, subject to some tweaking. I thank the Minister for accepting them, as they would improve the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Amendment No. 279 makes a technical amendment. The Bill should say that the board can call an inquiry after considering a report submitted under section 55 not 53. Government amendment No. 280 requires the board to inform the ombudsman of its decision to hold an inquiry. That amendment was suggested by the ombudsman; it seems a sensible proposition and I ask the Committee to accept it. Those amendments are simple and straightforward.
<P>
There may be some good news in the other amendments, if my hon. Friends get it right when they speak to them. However, that depends how well behaved they are.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The proposals concern what is required to ensure that an inquiry takes place. Amendment No. 92 would remove the requirement for the board to consult the Chief Constable before causing an inquiry to be held. Amendment No. 93 would change the opt in, which the Secretary of State's confirmation implies, for an opt out, whereby the Secretary of State would have 10 days from a reference to inform
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the board and the Chief Constable that the inquiry should not be held.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For all the reasons given in the previous debate, it seems right to strengthen the hand of the board in such matters. The Liberal Democrats accept that an inquiry should be initiated only in grave and exceptional circumstances. However, we believe that such an inquiry should only require notification to and not prior consultation with the Chief Constable. Our proposals seem closer to the intent described by the Patten Commission. We had a long conversation about how literally or metaphorically we should interpret the Patten report. The amendments would slightly strengthen the board's powers, and we believe that that is what the Patten Commission would have liked us to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I wish to speak to the amendments in my name. We would all agree that inquiries are important on many occasions of civil unrest, not only in terms of policing but when there are tragedies. Allowing the public to see openly that those inquiries are full and proper and taking place is an important aspect of any democratic institution. That applies just as much, or more, to policing.
<P>
I caught the drift of the Minister's final comments, but I would say that many of the arguments used about the previous amendments can be repeated for amendments 38 to 42. However, the Patten Commission stressed the importance of being able to follow up reports from the Chief Constable with inquiries
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>subject only to the limitations<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on national security. Patten did not intend to sanction any additional limitation on the powers to follow up inquiries by way of special voting rights. Paragraph 17(4) of schedule 1 provides that an inquiry cannot be initiated unless
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>12 members of the board present and voting<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
agree. Patten did not recognise that as a proper restriction on reporting procedure.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State a sweeping power to prevent an inquiry
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if it appears to him that the holding or continuation of an inquiry under this section would not be in the interests of the efficiency or effectiveness of the police force.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The SDLP amendment would correct that expansion of additional powers for the Secretary of State. I may have missed the Minister's comments in that respect, so perhaps he will respond further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My intervention will be brief as I am looking forward to hearing the Minister comment in a moment. I hope that the Committee might indulge me later if I am not happy with what he has to say.
<P>
The Minister will be aware of how we approached the previous group of amendments. I therefore assume that amendment No. 38 would not commend itself to the Minister for the same reasons. Amendment No. 40 is of real interest, as it would leave out sub-paragraph (3)(c). A similar provision was left out in relation to the clause discussed previously. I understand the point being made by the hon. Member for South Down—what is the relationship between an investigation or inquiry under clause 56, and that being carried out by another statutory authority? Are we to assume that, if one commences under clause 56, the other inquiry being carried out by another statutory authority would automatically cease as it would be taken over? If not, just as I took the view previously that any publication or report would prejudice the inquiry by another statutory authority, I would also consider that two inquiries proceeding at the same time would be a nonsense. One would have to give way to the other. The Minister might be able to satisfy that concern, so I shall reserve further comments until I have heard how he will approach the matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In order to explain the Government's overall approach, I should point out that, in giving the board power to order inquiries, paragraph 6.23 of the Patten report placed it alongside the ``extreme'' power of calling for the Chief Constable to retire. Perhaps there was a typographical error; perhaps the Patten commission might have found a more apposite word. However, the tenor of what it intended is set out within its clever use of that wording.
<P>
The Government have fully implemented the Patten recommendations in the context under discussion. In doing so, we have given the board a power that is not available to police authorities in Great Britain. Inevitably, safeguards are necessary for that aspect of the inquiry power, which the Patten report also envisaged. The relevant argument is in paragraph 6.22.
<P>
Some of the amendments would remove some of those safeguards, while other points were discussed under clause 55, to which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred. The Government are prepared to make changes to strike the correct balance, which is always what we try to achieve. We have taken cognisance of the views expressed in seeking to define the Bill. Other precautions are sensible, and whatever hon. Members might think about the correct balance, I hope that the Committee will appreciate that a power of this significance, novelty and uniqueness must have safeguards attached.
<P>
Amendment No. 92, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would remove a common-sense provision whereby a board is required to consult the Chief Constable before launching an inquiry. The board retains control, but such consultation would cover situations in which additional clarification of the contents of a report could avoid the need for a costly inquiry. The Government think that that is desirable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has argued for consultation. I do not therefore understand why he seeks to delete the safeguard, in an important process of consultation, that we are putting in place. I hope that, in the light of my explanation, he will not press amendment No. 92.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 42 and 275, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, and amendment No. 93, moved by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, reflect amendments to clause 55 and require the Secretary of State to act within a time limit if he wishes to prevent an inquiry. Amendments Nos. 42 and 275 would allow the Secretary of State one month or longer, with the agreement of the board, in which to reject an inquiry on the grounds listed in subsection (3). I said earlier that we would interpret one month as consisting of 30 days, and the same would apply here. We will probably clarify that technical aspect on Report, but it is useful to amend the Bill to establish that principle now.
<P>
Amendment No. 93 also requires the Secretary of State to act within a time limit. I ask the hon. Member for Beaconsfield not to press his amendment, on the understanding that we are meeting his intention by accepting amendments Nos. 42 and 275. Amendments Nos. 38, 39, 40 and 41, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, also reflect points made in clause 55 and deal with the grounds on which the Chief Constable can refer an inquiry to the Secretary of State. We debated the use of the words ``personal'' and ``personnel'' on amendment No. 32; as I said, we use the wording used in the Data Protection Act 1990. 
<H4><center>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Good afternoon, Mr. O'Hara. Clause 47 will be amended to enable inquiries to obtain information about registrable interests if necessary. It is therefore right that that information should be considered sensitive and personal. The Government accept amendments No. 40 and 41, which we believe more closely define the grounds on which the Chief Constable can refer a request for an inquiry to the Secretary of State, but we reject amendments Nos. 38 and 39, for the reasons that we have set out.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked about subsection (3)(c) and an inquiry by another statutory body. We intend to delete that subsection, but we will make it clear that the Secretary of State will be able to prevent inquiries if they are repetitious, which includes circumstances where an inquiry has already been held. We should not tread the same ground again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said a moment ago that amendment No. 275 would be accepted. That amendment gives the Secretary of State the power to prevent an inquiry from being held on any of the grounds mentioned in subsection (3), but subsection (3)(c) is being deleted, so how would the repetitious nature of an inquiry allow the Secretary of State to prevent it from taking place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has got me a bit unsighted and I do not want to try to bluster my way through. The best way of dealing with his question is to reflect on it. There are good reasons for deleting subsection (3)(c), including the fact that the clause would allow the Chief Constable to refer an inquiry to the Secretary of State when there has been another inquiry. We believe that to be the case. My hon. Friend the Member for South Down said that the issue could be worthy of consideration, as it could be seen to be extremely wide. That is why we accept that a deletion should be made. The Secretary of State's power will therefore be more closely defined.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I fear that I have not convinced the hon. Member for Beaconsfield; I shall consider his point if that is the case. If there are inaccuracies or weaknesses in what we seek to achieve, on the basis on which I have set it out, I will write to him. If there is a need for further examination on Report, he can return to the matter. We may return to it ourselves if we accept his point. I am grateful for his detailed intervention, without necessarily being able to answer the point that he made.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Without wanting to make an over-obvious point, Report, if not the further stages of the Bill, is no more than seven days away. Therefore, perhaps the Minister would oblige my hon. Friend and me with a written reply within that period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I tend to be fairly quick with my responses, but I am always dependent on the support of officials who are, given such a time scale, extremely pressed. We have to deal with the issue. We will table an amendment later on the question of repetition, and we might be able to debate the issue when we do so if it requires further consideration. Given the tight time scale, I would have to reply by early on Friday if the Opposition were to have the opportunity to table an amendment. I am conscious of the timetable; we are working to it as well. If I do not meet it, I apologise now and shall do so again in the letter. Of course, I may be able to explain the issue fully, so that may not be necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 44 would remove the Secretary of State's power to prevent or halt an inquiry on grounds that it would not be in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of the police service. That provision has been criticised as departing from the Patten report's conclusions. None the less, Patten recognised that there should be safeguards. I referred earlier to paragraph 6.22. As a result, we have designed the safeguards that we have sought to discuss. In the light of the representations, the Government have considered the matter again and have accepted that the efficiency and effectiveness of the formulation is too wide. We believe that a further precaution is necessary for us to rule out inquiries that raise the same issues repetitively and ones that do not justify the use of the inquiry powers.
<P>
Accordingly, we intend to redraft subsection (4) to provide the power to prevent and halt repetitious or vexatious inquiries, which will be in keeping with the wording used in regulation 17 of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Complaints etc) Regulations 1988. The safeguard is designed to prevent inquiries that are disproportionate or repeat issues that have already been dealt with by the board or another authority. We do not envisage that happening regularly, but in matters concerning the efficiency of policing, we believe such a safety-net provision necessary. On that basis, I do not believe that amendment No. 44 should gain the Committee's support.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would remove subsection (9), which states that the board should not launch inquiries into effects that took place before it was established. We all accept that Patten is about a new beginning to policing—indeed, that is reflected in the report's title. The board is not being set up as a one-sided truth and reconciliation body for policing. Some may want that, but that is not the intention of the report or the Government as we proceed to implement it. Patten made it clear that the concept of truth and reconciliation was not his aim. Paragraph 1.7 of the report stated that the Commission's approach was ``restorative, not retributive''. So it is all about creating a new climate and not being constantly backward-looking. Patten also said—again in paragraph 1.7—that a fresh start could never be fashioned
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>out of a series of judgments about who was culpable for each of the tragedies and mistakes of the past.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On that basis, I ask the Committee to oppose amendment No. 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I listened to the Minister's comments on amendment No. 48, which would delete subsection (9). Does he agree that the inclusion of that subsection in the Bill will prevent the Policing Board from carrying out any investigation that comes to light with respect to the period before it was set up? Is it not unusual for a board to be unable to investigate allegations of misdemeanour or more serious occurrences that do not come to light until after it is established? Is that not extraordinary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No, I do not think so, because I genuinely believe that Patten is about the future, not the past. Too many people want to use the new mechanisms constantly to refer back to the past, but we are trying to build a new approach to policing. That is why Patten stressed the importance of being restorative and looking forward, not looking backward and being the word that I could not pronounce—retributive. There is a real danger of exploiting the new framework. Some people in Northern Ireland will be vexatious and seek to exploit the truth and reconciliation provisions, while the rest of us are trying to build a new future for policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down accepts what we are trying to achieve, but he should also accept that some people will be deliberately destructive of our objectives and will not change their minds until they gain everything that they want. That deals not with a new vision, but with the past, which explains why we are seeking a balanced approach.

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister seems to be saying that people who have suffered injustice should not have the right to redress through this mechanism. He rightly draws attention to the possibility of vexatious, frivolous or malicious allegations being made. That is part of society, but proper requests for an inquiry should not be condemned alongside improper requests. I find that a highly unusual attitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I regret that my hon. Friend finds it unusual, but I am attempting to use language that has been employed by others in his party—and we sign up to it in making provisions for the future. People should raise their grievances now, not stand in line and wait for some new structure to come into being and then say that they did not trust the structures of the past. I accept that people do not trust them, but under no circumstances am I going to give grounds for believing that what we currently have in place is fundamentally flawed and biased against a particular section of the community. We accept that criticisms of the present system have been made and we are responding to them.
<P>
Currently, we have an independent police complaints commission. We know that some people will not even talk to the RUC, but they want their problems resolved. They cannot have it both ways. If they have complaints, they should raise them now. Because of problems of the past, several inquiries are being conducted into the most serious matters. The Government have said that all such issues will be examined. We have never ruled out inquiries into the most difficult matters that raise profound issues. All those issues are complicated by the fact that they are being tackled within the existing framework. I shall not criticise that. We are trying to build on a framework that has evolved over the years to tackle some of the alleged, perceived and real injustices.
<P>
The community in Northern Ireland seized on our approach when it supported the Good Friday agreement. That talked about a new future, marked by a more equal approach and recognition of everyone's traditions. Such an approach flows both ways. Respect should be given to the machinery of government, which has struggled to find answers to some complex problems. The present Government, previous Governments and those who serve the Government in a difficult environment are rarely given sufficient credit for tackling some deep issues.
<P>
The inquiries are not designed to revisit the past, but that does not mean that the past will never be revisited. For example, the ombudsman's remit, which we shall discuss later, allows an unlimited retrospective approach in some circumstances. However, if the Policing Board heard demands only for inquiries about the past, it would not be able to build for the future. If people want others to have a vision, they must share their vision of the future and not live too much in the suspicious atmosphere of the past.
<P>
I ask the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 92, 38, 48 and 44, accept amendments Nos. 39 and 93 in principle only and accept amendments Nos. 40, 41, 42, 275 and Government amendments Nos. 279 and 280.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall make only one point. I appreciate what the Minister said and I accept that some of the amendments provide—as he put it—a degree of duplication, so I shall not lose sleep over amendment No. 41, for instance, because it is perfectly arguable that the clause meets the purpose of that amendment by including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, I had reservations about amendment No. 40, which the Minister is minded to accept. As a matter of consistency, we would vote against that amendment, but it is in the Minister's power to reassure us on Report that our anxieties are misplaced. He accepted amendment No. 275, which would fetter the Secretary of State's ability to say no, by restricting him to refusing an inquiry only on the grounds set out in subsection (3). The Bill currently does not fetter the Secretary of State's discretion at all. If the Secretary of State is to prevent repetitious inquiries from taking place, the Bill requires some statement to that effect, because subsection (3) does not supply such a condition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The Minister made a fair point about amendment No. 92 and clarified the issue to my satisfaction. As he has accepted the principle behind amendment No. 93, I do not intend to press either of those amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> In view of the Minister's comments, I will not press amendment No. 38, which deals with the vexatious interpretation of the words ``personal'' and ``personnel''. That action is consistent with my caveat that I may revisit the issue on Report.
<P>
I thank the Minister for accepting amendments Nos. 40, 41, 42 and 275. However, he has not dispelled the concerns behind amendment No. 44. It is not inappropriate to credit the new Policing Board, even in advance, with reasonableness, integrity and honesty.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 48, we think that permission for an inquiry to deal with events that occurred before the board was set up should be given, when there is new concrete evidence and it is reasonably judged that an inquiry can be carried out into that event.
<P>
I am not sure what the Minister meant when he said that he accepted amendment No. 44. That seemed to be subject to the introduction of new phraseology. If I have misunderstood him, perhaps he will correct me. If he is accepting amendment No. 44, I will be delighted. If not, I would like to press amendments Nos. 44 and 48,

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The amendment would enable the Policing Board to appoint—as Patten had intended—certain named categories of persons to conduct an inquiry. Patten said that the board
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>should have the option to request the Police Ombudsman, the Inspectorate of Constabulary or the Audit Office to conduct or contribute to such an inquiry, or to use the Board's own staff or even private consultants for such a purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a reasonable and admirable aspiration for the board to have, and the amendment would enable it to do that very thing.
<P>
Patten considered it important that the board
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>should have the power to request another agency to conduct an inquiry and should have the capacity to do so itself.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He said that the board's activities would be bound
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to overlap to some extent with those of other more specialised agencies like the Ombudsman or the Audit Office . . . Sensible practical understandings will have to be worked out as to who leads on particular issues.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that a request from the Policing Board to any of the specialised agencies should be resolved directly between them and that they would not to have to wait for the Secretary of State's confirmation.
<P>
Under clause 56, the board cannot appoint consultants or even a member of its own staff to conduct an inquiry without the consent of the Secretary of State. Contrary to the clear implication of Patten's remarks, subsection (6) fails to provide clear authorisation for the ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General or an inspector of constabulary to conduct an inquiry on the request of the Policing Board without the Secretary of State's confirmation—an all-powerful restriction on the indemnity of the board. Patten emphasised the need for openness and transparency in the operation of the Policing Board, and recommended that it should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>hold the Chief Constable . . . publicly to account.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The public need to see, as they can see in Leeds or Los Angeles, their senior officers presenting reports and answering questions before the public's representatives.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, subsection (8) allows the person conducting the inquiry to decide whether it should be conducted in public. It should be a requirement that the inquiry will be held in public unless there are strong, valid reasons why it should not be.
<P>
I suppose that I should tread warily in speaking to amendment No. 49, too, as it relates to who pays for what in an inquiry. I do not want to alarm the Minister in these times of stringency, but inquiries are, as we know, trying to find the truth and investigate and prevent repetition of wrongdoing, and someone must pay for them. The costs can be extremely high, as we are now witnessing with the Bloody Sunday inquiry. It is important that the power to conduct inquiries is exercised judiciously, but none the less the cost, which can be excessive and a tremendous drain on the financial resources of the Policing Board, should be assisted by the Government in part or in full. I realise that that would require an understanding or memorandum of agreement between the Secretary of State's offices and the Policing Board on how financial assistance for such costs will be provided.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 is a simple amendment that would enable copies of inquiry reports to be submitted to the police ombudsman and the Human Rights Commission. They may, and usually do, have a legitimate interest in the outcome of such an inquiry.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 is another simple amendment. It would enable the Policing Board, rather than the Secretary of State, to decide what shall be published following an inquiry. If the board commissions the inquiry, the board should decide what should be published. That would ensure overt public confidence in the board, which might then be seen to be more independent of the Government, and it would help achieve openness and transparency. It would also ensure that the foremost policing agency is, and is seen to be, publishing the report and responsible for its actions.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 relates to the Policing Board's initiating inquiries. Patten's scheme is that, when the report of an inquiry is not published, as subsection (13) provides, it is for the Secretary of State to release the summary of findings and conclusions to the extent that appears to him to be in the public interest. Given that the Policing Board set up the inquiry, that should be for the Policing Board to decide.

<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I support amendment No. 94, which is consistent with the points that I have made in previous debates. The amendment would replace the words ``with the approval of'' with the phrase ``after consultation with''. Subsection (7) relates to the appointment of another person to conduct an inquiry. In our judgment, that should require only consultation with the Secretary of State, not his or her approval. The board should be in a position to make that decision.
<P>
We were thinking of tabling an amendment similar to amendment No. 49. One of the main hurdles could end up being the cost of running an inquiry. What process does the Minister envisage to ensure that an inquiry, which may be important, is not prevented from being held on the basis of cost alone?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 265, which also deals with inquiries. Others wish to make public inquiries readily available but I believe that some form of restraint on them is necessary—plenty of people in Northern Ireland are likely to demand inquiries, especially public inquiries. Our amendment would therefore provide that the person conducting the inquiry may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, hold it in public. Public inquiries tend to carry on and on and to cost much money and public resources. We therefore believe that before any inquiry is conducted in public it should have the approval of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Again, I will try to work through the cluster of amendments logically. I hope that I can explain simply the amendments that we ask the Committee to accept and those that we seek to resist; we accept one amendment only in part and we will have to return to it on Report.
<P>
Amendment No. 45, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, would effectively reword the Bill to achieve the aim of Government policy. It was always the Government's intention that the Secretary of State should act as an arbiter in cases where the Comptroller, the ombudsman or Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary is unwilling to comply with the board's request to hold an inquiry. It is within the board's ambit to ask those bodies to act, but only the Secretary of State has the power to compel them to do so. The wording of amendment No. 45 makes clear what we seek to do and I ask the Committee to accept it.
<P>
Amendment No. 94, moved by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would require the board to consult the Secretary of State when appointing bodies other than the Comptroller, ombudsman or HMIC to conduct an inquiry. As drafted, the Bill requires the Secretary of State's approval because, as we have said, we believe that to be an exceptional power. The Secretary of State has a duty to ensure that the inquirers carrying out that function are competent to do so. Where an inquirer is a professional investigator, such as the three bodies mentioned in the Bill, the board can make its own arrangements—otherwise the Secretary of State should retain a say, as set out in subsection (7). I do not accept the arguments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and I ask the Committee to resist his amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 265, moved by the hon. Member for West Tyrone, and amendment No. 277, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, deal with holding inquiries in public. Amendment No. 265 would require the Secretary of State to give his consent on whether an inquiry can be held in public. That power is an independent inquiry power and it would be contradictory to require the Secretary of State's approval for it. It may be the independent inquirer who determines that the case should, for whatever reason, be held in public. We do not believe it necessary for the Secretary of State to give his consent once matters have been approved. Paragraph 6.3 of the Patten report states that the board's primary function is to hold the police service publicly to account. The inquiry power is one of the main ways of achieving that and the Government accept that there should be a presumption that inquiries are held in public. That is the right approach to the matter. Therefore, I have no difficulty in accepting amendment No. 277, as it requires inquiries to be held in public but retains the necessary discretion to hold the inquiry in private. Accordingly, I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 277 but reject amendment No. 265.
<P>
Amendment No. 49 would require the Secretary of State rather than the board to pay for inquiries. The Government believe that resources should rest with those using them. That is the case with the Chief Constable, and should be with the board, too. The board will be expected to bid for resources in exactly the same way as the current Police Authority for Northern Ireland does. The Government cannot be expected to write blank cheques for the board to carry out inquiries.
<P>
I am reminded of a good description by Nye Bevan of the dilemma that may be posed in such circumstances. I think that he once said the question of priorities is the language of socialism. In this case, the question of priorities becomes the language of policing as well. There should be some discipline on those who initiate a course of action, who should be mindful of that course and of the principles involved, and fiscal discipline is not necessarily a bad thing in such circumstances. Another underlying aspect is that, if we accepted amendment No. 49, we would be saying that the board has a blank cheque to initiate any inquiry that it wants, without any question of the cost. The money has to be found from somewhere, and that somewhere is likely to be the Northern Ireland Vote, the bulk of which is paying for policing. Money would have to come out of the policing budget to pay for the inquiries, which would result in fewer officers on the street or attending to crime solving, although that is the very function that they are there to achieve. The board should be mindful of that.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for South Down to consider who would pay for such a measure. Would it come out of the policing budget or, by some magical means, would we be able to trot off to the Treasury and ask for an unlimited sum? If he believes the latter to be the case, he is being unrealistic. He may end up asking for more policing in his area, and he would not like to be told by the board that it could not be funded because the money had been transferred from policing to pay for inquiries. Therefore, he should consider the balance needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Would the Minister agree that an important inquiry should not be prevented from being held simply on the basis of financial constraint?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Define ``important inquiry''. Define a way in which that would be achieved. Governments regularly show that they are flexible when the substantial case has been made, but what is being sought here is an open-ended commitment. Hon. Members may want to use words such as ``exceptional'' to describe the importance of an inquiry, but they need to define such words. We are adhering to the correct principle: those who want to initiate a course of action should not think that it is easy to pay for it, because in that case responsibility goes out of the window. Anyone who has served at any point in the control of public money, whether in local or national Government, will understand that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I believe Ministers when they say that they are planning for success. Is it not incumbent on them therefore to assume that by and large the board will act responsibly when it calls for an inquiry, especially given the fact that the Secretary of State could veto inquiries that he considered otiose or unreasonable? There is a danger here that acceptable or important inquiries will be prevented from taking place because of the lack of funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are not inventing Valhalla. We may be inventing a new vision for Northern Ireland, but financial discipline comes into play. It has come into play at the moment: the devolved Administration are having to tackle the distribution of money. That comes back to the question of priorities that is the language of socialism, as Nye Bevan described it. It applies at every level and tier of Government decision making and it should apply with equal rigour to the Policing Board. It would be far too easy to say, ``Let's have an inquiry today, chaps, and someone else will pay for it.'' That is not a responsible way of viewing these matters.
<P>
As the board weighs the demand for an inquiry, it must consider how it is to be paid for. One day it may believe that one issue is the most important; the following day something else may come along and it will become an open-ended commitment. Unfortunately, I cannot dip my hand into the pockets of the Treasury to take out whatever money we want. If that were the case, it would make every Minister's job that much easier, but those are not the rules that apply and the right discipline to apply here is to consider the financial consequences of any decision alongside all the other aspects.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I take on board the Minister's strictures about financial accountability for any body or person in public service, but he gave the impression that the board would act in a frivolous manner and would have an inquiry because it was not paying for it. Those are not the actions that I envisage for a responsible board that has its own budget. When speaking to the amendment, I explained several times that there has to be an order between the Secretary of State and the Policing Board in respect of paying for inquiries. Will the normal budgetary procedures apply, with a bid being made to cover the expenditure of running the activities of the Policing Board. Is the Minister saying that inquiries such as the Lawrence inquiry or the Bloody Sunday inquiry could or should be paid for out of an annual budget? Surely that is not possible. Secondly, could—

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I have only one further question. If there were no budget left for an inquiry, would a proper public interest inquiry be frustrated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I could ask my hon. Friend to define public interest. Whenever the Government use the public interest reason for not proceeding, we are criticised because we cannot define the relevant public interest in the eyes of those who examine it. When people use that term, they should define what they mean by it.
<P>
I believe that the fundamental principle is right. The board should make its bid on the basis of its expected eventualities over a period. It should negotiate and discuss that with the Government, because the Northern Ireland Office and the Ministers responsible have to negotiate with the Treasury. If we get it wrong, it also has consequences for the way that we deliver our services. That applies across every spending Department. It has not been invented by this Government, but has always been the case. It has always applied in local government as well. In those circumstances, we have to consider what the amendment suggests. It is not about clarifying the inquiry, but suggests that the Secretary of State should pay, rather than the board. That is why the Committee should not support amendment No. 49. It sets a principle that I do not believe is correct, for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 50 would require the board to send a copy of any report to the ombudsman and the Human Rights Commission. I accept in part the thrust of the amendment. The ombudsman should receive a report, but the issues raised do not necessarily impinge on human rights matters, so it would be wrong to encompass the commission, too. The ombudsman may be carrying out equivalent investigations or may have initiated matters for investigation, so she should know what the Policing Board is doing on such matters. We shall return to that subject on Report to include the ombudsman, but not the Human Rights Commission.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 51 and 278 require the board instead of the Secretary of State to issue a summary of an inquiry that has not been made public. The Government acknowledge that that is an appropriate role for the board, and so is willing to accept the amendments.
<P>
I hope that all hon. Members are clear about what is in the mind of the Government. I am certainly clear about what we are accepting and rejecting, and why. I ask the Committee to consider the grounds on which I have dealt with the issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Once again, we are discussing the relative responsibilities of the board versus the Secretary of State. There is a contradiction in the Minister's argument about funding. He may be right in his strong argument that financial responsibilities for paying for inquiries should rest with the board. However, I have not had much reassurance that an inquiry would not be frustrated by a lack of funds on account of the limited resources available to the board to carry out inquiries. I hope that the Minister will think about that, because it would be a travesty if, having established a board in meticulous detail, it was unable to carry out the functions that went with its structures. In the hope that the matter might be reconsidered on report, I will not press amendment No. 94.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The amendments were tabled to bring this part of the Bill into line with the accepted proposals of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland—the Patten report. We share its view that the implementation of its recommendation for a fully independent ombudsman should lead to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a most effective mechanism for holding the police accountable to the law.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In Northern Ireland, such accountability is badly needed. Research has found that the level of police complaints that are upheld in Northern Ireland is strikingly and almost unacceptably low. All too often in our history, from the Samuel Devenney case to the Rosemary Nelson case, members of the police have obstructed complaints investigations.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 is designed to implement the Patten recommendation that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Ombudsman should exercise the right to investigate and comment on police policies and practices.<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is vital; it allows the ombudsman to take a proactive and pre-emptive role. Often, police policies and practices can lead to wrongdoing. Indeed, practices can sometimes almost encourage wrongdoing if they are portrayed in the wrong way and not dealt with effectively, efficiently and quickly.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 means that the ombudsman would not have to wait until things go wrong. She can stop problems arising in the first place, which can only benefit officers, the new police services and the public alike. Under the Bill, the ombudsman can only report on such issues, unless a criminal or disciplinary offence has been committed. That is not good enough. The ombudsman must be able—as Patten recommended—to conduct investigations.
<P>
Amendment No. 54 would make it an offence if an investigation had been obstructed. Under the Bill, anyone who obstructed the ombudsman from making a report would not have committed an offence. That is a glaring omission. 
<P>
Amendment No. 72 would allow an investigation into police policies and practices to be transformed into a full investigation of possible criminal or disciplinary wrongdoings. Amendment No. 53 is designed to remove a restriction in the current terminology of the Bill, under which a report that the ombudsman writes into police practices cannot 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>identify any individual; or . . . disclose any information from which the identity of an individual may be established.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many people have said to me that that is a bizarre restriction. I suppose that the identity of a police commander responsible for overseeing and implementing new policy is obvious, but it may be impossible for the ombudsman to report on that policy because the identity of the person would be revealed. Government amendment No. 281 attempts to redress that problem and provides that the ombudsman may name persons if it is in the public interest to do so. However, we prefer the wording of amendment No. 53, which would not assume secrecy. It would leave the matter at the discretion of the police ombudsman.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 is designed to ensure that the ombudsman has access to information held by the Chief Constable and the Policing Board. It is substantively identical to Government amendment No. 282, which we welcome. In those circumstances, we shall not press our amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 would ensure the independence of the ombudsman. Patten underlined the importance of that independence. We agree, which is why our amendment would delete sections 65(4) and (5) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which allow the Secretary of State to issue ``guidance'' to the ombudsman on the exercise of her functions.
<P>
Patten objected to the issuance of guidance to the Chief Constable on the grounds that it would undermine the Chief Constable's independence. If the same argument were used under our amendment in respect of the ombudsman, it would be perfectly logical. Other matters relating to the ombudsman could be raised at this time, but as the Committee is striving towards the fulfilment of a tight agenda this evening, I shall not pursue them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I find it very difficult to follow the purpose of amendment No. 52. The words ``investigate'' and ``report'' seem to add nothing to the word ``make''. The real change is that instead of ``may'', he puts in the word ``shall''. Does he argue that the ombudsman should have no discretion and that the moment something comes to his attention he must carry out an investigation? That is the apparent thrust of the amendment and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could clarify that point so that we can decide what view to take about it.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The intention of amendment No. 52 was to give the ombudsman the power to investigate police policies and practices, which in the terms recommended would not place an absolute obligation on the ombudsman to pursue that which was not considered worthy of pursuit. I am not sure that that answers the intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Following the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, amendment No. 52 seems to do rather more than give a power to the ombudsman. ``Shall'' does not seem very negotiable. The amendment appears to oblige the ombudsman to investigate and then report. Do I read the hon. Gentleman's intentions correctly?
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> That wording is as the hon. Gentleman puts it: the ombudsman ``shall'' investigate, which is mandatory rather than discretionary terminology. The intention was that the ombudsman would have the power to investigate these matters on report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Paragraph (b) uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the opinion of the Ombudsman,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I rather suspect that whatever term is adopted, it has almost exactly the same effect. I am not sure that the amendment will make any material difference to the Bill. If it depends on the opinion of the ombudsman, it makes little difference whether ``may'' or ``shall'' is used. It is the ombudsman's decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I take that point. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 attempt to tidy up two things that might be important in the drafting of clause 61. It deals with the ombudsman's access to information and refers to ``any of his functions''. That may be all right, but it should be more specific and what is presumably meant is the functions of that office. Amendment No. 96 aims to clarify that. Although I doubt whether the Northern Ireland peace process will collapse if that change is not made, I am led to believe by those who advise me on this that it might be beneficial.
<P>
Amendment No. 95 suggests another rather subtle and perhaps somewhat detailed change. The problem is that the wording of the clause leaves open to dispute the question in whose judgment are the ombudsman's requirements reasonable. In a difficult inquiry, the Chief Constable and the board may say that the ombudsman's requests are not reasonable and resist supplying the information. Our proposal would make it absolutely clear that it was up to the ombudsman to determine the answer to that question. Part of our aim is to ensure that the ombudsman is not distracted by a sideshow, as debate ensues among the very bodies that are being investigated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I mentioned to the hon. Member for South Down that I could not understand amendment No. 52. Having heard from him, I confess that I remain as mystified as before. There is no difference between saying ``make'' a report and ``investigate and report''. The process of making a report clearly requires investigation. Therefore the amendment would add nothing to the clause.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point is about the use of the word ``shall'' as opposed to ``may''. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) picked up, correctly, that the mandatory element of ``shall'' is tempered in view of paragraph (b). I confess that I believe that ``shall'' is not a word that should be used. I prefer ``may'', because otherwise one could argue, albeit this becomes rather complex, that the ombudsman was still under an obligation to investigate. The ombudsman must have discretion. I have never heard of a situation in which the ombudsman did not have the discretion, having considered the preliminary issue, to say, ``There's no point going down that road,''
<P>
Government amendment No. 281 raises a more fundamental issue. As initially drafted, the Bill provides that the report by the ombudsman, as a mandatory matter, will not identify individuals or disclose information from which their identity could be established. Are the Government right to depart from that principle? My concern is that identity in the context of Northern Ireland, especially relating to the police, has always had security implications. I accept that there may be occasions on which one might consider that an identity should be revealed in the public interest, but are we not simply producing a hostage to fortune? The poor old ombudsman's actions will be judicially reviewed according to amendment No. 281, because the moment that she decides to disclose the identity of an individual in the public interest, someone will take her to the High Court and say that that is not in the public interest.
<P>
Are we going down the right road? I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments. He has not yet persuaded me that we should accept this departure from what the clause says, but he may be capable of doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I respond not in any spirit of confrontation, but because it is important to set the record straight on the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. I may be misrepresenting what he said and, if I am, I will gladly stand corrected if he wants to intervene. As I understand it, he said that RUC officers have obstructed all investigations from Sam Devenney to Rosemary Nelson. That was the impression that the hon. Gentleman gave, but he is nodding his head in disagreement and I would be glad to accept a correction.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I made two separate statements. I said that, in the past, RUC officers have obstructed investigations. I then went on to refer to investigations into cases such as Devenney and Nelson, but the two statements were not connected, as far as I remember.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for that correction, and no doubt the record will reflect it. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that it is important to put on the record that no evidence exists that the RUC has obstructed any investigation. To make out that such a sweeping allegation was a general principle would be difficult to justify. However, I do not want to cause a fundamental disagreement between my hon. Friend and myself. One of the cases in particular that he mentioned is a subject of strong feelings in some parts of the community in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 52, 54 and 72 are related and would fundamentally alter the provisions. The clause enables the ombudsman to comment on police policies and practices when, during the course or as a result of an investigation, she identifies issues of which she believes the board and Chief Constable should be notified. We had an interesting discussion on that principle at an earlier stage in our proceedings. For example, if the ombudsman identified that a piece of guidance issued by the Chief Constable was being made by different officers, she might draw that to the attention of the Chief Constable or the board Alternatively, if a restraint technique was leading to a large number of complaints, she might want to comment. That would be a reasonable thing for her to draw to the attention of the board and the Chief Constable. To do that, she may need to examine the information in a range of complaints, and talk to the Chief Constable or the board to be able to produce a more meaningful report. That is different from her being able to investigate police policies and practices, whether or not they arise from complaints, and to have all the powers of section 56 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 in doing so. The amendments would also make an obstruction of such an investigation an offence.
<P>
That goes far beyond what Patten intended—or, certainly, far beyond what I can read into the commission's intention. More fundamentally, the measure would cut across the role of the board. That is the body with the responsibility for holding the Chief Constable to account on police policies, as was envisaged by Patten. It should receive any report from the ombudsman and decide the action required. For instance, it could seek a report under clause 55 or, if necessary, an inquiry under clause 56.
<P>
As Patten said in paragraph 6.23, there should not be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a confused proliferation of scrutiny into the police service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a wise and cautious suggestion and one that we take to heart. The board should be in the lead. In those circumstances, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw amendment No. 52 and not to press amendments Nos. 54 and 72.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56, 95 and 96 and Government amendment No. 282 affect clause 61. Amendments Nos. 56 and 95 appear to get at the same point, which is that the clause contains a barrier to the ombudsman's access to information, as it places a test of reasonableness on her. The intention of the test seems to have been misrepresented as an attempt to stifle the ombudsman, in spite of the fact that the same wording applies to the Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern Ireland in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Complaints etc) Regulations 1988.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I tabled Government amendment No. 282 to remove the doubt and allay concerns. I ask the Committee to accept it rather than either amendment No. 56 or amendment No. 95. I ask the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for South Down not to press amendments Nos. 95 and 56 respectively.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 links to amendment No. 95 and appears to change the wording of clause 61 in line 14 of page 31 without changing the meaning. I could not accept the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will agree that it is probably safer to stick to the existing drafting rather than to go down his somewhat existential route.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I want to take the Under-Secretary back to what he said about Government amendment No. 282, which would leave out ``reasonably''. What will its effect be? If the ombudsman makes an unreasonable demand for documents, will that be complied with because her word is law and cannot be impugned? Alternatively, is the answer that we have removed ``reasonably'' as it does not need to be there because reasonableness is implied in any request that the ombudsman makes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is helpful—he not only poses a question for me, but answers it as well. I happily accept his answer to his own question as the best interpretation that I could give of the amendment.
<P>
Perhaps I was being slightly trivial, but I was asking the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to rely on the wording of the Bill. I hope that he will not press amendment No. 96.
<P>
<H5>7.3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Before the suspension of the Committee, I was responding to remarks made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about amendment No. 281. I pointed out that he had answered his own question—[Interruption] For further amplification, I should also point out that section 3 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 includes a similar provision to that in Government amendment No. 281. Section 63 of that Act states that the ombudsman may issue
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a summary or general statement . . . which does not—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the important part—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>except to such extent as the Ombudsman thinks necessary in the public interest, identify any person to whom the information relates.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That indicates a consistency of approach. I accept that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the ombudsman could be subject to judicial review under section 73 or under Government amendment No. 281. That is a matter for the ombudsman. She was consulted on the amendment, which she regarded as suitable. Under those circumstances, it is not one of her fears.
<P>
In relation to amendment No. 53, my hon. Friend the Member for South Down said that the ombudsman would not be able to produce a report for fear of identifying an individual or disclosing information from which the identity of an individual may be established. That, of course, is prevented by clause 58(2). On reflection, the Government think that the clause can be improved. We must bear in mind, however, that a report could be produced in advance of the conclusion of an investigation, and we would not want it to prejudice a possible action against an officer. That is one of the reasons why the clause is drafted as it is.
<P>
However, we have accepted the ombudsman-designate's argument that the provision should be changed to allow disclosure if it is in the public interest. If that test is satisfied—and only if that test is satisfied—the naming of complainants who are officers is reasonable. In those circumstances, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw amendment No. 53 and accept amendment No. 281.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 is, entirely unintentionally, technically deficient. It calls for the repeal of section 65(4) and (5) of the 1998 Act. Even if it were not technically flawed, I would ask the Committee to resist it. Section 65(4) enables the Secretary of State to guide the ombudsman specifically on issues concerning discipline. It is designed to assist dealings between the ombudsman and the police in deciding on any disciplinary action. Such guidance is already provided for Article 23 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. Section 65(5) enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the ombudsman to ensure that her actions do not prejudice the public interest. That could cover guidance on not revealing publicly information that might prejudice national security. I am sure that the Committee accept that that is important.
<P>
In paragraph 6.22, the Patten report recognises that the Secretary of State should continue to have responsibility for national security. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for the Secretary of State to issue such guidance. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for South Down not to press the amendment, because it is technically deficient and the provisions that it would attack are defensible.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for South Down to withdraw amendment No.52 and not to press amendments Nos. 53, 54, 56, 72 and 74. Although he is absent, I ask the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire not to press amendments Nos. 95 and 96. I ask the Committee to accept Government amendments Nos. 281 and 282. I hope that that summary was for the Committee's better edification and that it will follow my recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary and other hon. Members for their contributions. I do not understand why the hon. Member for Beaconsfield objected to the word ``investigate'' in amendment No. 52, as he accepted that reporting requires investigation. The words ``investigate'' and ``report'' do not conflict with each other, but he made much of that.
<P>
On amendment No. 53, the Under-Secretary said that the public interest was a great concern but difficult to define. However, he uses the phrase ``public interest'' in Government amendment No. 281. If the public interest was difficult to define for my amendment, it must be equally difficult for his.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Although the public interest is difficult to define, we accepted the underlying argument, which is why we included the phrase in amendment No. 281.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Bill is silent on the ombudsman's powers to appoint staff and conduct investigations, but I take on board the Under-Secretary's comments about possible technical inaccuracies in amendment No. 54. He is probably right, so I shall not press it. It is fair to say that Government amendment No. 282 deals with the issue raised by amendment No. 56, which relates to clause 61, so I shall not press amendment No. 56 either.
<P>
Amendment No. 72, which relates to schedule 5 and is consequential on amendment No. 52, concerns the ability of the ombudsman to conduct investigations. Amendment No. 72 is logical and proper, so I shall press it. I shall also press amendment No. 74, which deals with schedule 7 and would ensure the independence of the ombudsman.
<P>
As I said, I shall not press amendments Nos. 54 and 56, but I ask the Committee to approve amendments Nos. 52, 53, 72 and 74.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 281, in page 30, line 18, leave out from beginning to end of line 21 and insert—

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure the full independence of the ombudsman and that her office provides the necessary level of discretion to investigate past matters. The ombudsman should not operate as a truth and reconciliation commission and the office should not be diverted from its main task—investigating complaints of the past. We hope that the person appointed to the office—and her successors—will exercise discretion sensibly, bearing in mind budgetary constraints and other factors. The implementation plan states that the ombudsman should look into matters in relation to the past only in grave and exceptional circumstances or where there is fresh evidence.
<P>
The ombudsman should have a general power to look into past matters where it is—if I dare use the phrase—in the public interest to do so. The amendment is competent and reasonable and should gain the Committee's approval.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendment would give the ombudsman an override provision to bypass the regulations under clause 60 where, in the ombudsman's opinion, there are exceptional circumstances relating to the public interest to do so. That was the basis on which the amendment was moved.
<P>
The Government believe that such a provision is unnecessary and that it would go further than we are prepared to go. The Government's underlying approach to Patten is that it offers a new beginning. The regulations that will apply to the ombudsman have been made available to hon. Members today. I do not expect members of the Committee to be in a position to deal with them in detail, but we are prepared to listen to any representations that they might wish to make. The ombudsman has been consulted on the regulations, and we have taken into account her views on the way in which she will perform her functions.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Generally, the ombudsman will be able to consider cases in which the conduct complained of arose in the previous 12 months. In her first year of operation, we have agreed with her that the period should be 24 months; thereafter, however, it will be 12 months.
<P>
The ombudsman may take on cases provided—it is an important proviso—they have not already been dealt with. She may take over cases that are not closed, but she may re-open cases only in exceptional circumstances, which are defined in the regulations. That is our view and it is in keeping with what Patten said. It will avoid the ombudsman being inundated with complaints about cases that have already been dealt with.
<P>
The exceptions will include matters that have not been complained of previously, where it appears to the ombudsman that a grave or exceptional crime or disciplinary matter has been committed. In addition, it will be open to her to investigate cases where new evidence has become available, such as a witness coming forward, if she believes that it suggests that a grave or exceptional offence has been committed.
<P>
Where a case concerns a crime that has not previously been dealt with or where there is new evidence—this shows how broad the exceptions are—the Government believe that the ombudsman, as the new body charged with dealing with complaints, should be able to decide how it should be investigated. The regulations provide for that and aim to give her the widest possible discretion to deal with cases that need to be tackled, without opening the way for her to be inundated with requests to rake over cases that have already been dealt with.
<P>
That approach has been discussed with the ombudsman and she is comfortable with it. I repeat my opening comment: this is about a new beginning in policing. The ombudsman is clear about her main function, although I do not speak for her in this respect. The tenor of our discussions, however, has been about a new beginning. If she is constantly dragged back into the past, it might detract from our trying to develop that new future. We believe that that would be inimical to what Patten set out in his report and would not be helpful in trying to establish the new future for policing in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Does the Minister know whether the ombudsman wishes to have greater powers than the regulations permit? What is her opinion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Discussions between the ombudsman and the Government would have to be protected—only she can articulate her view. The regulations have been drafted in line with her views and she is comfortable with her powers retrospectively to consider matters. The regulations allow her a wider remit in grave and exceptional circumstances. She is satisfied with what we are doing and the regulations are in any event open to examination. If hon. Members wish to comment on the proposal, we would have to take account of that, before consulting the ombudsman on whether she was comfortable with such suggestions. So it is not a closed book; we have given a precise definition of the general way in which her approach should be applied, while leaving a capability for examining the past in grave and exceptional circumstances.
<P>
We have married the desire to achieve a new future to the recognition that past matters may require further examination, on the basis of new evidence and on specific grounds. The regulations seek to provide for that. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister has said several times in our debate, and in his comments on amendment No. 55, that a line should be drawn under the past. His colleague the Under-Secretary has also made that comment. The past exists and its consequences continue. It may be—we do not know until it happens—that some happening, event, misdemeanour or gross negligence that occurred in the immediate past is worthy of investigation. I find it hard to accept the notion that such investigation is allowable elsewhere but not here.
<P>
Secondly, there is a continuing theme that we cannot trust to the good judgment of the people we appoint to those important positions. We would be well served in many respects by most of the points that have been made but the responses seem to have missed the aim of the amendment. It is worth quoting the amendment again. It states that

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any regulations under subsection (2A) shall include an exception permitting the Ombudsman to accept any complaint or investigate any matter which he otherwise could not investigate by virtue of said regulations where in the opinion of the Ombudsman there are exceptional reasons relating to public interest to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not giving anyone a blank cheque in terms of inquiries. A responsible occupant of the office of ombudsman would treat his or her responsibilities under the amendment seriously and would act only in exceptional circumstances relating to the public interest. I do not see what is dangerous or offensive about the amendment and I invite the Committee to consider it favourably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have tried to set out our recognition that the past exists. That is why we have provided for that exceptional allowance, which in the first year goes back to 24 months and thereafter to 12 months. That is wholly consistent with any other post of ombudsman that has been established. We respect the judgment of the ombudsman as much as that of any other ombudsman who has been appointed, but we are allowing for exceptional circumstances. Indeed, what we establish may be a form of protection for the new post. I have been living with the post of ombudsman since I first introduced it in the 1998 Act. The post does not emerge from Patten; the Government introduced it in the 1998 Act, where we tried to define its parameters. The development of that post was then picked up in Patten and has been further refined and defined.
<P>
Members of the Committee must recognise—I know that my hon. Friend would recognise it—that there are people who may want to rake over the past and forget about building the future. We do not have the perfect society in Northern Ireland—or, indeed, anywhere—and some people might use that office for their own reasons. The ombudsman must therefore have some parameters within which to operate. The provision will give her protection in making a judgment that is consistent with the law and the power that she has been given. It will allow her to get on with the job of looking to the future to deal with the new policing environment, in which she will be responsible for dealing with complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Does the Minister not believe that it would be appropriate and proper in exceptional circumstances, and for exceptional causes in the public interest, to allow the ombudsman to investigate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That has not been ruled out, but it has been defined, which will offer the ombudsman protection and allow her to point to the parameters of her power, so that if grave and exceptional circumstances or new evidence are involved, or if the case touches on a grave and exceptional issue, she may proceed. If the power were left open-ended and we provided a blank cheque, she would be obliged to respond to every case brought to her attention, and while trying to look to the future she would be trapped in the past, because so many people will want to drag her into examining its entrails.
<P>
The Patten report contains a vision for the future, in which the ombudsman plays a part, but we are allowing the recognition that, although the past may require consideration, a proven case must be involved. On that basis, we believe that we are giving the ombudsman a powerful remit. We are effectively covering my hon. Friend's points but are defining the matter differently.

<P>
Question, proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I welcome the clause. Many people will be happy that the Government have decided to set up a Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross foundation to honour the sacrifices and achievements of the RUC. What input will the public have in the foundation? Will it be merely a police organisation controlled by the Chief Constable, or will an interest be vested in the public to give them an input in its workings? Many people in Northern Ireland will welcome the clause. It is a provision to be proud of.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his acceptance. He speaks for the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland in recognising the importance of the clause. Regulations will have to be made under the clause and we will take on board any representations that are made to us in advance of that. If the hon. Gentleman, individually, on behalf of his party or any section of the community, wishes to make suggestions, we shall consider them, because we want to ensure that the foundation receives the recognition that it deserves.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not want to answer specifics but I want to say, in general, that we would welcome any good ideas that people may have on how best to take matters forward. The measure is a new concept. It is based on the fact that the RUC has received the just reward and honour of being granted the George Cross. We must ensure that the maximum impact and benefit flow from the foundation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Given his wide discussions with other political parties, can the Minister say whether the clause has the approval of the majority of official parties in the Province?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I would not discuss in Committee the detail of my discussions with other political parties, not even those that I have had with the hon. Gentleman's party, because sometimes such discussions reach a conclusion where matters have not moved forward, although that may be an agreed position. If political parties or individuals have views on the provision, we shall listen to them. We shall talk to police associations, because the clause is targeted towards the recognition of what their members have done over the years, just as we will talk to the Chief Constable, who has the prime interest in the matter. We must ensure that the measure is a substantial recognition of the RUC.
<P>
The Chief Constable has said that the foundation is a positive and significant development, as have the widows associations and the disabled police officers association with which I have had many dealings. Organisations within the police family will undoubtedly have views on the matter, but that will not preclude others from commenting on it. If people offer positive and constructive suggestions, the Government will be happy to take them into the police family to show that wider views have been canvassed and ask whether such suggestions are consistent with what we want to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> In light of the Minister's response, I can certainly—at least on this particular clause—support the provision.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
