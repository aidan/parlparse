<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemption for certain other agreements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I 
apologise for transgressing the rules of order earlier, and 
shall now endeavour to make the speech that I would have 
otherwise made, but shall remain in order.
<P>
I hope not to detain the Committee too long, but I have 
been prompted to speak by the Minister's reply and on 
reading once again the notes on clauses and article 88. It is 
clear, as the Minister helpfully explained, that the intention 
of the clause is to make certain that, when there is no 
corresponding EC regulation that deals with a sector, 
national authorities, by virtue of article 88, are enjoined to 
make provision for the control of anti-competitive 
agreements in accordance with the provisions of article 85.
<P>
That seems slightly curious. Is the clause necessary? In 
the absence of the clause, would article 88 not still have 
force, requiring national authorities to operate in relation 
to sectors that are not covered by EC regulations in the 
character of article 85? In the rest of the Bill, the 
prohibition is designed to achieve an article 85-style 
prohibition that applies within the United Kingdom in the 
same way as in relation to any other sector of industry. 
Therefore, although a sector such as the air transport 
industry may not be covered by the regulation, in so far 
at it is covered by the prohibition in the United Kingdom, 
it would clearly be covered by the article 85-style 
prohibition rendered in clause 2.
<P>
I am therefore at a loss to understand why clause 11 is 
necessary. In the absence of clause 11, would an article 
85-style prohibition none the less be given effect in 
relation to any sector, including those that were not 
already covered by EC regulations? Stemming from that, 
if the Minister explains that, in the absence of clause 11, 
there would be a problem about jurisdiction, why is there 
no corresponding provision relating to article 86 and the 
chapter II prohibition? I do not see one.
<P>
If there is a difficulty in the application of article 88 in 
relation to the chapter I prohibition, why is there not a 
corresponding difficulty in relation to article 86 and the 
chapter II prohibition? Article 88 applies to the article 86 
and chapter II prohibition in exactly the same way as it 
does to article 85 and the chapter I prohibition. I am not 
sure that Ministers can have it both ways. Question number one is, what would happen if the clause were not 
there, and why do we need it? Question number two is 
that if it is necessary, and if there is a justification for 
that, why is there no corresponding clause that deals with 
chapter II prohibition and article 86?



<P>
<B></B><P>
The Minister of State, Department of Trade and 
Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney): The hon. Gentleman has 
tried to target his remarks and narrow down on the 
dartboard of the two parts of the clause. His opening 
remarks were fair and reflected the process between 
articles 85 and 88. The Commission cannot apply article 
85, and therefore cannot grant an exemption either. The 
hon. Gentleman is therefore right about the process. 
However, he went on to say that he is not arguing against 
the concept of the clause, but is trying to say that the 
wording is unnecessary.
<P>
The clause is an extension of the parallel exemption 
provision in clause 10 to those sectors of the economy for 
which no regulations give the Commission power to apply 
article 85. It does therefore fit if clauses 10 and 11 are 
linked together.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Lansley: Does the Minister argue that, because 
there are no regulations in relation to some sectors of 
industry and therefore no community exemptions, there 
will be no parallel exemptions as a consequence? Does 
the clause therefore give the Secretary of State the ability 
to make parallel exemptions in relation to those sectors, 
notwithstanding that there is no EC regulation? In the 
absence of the clause, would it not be perfectly easy none 
the less to use the clauses relating to individual and block 
exemptions rather than relying on parallel exemptions?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: You are really making the point 
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Chairman: Order. The Chair is getting rather 
enmeshed in the debate when the Minister refers to "you"	.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. You are 
quite right to rap my knuckles for making such a heinous 
error after 11 years. I lie prostrate and apologise 
profusely. [Interruption.] It makes no difference. As the 
hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) knows well, 
there is nothing wrong with small packages.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's query was that if it applied in 
respect of article 85 why not article 86. The reason is 
simple. Article 86 is available to the commission and 
article 85 is not. I hope that that explains the situation.
I have taken on board the hon. Gentleman's comments 
and I will reflect on them.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Requests for Director to examine agreements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 9, in page 7, line 43, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Director may not charge a fee in respect of applications 
for informal guidance under this Act.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
amendment No. 78, in clause 13, page 8, line 22, at end 
insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The Director may not charge for guidance under this 
section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Basically, this concerns the director 
general's guidance. We have established over the course 
of considering the Bill that there will be a complete 
change in the competition law and that, with the best will 
in the world, and even with the Minister's assurances that 
it will affect only those companies who are engaged in 
anti-competitive action, large numbers of people might be 
affected and might therefore reasonably wish to seek the 
director general's guidance.
<P>
We do not know, and the Minister may hazard a guess 
on this, how many persons will apply for guidance. But 
clearly it is sensible that anyone who applies to the 
director general for an examination will require guidance 
on it. That must be done professionally. It cannot just be 
done in two minutes over the phone, as those of us who 
have briefed Ministers in the past have done. It is a serious 
and quasi-legal procedure. It is then set out and explicated 
in the subsequent clauses.



<P>
There is a basic point of principle here. I do not want 
to pin the Minister too hard tonight. He may not want to 
give a definitive answer. The basic point at principle is 
that if businesses are acting in good faith, and a referral 
of an agreement to the director general by parties to that 
agreement to seek guidance amounts to an act of good 
faith, they will wish to know whether they are covered by 
the law.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham 
(Mr. Redwood) said today in an earlier debate, where 
there is a slight dissonance between article 85 cases and 
chapter I cases it could be extremely complicated. They 
could be right on the border line of interpretation if not 
of substance. We feel and hope that the Committee 
agrees that if the procedure of agreement is referred to 
the director general for guidance, no fee should be 
attached to it. The Minister may want to give us an 
assurance or explain the basis on which a decision will be 
determined. It is important for the Committee to reach an 
understanding about it.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: The amendments would contradict 
the policy behind clause 53, which will permit the director 
to make rules for the charging of fees for the exercise of 
functions specified in the rules. It is sensible to have that 
provision in the Bill. Where a genuine service is being 
provided and has to be provided by the public sector, there 
is a case for charging fees. It may help the hon. Gentleman 
if I say that the guidance put out by the director general 
is out for consultation, so fees are part of the overall 
consultation process. No decisions have yet been taken 
about whether fees should be charged; I do believe, 
however, that that option should be available.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham): I note the Minister's 
caution in the light of the conflict that might otherwise 
arise when we reach later parts of the Bill. However, I am 
genuinely concerned about the notion that, in requesting 
guidance and advice from the director, a business should be obliged to incur a fee. The director is a public servant 
and his advice should be available without any fee being 
charged. I remain open-minded and I ask the Minister 
whether his Department, in recommending fees, has acted 
on the basis of precedent in other fields of public policy 
with which the director is involved? Is there a precedent 
for it in other circumstances?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that 
question. There is indeed a precedent and I have to admit 
that I took it from the previous Conservative Government. 
I cite the regulation of investment business under the 
Financial Services Act 1986 and also the draft Bill 
published in October 1996, which contained similar 
powers in clause 53. We have followed through those 
processes established under the previous Administration.
<P>
I am not making a party-political point: it is an 
administrative issue about a regulatory regime. It is well 
established that, in some instances, costs of administration 
have to be borne by those subject to it. We are simply 
providing for the capacity to do that. However, before we 
do so, we are going out to consultation and no final 
decision has been made about whether fees will be 
charged or about the appropriate level of fees. We are 
being eminently reasonable.

<B></B><P>
Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh): I noted carefully that 
the Minister said that the consultation process is in hand 
and that it will consider whether a fee should be charged 
as well as the level of fees. I want to press the Minister 
on the matter. Would he not agree that it is important for 
small firms not to be discouraged from seeking guidance 
from the director? What consideration is he giving to the 
level of fees that should be charged for providing advice 
and to the monitoring of the efficiency with which such 
advice may be given? What level of fees does he believe 
that small businesses could bear without being 
discouraged from seeking guidance? That is a crucial 
issue.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: That is a good question, which is 
why I said that no decisions have been made on those 
matters. It is important to go through the consultation 
process and come to decisions only at the end of it. Even 
after that, decisions will be subject by order to the 
Secretary of Sate's approval under clause 51.
<P>
Under the powers in clause 53, fees could be levied on 
a flat rate or by reference to an undertaking's ability to 
pay. Consultation allows for different measures and those 
involved in consultation will be asked for their opinions 
about the best means of proceeding. That is the whole 
purpose of consultation.



<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bewcow: I am happy to concede that there could 
be merit in a fee system if its purpose was twofold to 
defray costs and to deter vexatious or frivolous requests 
for guidance. I ask the Minister to place it on record that 
he recognises the difference between that and allowing 
vast sums of money to accumulate in the director 
general's office in the performance of those functions. 
Does the Minister agree that we should not allow a 
revenue producing monopoly to develop?

<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman should know by 
now that he should not to walk into a sucker punch.
I made it absolutely clear that no decisions have yet been 
made, and that we are in the process of consultation. The 
hon. Gentleman surely does not expect me to pre-empt 
those consultations but it was a nice try. I have given 
assurances, and I ask the hon. Member for Daventry
(Mr. Boswell) to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We have 
had a useful exchange of views the Minister's response 
was complemented by the contribution of my hon. Friend 
the Member for Buckingham and the hon. Member for 
Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). They have homed in on the main 
points of concern.
<P>
No one wants a lot of piffling little agreements that 
have no relevance to the process. They will clog up the 
process further than is required to discharge the intentions 
of the Bill and the responsibilities of business. Equally, 
the Minister rightly said that he would wish to given 
sensitive consideration to the scale and appropriateness of 
serious cases for instance, whether they should be 
flat-rate, or scaled to ability to pay or the value of the 
undertakings. That helps to meet our worries about small 
business.
<P>
I wish to mention one other matter. I am not sure 
whether I need a formal undertaking from the Minister. If 
I read the financial memorandum correctly, the extra 
overall cost to the Competition Commission will be about 
£6.5 million per annum. Scaling that against the 
compliance costs, which are set in relation to business 
under the Minister's estimate, and which we regard as 
somewhat implausible, it is in the public interest that a 
Treasury-driven device is not undertaken whereby 
industry would effectively be required to pay for the 
Competition Commission.
<P>
We have had a useful dialogue. I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Notification for guidance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in 
page 8, line 5, leave our `may' and insert `shall within 
30 days'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this it will be convenient to 
discuss the following amendments: No 110, in page 8, 
line 5, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 112, in clause 14, page 8, line 27, leave out `may' 
and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 113, in clause 22, page 12, line 2, leave out `may' 
and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 114, in clause 23, page 12, line 9, leave out `may' 
and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Although amendment No. 56 was not 
tabled in my name, I certainly associate myself with it. It 
is one of a group of amendments tabled by other members 
of the Committee, but they all relate to how guidance is 
given.
<P>
Justice delayed is justice denied. A decision delayed 
is a decision denied. It is difficult enough for business, 
particularly small businesses and those that do not have 
the support of an elaborate legal staff, to cope with the 
legislation. Applying to the director general for guidance 
and finding that requests were subjected to a substantial 
delay would be the last straw.
<P>
I concede that some cases will be complicated, even 
those involving relatively small undertakings and small 
agreements, but we must emphasise the Minister kindly 
said that the director general will be informed of our 
debate that people should not suffer inordinate delays. 
That is why I emphasise the importance of screening out 
his consideration of such matters whenever possible.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 56 is to elicit a decision 
within 30 days, if possible. That seems to be a sensible 
term of art; I do not want to get hung up on a precise 
date. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to 
the point and to emphasise the importance of a smooth 
process in which businesses know where they are.



<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Chidgey: My thoughts on the amendment follow 
on from the speech of the hon. Member for Daventry. The 
essence of the amendment is the notification for guidance 
from the director general. I am sure that the Minister will 
agree that the ability to seek the director general's 
guidance is fundamental to the ability of firms, especially 
small firms, to understand and, therefore, to fulfil their 
obligations under the Bill. For the good working of the 
Bill and the good order of small firms especially, it is 
important to create competitive, administrative and 
financial stability. That is what most businesses want.
<P>
These amendments those that I tabled would change 
"may"	 to "shall"	 are intended to flag up the danger that, 
if the director general is given broad discretion on 
requests for guidance, some companies might be 
discouraged from seeking the director general's views. 
That might be especially so for small companies, which 
do not have the administrative and legal back-up that 
larger organisations might have. That would leave those 
companies in a position of uncertainty.
<P>
The ability to seek guidance is fundamental in enabling 
small firms to understand and fulfil their obligations with 
certainty bearing in mind that they might be subject to 
large penalties imposed by the director general. It is 
important that the Minister gives an assurance that the 
director general's discretion can be limited, so relieving 
the burden that businesses, especially small businesses, 
will otherwise suffer.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: These fair, probing amendments 
deserve an adequate response, as do those that the hon. 
Member for Eastleigh will move in a few moments. I shall 
have some positive things to say about those amendments 
when we debate them.
<P>
This debate relates to our debate on clause 5 and the 
difficulties of prescribing time scales in the Bill, but, 
nevertheless, it brings us to the crux of some crucial issues. Therefore, as in the debate on clause 5, I shall give 
a detailed response to show that hon. Members' concerns 
will be met in the Bill and in what we intend to do 
following its enactment.
<P>
I appreciate the concern that the director general should 
not delay when giving guidance. It is important that 
businesses and consumers are not kept waiting for long 
periods in respect of decisions and activities in which the 
director general is involved.
<P>
However, it would be dangerous to impose a time limit 
of 30 days on the director general. The hon. Member for 
Daventry was right to say that complex and detailed 
investigations take place, some of which involve difficult 
economic and legal matters. Therefore, the director 
general should not be made to rush into decisions doing 
so could be detrimental to those against whom the 
complaint has been made or to those who are 
complaining. We must get the balance right, which can 
be done without imposing time limits.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bercow: Again, I can see the logic of what the 
Minister says. Clearly, the quality of the decision is more 
importantly ultimately than the speed at which it is 
reached; nevertheless, there must be a balance. If the 
Government are willing to agree that there should be a 
time limit, would they be willing to include in subsequent 
guidance a target time scale within which judgments 
would be expected to be reached?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: I shall deal with that matter later in 
my speech. What I say then might assist the hon. 
Gentleman.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: Perhaps I ask this question a little too 
early. Will the Minister confirm that, in cases in which an 
application has been made but has not yet been 
determined, even if it takes more than 30 days, the 
applicants are protected by subsection (4) from penalty 
during that period?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is 
absolutely right. He is 100 per cent. correct.
<P>
We must also bear in mind that we are in the early 
stages of the new regime. The director general is likely to 
be faced with the need to deal with a large number of 
cases. It would be wise if we recognised that. At this 
stage, the Bill should not specify a period that would have 
to be suitable in all circumstances.
<P>
The Government are determined that the regime 
provided for in the Bill operates efficiently. That is why 
there are provisions that will ensure that when the regime 
is up and running, there will be no undue delay in 
decisions made by the director general.
<P>
Schedules 5 and 6, in their seventh paragraphs, make 
provisions to allow persons aggrieved by the director 
general's failure to determine an application for a 
decision, to apply to a court for directions to secure that 
the application is considered without further delay.
<P>
I also draw the Committee's attention to clause 51, 
which enables the director general to make rules on 
procedural and other matters, and to schedule 9, which elaborates on the type of rules that can be made. 
Paragraph 2(c) of that schedule makes specific reference 
to the possibility of rules making provisions for 
applications whether for guidance or for a decision to 
be dealt with in accordance with a timetable. That goes to 
the heart of the hon. Member for Buckingham's remarks 
about the potential for timetables. The Government have 
made provision for that.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that we expect the 
rules to cover a timetable, when the new regime has been 
bedded down. I think that all hon. Members would agree 
about the matter in principle. The timing of the regime 
should ensure that the implementation strategy is 
non-disruptive. It should take account of the needs of the 
director general in carrying out his or her duties and 
provide a balance so that rushed and possibly defective 
decisions are not made. All members of the Committee 
seem to share a similar view about the various pillars that 
are needed to support the new regime.
<P>
Furthermore, the new regime would be damaged if we 
were to remove the director general's discretion about 
whether to give guidance or a decision. In some cases, the 
issues might not be black or white. In particular, in cases 
of guidance, the application will not be published and the 
director general will have no opportunity to consider the 
views of third parties about an agreement, even if they 
were aware of it. It would be quite wrong to tie the 
director general down by forcing him to give guidance. 
Even in regard to a decision, the director general might 
feel that he had insufficient information on which to 
decide. Business might even find that the director general 
was more inclined to take the view that an agreement 
might infringe a prohibition if his or her discretion were 
removed.
<P>
The Government do not want a situation in which the 
director general has to take up a safety-first attitude, in 
the way that I have described. We want to ensure that 
there is flexibility, so that the director general has the 
capacity to seek out all the facts and makes a decision 
that is based on those facts.
<P>
Current European practice is unsatisfactory. The 
Government intend to improve on it in our domestic 
legislation. If parties have an agreement that infringes the 
prohibition and they need a formal exemption decision, 
the Bill is designed to ensure that they receive such a 
decision in a timely manner.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to persuade hon. Members 
that we share the same principles in discussing these 
processes. We need to ensure that an implementation 
strategy is established so that we reach the objectives that 
we share. My contributions, and those of Opposition 
Members, have sought to achieve that in some form.

<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: The Minister has done his best to be 
helpful and I do not want to press the matter at this stage.
<P>
However, I should like to draw the Committee's 
attention to one general point, in what is almost a dialogue 
with the director general. The process will be front-end 
loaded, although we might differ about its extent, its likely 
impact on business, or the amount of aggravation that it 
might cause. It is new legislation, so there will be a 
learning curve for the director general and for businesses when dealing with him. There will be time for a precedent 
to build up and for the director general to say that a certain 
case was like the one that he dealt with the previous 
month and to explain the outcome of that case. It will also 
be a learning curve for trade associations when advising 
their members on how such matters are determined.



<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As happens so often with a new organisation, be it the 
Crown Prosecution Service or the Child Support Agency, 
there is an element of getting the process off the ground 
on the right note. If it does not get off the ground on the 
right note, it is difficult, as one of the examples shows, 
ever to claw it back. The director general and the 
Competition Commission will want to be on top of the 
process from day one. They may need additional members 
of staff at the beginning, but such staff will not be able to 
catch hold of a precedent and be familiar with it.
<P>
People will be trained to start a process, not trained to 
carry it on. That will be difficult. My comments are not 
meant to derogate what the Minister says. Naturally, he 
can come back to me about the issue and I should be 
delighted if he did. It is of common interest to the 
Committee as well as to the process and the business to 
get details well understood from the start and plan for 
their resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair 
point, which is why we forecast in the explanatory 
memorandum to the Bill the additional annual figure of 
£6.5 million to resource adequately the director general's 
office, as well as a net increase in the director's staff of 
about 50. In the planning stages, we made sure that there 
is adequate financial and physical resources to enable the 
job to be done effectively and professionally.
<P>

amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the decision of the Director is made available to the parties 
concerned.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> In many ways, the amendments continue 
our debate on the previous amendments to which the 
Minister has responded. However, it is worth the 
Committee's time to probe a little further. Our proposals 
are designed to remove uncertainty, particularly for the 
small businesses that I prayed in aid earlier. Under the 
Bill, no penalty is to be imposed for an infringement of 
prohibition by an agreement that occurs from the date 
when the notification was given and ends on the date 
when the application was determined.
<P>
It may seem a tiny point on which to question the 
Minister, but the date on which the application is 
determined in the Office of Fair Trading may be in 
advance of the news leaking out. It was interesting that 
the hon. Member for Daventry referred to the CSA and I 
am sure that all members of the Committee will know
the problems that can arise with an understaffed, 
inexperienced and underfunded organisation. We all know 
from our constituency surgeries what happens then a 
Government agency cannot perform the functions that it 
was set up to perform whatever the policies or politics 
of the Government at the time.
<P>
The Bill will create uncertainty, with the effect of 
financial and legal instability for companies. As drafted, 
there is uncertainty in respect of the point at which 
penalties may be imposed for infringement during the 
notification period. The amendment would place the onus 
on the director general not to sit on a decision and to 
ensure that action should not take place until that decision 
is notified to the interested parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Member for Cities of 
London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) Sought my help 
and guidance in our previous sitting with regard to 
correspondence between the Lord Chancellor's office and 
the Home Department. Being a bit of a Sherlock Holmes, 
I have traced it and the right hon. Gentleman should be 
getting a reply shortly. The bill is in the post.
<P>
I return to this Bill. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of schedule 5 
provide that when determining an application for guidance 
or a decision, the director general must follow such 
procedure as specified in his rules. His draft rules 
currently provide that on determining an application for 
guidance or a decision, he must give notice of the 
guidance or the decision to the applicant in writing.
<P>
As penalties may be imposed following a 
determination, I can see that it may be necessary to 
provide comfort that there will not be a long delay 
between the date when the application is determined and 
the date when the applicant is given notice of the guidance 
or decision. I believe, therefore, that there is a good case 
for the finalised rules to make it clear that on determining 
an application, the director general shall, without delay, 
give notice of it to the applicant. The rules will, of course, 
have to be approved by the Secretary of State under clause 
51. I should add that I cannot envisage the director general 
imposing penalties before someone has received notice of 
that determination. An attempt to do so might be regarded 
by the court as unreasonable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh makes the not 
unreasonable point that the Bill should ensure that a party 
is not liable to penalty until the director general's decision 
is made known to him. It is unlikely that the director 
general would penalise someone before the guidance or a 
decision has been made available to him. Without giving 
an absolutely guaranteed copper-bottomed commitment to 
table an amendment, I shall consider the matter and will 
return to it on Report. The hon. Member for Eastleigh 
makes a fair point and if he accepts my remarks in good 
faith, he may consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and </B><P>
Westminster): It would be churlish not to thank the Minister for what he has done. He referred to Sherlock Holmes, who resided at 22lb Great Baker street, which is just outside my constituency. The Baker street 
irregulars were clearly my constituents and I am happy to 
regard the Minister in his new capacity as an honorary 
constituent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister called upon me to exercise 
good faith, and how could I refuse? I found his remarks 
extremely reassuring and I look forward to his proposals 
on Report. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I want to ask the Minister a question. It 
may be a linguistic point, so I hope you will forgive me 
if I stray into pedantry, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Surely not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It may seem unlikely to those who have 
not heard me often in the past, but for those who were 
present for the National Minimum Wage Bill, it will come 
as no surprise.
<P>
Clause 14(2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Director may make a decision as to...whether the Chapter I 
prohibition has been infringed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the director general concludes that the chapter I 
prohibition has not been infringed, subsection (2)(b) 
appears to provide that he must choose whether it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is because of the effect of an exclusion or because the agreement 
is exempt from the prohibition."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is entirely possible that the director general may 
conclude at that point that the prohibition has not been 
infringed because the agreement does not meet the criteria 
in the clause referring to the fundamental elements of the 
prohibition. Am I simply reading the provision wrongly 
as is entirely possible or would it be clearer to state that 
the director general may decide that the prohibition has 
not been infringed because the fundamental criteria 
involved in doing so have not been satisfied? There is 
then a consequence for clause 16, but we have not reached 
that point yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. member for South 
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) is, as he says, carrying on 
where he left off on the Committee considering the 
National Minimum Wage Bill. I will have to have a word 
with the hon. member for Westmorland and Lonsdale 
(Mr. Collins), if the hon. Gentleman keeps following me 
around asking me deliberately awkward questions. 
However, I will try to assist him somehow.
<P>
The clause prevents a penalty being imposed under the 
prohibition in respect of any infringement of the chapter 
I prohibition by a notified agreement between the date of 
its notification and the date on which the application is 
determined. The power for the director general to decide 
whether an agreement infringes the prohibition and to 
grant an individual exemption is, of course, a crucial 
element of the Bill. It will enable businesses to seek the 
director general's decision on the application of the 
chapter I prohibition to their agreements and, if needed, 
an exemption decision. The director general can decide 
whether an agreement has infringed the chapter I 
prohibition, and, if it has not, whether that is because the 
agreement is exempt.
<P>
The comments of the hon. Member for South 
Cambridgeshire are well chosen the director general 
may decide that an agreement does not infringe the 
prohibition because it is not anti-competitive; the power 
is discretionary.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in 
page 9, line 38, leave out `does not infringe' and insert 
`has not infringed'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
Government amendments Nos. 90, 94, 95 and 97 to 99.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The principal purpose of the 
amendments is to make it clear that if an agreement or 
course of conduct has infringed a chapter I or chapter II 
prohibition, as the case may be, but has come to an end, 
the director general can still penalise a person for 
infringement. Clearly, it would be no deterrent if an 
infringer were to escape penalties merely by bringing the 
agreement or the conduct to an end. Proceedings relating 
to past activities are by no means uncommon in the EC 
system. For example, the European Court of Justice is 
currently considering a major case on liner conferences in 
which the agreement in question came to an end some 
time ago.
<P>
That clarification is achieved by Government 
amendments Nos. 94 and 95, which substitute "has 
infringed"	 for "infringes"	 in subsections (1) and (2) of 
clause 37, which empowers the director general to impose 
penalties. When the director general is contemplating 
imposing a penalty, he must consider past infringement 
whether infringement is continuing will make no 
difference.
<P>
The remainder of the amendments are either directly 
consequent upon that change or as a result of the review 
that we carried out on the tense used in the Bill in relation 
to a prohibition being infringed. We concluded that we 
should make a few changes for the sake of consistency. For example, in clause 16(1) and clause 25(1), "does not infringe"	 should read "has not infringed"	 if the provision 
is to match that of clause 14(2), clause 23(2), clause 26 
(1) and clause 32(1). That is achieved by amendments 
Nos. 89 and 90.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand 
part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I know that the question I want to raise 
was dealt with on a previous clause, but it arises on this 
clause as well. The director general must have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable suspicion that the information on which he based his 
decision was incomplete, false or misleading in a material 
particular."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Has the Minister given any thought to whether 
"reasonable suspicion"	 is a sufficient test? The word 
"reasonable"	 would not be necessary if the Bill used the 
word "satisfied"	. The word "suspicion"	, however, requires 
the use of the word "reasonable"	. The phrase "reasonable 
suspicion"	 will not provide a sufficient test if, on the basis 
of that, the director general can remove immunity and 
expose people to considerable penalties. Will the Minister 
consider strengthening the test?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. 
The Government think that the wording and the test are 
sufficient to ensure that the director general will be able 
to effectively investigate complaints if he has reasonable 
suspicion or reasonable grounds to do so.
<P>
In a previous debate, I set out in detail the checks and 
balances in the system. When the director general decides 
that there is reasonable suspicion, he must notify the 
parties and give adequate notice. The parties will then be 
able to make representations to the director general. If he 
feels that those representations are fair and that his 
suspicions have been allayed, he can change his mind and 
take no action. However, he feels that there is still 
reasonable suspicion, he will provide notice in writing.
<P>
When my note is made available to members of the 
Committee, it may assist them to understand the process. 
Until matters are set out, it is always difficult to consider 
the minutiae and ensure that the checks and balances are 
right. I think that we have got them right, but we shall 
return to this issue on later amendments that will flush out 
even more of the issues regarding the test.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have an agricultural background and I 
have often seen the fall of the hammer, but I have never 
seen such a dramatic last-minute intervention as that made 
by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. 
We were informed by it. We must look carefully at the 
small print. Although, with the exception of two Labour 
Members, we are not professionally qualified as lawyers, 
we should do that in the spirit of friendly laity if that is 
the right word and try to get the details right.
<P>
Schedules 5 and 6 are twins and they relate to the 
notification procedures under the two chapters. I have 
studied them and, as far as I can see, they diverge only to 
the extent that they serve slightly different requirements 
under both chapters.
<P>
My remarks will be directed at the amendments, but 
will the Minister pick up on the slightly strange reference 
made in paragraph 5(2)? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director must arrange for the application to be 
publishedunless he is satisfied that it will be sufficient for him to 
seek information from one or more particular persons than the 
applicant."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I imagine that, in such cases, there are only two or three 
players. It is easy to identify parties that might have an 
interest and to contact them, rather than put it in the 
London Gazette at some public expense. Perhaps the 
Minister can tidy that up.
<P>
This clutch of amendments, to which I am sure hon. 
Members will want to speak, includes some from rather 
different provenances. The amendments in my name have, 
unusually, an impeccable provenance. In this case, we are 
not thinking on our own, but are relying on the joint 
working party of the Law Society and Bar Council than 
whom there can be few more august bodies in these 
matters. To diverge for only a few more sentences, I recall 
a famous occasion when I was an Education Minister and 
had in my room, discussing student support, the president 
of the Law Society and the chairman of the Bar Council. 
I remember saying that I wondered how much that would 
cost at full commercial rates. They had given their 
services free and pro bono publico to make some 
suggestions.
<P>
My knowledge of the law is imperfect, but broadly 
along the right lines. To anticipate a possible criticism, I 
do not feel that it is informed by naked interest. Clearly, 
an oral hearing takes time and requires extra costs. 
However, in the interests of justice, when businesses are 
to be subject to procedures and penalties, they should have 
their chance, or, as the saying goes, "their day in court"	, 
as they would want.
<P>
I should like to refer to a case about which I feel sorry, 
although I shall not give the Committee details. I have a 
constituent who has, sadly, lost his business through a 
legal process, with which he is extremely dissatisfied. He 
explained to me at some length that he finds it difficult to 
deal with documents. He is not unintelligent, but because of dyslexia or some other condition, he finds the business 
of going through documents difficult. He can make 
representations, but may find it easier to make informal 
explanations

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if it were 
sufficient to rest on the text of documents only, we would 
not have to rely on the Minister's helpful explanations? It 
would all be set out in the notes on clauses, and we would 
be satisfied with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is my point. We are playing with 
the idea of giving people as many fair chances as possible 
to get a fair hearing.
<P>
Without having a row I believe that a row is currently 
in progress in another Committee although Hansard is 
extremely interesting and often better articulated than 
even the Minister, let alone myself, could have achieved 
on our own, it does not always capture the feeling of cut 
and thrust in debate, which is important on such issues, 
on which the Minister is anxious to respond.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 is designed to provide for an oral 
procedure as an option for parties. A further amendment 
No. 131 which, as the Minister will have picked up, is 
rather anonymous relates to the points that we discussed 
earlier about guidance, time periods and the time for 
investigations. The Minister has responded to those 
already 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend believe that in 
making representations in circumstances such as he has 
described, and for which the amendment provides, the 
person or persons involved should be able to be 
accompanied by legal advisers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That must be implicit in what I have said. 
We should so provide. The Minister nods on that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 127 gets to the decision point and 
hangs on clause 32. It is important, because it is at that 
point that the law begins to bite.
<P>
The amendments are low key. They come from a good 
source and tell the Minister and the director general that 
everyone should be given an opportunity for a fair 
hearing. That would not frustrate or prolong the 
procedure, but it would allow people to feel that the issues 
have been addressed seriously and dealt with fairly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I will add briefly to the comments made 
by the hon. Member for Daventry, especially in relation 
to amendment No. 142. I, too, have received advice from 
an august and robust body of lawyers, the Law Society of 
Scotland. It has taken the matter equally seriously, and 
it has made comments with a sincerity and with a lack 
of self-interest.
<P>
We are anxious that the application process may be 
openended. Amendment No. 142 would establish a 
timetable for the process. It specifies that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Director shall set out a timetable within which all 
applications will be considered and the court shall assess the 
application of any person aggrieved against the timetable."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that that sounds rather onerous. However, given 
the context of what is a probing amendment, the Minister 
will see the sense of the proposals made by the Law 
Society of Scotland, and may be able to give us 
reassurance.
<P>
It is important that the new regime should operate 
according to a timetable so that delays encountered at the 
level of the European Commission in the application of 
article 85 are not replicated domestically. We have all 
heard horror stories of what has happened previously.



<P>
The amendment proposes a timetable to be achieved in 
all cases. Under the current regime, that would apply to 
mergers. The court would be able to assess whether there 
was a reason why the timetable may not have been met 
in particular cases. Including a provision that allows 
remedy for excessive delay is insufficient, as that places 
an additional cost and onus on the party that is seeking 
a decision.
<P>
That is the basis of our amendment, and we would be 
interested to hear the Minister's response to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to add 
a little in support of the amendments tabled by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Daventry. Indeed, amendments 
Nos. 159 to 162 to schedule 6 which I tabled, mirror those 
that my hon. Friend moved to schedule 5.
<P>
There are three arguments for accepting the 
amendments. First, the director general may intend to set 
out his procedure and, under certain circumstances, to 
afford an oral hearing to the parties concerned. However, 
it would be beneficial to set out that procedure in 
legislation. Secondly, we seek consistency between the 
proposed legislation and that which applies in the 
European Community. Will the Minister tell us to what 
extent the right of an oral hearing exists in relation to 
notification for a decision from the EC Commission on 
article 85 and 86 prohibitions?
<P>
Thirdly, affording a right of an oral hearing is not 
simply a matter of justice being seen to be done; it will 
also encourage notification. Parties to an agreement 
should be encouraged to notify, if the Bill is to work. 
They should not wait until an aggrieved party seeks a 
decision from the director general. Those who enter into 
agreements should have confidence in notifying the 
director general. For reasons explained by my hon. Friend, 
people will feel more confident if they can not only notify 
the director general in writing, but be able to amplify their 
case by way of an oral hearing.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It seems desirable that the parties should have 
confidence in the director general's decisions, as that will 
result in relatively few appeals. I imagine that appeals to 
the Competition Commission are likely to be the most 
time consuming procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> And the most expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend prompts me to say that 
if lawyers are involved, they will probably be the most 
expensive procedure.
<P>
The informality of an oral hearing with the director 
general might make the parties feel that they have the 
opportunity to air their questions and express their 
grievances; metaphorically, they will have had their day 
in court. Those parties who have had the opportunity to 
express themselves as they think fit will, as a result, feel 
much less inclined to believe that if only they had had the 
opportunity to express themselves to the director general 
or his staff, all would have been clear and they would not 
have needed to appeal. Otherwise, they may go to appeal.
<P>
For all those reasons, it seems desirable that we should 
pursue the option set out in the amendment of including 
in the schedule a right to an oral hearing.



<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Brooke: The Law Society is based in my 
constituency, and at least half the Bar are my constituents. 
I apologise that I was not in the Room when the hon. 
Member for Eastleigh alluded to amendment No. 142, but 
he will know, as I do, that it came from the Law Society 
of Scotland. Although it did not satisfy the hon. Members 
for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) and for Isle 
of Wight yesterday on the subject of notaries public, it 
nevertheless reinforces the authority of the amendments.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire 
alluded to the value of the Minister being present because 
we shall not need to rely on the notes on clauses. I shall 
use a different analogy it will be familiar to all members 
of the Committee that of conducting constituency 
surgeries. I have no idea what experience other hon. 
Members have, but my experience is that although they 
are not an efficient way of doing business, they are widely 
valued by the constituents who attend them, because they 
feel that they have had their day in court.
<P>
In my experience, in only one case in every 1,000 does 
one learn more than one would have learned if the person 
attending the surgery had set the problem out on paper. 
Nevertheless, it is a valued safety valve. It will rapidly 
become apparent to whoever conducts the oral 
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Lansley: Does my right hon. Friend agree that 
although he gives a right to any constituent to make a 
surgery appointment, as do I, that right is rarely abused, 
and that people rarely seek to explain in person something 
that they could equally well have explained in writing?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Brooke: I certainly concur with that. I was about 
to say that the person conducting the hearing in this 
case, the Member of Parliament would find it an 
advantage if the submission was written rather than oral 
if the constituent was suffering from the sort of problem 
referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Daventry, which sometimes involves mental health. It is 
much easier to identify the problem on paper; it takes 
quite a long time with an oral hearing. However, there 
are virtues and benefits to the person conducting the oral 
hearing in understanding the mind set of the person 
bringing the case.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: It has been an interesting and helpful 
short debate. My nightmare would be the hon. Member 
for South Cambridgeshire turning up at my advice centre. 
I would be suicidal if the hon. Member for Buckingham 
were to come with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does the Minister recall that there is a 
term for such visitors in general practice surgeries? They 
are known as heart-sink patients, so I shall be the 
Minister's heart-sink parliamentarian.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: The hon. Gentleman always lifts my 
heart. I think that the hon. Member for Buckingham 
wanted me to give way.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bercow: Not for the moment.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: The hon. Gentleman reserves 
judgment.
<P>
I recognise that the amendments have been drawn up 
by the Bar Council. I am not sure whether that is a perfect 
or imperfect monopoly, but for the purposes of the Bill
I shall try to respond effectively. The issues about 
proper and fair procedures and timeliness in decision 
making are important. I welcome the opportunity to set 
out once again the Government's view that the matters 
are best dealt with under the procedural rules made under 
clause 51. Primary legislation would lead to unwelcome 
inflexibility.



<P>
Several hon. Members raised points with which I want 
to deal. It will be easier if I deal with that raised by the 
hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire in the course of 
my remarks. The analogy used by the hon. Member for 
Daventry in connection with schedule 5(2) is right. The 
director general can identify those who may be affected 
by an agreement and seek their views. He does not need 
to publish the application to seek those views.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh raised an issue about 
schedule 5(7) being inadequate. The right to seek redress 
for undue delays is a backstop. As we discussed earlier, 
the director general's rules are to cover a timetable, once 
the regime has bedded down.
<P>
The Committee discussed earlier, on amendment
No. 13, procedural requirements under the director 
general's rules under clause 51. Schedule 9 elaborates on 
the provisions that may be contained in the rules 
signposting the matters that we consider particularly 
important. The director general must consult on the rules. 
They are subject to the Secretary of State's approval and 
to parliamentary scrutiny by negative resolution. They 
must clearly ensure that parties have a proper opportunity 
to state their case. I should not necessarily expect them to 
confer an absolute right to an oral hearing, although the 
director general might want to permit that if requested.
I think that the hon. Member for Daventry asked about 
that.
<P>
The question needs to be seen in the context of the 
much fuller provision that the Bill makes for appeals at 
community level. Under clause 47, the decisions of the 
director general may be appealed to an appeal tribunal of 
the Competition Commission,. Not only would that confer 
the right to a hearing, it would enable the director 
general's decision to be overturned if the tribunal so 
decided. The appeal would be on the merits of the case; it 
would not be confined to judicial review. That framework 
should ensure a full and fair hearing for the parties. 
Within it, detailed matters should be set out by the 
director general's rules. the circumstances in which oral 
hearings should be held are best covered there.
<P>
As to amendments Nos. 130 and 161, the director 
general would need to consider carefully whether the rules 
should provide for a formal hearing by an independent 
chairman. There are respectable arguments for a 
separation between investigatory and adjudicating 
officers. I am sure that the director general will carefully 
consider the points made in Committee today, and I shall 
be happy to draw them to his attention.
<P>
It should be remembered that the Bill provides the 
safeguard of an appeal for the parties against an 
infringement decision. The effective right of appeal that 
we are providing in the Bill is likely to make the director 
general all the more respectful of the rights of the defence. 
The director general has no interest in his decisions being 
overturned by the competition commission. He will 
therefore wish to ensure that all relevant points are 
considered before a decision is made.



<P>
Amendment No. 131 deals with the timings of the 
director general's decisions. We have already fully 
discussed the issue on amendment No. 56. As I said then, 
provisions will ensure that when the regime is up and 
running there will be no undue delay in decisions being 
made by the director general.
<P>
Even though the timings proposed in the amendment 
are not expressed as absolute time limits, their effect may 
be the same given the requirement for the director general 
to forfeit any fees that might be levied. If the amendment 
were accepted, there would be ample scope for abuse by 
applicants taking the maximum time to respond to 
requests for information, pushing the director general over 
his time limits.
<P>
I hope that my next point relates to that made by the 
hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. If it does not,
I am sure that he will tell me. He referred to parties in 
European Community competition law cases having the 
right to an oral hearing that is chaired by an independent 
officer and to the differences in our proceedings.
<P>
It is not fair to make comparison with proceedings 
before the Commission as the appeal rights under the EC 
system are different. Under the EC competition law 
system, an appeal from the Commission to the courts is 
on judicial review-type grounds. Ours is wider. The court 
cannot substitute its decisions for those of the 
Commission. The specific right to a formal hearing before 
the Commission can be seen as a recognition of that 
limited right of appeal. That is the difference between 
the systems.

<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: As a lay person, it seems that the 
Minister is describing the British system whereby the 
director general's decision is directly appealable against 
and the matter can go to a court that can overturn the 
substance of it. However, the European system is more 
like the other European practice of the advocate general 
whereby a recommendation is made. I am not sure that I 
have it right, but I have tried to produce a helpful analogy. 
I may have confused the Committee but, in the British 
context, the director general's decision can be overturned, 
while the Commission operates as the court of last 
instance and can be overturned only on a point of law.



<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: The hon. Gentleman is bumping 
along the right road, but I shall not follow him down the 
potholes. The key element in our system will be that the appeal is on the merits of the case and all aspects of it 
and is not confined simply to narrow, judicial review 
points as applies under the European system. I might be 
off line here I am not looking at the legal advisers on 
my left but we are attempting to improve the system in 
which appeals are on the merits of a case.
<P>
The circumstances in which an oral hearing should be 
held is dealt with best in the director general's rules. That 
includes any circumstance in which parties would be 
entitled to an oral hearing. The appeals framework under 
the Bill ensures that parties have full and proper rights of 
appeal. The director general's rules go out to consultation 
and, during that process, I am certain that several 
organisations, individuals and stakeholders will also 
submit their views about the process and those views will 
be given due weight. I hope that Opposition Members are 
satisfied that the Government are trying to meet all the 
principal issues that have been raised.
<P>
<B></B><P>
 Mr. Boswell: I am grateful to the Minister. As the past 
few exchanges may have made clear, we sometimes do 
fall down potholes, as he said, but the process of thinking 
our way out of them is instructive. I now understand what 
I wanted to say. The hon. Gentleman described a system 
that will be potentially powerful in resolving such 
difficulties. He has shown some sensitivity to the 
arguments that have been put by us on behalf of learned 
bodies and others. It is important that they are carried 
through into practice.
<P>
The issue is complicated, but it was illumined in the 
real world by some of the exchanges in Committee 
particularly by the contribution of my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. As 
we are anxious to declare interests on these occasions, I 
could say that he is one of my two constituency Members 
of Parliament, although I do not recall having gone to him 
as a heart sink or any other constituent.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bercow: I express solidarity with my hon. Friend 
the Member for Daventry on this point. I am also in the 
peculiarly fortunate position of being represented in my 
Westminster address by my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Cities of London and Westminster than whom there 
could be no better representative in this House.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: Indeed. Flattery will, as they say, take 
one quite a long way in this place.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: I do not want to worry the right hon. 
Member for Cities of London and Westminster, but when 
I personally telephone canvassed the hon. Member for 
Daventry during the general election, he sounded a bit iffy 
and a bit doubtful about his vote.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell rose 
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bercow: Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: No. I have the impression that the 
Chairman is becoming rather tired of this, but it is 
important to put the point on the record. I want to make 
it absolutely clear to my right hon. Friend that I was 
unable to vote for him because I voted for my other Member of Parliament who happens to be myself admittedly a poor imitation. I am not in the habit of 
attending my own surgeries and making complaints to 
myself.



<P>
The material point is that oral procedures provide an 
additional element. They can provide light and shade and 
insight into the mindset of people involved. It would be 
helpful to have them. However, the Minister has provided 
helpful assurances as he has done continuously during the 
afternoon, and I see no reason to press the matter further.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: In response to the hon. Gentleman's 
kind remarks, I can point to another aspect of the problem. 
The director general is subject to what will become the 
Human Rights Act, which will again ensure the rights to a 
fair hearing. Any departure from the convention principle 
would invalidate the rules. I should have advised members 
of the Committee about that important proviso earlier.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Boswell: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 5 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Request for Director to consider conduct</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am learning to be quick off the mark; 
otherwise you will beat me to it, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
I have two questions to ascertain what led to a 
particular construction. The clause refers to when a person 
"thinks"	 a chapter II prohibition may be infringed. Why 
has "thinks"	 as opposed to a stronger term such as 
"believes"	 been adopted? Is not "thinks"	 a curious term 
to use in this context: it is closer to "suggesting"	 rather 
than reaching any settled conclusion abut the matter? One 
would have thought that reaching a settled conclusion was 
more important than thinking something. Secondly, why 
is the provision confined to "that person"	 rather than all 
the parties to an agreement who wish to obtain guidance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On my construction, it seems to be 
designed for self-reference. That is why "thinks"	 appears. 
An individual may be in some doubt about the position 
and would have the ability to refer to the director to have 
the position clarified or regularised.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Lansley: I think that I understand my hon. Friend. 
I shall not delay the Committee because I am sure that 
the Minister is more than adequately equipped to explain 
matters to me. When introducing the question of 
notification, it would have been better at the outset for the 
clause to have something rather stronger than the word 
"thinks"	 and rather wider than simply "that person"	. The 
person who is seeking notification is the one whose own 
conduct might give rise to an abuse of a dominant 
position, but I should have thought that it would be 
reasonable for it to be the people who had a sufficient 
interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bewcow:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that clause 
48 provides for third-party appeals. Is he saying that, 
whereas that later clause provides for that category of 
person in relation to appeals, it is not clear that any part 
of the Bill provides for initial notification of an agreement 
by a third-party? It is curious that clause 21 provides only 
for self-reference, not for reference by others.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Lansley: Absolutely. I agree with my hon. Friend. 
I do not think that clause 48 answers the case because it 
relates to appeals by third parties rather than those who 
are participants. I am aiming at those who are directly 
involved in the abuse of a dominant position or in matters 
of conduct. They should be able to initiate a notification, 
rather than simply appeal against the director general's 
decision.



<P>
As clauses 22 and 23 rest on the gate-keeping clause,
I wonder whether the reference to "conduct to be 
considered"	 should be confined only to the person who 
has thought about his own conduct or whether the matter 
should be the subject of an application by parties on a 
wider basis.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: As the hon. Member for South 
Cambridgeshire says, clause 21 is a gateway clause, 
which introduces clauses 22 and 23, allowing the director 
general to consider conduct on the application of a party 
to the agreement who thinks that it may infringe the 
chapter II prohibition. The reason why it is phrased in that 
way is because the matter is simply being notified; an 
infringement cannot be presumed at that stage. 
Notification is confined to the parties involved in the 
conduct. Therefore, the language is consistent.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Lansley: Perhaps I can ask my question in rather 
plainer language. A person may believe that he is a party 
to the process and that there has been an infringement of 
the prohibition, but that his own conduct is not an abuse of 
a dominant position. He may regard himself as essentially 
blameless and that others are infringing the prohibition.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: Other parties can make a complaint. 
They do not need to be able to notify. They are not placed 
in an invidious position, but have the capacity to make a 
complaint about an alleged abuse of a dominant position.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Bercow: I do not think that the Minister is trying 
to be unhelpful indeed, he is being helpful, but I am not 
satisfied that we have cleared up the point. To avoid 
doubt, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for South 
Cambridgeshire is concerned about the position of the 
person who is not party to the conduct, but who believes 
that he or his business may be affected by that conduct. 
Is the Minister reassuring us that such a person can notify an agreement to the director general under clauses 21 and 
22? I fear that that is not the case, but I should be grateful 
for the Minister's reassurance.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. McCartney: The person can make a complaint or 
apply for advice and guidance to the director general. The 
Opposition are making heavy weather of this.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> We are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I understand that the hon. 
Gentleman 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In an effort to help, it seems to me, not 
least from the tone of what he says, that he is using the 
word "notify"	 as a term of art. A notification of a course 
of conduct has to be by a person who is joined in with 
that course of conduct. If someone else from outside, 
albeit fairly close or even affected by that course of 
conduct, wants to grumble to the director general, he may 
do so, but it will not constitute a notification. It will just 
be a representation about which the director general can 
form his own view.

Mr. McCartney: The clause introduces schedule 6, 
which provides for the procedures to be followed when a 
person seeks guidance on a decision under the chapter II 
prohibitions. All the points are covered. I was hoping that 
we could therefore proceed to agree that the clause should 
stand part of the Bill.  [Interruption.] I have received a 
message from God. It says that I must say that I 
inadvertently said that the third parties get guidance. The 
director general can investigate and make a decision about 
complaints by a third party. I think that that answers the 
hon. Gentleman's point. I apologise for inadvertently 
leading the Committee astray.
