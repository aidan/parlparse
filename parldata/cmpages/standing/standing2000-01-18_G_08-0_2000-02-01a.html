Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 48, in page 40, line 19, after 'period', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'not greater than 12 months'.<P>

<P>
No. 49, in page 40, line 20, after 'section 48(2)', insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): Last Thursday, we had an extensive debate on the amendments to the clause, which deals with special provisions for Northern Ireland parties. I do not want to repeat my preamble, but we shall argue now and during the clause stand part debate that we are unhappy about making special provisions for Northern Ireland parties. In the light of the changed political circumstances in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive, and the markedly changed atmosphere in the north, we feel that such special provisions should not apply. However, the amendments suggest a number of compromises that would provide a way forward.
<P>
Although amendment No. 46 is a matter of semantics, the semantics are quite significant. It would replace the phrase "a Northern Ireland party" with "Northern Ireland parties", so that any special provisions that may apply in Northern Ireland would apply to all parties, rather than a particular party. As we said during the previous sitting, we fear that the clause might be seen to relate only to Sinn Fein, which is reputed to have received most of its funding from the United States.
<P>
Under amendment No. 48, any arrangement would not be specified by the Secretary of State, but time-limited to 12 months.
<P>
The most significant and interesting of our proposed compromises is one with which the Minister has some sympathy. As Neill and the Minister acknowledged, because some political parties span the border, difficulties might arise in the north of Ireland. Amendment No. 49 recognises that, and would limit the clause's provisions to citizens of the Irish Republic. The amendment would make it impossible for people from other parts of the world to make donations to Northern Ireland political parties. If the amendment were accepted, the clause would apply only to electors in the Irish Republic. The amendment is based on the principle that, if those electors were resident in the United Kingdom, they would not be regarded as aliens and would be entitled to vote in United Kingdom elections.
<P>
As Neill rightly pointed out, the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country. Therefore, we are minded to suggest that the amendment is a way of addressing the dilemma in relation to the traditional funding of Northern Ireland parties without undermining the spirit of the Neill report or the basic thrust of the Bill, which is to outlaw foreign donations to United Kingdom political parties. I want to emphasise the United Kingdom aspect in that those elected to the United Kingdom Parliament serve and owe allegiance to the United Kingdom. Therefore, there should not be special provisions of the nature suggested by the clause for one particular part of the kingdom.
<P>
I am conscious that the Minister seems amenable to returning with amendments on Report. Perhaps those amendments will not be dissimilar to ours. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 40, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(c) a registered party that has its headquarters in Northern Ireland
<P>
(d) a registered party that has one or more accounting units that has its headquarters in Northern Ireland'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 51, in page 40, line 33, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(4) In this section "headquarters" means the headquarters of the registered party or accounting unit given in the application for registration under Schedule 1 to this Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) has just said, we have a responsibility to give the Bill detailed consideration. These two amendments offer another approach to the problem of funding in Northern Ireland. They address what seems to us to be a particular flaw in relation to this part of clause 63.
<P>
The problem with the way in which clause 63 operates is that it defines a Northern Ireland party as having one or more Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly or one or more Members of the House of Commons representing Northern Ireland constituencies. Although I have listened carefully to what the Minister said about other aspects of the clause and the attempt to ring-fence Northern Ireland politics, I confess that I still find this provision astonishing. Even if one leaves aside the unfairness that might be perpetrated in relation to United Kingdom parties organising on a United Kingdom-wide basis, the clause as drafted would effectively prevent any special provision being made for a Northern Ireland party that did not have Members of the Assembly or Members of the House of Commons. Therefore, the clause would effectively create sclerosis in Northern Ireland.
For example, the idea behind the clause, as drafted, is that it should be possible, in Northern Ireland, for an established party to obtain funding from the Republic. If I understood correctly some of the comments that were made at the time of the Bill's introduction, it was even suggested that a party should be able to get funding from the United States of America, and that would trouble me even more. A party might want to set itself up in Northern Ireland on an agenda that appealed to many members of the Committee--one of non-sectarian, liberal democratic policies. I use liberal with a small "l", with due respect to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). Why should such a party not be able to benefit from the same funding sources as a party dedicated to sectarian nastiness? A moment's thought makes one realise that that is nonsense. The Bill is therefore seriously flawed, even in terms of achieving what it seeks to achieve through clause 63, which, as the Minister already knows, does not entirely commend itself to me anyway.
<P>
The amendments address that issue, but go further. They also cover parties that may have a United Kingdom-wide operation but an accounting unit in Northern Ireland. My own party has such an organisation. Admittedly it is small, but there is a Conservative party in Northern Ireland. I have had the pleasure of addressing its annual dinner. It has put up candidates and on at least one occasion, as I think has been said, it came close to winning a seat in Parliament. Therefore, it is by no means a negligible force. In saying that, I appreciate that the party in government here, the Labour party, does not organise in Northern Ireland. I know that some of the Minister's colleagues regard that as being a great mistake; others may take a different view. However, it is wrong to exclude such groups.
<P>
If accounting units organise in Northern Ireland, I confess that I find it difficult to justify their being able to get funding from the Republic or the United States, but being deprived of the opportunity to transfer the funds, if they wish, to support wider party aims in Great Britain. However, I leave that to one side for a moment, because the amendments are designed to ensure that funding can be obtained by such accounting units. That essential change needs to be made to the clause.
<P>
Clearly these are probing amendments. I suspect that in not too long we shall move on to a clause stand part debate, where we shall express disquiet about the provision. I detected that the Minister was likely to go back to the drawing board on the entire clause, so I tabled the amendments as ideas to prompt his advisers into what I hope will be more creative thinking than what appears in the Bill. I hope that the Minister can therefore understand the logic behind the amendments.
<P>
Behind that logic, as a general principle, is the question of being equitable between political parties. In the wider sense we believe that that can be done only by treating Northern Ireland parties in the same way as any other United Kingdom party, and vice versa. In the narrower sense it means that we must ensure that parties that organise in Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged just because they do not at present have Members of the Assembly or Members of Parliament. If the peace process goes forward, as we all hope it will, over the next decade there is likely to be a sea-change in Northern Ireland politics, because, if there is peace, the issues that people have to address are likely to be very different in 10 years' time from what they are today. That in itself should ring an alarm bell about the way in which the clause is drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In supporting the amendments, I make no apology for being slightly partisan, because I shall deal with the provisions as it affects the Conservative party, particularly in its representation in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Traditionally, the Conservative party and the Ulster Unionist party were as one. The relationship between the Conservatives on the mainland and the Unionist party in the north of Ireland was similar to the relationship today between the Conservative party in England and Wales and the Conservative party in Scotland. Much of that is now history, in the dust of the Sunningdale agreement and elsewhere, but latterly the Conservative party has, outside the Unionist structure, organised itself in Northern Ireland, and there are Conservative associations in Northern Ireland in the same way as there are in England, Wales and Scotland. The argument that has been deployed is that we should not deny citizens of the United Kingdom who live in Northern Ireland the ability to vote on the major questions of the day that affect the United Kingdom and to participate in choosing the Government of the United Kingdom, rather than merely their local representatives in the House of Commons.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
People who support the Conservative party in Northern Ireland have been concerned that debates among Northern Ireland politicians have been dominated over the past 30 or 40 years by constitutional and security arrangements in Northern Ireland, rather than matters relating to the economy, social security or foreign affairs of the United Kingdom, or--although these are now devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly--health and education. I admit that I cannot remember the distinctive foreign policies of the Ulster Unionists, the Social Democratic and Labour party or Sinn Fein, or where they stand on questions of public spending and levels of taxation as they affect the United Kingdom as a whole. However, many people in Northern Ireland have opinions on such matters, and those are best expressed through a United Kingdom political party.
<P>
It is therefore possible, if not inevitable, that United Kingdom parties will have accounting units in Northern Ireland. Those units may be constituency associations--although, given the state of our organisation in Northern Ireland, I suspect not. There could be a body in Northern Ireland called the Northern Ireland Conservative party--the kind of federal structure that we have discussed before.
<P>
The amendment would recognise the existence of such accounting units, ensure that they were not unfairly treated if the Secretary of State were to give special exemptions to Northern Ireland parties, and that those exemptions applied equally to the accounting units of United Kingdom-wide parties. Otherwise, candidates could stand and parties could campaign in Northern Ireland elections regardless of whether one party had to comply with the requirements of the Bill and the spirit of the Neill report, while another party did not. That would be nonsensical and unacceptable. I therefore ask the Minister carefully to consider the amendment. Will he ensure that the accounting units of UK-wide parties in Northern Ireland are not adversely treated?

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said that the objective of the amendment is to be equitable between parties. I understand what he means, but I think that Conservative Members are being a little disingenuous, because their party would be unique among the parties that are represented in the Room in benefiting from the provisions of the amendment. As matters stand, the Conservative party is the only mainland party that would come close to being able to qualify for benefiting from a Northern Ireland exemption. As the hon. Gentleman said, his party came within 2,000 votes of winning a UK seat in Northern Ireland, and it is possible that, with its existing organisation, it could win a couple of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. If amendment No. 50 were agreed to the Conservative party alone among the parties here would benefit. I do not know whether the Liberal Democrats have a similar organisation, but even if they do, they would be far less likely to receive any serious money from the citizens of the Irish Republic, whereas the Conservative party might benefit substantially.
<P>
However, I agree with the underlying point in the amendment that the law should be equitable between large, successful parties and unsuccessful parties in Northern Ireland. It would be a dubious legal principle if we allowed an exemption for parties that succeeded in winning seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, but denied that help to parties that did not succeed. Such a law would help the pigs who already had their snouts in the trough, and would offend against basic principles. There must be a law that is equitable between parties in Northern Ireland, but it should not inadvertently help one of the mainland parties and not the others.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office </B>(Mr. Paddy Tipping): One difficulty with this group of amendments is that it is linked closely with the group that we discussed at the previous sitting. It is also linked to another group that we shall discuss shortly. I await your guidance in due course on the clause stand part debate, Mrs. Michie. It may be the case that, when we have discussed the three groups of amendments, we will have covered a great deal of clause 63.
<P>
I listened closely to the debate last week, and I am listening closely to the debate today. I do not perceive any difference in aim across the Committee between the hon. Members for North Dorset and for Beaconsfield and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton). The issue is one of how to achieve what we all desire, which is to have a level playing field in Northern Ireland, and to extend that, almost by definition, to the island of Ireland. At the same time, we must recognise that there is a different and changing political climate in Northern Ireland. Earlier today, the hon. Member for North Dorset said that Northern Ireland should not be viewed as different and separate. Things have changed, and I welcome that change. However, I am not yet convinced.
<P>
The events of the next few days may convince us further of the substantial difficulties in Northern Ireland and we may have to continue to focus on special provisions there. I hope that one day soon the situation will be normalised and the provisions of the Bill will apply to the whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. However, that has not yet been achieved.
<P>
The Neill committee examined the issue at some length. During its deliberations, the proposed duration of special provisions for Northern Ireland as set out in clause 63 moved from five years to three years, and earlier we debated an amendment that referred to one year. The specialness and pace of change in Northern Ireland is not in the control of the Committee--I wish that it were--and it is important to have flexibility.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 refer to the position of political parties in Northern Ireland. I made it clear at a previous sitting of the Committee that the current provisions in the Bill are unsatisfactory and that the Government intend to table amendments. I am not yet clear what they will be, because I want to hear the debate. It is helpful and important to hear the Committee's views. To put that debate in context, I remind the Committee that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office is meeting Northern Ireland political parties this week, outside the Committee, to consider similar themes.
<P>
The provisions in clause 63(2) narrow the definition of a political party in Northern Ireland too much and confine it to parties that are represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly or have members in the House. That is unsatisfactory and we intend to table amendments to remedy it. The Neill committee made that point in response to the draft Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to the position of the Conservative party in Northern Ireland and, rightly pointed out that it was a political force there and had nearly had a gain. Perhaps if it had been invited to speak more often at dinners there it might have encouraged the troops. The hon. Member for North Dorset referred to the history of the alliance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said, the only traditional party that is organised in Northern Ireland is the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): On that point, I have been present at Conservative party annual conferences when there was dispute about whether we should be organising there. It was a grass roots upsurge that led to that result. There is nothing to stop any other party taking the same route. We hope that circumstances are changing for the better. The legislation should reflect that that outcome is more likely, not less likely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I do not want to invite the Committee to consider the private discussions that take place within political parties. The hon. Gentleman said that the Conservative party had discussed the matter and the hon. Member for North Dorset also made it clear that there are strong views in my own party. I am frequently asked why the Labour party does not organise itself in Northern Ireland, but that is a matter for another day and another audience.
<P>
We shall table amendments to change the nature of political parties, but my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea wanted some reassurance on that. If the Conservative party were registered under the terms of the amendments, it would be possible for money to come from overseas, unwanted and unwelcome as it might be, to the Conservative party in Northern Ireland and then to the mainstream party in Conservative central office. That possibility would clearly run against the spirit of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not unsympathetic to what has been said. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that officials had been looking at the matter; indeed, they have. The clause is turning out to be one of the more controversial elements of the Bill, and we are on the case; we are working on it. If I may stretch your indulgence a little, Mrs. Michie, the way forward may be, as the hon. Member for North Dorset said in an earlier debate, to table similar amendments to those proposed. We are minded to table amendments, but how similar they will be remains to be seen.
<P>
First, we must define a Northern Ireland party better; secondly, we must allow mainstream UK parties to organise in Northern Ireland; and, thirdly, we must ensure that, given the need to organise there, foreign donations are not made. That leads me to the provisional conclusion that the way forward may be--I stress "may be"--to have a separate register of parties in Northern Ireland--a firebreak, a wall between the transfer of funding between parties on that register and the mainstream UK parties. We are aware that evasion could result, but it would be a way forward.
<P>
That is the present direction of thought and it is being canvassed outside the Committee. It would satisfy all the aims put forward by hon. Members, but we are not yet in a position to table those amendments. I hope that we shall do so on Report when I expect that we shall return to the issue. Given that background and the desire across the Committee to find a solution, I hope that hon. Members will reflect again and consider seeking to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As the amendments were tabled as probing amendments to examine one aspect of the clause, there will be no difficulty in withdrawing amendment No. 50.
<P>
The Minister made a number of comments, and it may be more sensible if I reserve my replies to the clause stand part debate, because they raise difficult and important issues. It is helpful of the Minister to show the direction in which the Government's mind may be going, but there appear to be serious difficulties in seeking to isolate a portion of a country--the United  Kingdom--and place it under a special funding regime, which may distort United Kingdom politics. I shall return to that point later.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will be mindful of the Human Rights Act 1998 and its protocol on free and fair election--another topic to which I shall return on clause stand part. With that in mind, and perhaps a warning shot towards the Minister that the matter becomes even more complex the more one looks at it--whether in detail or in a wider context--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 40, line 33, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> '(4) The Secretary of State shall not make an order under subsection (1)(b) above unless the following conditions are satisfied--
<P>
(a) a draft of the order has been submitted to the Electoral Commission; and
<P>
(b) the Commission has stated that, in its opinion, the contents of the draft order are compatible with the effective enforcement in individual cases of the provisions of section 54 relating to evasion of restrictions on donations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned evasion, and the amendment deals with that point. I hope that our debate this morning will not pre-empt or duplicate, but assist the talks that are taking place and help to establish a way forward. The amendment would ensure that Northern Ireland's exemption will not become a huge loophole.
<P>
It would be easy for us inadvertently to create two huge loopholes. If the amendment is not agreed to, the clause will allow citizens of the Republic to give funds to Northern Ireland parties and to act as conduits for American money. Clause 48, which we discussed last week, will allow overseas voters to give money to British political parties and to act as conduits for overseas funders. Similar reasoning is involved in both cases: clause 54 will make it an offence to give false information, punishable by a year in jail, but--I seek confirmation from my hon. Friends in this regard--it will be an offence only if it is committed by a United Kingdom citizen. It could be realistically investigated only if the offence were committed in this country.
<P>
I want to give some examples. A London banker who gave £5 million to the Euro federalist party--I imagine that no Committee member would support such a party--could be investigated under the provisions of clause 54 to establish whether the money really came from him or whether it came from someone else. However, a Dublin banker who gave £5 million to Sinn Fein or to the Ulster Unionist council would not break Irish laws or be subject to British law. Equally, a British expatriate living in Majorca who gave £5 million to a British party might be subject to British law, but only if he returned to Britain; moreover, there would be no way to check the veracity of the information that he gave.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will explain what would happen in each of those cases. Presumably, they will not be covered by Interpol, and people will not be extraditable for party funding fraud. Although I do not suggest that they should be extraditable, we need to know what the law is. We return to the simple proposition that if we want to ban foreign funding, we can do so only in relation to people who are subject to British law. We cannot create a class of permissible donors that includes Irish citizens who live in the Republic of Ireland unless we can prevail on the Dail to pass a law that bans its citizens from acting as conduits for donors to United Kingdom parties; it need not, however, ban them from accepting overseas funding, which they can currently do. We could ask the Dail to do that as a quid pro quo for the other night--I do not see why it should not do so. Unless there is such a provision in Irish law, there will be a loophole in British law.
<P>
When the Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland office, talks to the Irish parties--he may be doing so as we speak--I hope that he will discuss that problem and the problem of re-routing, which was identified in the Neill report. That involves money coming from, for example, an American citizen, going to an Irish citizen, from him to a Northern Ireland party and from that party to a London political party. It will be possible, and perfectly legal, for overseas money to reach British political parties through that circuitous route, unless at some stage along that route we can erect an effective and watertight firebreak of the kind that my hon. Friend the Minister described. He suggested that that firebreak should be created between the Northern Ireland political party and the mainland political party. It would ensure that money could not pass between a party in Northern Ireland, and a party in London. I hope that he will address two problems that might arise from that. What would happen if a party were to qualify as a Northern Ireland party and as a British party, which was the subject of the previous amendment.
<P>
Currently, the qualification for a Northern Ireland party is to have two seats in either Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly. At the moment, no party would qualify in both respects. Clearly, however, it could easily happen. If amendment No. 50 were incorporated into the Bill in any form, the qualification would extend to the Conservative party, the Green party and a number of other smaller parties that organise in Northern Ireland and mainland United Kingdom. If that were to happen, we would be creating a law under which it would be illegal to pass money from the Belfast branch of the party to the London branch of the same party. There must be a million ways around that. The Northern Ireland party might pay for things that would otherwise be paid for by the mainland party. The mainland party might currently be subsidising the Northern Ireland party, but the clause would allow it to increase the share that the Northern Ireland party was expected to pay.
<P>
If a Northern Ireland party were to give money to a person who subsequently gives it to a British political party, how can that be a breach of the law under the clause as drafted? It is not illegal for political parties to give money to individuals, and it is possible for a United Kingdom citizen and voter, who lives in Northern Ireland, to donate money to a British political party. There are all those possible ways around the firebreak that the Bill seeks to erect. It is not that I do not want the  firebreak to work; I want it to be completely watertight against any leaks.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): How can a firebreak be watertight?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I think that the meaning is clear. I do not know whether there is an equivalent term to watertight in relation to firebreaks, but perhaps a member of the Committee can provide one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Firetight, perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The Neill report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as a practical matter (even if it were legally possible) it would be virtually impossible to halt the flow of funds from the Dublin offices of the SDLP or Sinn Fein to their Belfast offices."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If that were right in practical terms, would the hon. Gentleman not agree that the impact of the amendment would be that no special provisions for Northern Ireland could ever be introduced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> It is perfectly possible. Under the amendment, the exemption in clause 63 could only be brought into play if the Electoral Commission could guarantee that it would be firetight. If that were impossible, it would never be brought into play. That is absolutely right. The onus is on all members of the Committee to ensure that the Bill is firetight or leak-proof before we complete our consideration. The history of party funding legislation is exactly the same as that of tax legislation--there are many people outside this House whose job it will be to look for ways around the provision. An army, not so much composed of accountants as of possible donors, will look for the leaks in the system. We must not only make sure that the Bill is firelight, but accept the need for continual revision of party funding legislation. However firetight we make it, people will always look for new ways of evading the provisions. Therefore, as with tax legislation, we must be careful about the detail. The onus should be on those who argue for an exemption in Northern Ireland to satisfy the Electoral Commission that it can work, without driving a coach and horses through the entire Bill before it can be brought into play.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is an interesting principle in the Bill on this point. The Neill committee says that it should be open to Republic of Ireland citizens "resident in the Republic". I do not know whether that phraseology is included in the Bill, but clearly the clause would empower the Secretary of State to draw up rules that would almost certainly include it. That would not allow Irish expatriates in the United States to fund Northern Ireland parties, because they would not be resident in the Republic of Ireland. However, the distinction will be ineffective if we cannot question citizens of the Republic of Ireland about the true origin of the funds that they give to British political parties. It seems illogical to apply the principle in the Republic of Ireland that people must not only be registered but be resident there if we do not apply it to this country as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I hope that I do not pre-empt any of the comments that the Minister intends to make. Paragraph 6(b) of schedule 5 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"details of any element of deception or concealment employed by the donor of which the registered party or any accounting unit of the party became aware and the means by which it was revealed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a responsibility is placed on the treasurer of the party or accounting unit to decide, if he becomes aware, whether a donation is permissible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but that merely covers the civil law responsibility of the treasurer of a party to be as sure as possible about the origin of the donation. It does not cover the provision in clause 54, which makes it a criminal offence for the donor to evade the intention of the Bill. If that cannot be applied to a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, it will leave a loophole that enables a Dublin banker to take money from an overseas donor and pass it on to a British political party, no doubt deceiving the treasurer of that party along the way about the true origin of the funds, but immune himself from investigation under the criminal law in clause 54.
<P>
In clause 63 we accept that it is not enough for people to be voters in the Republic of Ireland; they must also, as a safeguard, be resident there, because we do not want the clause to become a conduit for overseas funds. Surely he will now see the relevance of the original tax exiles' amendment that we discussed previously, which suggested that it was not enough for overseas voters to be registered as voters in this country: they must also be resident here. Only residence in this country will make somebody liable to British law and to clause 54, which provides powers under criminal law to investigate the source of funds coming to parties in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I have listened with great interest to what the hon. Gentleman said on the amendment. I understand what he aims to achieve, and the anxieties that he feels about clause 63 and seeks to address. I hope, therefore, that he will forgive my saying that there is a circularity to the argument in which we are engaged.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wishes to ensure that donations from the Irish Republic comply with the provisions of clause 54 in terms of transparency, so that people know the original source of all party funding, and can be sure that such funding has not come from criminal sources or racketeering. The circularity of the argument is that the exemption has been proposed for Northern Ireland because it is perceived as having links with the Irish Republic that rightly need to be addressed. However, the Irish Republic is a foreign country for the purposes of the Neill report.
<P>
Neill suggested that individuals in foreign countries should not be allowed to make donations only partly for the reason--stated earlier by the hon. Member for Battersea--that they had no cause to be involved in United Kingdom politics. His main reason was that the sources of such funds could never properly be ascertained. So we go round in circles. Unless an agreement can be reached with the Government of the Irish Republic to provide assurances about funds originating in the Republic for transfer to Northern Ireland, this question will never satisfactorily be answered.
<P>
Lord Neill has produced an enormous report, full of righteous thinking--I do not say that pejoratively--and one of its most serious flaws is that, at the end of it he says, "In the Irish context, there is nothing we can do so we will just have to adapt." That is anathema to me. It sticks in my throat that we should have to adapt our procedures on a United Kingdom-wide basis either to isolate Northern Ireland or to accept that funding there will continue to involve racketeering money and money from criminality being made available to political parties.
<P>
Dare I say to the Minister that everything must be thrown back into his lap, and the laps of his officials? They must come up with creative solutions that address the status of the Republic of Ireland--with which I have no difficulty in the context of the United Kingdom--and at the same time seek to do what Lord Neill intended. Otherwise, we are wasting our time with this legislation, going through the motions of setting out on tablets of stone tremendous rules to ensure that parties are properly funded, with no taint of corruption, while leaving open an enormous door. Alternatively, it is a door that can never be closed, in which case we should not have gone down this road in the first place. On that depressing note, I await the Minister's response with interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It has been an interesting debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has been helpful in sharing some legitimate concerns with the Committee. In fairness to him, he has come up with what has just been called a creative solution.
<P>
However, I am not entirely convinced that it would solve the problem of how to maintain a watertight firebreak, or whatever image one chooses. It must be right to close down the possibility of the evasion of, for example, funds coming from the United States to the Republic of Ireland, then to a political party that operates in Northern Ireland and, finally, to the mainland party. I do not know the scale of the problem, but there are potential difficulties.
<P>
Before I turn to the main point, I want to refer to a comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, who has a long history of examining legislation and policy in this area, He said that legislation should not be fixed for all time and he may tell us later that some of the legislation has existed for 100 years and that we have not been able to change it quickly. The Committee has not had an opportunity to discuss the Electoral Commission, which will be the engine for change. We do not want the law to become ossified; we want to be able to make changes.
<P>
My hon. Friend gave a number of examples to plug the gap, make the Bill watertight and stop the fire. The Belfast-based part of an organisation--the accountancy sub-unit--could pass money across to the UK-based organisation through accountancy practice or sharp practice. Clearly, that is a possibility, but under clause 45(2)(c) such a donation would effectively be a concealed donation. The Bill covers that, but whether it resolves the problem satisfactorily is a separate question.
<P>
My hon. Friend also gave an example of a Northern Ireland party passing money on to an intermediary or third party who then passes it to the UK party. Again, that is a possibility, but I am not sure whether it is a realistic one. Nothing in the Bill forbids that, but I remind the Committee that the purpose of the Bill is to introduce openness, honesty and transparency. The accounting provisions in the Bill make it clear that the money could be tracked back.
<P>
During our discussions, I have been interested in the notion of a new element of political activity and the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) is gripped by the possibility that people in political parties may scour the accounts and shine spotlights into dark corners. I know that the hon. Gentleman is able to do that because he raised consequences that I had not recognised when we started to discuss the matter. The disclosure elements will provide the opportunity to track back and to use the powers in the Bill, under criminal or civil law.
<P>
The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea--would result in the Secretary of State having two powers to make orders. Subsections (1)(a) and (b) provide one power and the amendment would provide another. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said in a slightly different context, it is possible that a kind of circularity could arise, in that the order in the clause could run counter to the order that my hon. Friend is proposing. To use a popular phrase, it would be a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I am not convinced that one could have two such orders that did not impinge on each other and thereby lead to conflict.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend's essential point is correct. I acknowledge that we need to work on the Bill's underlying principle that foreign money should not come into UK politics. Clause 63 is unsatisfactory, but, as I said earlier, we are dealing with that--perhaps not creatively enough for the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. We wanted to hear Committee members' views about this part of the Bill.
<P>
There are no easy solutions to the problem. Perhaps the best solution would be to have no separate provisions for Northern Ireland. I hear that being whispered on both sides of the Committee. However, I and my ministerial colleagues are not convinced that the change in Northern Ireland, great as it is, has allowed us to reach that point. I wish that it had. We may receive further information as our discussions progress in Committee, on the Floor of the House and when the Bill is considered in another place.
<P>
Given that the provisions in clause 63 are temporary, we need to define more precisely what temporary means. It has progressed from five years in the Neill report, to three years in the draft Bill, to one year in an amendment that the Committee considered during a previous debate.
<P>
I hope and believe that the provisions in clause 63 will eventually become unnecessary, because politics in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will have been normalised to the extent that they can take place in the context of the ground rules that apply in the rest of the United Kingdom. We must all work, not only in Committee, but in our wider lives, to ensure that that happens.
<P>
Given those assurances, I hope that my hon. Friend will reflect on the matter, and perhaps return to it at a later stage, but in the meantime, withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Linton:</B> With an eye on the talks that are now taking place and the assurances that have been given by my hon. Friend the Minister, I conclude that the best solution would be for the Dail, of its own accord, to pass legislation that is similar to the Bill. The next best solution would be for it to pass legislation that would make it possible for it to prevent citizens of the republic from acting as conduits for overseas donations. Any other solution would effectively close the front door to overseas funding, while leaving the back door wide open.
<P>
In view of the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister clearly understands the problems and is working to resolve them, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am in a dilemma. Having only just seen the Hansard report of Thursday afternoon's proceedings, it seems to me that matters arising from clause 63 were well discussed during the debate on the amendments. Nevertheless, I sense that Committee members wish further to discuss those matters. I hope that their contributions will be reasonably brief and certainly not repetitious.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Let me say at the outset that I hope not to be repetitious. I do not wish to reconsider the amendments in detail, but want to talk about the clause's general principle, which is to exempt Northern Ireland political parties from the Bill's foreign donations provisions.
<P>
I was slightly encouraged by the Minister's response during the previous debate. As I recall--I hope that I am paraphrasing him correctly--in his opinion, foreign money should not enter into British politics, and we tend to agree; otherwise, we would not be generally supportive of the Bill's provisions and the recommendations of the Neill committee.
<P>
Committee members, and the Government, should they wish to amend the clause on Report, are faced with several alternatives. We could exempt Northern Ireland political parties from all the Bill's foreign donations provisions. As the Bill is currently drafted, donations could be taken from whence they come without let or hindrance--be it the United States, south America, or any other country where there are members of the Irish diaspora who wish to fuel the political debate in Northern Ireland. A second alternative, which we have discussed, is Neill's recommendation to allow Northern Ireland political parties to accept funding only from the Republic of Ireland. A third alternative, with which some of our probing amendments dealt, is not to distinguish between a Northern Ireland political party and a United Kingdom political party, and thereby to allow all parties in the United Kingdom to accept donations from the Republic of Ireland. The fourth alternative, which is the essence of the debate, is to delete clause 63 and grant no exemptions for Northern Ireland.
<P>
I take comfort from Neill's recommendation 28, which has some bearing on an intervention I made during a previous debate. It states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The responsibility for ensuring that donations are received only from a permissible source should be placed on each political party. The designated responsible officer of the party would be required to certify the position to the Election Commission annually when reporting on the donations received."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would apply equally to a Northern Ireland political party and a United Kingdom political party. I see no reason to move away from that recommendation.
<P>
The Opposition take the view that there should be no special provisions for Northern Ireland. If we in Great Britain entertain Neill's concept that there should be financial propriety in all political affairs and that all donations must derive from permissible sources, and if we seek to clean up our act by rejecting donations from foreign, non-permissible sources, such special provisions are unacceptable. Clearly, in the past, the major political parties have accepted some overseas donations. Northern Ireland is probably the most corrupt part of the United Kingdom in terms of political and financial propriety. The clause allows that corruption to continue and enables foreign money to fuel political debate in Northern Ireland, which, as we all know, has been tainted by violence and intimidation. We should seek to ensure greater financial and political propriety and not to introduce weaker rules on it.
<P>
We have several times heard references to Lord Neill's quotation from the Ireland Act 1949, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would have recognised that when suggesting earlier the compromise of allowing the Republic of Ireland in on the provision.
<P>
Neill's recommendation 29 suggests that we do so. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In relation to donations to political parties in Northern Ireland, the definition of a permissible source should also include a citizen of the Republic of Ireland resident in the Republic subject to compliance with the Republic's Electoral Act 1997."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has already rejected amendments drafted along those lines and has suggested that such an approach could be a compromise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks at the record, he will see that I asked the Committee to reject the proposal at this stage but to leave the amendment in question as an option to which we could return at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. He is quite right; he asked us to lay the amendment on one side for the moment but gave an assurance that he would consider it in due course as a possible way forward. He can take comfort from Lord Neill.
<P>
When we consider Northern Ireland, we must think about practicalities. We have discussed firebreaks in the Irish sea, intended to prevent the heat of all the foreign money that finds its way across into the United Kingdom. I am not convinced by that argument. In terms of the clause as a whole, we should go back to the basic principle laid down by Lord Neill, which people in the rest of the United Kingdom must accept. He said that there should be no exemptions and that United Kingdom political parties should not take donations from foreign sources. I seek an acknowledgement of that from the Government, and I hope that they will delete the clause and accept that it should not stand part of the Bill unless they can propose a compromise that is acceptable to the Committee.
<P>
The clause, as it stands, is offensive, because it flies in the face of the Bill's basic principle: that we should not take donations from foreign political sources. To allow exemptions or the possibility of exemptions for political parties whose record in democratic principles is the worst in the United Kingdom is offensive to all those who have suffered in Northern Ireland and on the mainland of Britain as a result of the actions of a number of political parties. I suggest seriously that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): I shall speak briefly and along the same lines as the hon. Member for North Dorset. I support the idea that clause 63 should not be part of the Bill unless similar clear, waterproof and fireproof legislation exists in the Irish Republic. In defining Northern Ireland parties and political organisations, we have restricted ourselves to the current range of parties and organisations, but we have not discussed the difficulties that are caused by political parties that promote single-issue campaigns.
<P>
The anti-abortion cause in the United States has seen extremists involved in fire bombings, shootings and murder. Their activities have been linked to arson attacks in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the language is growing ever extreme. The pressure in those circumstances for a single-issue pressure group to attract money from the United States and launder it through routes in my area of west Scotland, where the issues are inflammatory, is so substantial that it poses a greater risk than simply transferring it to a normal political party. Because of the magnitude of the threat and the impact that a virtually unlimited flow of American extremist money would have in areas such as my own, there has to be a fireproof, waterproof break in the conduit for money. That has not been adequately accepted and, unless provision is made for it, I shall not support clause 63.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The clause presents a problem. The Minister has accepted that it is a dog's breakfast. It has received criticism from many directions and in many ways. Up to now, I have been a silent but interested listener in our debate on Northern Ireland, but we should reconsider what we are trying to achieve. The Minister must give serious thought to whether the underlying direction of the clause is right. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield summed it up when he said that, because we cannot be effective, we are providing an exemption from complying with the rules.
<P>
Electoral law in Northern Ireland has extra provisions. They do not only apply to Northern Ireland, but in practice, they are used only there. Their purpose is to ensure that abuse is reduced. For example, the appointment of polling agents by political parties is not, to my knowledge, done on the mainland. In Northern Ireland, representatives of each party sit next to the polling clerk to spot impersonation and other misdemeanours. The provision prevents criminal actions, which might otherwise be commonplace, from occurring. People who have contested elections in Northern Ireland have first-hand experience of campaigns and they tell anecdotes that would make even my hair curl. This is not just about fundraising but about the process of democratic elections where people are experts at getting round the rules. The Minister should not be finding ways to exempt them, but should be finding ways of imposing stringent requirements that cannot be avoided even by the parties of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The information I have, which is anecdotal, comes from an especially lively conversation with representatives of Northern Ireland parties at a party conference some years ago. No doubt, the stories grew in the telling, as stories often do at party conferences, but it was scandalous to hear what had been attempted and the difficulties faced by those who tried to fight the elections in a legitimate way. Please will the Minister reconsider the clause and change the principle on which it is based, so that it will prevent things from happening instead of giving up in despair?
<P>
Several points have been made about the possibility of money being channelled through Northern Ireland back to the mainland. At the present stage, I do not think that is a major defect, but I want to return to a point that has been made in relation to other clauses. What, at the moment, seems like a minor loophole or small exemption is exactly the sort of thing that bright people in party headquarters will try to exploit. The capacity for political experts to find ways of ballooning expenditure and channelling funds through whatever loopholes appear will be endless. Parties will always be careful to ensure that their actions constitute avoidance, not evasion, but the wider the chink through which avoidance measures may proceed, the more certain we can be that they will continue. Whatever we come up with, whether it is firebreaks, firewalls or waterproof fishing nets, we must have something that makes it absolutely clear that we will not give up on the problem, but will to try to find something that will really work.
<P>
In his response to the previous amendment, the Minister made an interesting point about freedom of information. Once all the material is published, and once members of the press and of other political parties are crawling all over it, we shall be too frightened of being caught to indulge in such activities. I would like to think that that is true. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is his impression of what the provisions will achieve, and I hope that he will convey that view to the Home Secretary. We are talking not about commercially sensitive but about politically sensitive information. If the Minister places such emphasis on that exposure of our politically sensitive information to the press, the public and our opponents, as a way of keeping us in line, he might perhaps tell the Home Secretary that it is an appropriate way to deal with the whole of the Government, so that the same pressures are brought to bear.
<P>
I do not want to trespass too far on your hospitality, Mrs. Michie, and I realise that we must confine our remarks to the clause. However, there are some general underlying principles that, I believe, the clause misses completely, so if the Committee proceeds to a vote, I shall oppose it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As I have said a great deal about the clause in considering the amendments, I shall try to confine my argument to a more general principle about whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. I am mindful of the Minister's difficulties. We are sympathetic, and we have tried to approach the problems of the legislation generally, but particularly clause 63, in a non-partisan way. Perhaps it is my lawyer's instincts, but sometimes I worry about the way in which legislation is considered in the House. After Second Reading, a Bill goes into Committee, where we are supposed to improve it, or at least to consider it in detail, and to send it back to the House on Report with the necessary amendments and our thoughts so that it may be reconsidered. Third Reading follows and then it goes to the other place so that it can be considered there, too.
<P>
The Minister must accept that we are having an interesting discussion, tabling probing amendments and giving the Minister ideas to consider. The Bill has been left as it was, except for one occasion during the previous sitting when the Minister agreed to one of our amendments regarding the word "knowingly".
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman underestimates the power of the Committee, which is 100 per cent. greater than his assessment--we have accepted two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is right, and I apologise.
<P>
I approached the stand part debate considering the clause untenable. What should we do? The proper course to delete the clause; I accept that there might still be problems to address. That would not mean that, as a Committee, we had said that there was no problem or issue to be considered--anyone could examine the record to discover that we had. There are matters for consideration, but the Government must legislate--that is one of the burdens on the Minister and his colleagues.
<P>
Nothing prevents the Government from saying on Report that the clause was deleted and that they would like the House to consider something new. If they have not had time to think of something by then, they can still say in the other place that they have thought further and want to table a new proposal. Such a proposal will ultimately come to this House when we consider Lords amendments.
<P>
I am bothered that a totally unsatisfactory clause may be left. We have so far failed to provide an acceptable solution not for a question of small detail but for a general issue of principle. The Minister admitted that the clause was unsatisfactory and that was not satisfied that any of our amendments had cured the problem. Will he say that the clause should not stand part? It could be removed and, once the Government have thought about the matter again, brought back.
<P>
The Bill would rightly remain in good condition with the clause deleted--many of its other aspects would remain. We would not wreck the Bill by deleting the clause. The Bill still has much good substance and some might say that it was greatly improved by the deletion. I hope that the Minister will agree to the deletion of the clause. I do not wish to be confrontational, but we shall divide the Committee if he feels unable to do that because we should not advance legislation that, as the Minister accepts, contains such a flaw.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We have come to the defining moment of the Committee's life. We have proceeded by consensus; now, my emollience has finally been exhausted. Hon. Members have made it clear that they wish to state their position. Those of us taking a religious interest in the proceedings might suggest that the difference between the Opposition and us lies in their omission and our commission. I say to my hon. Friends that I want the clause to stand part on the understanding that it will be amended substantially on Report and, perhaps, later.
<P>
You asked me to be brief, Mrs. Michie, and not to repeat myself, but let me have one repetition. I have said consistently during our debate on the clause and the proposed amendments to it that the Government are prepared to listen. I have gone further than that; I have tried to help the Committee by sketching out a possible way forward and by making clear our best thinking as it is at the moment and giving hon. Members the opportunity to consider it.
<P>
Conservative Members have made it clear that they do not accept that the situation in Northern Ireland is different. I simply do not agree. The Neill committee considered the matter at length. The Opposition were fair in their characterisation of the Neill report. They did not use the word "pious", but I think that they were suggesting that it was full of good intent, although they said that Neill had not found a solution.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I find it difficult to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks. He said that he was willing to consider various alternatives, but wanted the clause to stand part of the Bill. That is offensive to anyone who believes that we should not take foreign political donations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have told hon. Members candidly that various parts of the clause need amendment and I have asked for time to sketch amendments out. I agreed that the definition of political parties needed change and accepted that there was discussion about the length of the exemption. When Lord Neill considered the matter, he spoke of a five-year exemption, but the White Paper suggested a three-year exemption. I shall not be privy to the discussions that the Northern Ireland Office Ministers have with political parties in Northern Ireland, but I suspect that they will propose exemptions of less than three years.
<P>
Hon. Members from the mainstream political parties may say that we do things better here on the mainland, but there are problems in Northern Ireland of violence and intimidation. We should be conscious of those problems and not put voters and political parties at risk. The Committee must reflect on that risk, which is a real possibility. If clause 63 were deleted from the Bill, people would be at risk. I suspect that hon. Members are asking me to tighten up the Bill--
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that to achieve change on the clause--as the Opposition wish to do--we require the assent not of the Committee but of those who are engaged in terror? That seems to be what he is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> No, I am not saying that. I am saying that Committee members operate in a comfortable and risk-free environment. There is, of course, risk in the sense that an hon. Member can lose his or her seat, but I am speaking about the fact that hon. Members are not in danger of violence or death. Will the hon. Gentleman talk to some of the participants who operate in Northern Ireland? The hon. Member for Hazel Grove half-referred to the difficulties that exist at present. We must recognise that they exist, as Lord Neill has, and try to move forward in consensus. I simply make one point: it is all very well for those of us who are in a relatively comfortable position to make claims about Northern Ireland, but we need to listen, and we should not block people or give them a veto from whatever side of the tradition in Northern Ireland they come. We should hear their opinions and reflect on their views about whether the legislation that we propose to use in our tournaments puts people in Northern Ireland at risk. I am not arguing for a veto on either tradition; I am just asking hon. Members to understand the significance of what they are thinking of doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> As a point of explanation, the Minister should understand that my relative safety includes 10 days in hospital, courtesy of the IRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am always sorry to hear that people have had difficulties. Perhaps that is something we should discuss outside the Room. However, I must stress that the provisions in clause 63 are supported by both sides of the tradition. I invite the Minister to refer back to the Neill report and to look at the evidence given by the Unionist party. We should reflect on that argument and be conscious that, in discussions about Northern Ireland as a whole, there is balance in the argument, and it is important that one side of the balance should not contain all the weight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I followed carefully what the Minister said, but we seem to be getting a little too emotional. We have suggested that the clause should be removed because, on the Minister's own admission, it is unsatisfactory. That does not detract from the Minister's stated aim that certain provisions must be made for Northern Ireland, to which the Government can return. Why should the Committee send back to the House on Report a Bill that contains a clause that is not only flawed in its detail but is totally unsatisfactory in its thrust? Surely the proper procedural approach would be to delete the clause and for the Government to think again and suggest an alternative. We are talking not about principles, but about the nitty-gritty of whether the Committee is doing its job properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The Committee's task is to improve the Bill. To delete a significant element of the Bill that refers to Northern Ireland does not wreck it, but does leave a gaping whole in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): It seems to me that we established that principle when we recognised that, in an ideal world, we would not adopt clauses unamended. However, we are required to do so because of forces outside the Committee. I am thinking particularly of the interesting debate we had on clause 48(2) about the incorporation of European Union companies. That principle has been well established in Committee, and we should proceed on that basis, because I understand from my right hon. Friend the Minister--I should be grateful if he would correct me if I am wrong that those matters will be discussed further once a debate has taken place outside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That issue has concerned the Committee and I gave an undertaking to reconsider it. I also promised to circulate legal advice to all Committee members on a point with which they were most unhappy--and I share some of their unhappiness. The weight of the legal advice that we have been given has made it difficult to process the matter quickly, but my hon. Friend is right to say that a marker has been put down to signify that hon. Members are not happy with the Bill as drafted. It is a straightforward choice; an either/or choice whether to accept an improved clause 63 or to delete it. I do not believe that deleting it will improve the Bill.
<P>
I made it clear from the outset that I would listen to the debate and I thought that I was being helpful to the Committee by trying to sketch out the Government's thinking on this issue. We have talked about intimidation. One of the issues with which members of the Committee are most concerned is foreign donations. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) is not with us at the moment. [Interruption.] "Perhaps we should vote quickly", I hear someone saying. I reassure my hon. Friend that the notion of a firebreak, plugging the waterhole or whatever image we want to use will remove his worry about the single-issue abortion campaign. If the Government table the kind of amendments that I propose, money could not come in from the United States and end up funding a campaign in, say, Glasgow on abortion issues.
<P>
These are temporary provisions. We all want to see normality in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove made a fair point. He had been listening to what I said to the Committee during the debate. My view is that the Bill will change the political climate. There may be, as he put it, avoidance rather than evasion and people will struggle to find ways around the provisions, but, given the support of all the political parties for the Neill report and for most of the Bill, I strongly believe that it will change the way in which we operate: it will be open, transparent and allow freedom of information. The hon. Gentleman asked me to pass his comments to the Home Secretary. Of course I shall do that. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day), who has the unique distinction of serving on two Committees at the same time, can take up these issues down the Corridor, because they pervade the whole of our discussion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time on this matter. I tabled an amendment to clause 64, which appears on the amendment paper but has not been included for debate. The stand part debate is the only means by which I can deal with the relevant issues. In a sense, I accept that the thrust of amendment No. 67 might have been included in a kind of extra paragraph in schedule 6, but this seemed to be the easy way. The amendment sought to delay the operation of schedule 6, which we are about to consider in detail, for at least six months after the proposed legislation came into effect. In dealing with the clause, perhaps I can therefore briefly flag up my concern about the complexity of the Bill which has been touched on previously.
This is a very complex Bill, and schedule 6, in particular, imposes a range of duties on individuals, whether they are the treasurers of large political parties or the Mrs. Browns we have discussed. I have no objection to those regulations, except in so far as I have described certain regulations as wrong, too complex or imposing excessively harsh penalties on individuals. However, the timing of the introduction of schedule 6 is important. The Government want the Bill on the statute book by the end of the Session--with which no one would disagree--but they also want it to be in operation swiftly afterwards. It has been suggested that major elections might take place next year. Given those circumstances, I am concerned about schedule 6. It is the nitty-gritty schedule, which determines when most of the detailed regulations are introduced. A period should be allowed to educate people about what will be expected of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. This is an extremely complicated Bill. My constituency treasurer, who happens to be Miss Brown, will be apoplectic when she reads some of the requirements that it will impose. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be desirable to have the Bill in place, as an Act, well before a general election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree that it would be desirable to have it in place before the next general election. However, the next general election could take place in three weeks' time--
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> It will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> One never knows what can happen in British politics--there may be strange and unexpected happenings. If we consider the matter reasonably, it is likely that the Bill will be on the statute book by November of this year. I have a funny feeling that the other place will spend a lot of time considering the Bill, especially given the way it is being dealt with. The Bill will be on the statute book for the start of the next parliamentary Session. Elections could take place a year or a month thereafter. I am simply saying that there has to be a good period for the educational process to take place. If by chance that educational period was not available, it would be better to have the next election without the Bill in place; otherwise, in the period immediately after the next general election the magistrates courts of this land will be chock-a-block with law-abiding and decent citizens who have fallen foul of immensely complicated legislation, which has then brought it into disrepute, which is not what I want to see. I flag that up with the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall resist the temptation to talk about amendment No. 67, which is not selected for discussion. I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he and I think that all the political parties want to see the Bill in place for the next general election, whenever that may be. He must remember that the draft Bill was produced in July last year, so political parties have already had a considerable time to look at it and consider its implications. On Second Reading, the Home Secretary exhorted political parties--he would never use a phrase such as this, but I shall use it--to get on with it and begin to put the principles, the practicalities and the mechanics lying behind the Bill into practice. I know from discussions, not with my own party but with yours, Mrs. Michie, that attempts are being made at least by some to get on with it. The fact that the Bill has not yet received Royal Assent should not stop us beginning to work on its proposals.
<P>
Let me try to give the hon. Member for Beaconsfield some reassurance. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set out a provisional timetable. He is on record as saying that part IV of the Bill will not come into effect until February or March 2001, a year away. I know that that reply does not exactly pick up the hon. Gentleman's six-month point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That is precisely the point that I am raising. February-March 2001 is two to three months earlier than I feel is reasonably possible, with the educational process that is required, especially if the Bill goes on the statute book only in November. That is precisely what causes me anxiety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As I said, the Bill has been in draft since July 1999. It is still a year until February and March 2001. Political parties have different priorities, one of which is to win the next general election. Let everyone aspire to do that; let the just cause win, though. A year is certainly a long time in politics and it gives political parties a long time from now to prepare.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 65 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 6</center></H4>
<H4><center> Control of donations to individuals and</center></H4>
members associations
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 110, leave out line 38.
<P>
I hope that, in tabling the various amendments to this detailed schedule, we have identified areas that may simply need to be looked at and clarified. At the same time, they are probing amendments. I do not suggest that they are comprehensive amendments which could be incorporated.
<P>
The schedule raises an issue of principle that gives me slight concern. I have raised it in the context of Members of Parliament, although it could apply to anyone holding elective office. This is the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. It is designed to regulate the activities of political parties. Although Members of Parliament may be elected with the support of a political party, they are free agents. We hold elected office and we are answerable to our constituents at elections and to our consciences. We are asked to comply with extremely detailed rules and regulations that involve the disclosure of interests to the House, and failure to do so can result in substantial sanctions by the House.
<P>
How does that arrangement dovetail with the provision that will put Members of Parliament into the category that schedule 6 refers to as "relevant elective offices"? Will we thereafter adapt our procedures in the House and abandon the relevant responsibilities to the Electoral Commission? If we do not, should the Electoral Commission dabble in such matters as the way in which Members of Parliament run their offices?
<P>
There are other categories of people who are elected office holders and who are identified, and although there are no proposals to tinker with their arrangements, one could argue that similar provisions should apply to them. I am sure that Members of the Scottish Parliament are subject to a host of regulations that relate to the disclosure of funds that they receive. I apologise if I appear to put Members of the Scottish Parliament in a lower category. Amendment No. 70 is a probing amendment, and I want to concentrate on the provisions that will affect the House. There may be a difference between Members of Parliament and Members of the Scottish Parliament--the House of Commons is, by virtue of its nature, the supreme legislative body in this country. However, would we create problems for ourselves if Members of Parliament were subject to such a statutory framework? Should not we rely, as we currently do, on the rules that are passed by Parliament? I hope that the Minister will clarify how the situation works in principle and in practice. I remind Committee members that at least one Member in the House does not belong to any political party. How does he fit into the framework that is contained in schedule 6?
<P>
Although amendment No. 70 is a probing amendment, I invite the Minister and Committee members to pause for thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I accept that amendment No. 70 is a probing amendment. If we withdrew the schedule, Members of Parliament would fall outside the Bill's scope. Amendment No. 70 would not do the job that the hon. Gentleman anticipates. We are all Members of Parliament, but we are also members of political parties. Agreeing to the amendment would not solve the problem for us, with the exception of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell), whom the hon. Gentleman mentioned. If the amendment were agreed to, we should all be penalised, with the exception of the hon. Member for Tatton.
<P>
For the life of me, I see no reason to make special provisions for Members of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that Members of Parliament reported through the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges, and they have been consulted on this matter. There is not a problem in this context. I acknowledge that Members of Parliament would have the added burden of having to report in two ways. If we accepted the amendment, it would be open to Members of Parliament to receive foreign donations and money from trusts, when we are denying that to others. We should not put Members of Parliament in a privileged position.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister has reassured me to some extent, but we may wish to consider how the provisions in the schedule square with the procedures of the House. There is enough bureaucracy already without massive duplication of responsibilities between election commissions, parliamentary commissioners for  standards, registers, and so on. That would be an interesting area for the appropriate Select Committee to examine.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 113, line 43, leave out '£1,000' and insert '£5,000'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 73 page 114, line 3, leave out '£1,000' and insert '£5,000'.
<P>
No. 61, in page 116, line 7, leave out '£1,000' and insert '£5,000'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I shall not delay the Committee long on this group of amendments. Amendment No. 72 is a probing amendment to seek a response from the Minister on consistency. For political parties, the limit is £5,000 and for individual accounting units it is £1,000.
<P>
I shall concentrate on the nature of members associations, which are national bodies, not local bodies. In the interests of consistency, £5,000 would be a more appropriate limit than £1,000 for donations directly to an accounting unit of a political party. We suggest a limit of £5,000 for donations by individual organisations to a political party. The activities of members associations tend to be in terms of effecting political debate at national level, either within or without the party to which they are associated. It would be more appropriate to raise that limit to £5,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I wonder whether I could probe further. The figure and its relevance depends on the extent to which it is intended that the provisions will apply. The hon. Member for North Dorset said that members associations tended to be national groups, but that is not mentioned in the Bill. I seek clarification from the Minister on whether they would be considered members associations under the Bill.
<P>
During our leadership election campaign, substantial sums of money were raised by the candidates. From what has been said, I am not sure whether the term "members associations" would cover the campaign of each candidate for the party leadership. Nor is it clear whether the candidates for the Labour nomination--or, indeed, the Conservative nomination--for the mayor of London would be included as members associations. Similarly, I am not sure about campaigns in Scotland for such positions.
<P>
I also seek clarification from the Minister about certain groups, such as the Tribune group and the Tory Reform group, which are mentioned in the explanatory notes. For example, the organisation previously known as Militant claimed to be not an organisation but a newspaper. It is well know that I was never a supporter or a member of that organisation; indeed, I was one of its direst foes. It was a group that claimed to be neither an association of members, nor an organisation, but a newspaper.
<P>
If money is to be declared when given to the Tribune group--a parliamentary organisation--is it also to be declared when given to, for example, the Tribune newspaper, if that were to become a campaigning vehicle? Would money have to be declared if given to the New Statesman, a similar campaigning vehicle on the Labour side? A variety of publications has been established under the guise of new Labour that are clearly campaigning organisations and members associations, although they would not necessarily have a formal membership structure, with officers and so on. I am not sure when an association is created, in this context.
<P>
I am unsure whether the schedule is intended to deal with the problem discussed earlier about the value of transfer of data. Such transfers can be enormously helpful to members associations when they are engaged in internal party battles. Is it the Minister's intention that members' associations should declare those materials, information and data provided to them by the party establishment, if they were not provided to another organisation within the party contesting an election? That could apply to all the political parties represented here--a faction in favour could receive benefits in kind, perhaps in the form of data, from the central party machine. Would such benefits need to be declared? The answer to that will affect my judgment as to whether £1,000 or £5,000 is the more reasonable sum to be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok has now returned from the cellars of Millbank; having made his escape and missed an awkward moment in Committee, he has raised some interesting questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> In creating firebreaks and waterproof barriers, one must make sure that they are completely resistant, otherwise things will escape.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As my hon. Friend's presence in the Committee now shows, a great deal of work is being done to make things Pollok-proof.
<P>
My hon. Friend asked what constituted a members association. Let me turn his attention to paragraph (6) in schedule 6, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'Members association' means any organisation whose membership"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the important part--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consists wholly or mainly of members of a registered party".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He gave us examples, some more interesting than others. The New Statesman would, I believe, fall outside the scope of the provision. Militant is a more interesting example. The question whether that organisation is part of the political party is a matter for party discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok acknowledged the associated problems. It was deemed that members of Militant were members of a political party who operated internally as members of another political party so they would be covered by the schedule.
<P>
My hon. Friend also asked about data. The issue is not data themselves, but their value. During our deliberations, there have been interesting discussions on the value of items such as handbags, gavels and data. The  Electoral Commission will play a part in defining the value of a contribution in kind. As I said during our discussion on patios, the commission is hardly likely to spend time assessing such items with tape measures; it will keep its eye on the bigger issue. Reference is made to that issue in amendments Nos. 72, 73 and 61, which, although they would amend different parts of the Bill, are effectively the same amendment. They would raise the threshold from £1,000 to £5,000 in respect of individuals and members' associations. That is the nub of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for North Dorset.
<P>
In the context of an individual, £1,000 is a substantial sum. The hon. Gentleman will recall that accounting units must declare £1,000, whereas central bodies and political parties must declare £5,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In respect of an individual who holds elected office in this House, for example, would not a donation of as little as £5 appear in the Register of Members' Interests?
<P>
<B> Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall return to that point later, because the matter is not quite as he describes it. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to say that  £1,000 would mean very little to an elected representative of, say, North Dorset. I can assure him that £1,000 would mean a great deal to an elected representative of Sherwood. That point was recognised by the Neill committee, which accepted that the issue was the amount of money that might buy influence. I accept that an individual's perception of £1,000 is different from a large organisation's perception of £5,000.
<P>
 I shall think about the point that the hon. Gentleman made. However, we intend to retain the £1,000 threshold because it links to the £1,000 accounting units threshold at the ward level, for example. There is nothing magical about those figures; they simply provide signposts and milestones against which we can measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Although I do not have a strong interest in this amendment, the Minister has advanced an argument in which I am interested. He has said that the £1,000 threshold connects with the accounting unit threshold that we have already debated, and which he has undertaken to reconsider. I wonder whether the £1,000 threshold might be varied accordingly. Such issues interconnect. I hope that the Minister accepts that, if the intention is to establish a clear threshold that people can understand, it must operate in each relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
12.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have acknowledged that there is nothing magic about the figure. To be honest, I had thought of £1,000 in the context of individuals, rather than members associations. Such associations vary a great deal in style, influence and size--they may be very small or very large. I shall consider the points that members of the Committee have made. The figure is not set in stone.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset asked about the declaration rules in respect of the Register of Members' Interests. For a Member of Parliament, payments or sponsorship arrangements exceeding £500 and gifts exceeding the value of £125 have to be declared. In relation to that, £1,000 is comparatively generous.
<P>
I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point about members associations. I assume that a large association such as the Tory Reform group--although I am unsure about its finances--would be linked more to £5,000 than £1,000. However, I make it clear to the Committee that we intend to table amendments about the matter. A fair point has been made, and I shall discuss it with my officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> Before my hon. Friend sits down, I should like him to clarify the point about members associations. He did not respond to my previous question about Labour party leadership groups. For example, would the Jackson and Dobson campaign groups be considered to be members associations? When the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) and others established an office and installed telephone lines during the Conservative party leadership election campaign, that did not result in any candidate coming forward, but costs were incurred. Would that be deemed to be an association that had to be upfront and honest?
<P>
<B> Mr. Tipping:</B> I am sorry that I did not address all the points that my hon. Friend raised. The New Statesman and Militant were the subjects that attracted me. [Laughter.] I have always taken a real interest in Militant. My record on that matter is perhaps parallel to that of my hon. Friend.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I would like to give the Minister the opportunity that he richly deserves to clear his name by withdrawing the word "attracted". I am sure that he did not mean it in one of its possible connotations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That is only one of its connotations. I have noted that the hon. Member for New Forest, East seems to be attracted to a great many things, in that they attract his attention and he follows them religiously.
<P>
As the Bill stands, a certain looseness is involved in the word "attraction" in the context of election campaign expenditure. Donations of more than £1,000 to, say, the Dobson campaign or the Portillo campaign would have to be declared. The hon. Member for North Dorset seeks to stretch that limit to £5,000. Clearly, a  £1,000 donation to an individual should be declared, but I have agreed to consider the figure of £5,000 in relation to organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I did not intend to comment on the schedule until I listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, who caused me to ponder some of the issues surrounding intellectual property. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that that needs closer investigation, because there are potential contradictions involved in the way in which the schedule has been drafted. Paragraph 4(5) of part 1 states that the value of a donation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "shall be so determined by reference to the total benefit accruing to the donee over that period."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are potential contradictions between that and the paragraphs that deal with financial value which could lead to some interesting legal cases.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister might consider introducing a clause on Report to clarify the meaning of the provisions. It appears that intellectual property rights that are transferred to a second person could fit into the relevant description. The Bill clearly refers to commercial costs, but the cost of obtaining data could be considerable. However, paragraph 4(5)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the total benefit accruing to the donee"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
over a period. The total benefits that will accrue depend on whether the donee achieves his or her objectives. The Bill's drafting contains vagaries that could cause difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am conscious that there are vagaries in the Bill's drafting. Committee members have presented us today and in previous sittings with hard cases.  My hon. Friend rightly said that value can be defined in different ways and that different materials can have different values to different people. Value depends on the successful outcome of an attempt to acquire, for example, data. Of course I shall consider this complex matter, although I am not confident that I will be able to produce a clause, several clauses or a new schedule that will resolve all the problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister will be aware that I have tabled amendments that are designed to deal with that problem. We have not yet reached those amendments, but I hope that we shall discuss them on another occasion. The definitions of "market value" and of "property" in clause 146 leave large holes that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) has only begun to explore. I hope that we shall fully discuss this matter. The Bill's current drafting does not deal adequately with the cases that Committee members have discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have seen the amendments that have been tabled to clause 146, and I shall try to give the hon. Gentleman a better answer when we reach that clause. We shall consider questions relating to valuation, which is a difficult subject, and try to do better, but I suspect that there are no easy answers. A wider issue is involved. Although I do not chide Committee members or seek to criticise them, I must point out that dangers can be associated with focusing on points of detail rather than on the big picture. As I said earlier, that big picture involves bringing openness, honesty and transparency into the system. If we can do that without examining the detail, we shall have done much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I appreciate the Minister's point, but does the big picture involve putting on the statute book a well-intentioned but completely unworkable piece of legislation? We have considered details and scratched our heads in an attempt to avoid such problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> If the Bill results in a change of attitude--I am sure that it will--that new approach to political life might mean that the legitimate concerns and interesting discussion points that Committee members raised were not pressing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am gratified that the Minister appears to accept our point about members associations. We believe that it is important to achieve consistency with regard to larger national organisations. I look forward to discussing that matter in detail later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the campaigns for party nominations for the mayor of London, for example, might have financial turnovers greater than some national organisations and that we should not distinguish between national and local but should consider the scale of the expenditure of bona fide organisations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman has touched on an interesting point. We have not sought in any of our amendments to define a members association as local or national. Whichever figure we arrive at for members associations will have to be relevant to both national and local campaigning groups. As the hon. Member for Pollok has said, a campaigning group for the mayoralty of London has a larger turnover than many smaller, national campaigning groups in our political parties--but I shall leave the Minister to ponder that.
<P>
As the debate has gone on, I have become more concerned about the limit as it relates to individuals. It is not relevant to cover it here, but I may come back to it later. Despite the Minister's assurance that he has discussed this matter with the Committee on Standards and Privileges, there are one or two conflicts here that we should discuss in relation to the application of the schedule. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 115, line 19, leave out from 'he' to 'to' and insert 'acted reasonably'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment, but it relates to exoneration for a person charged with an offence of failure to deliver a donation report. It is a matter on which I would welcome clarification. Earlier in the Bill the word "knowingly" was left out, and the criminal sanction was turned upside down as a result. In this case, quite properly, a defence will exist for a failure to deliver a donation report. Paragraph 10(3) of the schedule says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where a person is charged with an offence under this paragraph, it shall be a defence to prove that he took all reasonable steps, and exercised all due diligence, to ensure",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then it explains what he has to ensure. What does that mean? I appreciate that ultimately it is likely to be a matter for a jury or magistrates to decide, but does this term habitually appear in legislation of this kind, such as the Companies Act? If not, why has the provision been worded in this way and could it be worded more simply?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset and I propose in this amendment that, for the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"took all reasonable steps, and exercised all due diligence",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one could substitute the words "acted reasonably". That might be a better test to put before a jury: "Members of the jury, do you feel that, although this person failed to deliver a donation report in the form in which it should have been delivered, he was acting reasonably at all times in what he did?" Or would that not meet the mischief that the Government are seeking to stop? Would it provide a loophole?
<P>
We have a tendency in the House to criminalise people when we pass legislation and then, quite properly, to give them let-out clauses. We never explain what the let-out clause is supposed to be or to mean. I seek clarification from the Minister on what the let-out clause for the unfortunate person who falls foul of the Bill on donation reports will mean in practice and what we will be asking the courts and a jury to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall try to deal rapidly with this issue. The amendment lowers the threshold or gives an individual a greater chance for defence than the terms already in the Bill. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked why we had chosen these words. I draw his attention to clause 58(5), where the same form of words is used. It provides consistency across the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That may show that I should have raised the matter on clause--
