                           </strong> I was in the process of answering some specific
questions from the hon. Member for Glasgow East. She made great play of
the number of people of working age migrating from disability living
allowance to personal independence payment: 1.8 million over
three years. It is always important to put such matters into context. I
am sure that the hon. Lady would never want to create any unnecessary
anxiety. None of us wants to do that. I can reassure her that the
Pension, Disability and Carers Service, known as PDCS, is already
accustomed to managing high volumes of work on DLA, due to the large
number of recipients. The organisation processes on average 730,000 new
and renewal claims for DLA every year. Alongside that, it deals with
285,000 changes each year, for example, when a customer moves house.
That constitutes activity in one year. I hope that that reassures the
hon. Lady that the organisation is used to dealing with volume in the
region of 1.8 million people over three years. I do not wish to sound
complacent. The hon. Lady is right to ensure that the Government think
carefully about such matters. However, the volumes are usual for this
style of
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000012">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
come to the questions about migration, training and ordering of
migration. We will ensure that comprehensive training is delivered to
staff and independent assessors well before migration begins. Our
current plans are to begin staff training as early as November 2012. It
will be difficult to start much sooner, because it is important to
ensure that people are trained in the process as it goes live, as
opposed to anything that might still be under review. As for the order
of migration, targets and time scales are being considered and will be
informed by

                           </div>final decisions on the delivery model for assessment. We will ensure
that is done once the additional testing has taken place over the
summer. As for new applicants being able to continue with DLA while we
transfer to PIP, we will look at that in great detail to ensure that
the processes are as they should
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000013">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is the further reassurance of external scrutiny. I will soon meet the
Cabinet Office on the issue, and am working in partnership with the
Treasury. They will provide additional external scrutiny and assurance
as part of the major projects authority process. That is a new process
created to improve governance, in a way that I am sure the hon. Lady
would want the new Government to do. It takes a great deal of interest
in significant projects such as this, which have important outcomes for
the taxpayer. That will ensure that the project undergoes regular and
planned analysis to keep it on track; the sort of scrutiny the hon.
Lady has called
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000014">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
91(6) states that regulations will require the approval of both Houses
for provisions about the assessment of persons under 16. Through the
amendment, I wish simply to point out that the focus only on assessment
is too narrow. The regulations that require the approval of both Houses
should cover all aspects of the introduction of the personal
independence payment for young people and children under 16. I say that
to emphasise briefly two or three points I made this morning. The
issues for children and young people are different from those for
adults in several important respects. It certainly may be the case that
the assessment process will need to look different. I think the
Minister acknowledged that usefully this morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I
suggested, there are issues where a different approach might be
appropriate for children and young people, for example, in relation to
the eligibility period for the benefit. On the possibility of a
different rates regime applying to children and young people, it may
not be right for the two-rate system that is being proposed for adults
to apply to children and young people. For children and young people in
a residential educational setting, there may be reasons why a different
period for either entitlement to the benefit or eligibility could be
relevant, for example, to allow families properly to support or settle
young people in residential educational
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Through
the amendment, I simply wish to ensure that the regulations that
require the consideration of both Houses cover not just the assessment
of children and young people, but the operation of applying PIP to
children and young people. I have tabled the amendment to hear from the
Minister on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000025">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady through
my comments. I understand the issue that she is pressing and the need
to ensure that there is full scrutiny of the provisions that will
eventually be introduced for children. Her amendment would make the
first version of all regulations relating to children subject to an
affirmative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
regulations in clause 78 dealing with the assessment and the required
period condition must have a full airing in Parliament and be subject
to debate in the first instance. Those were two of the issues that the
hon. Lady raised in her comments when adding depth to the intention of
her amendment. The provision includes the regulations dealing with the
assessment of children, and recognises the importance of those key
conditions of entitlement, which will be contained in secondary
legislation under our proposals rather than enshrined in inflexible
primary legislation, as is currently the case for DLA, causing several
problems. However, we do not consider a debate under the affirmative
procedure necessary for those conditions of entitlement under the PIP
regulations that will be similar to those that apply to DLA, or where
changes are relatively minor. I suppose that the hon. Lady and I might
have a slight difference of approach on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
information provided to the Committee about our regulation-making
powers describes the regulations to be made under each clause and, as
the hon. Lady knows well, any regulations made under the negative
procedure remain subject to full parliamentary scrutiny, including a
debate if any hon. Member decides to pray against. Any measure also
remains subject to the scrutiny of the Select Committee on the Merits
of Statutory Instruments and the Joint Committee on Statutory

			Column number: 904<a class="bkMark" name="Column904">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Instruments. Furthermore, as, again, I am sure she knows, if regulations
are laid as a package and one part is subject to the affirmative
procedure, the entire package becomes subject to debate—it is a
trump
card.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate that the hon. Lady wishes to ensure that the needs of
children receive proper consideration. We share that objective. I
assure her that the way in which we have structured the Bill will
ensure that that is the case. We are conscious that the needs of
children are different from those of adults, as she so rightly said,
and that they vary at key stages of the child’s development. As
the Government made clear on Second Reading, it is important to get
that
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are clear that we will need to develop a specific child assessment
before we can apply the new PIP to children. Furthermore, the
Government are committed to consulting on the arrangements for
children—another reassurance which I hope the hon. Lady will
find helpful. There will, therefore, be ample opportunity for the
families of disabled children, organisations representing their
interests and hon. Members to scrutinise our full proposals. I reassure
her that I have listened carefully to what she said and I share her
desire to have a full and open debate about all aspects of the measures
for children. I am not, however, prepared to commit to regulations
subject to the affirmative procedure across the board, as she proposes,
but if I consider it appropriate that other regulations should be
subject to the affirmative procedure, the Bill can be amended at a
later
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000030">&#160;</a>

has said. The families of disabled children would not necessarily think
that changes to things such as the three-tier rates or the period
during which children in residential educational settings can receive
the benefit are minor, but I welcome what she said about the specific
child assessment and consultation process that will be put in place
before any such regulations are laid before the House. That would
certainly give every opportunity for such issues to be explored in
full.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000033">&#160;</a>

withdrawal of DLA mobility component in residential care, and it
relates to the

			Column number: 905<a class="bkMark" name="Column905">&#160;</a>
                           </div>procedures surrounding that withdrawal. The proposal would ensure that
any regulating powers in clause 83—“Persons
receiving certain services”—must be subject to an
affirmative vote in each House of Parliament. The argument for the
affirmative process for the PIP regulations is strengthened
categorically, I would argue, by the lack of information that will be
released on the review into DLA mobility component. As MPs will not be
given the information before voting on it, the argument that any future
regulations must be subject to greater scrutiny is very strong. If
there are any concerns at all, at  the very least, we should
move to the affirmative  procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000037">&#160;</a>

questions remain following our decision in Tuesday’s vote. I do
not know whether we have established that PIP will only be removed in
case of overlap. The individualistic approach that the Minister argued
for seems to run counter to the approach that has been taken in
residential care. If clause 83 is merely a power, leaving it in the
Bill does nothing to calm those who are worried about that potential
cut. Although I am happy to revisit the substance of our argument on
clause 83, I do not necessarily want to. My appeal is that, given the
nature of our debate and because of the concern about the proposals, it
is more than reasonable to ask that the provision be subject to the
affirmative procedure. That would be a minor concession for the
Government to make, given the scale of the
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000038">&#160;</a>

behind her amendment. Although I understand why she has tabled it and
brought those concerns to the Committee’s attention, I hope that
I can reassure her that the change is not needed. There are significant
controls in place to enable adequate consideration by Parliament not
only on this measure, but on many others in the Bill. The information
provided to the Committee on our regulation-making powers clearly
describes the purpose of the regulations associated with each clause in
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000039">&#160;</a>

the hon. Lady that we clearly and obviously continue to abide by the
Government code of practice, which ensures that we consult publicly and
openly on all regulations coming out of the PIP measure, whether they
are affirmative or negative. It is useful to bring that to the
attention of not only the hon. Lady, but all members of the Committee.
The hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston said that it was helpful for
me to outline some of the measures. Given that some hon. Members have
less experience on Bill Committees than others, being aware of some of
the real powers of scrutiny that are an important part of the process
that we are all involved in might help. I assure hon. Members that any
regulations made under the negative procedure always remain subject to
full parliamentary scrutiny, should Parliament wish that to be the
case, including through a prayer debate. All regulations are
scrutinised by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee and the
Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. Furthermore,
regulations—as I have said before, but it is helpful to remind
hon. Members—are often laid as a package. If one part of that
package requires an affirmative procedure debate, they will
all be subject to such a debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000040">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Glasgow East has had time to reflect and perhaps
read through some of the debate in <em>Hansard, </em>she will see that we
have a shared conviction, which is to ensure that the elements of the
Bill that relate to care home residents work well. We are taking the

with all the different measures that we have in place, I am not
prepared to commit to making regulations subject to affirmative

consideration, and if it were appropriate for other regulations to be
subject to the affirmative procedure, that is something that we can
consider. I appreciate her wish to ensure that the needs of those in
hospitals or care homes receive proper consideration, and I can assure
her that that will always be the case with the Government. With those

that I am far from an expert on procedures, but I have experience from
another place—the Scottish Parliament—which Mr Weir will
be well acquainted with, so I have some grasp of the different
procedures that can be deployed in such circumstances. I understand the
Minister’s argument about standard procedures of scrutiny and
that scrutiny takes place in varied structures and processes, and there
are times when that is appropriate, but we have a choice of procedures.
It is open to us to choose the affirmative procedure, and that is there
for a purpose. If it was just as the Minister described, there would be
no reason to choose between negative and affirmative, but affirmative
is there for a
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000043">&#160;</a>

can think of no other circumstances in which we need the affirmative
procedure except for these. There is still a degree of confusion. There
are still outstanding policy issues that the Government need to bring
forward. There is still this scale of concern. Parliamentarians are
still unclear about what will actually happen and what the impact of
this policy, either in principle or in practice, will be. Given the
scale of concern, it is the least that we can do. That concern is not
only about the policy, but about all the details of the proposals and
what they actually mean. We still do not know what the review is doing,
who is involved in it, what it is considering, what the impacts are or
what choices the Government are considering. Affirmative procedure
still needs to be
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
the heart of the affirmative procedure is the fact that it leads to
another vote in Committee—another vote in the parliamentary
process. That is why it is critical. That is why it is there. Quite
properly and quite reasonably, as the Minister outlined, it is not the
same as the other regulations and scrutiny, and it is appropriate in
these circumstances. The affirmative procedure is there to enable us to
have that vote. I appeal to anyone with a modicum of concern about the
withdrawal of the mobility component for those in residential care to
support the affirmative procedure. It is a basic democratic
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000045">&#160;</a>

illusion about the amount of concern that exists about some of the
widely promoted possible implications. I am reassured, however, and I
am disappointed that the hon. Lady is not reassured by the great
thoroughness with which the Government have spelled out how they will
consult on the measures and by how they have postponed any decisions to
ensure that anybody who requires mobility support will receive it. We
will have ample opportunity, through all the measures that are
available to us as parliamentarians, to ensure that we hold the
Government to account so that anybody who is in residential care right
now who needs support with their mobility will have
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000046">&#160;</a>

that I have talked to have absolutely and categorically not had that
reassurance. I have pressed the Minister to explain to me who will get
the mobility component if they stay in residential care and who will
not. From the hon. Lady’s contribution, she perhaps has an
understanding that I do not. It is clear that some people will not
receive it. Those currently living in residential care do not know

back into the substance of the argument, but I am making a slightly
different point. Perhaps I will be proven wrong, but we have
affirmative procedure for exactly this kind of case, which is one where
there is a distinction and where we are still arguing about the detail.
I am not going back into that argument—enthusiastic though I am.
It is about actual Parliamentary scrutiny, and the procedure is
therefore exact in these circumstances. It is not about the policy
itself; it is the procedure we are debating

create concern among individuals who may be residents of care homes.
She may or may not be aware that there are many residents of care homes
who do not currently get mobility allowance. There may be people who do
not receive mobility allowance under PIP because they are not be
eligible for it and may not have been eligible for it under DLA. I urge
her to take a measured approach to this and not to assert that
individuals will not receive a benefit for which the assessment has not
yet been made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000050">&#160;</a>

clarify my remarks. I would certainly not wish to raise the alarm for
people who currently do not get a benefit and imply that they should
get it. However, there is no doubt that people who currently receive
this benefit are very worried that they may not get it in the future,
and that they have no clarification about that. If the Minister had
been with me—I know she was invited—with the 5,000 people
demonstrating yesterday, she would have seen that many of those people
were not clear about this benefit and were concerned. It would be fair
to say that we were referred to during that demonstration.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000051">&#160;</a>

<em>Hansard</em> will be communicated widely. No one on this side of the
Committee is not clear in their own mind about the Government’s
commitment to ensure that anyone with a disability in residential care
who needs support with their mobility will receive that support.
Because we have that clarity, which has been given to us time after
time, the processes will be there for me as a Back Bencher to ensure
that I hold my Government to account through all the debating and all

She may have been reassured that there are many people, but she is in
danger of shooting the messenger. We are expressing views that have
been put us very strongly. There are many people up and down the
country. She may be satisfied that she has had ample information, and
that there is ample opportunity to use the procedures of the House of
Commons. However, that is not adequate. An affirmative procedure is not
the most revolutionary step one could take to deal with
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000054">&#160;</a>

am not suggesting that we upturn all the procedures of the House of
Commons and introduce some unheard of new step. It is a standard
procedure that emphasises the need for Parliament to be involved where
there is a particular issue to consider. It is a small, minor step that
could be taken and it would show good will on the part of the
Government to do so. It would show respect to the people who have not
got the clarity of Government Members. It would be a recognition that
the Government are beginning to “get it” a wee bit and,
believe me, as someone who takes a great interest in this field, that
is genuinely required. It gives us that extra opportunity. It is
extraordinarily disappointing to say no to this. It seems to indicate
that we are a wee bit insular on this Committee and that we are not

which we talked about this morning. I want to put a few more issues on
the record so that the Minister may have a chance to respond to them.
The amendments also relate to the transition process for those children
currently in receipt of disability living allowance who are likely to
be among the first to be assessed for the new PIP because they will
reach their 16th birthday at around the time that the new payment comes
in. They will, therefore, be required to go through an assessment to
claim the new
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said this morning—this is the specific problem in the
consultation—the issue is of concern because PIP is initially
intended as a benefit for working-age, disabled people. We all
acknowledged this morning that PIP essentially has that age group in
mind and may not fully reflect the specific needs of disabled
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
ensure that the consultation on introducing PIP for children properly
addresses the different needs of children and young people so that PIP
supports the extra costs of living with a disability. I want to mention
a few of the instances in which there is a case for designing PIP
differently so that it takes account of the specific needs of children.
It would be useful if the Minister could comment on these particular
aspects.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already touched on some of the issues. The Minister herself has
touched on this first issue. The frequency of assessments for children
can be a particular factor that causes distress or concern for children
and their families. It may be appropriate to look at less frequent
assessments for children whose health conditions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 910<a class="bkMark" name="Column910">&#160;</a>
                           </div>or impairments will not change or get better, or for whom extra distress
will be caused in carrying out assessments for PIP at the same time as
assessments for other care needs. I was grateful to the Minister for
raising the issue herself this morning. I would simply add that parents
are concerned about who carries out the assessment of children. Parents
have expressed concerns that social services, which may have some
contact with the family where a child is severely disabled, may none
the less not be particularly good at assessing some of the aspects of
living with that disability. So the assessment process for children
will need to be looked at with particular
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
talked this morning about the qualification period before entitlement
to DLA. If it is increased from the current three months for children
under the age of 16 that would cause considerable concern. Families
need support early on when a child is identified as having a disability
or impairment. Three months is a long time in the life of a young child
and addressing the needs of children as early as possible is really
significant for their well-being in childhood and also for their
long-term outcomes in
adulthood.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
talked about children in residential schools and the importance of
giving proper consideration to ensuring that the way in which the
mobility payment is retained enables them not just to be mobile in the
educational setting, but to play an active part in their family life
during the holidays and at weekends, and to ensure that families have
the money to maintain the child’s strong familial relationships
while they are in their residential educational setting. It is not
unknown for schools to provide transport between home and school only
at the beginning and end of term and not during the term to enable
children to spend time with their families at weekends. Clearly that is
an issue for children and young people that might warrant special
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I raised some
of these issues with the Minister of State, Department for Education,
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb) and asked
to what extent such support beyond the beginning and end of term was
already being provided and what sort of support was being provided for
transport costs by residential educational settings. He could not tell
me much about that because it is apparently a matter for local
discretion. I expect that will continue to be the case, but it is
important that children are facilitated to have proper contact with
their families during the school
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
discussed the concern about a potential change to the current situation
where disabled children can gain three levels of the daily living
component and two levels of the mobility component. Overall, if the
Government decide that it would be appropriate to bring disabled
children on to the PIP system, it would be helpful if the welcome
consultation and review process that the Minister described followed
the review of how PIP works for adults. Some useful lessons could be
learnt from that on how to be adapt the system to meet the specific
needs of disabled children. If there is be a full consultation, as the
Minister has pleasingly indicated, the public should be clear about its
process and be given every opportunity to
participate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
apologise for taking the amendments in reverse order. Amendment 185 on
consultation is intended to ensure that if PIP is introduced for
children it is well 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 911<a class="bkMark" name="Column911">&#160;</a>
                           </div>designed and can respond to the concerns and issues that many families
with disabled children would want to be given the fullest
consideration. I am sure that the Minister will be able to give us
considerable reassurance on that point, but it is useful to put on the
record some of the concerns that disabled children’s families
are already raising and I am grateful for the opportunity to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
transition, my specific concern is that young teenagers are likely to
be among early implementers of the move to PIP. They will reach their
16th birthday more or less at the time that PIP comes into play for
adults so they would, presumably, be undergoing an assessment at an
early stage. The Minister helpfully said this morning that until people
were migrated they would remain on disability living allowance, which
means that two very different systems will be running for disabled
people at the same time. It is important that we are reassured about
how the Government intend to ensure a smooth transition between DLA and
PIP for disabled young people, particularly if they are likely to have
to make that transition in their teens, as they turn 16. We
are all keen for that process to be as smooth as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Government
Members have rightly mentioned that transition from childhood to
adulthood can be extremely stressful for disabled people and their
families, because of the changing infrastructure of support that they
have to access; the way in which assessments for that change in support
can be carried out by their local authority and others; and the worry
that there will be some sort of gap as that transition takes place, and
services or financial support will disappear for a while as the systems
readjust to the child’s moving into the adult environment.
Families of disabled children have said they and their children often
feel that they are starting from scratch at that moment, with no clear
pathways for how the young person will move from childhood to adulthood
in both social care and financial support.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Disabled
young people and their families currently report limited problems with
the reassessment process during the transition from DLA as a child to
DLA as an adult, even though the systems currently operate differently
for the two groups. It would be disappointing if the Government did not
have arrangements in place to ensure that a smooth transition is
maintained in the benefits system for disabled young people who turn
16. As we can expect that these young people will be among the first to
be moved on to the new PIP system, it is important that both the system
itself and the transition process are fit for purpose and designed to
support this group’s specific needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister will take the opportunity to provide clarity on how she
intends to support disabled young people during this time in their
lives. I am sure that all hon. Members agree that it is a time of great
upheaval and uncertainty, which we would not want to see made
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000098">&#160;</a>

second seeks to ensure that the first set of regulations dealing with

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 185, powers in clause 90 and schedule 10 already
provide for important transitional arrangements. Those regulatory
arrangements will, as a matter of course, deal with the very important
issue that she has highlighted regarding ensuring that children
receiving DLA move smoothly to PIP in a way that is sensitive to their
needs and circumstances and which ensures no break in payment where
that is appropriate. Clearly such regulations will also need to be
supported by guidance, to decision makers and trained independent
assessors, to fully support the aim of the smooth transition. I can
again assure the hon. Lady that we will publicly consult on the
regulations that would relate to the issue she has
highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
referred to the consultation that we held on the totality of the new
reforms around DLA. It is worth explaining to her why we held a
10-and-a-half-week rather than a 12-week consultation as part of the
important process of developing that. The code of practice on
consultation sets a standard that we aspire to; it is not binding. In
this case, we are consulting on general principles only. As I have
outlined to the Committee at length, there will be extensive
opportunities for the Government to take views on how we might deliver
the reforms. The change in timing in no way implies a lack of desire to
get comments. We received 5,500 comments, which hopefully proved that
the change in timing was not a limiting factor. There were some
problems with the consultation website for two days, so we extended the
consultation period by four days to ensure that those problems were not
a barrier to people participating.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With regard
to amendment 187, I am happy to confirm that it is our firm intention
to consult on such regulations, whether they apply to people of working
age or to children. We said so in the policy briefing, which hon.
Members will have received a few days ago and which has been made more
widely available through our website. The hon. Lady referred to a
number of specific matters, such as assessments, that it would be
important to review through regulations. She asked who would undertake
such assessments, and talked about important issues such as the
qualifying
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000103">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Like all my colleagues on this side of the
Committee, I spend a lot of time listening to the concerns of people
with disabilities and of families that are doing a great job of caring
in what can be a very difficult situation. The qualifying period
concerns us all. It would be very helpful for us to hear a bit more
from the Minister today about those concerns. As the reforms are being
more widely debated and we have representations from all sorts of
organisations, we would like to be reassured that she is listening very
carefully to concerns about the qualifying period and its
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. I know
that she has been having discussions about the issue with people in her
constituency and I applaud her work on ensuring that people are fully
aware of exactly what the Government are introducing. The hon. Member
for Glasgow East said that some of the people she meets are perhaps
less clear than they would be if she were able to make the information
that we give her available to her constituents. That may help in the
process. It would perhaps be a useful way for us proceeding.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">We
debated the qualifying period extensively on Tuesday, and it is an
important difference between us. I explained that it was not about any
spending issues; it is much more about getting an alignment in how we
deal with long-term disability. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Truro and Falmouth for picking up on an important point, because we
will be able to consider the issue of children and qualifying periods
separately to the debate on adults. As part of the deliberations about
children, we can look at that specifically to see what would be most
appropriate for children under 16. That is yet another demonstration of
the importance that we attach to the difference between adults and
children, and of how, although the measures for adults and children are
contained in one Bill, we will deal with the practicalities of the
evolution of the assessment and the operational procedures on an
individual basis to ensure that we develop the most appropriate
procedure for children. It is important for us to say that. If we were
minded to look at a way in which to vary the qualifying period for
children, we would consider it
carefully.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston talked about children turning 16
shortly after the introduction of PIP, and made the assumption that
they would be the first to go through the new assessment. I can
understand why she assumed that, but I would like to clarify the matter
for her. The migration strategy is a very detailed piece of work, in
terms of who would be migrated at which point. There are very important
equality issues tied up with all those matters, and they are being
looked at carefully, but we obviously want to consult disabled people,
their families, and user-led organisations to get that important aspect
of the Bill right. We would also include organisations representing
disabled children. So I urge the hon. Lady not to make the assumption,
at this stage, that 16-year-olds would be the first to go through the
new assessment, because that may or may not be the case. We want to
look at it in great
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to reassure hon. Members that, as we develop these processes and
any regulations that emerge from them, we want to continue to work
closely with disabled people, their families and advocates, and
disabled people’s organisations. It is vital to ensure that, for
instance, any unintended consequences of the process are ironed out
well before the introduction, and that supporting regulations receive
the appropriate public scrutiny through open consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I realise
that I did not touch on our work on the assessment for children, but we
have covered that previously, so I hope that the hon. Member for
Stretford and Urmston will forgive me for not going over that argument.
Given the assurances that I have given in this and previous debates, I
hope that she feels able to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000108">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for a very useful and
interesting response on several important aspects, including to some
questions I did not ask. It is always very welcome to have that
information, and to hear the Minister amplify a little the reason why
the Government feels that a 10-and-a-half-week consultation period is
acceptable: there will be significant further consultation on delivery
of the benefit. I hope that when that consultation takes place, it will
extend to the full period to which we aspire for consultations. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East has pointed out several times
today, many people have a lot to say about the reforms, and naturally
we want—as I am sure that the Minister does—to ensure
that they have the fullest opportunity to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was very interested in the Minister’s remarks on the qualifying
period. I am grateful for her recognition that there might be specific
issues around the qualifying period in relation to children and young
people. The hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth also made that point;
there is common understanding of why there might be particular aspects
to take into account. I interpreted the Minister’s comments to
men that, although her justification for a six-month qualifying period
for adults was about standardising definitions in the context of other
equality legislation, there might be a case for a different approach to
children. I do not think for a minute that the Opposition have bought
in to the standardisation argument for adults. However, taking that at
face value for the moment, there is an overriding consideration for
children. It is the Children Act approach: the well-being of the child
should be paramount. I suggest to the Minister that that might be the
right framework for determining how the PIP process is designed for
children, including the way in which the eligibility period is
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to the Minister for her interesting comments on the process
of determining who will migrate when, and that we should not assume
that those who would have had to be reassessed for DLA at the age of 16
will automatically be at the top of the queue for an assessment for
PIP. Her commitment to full consultation on that migration process is
very welcome. It will be a good opportunity to ensure that the
disruption young people experience is kept to a minimum. That is an
important transition point for young people in so many ways. There is
often an educational transition, and they may be thinking about
different residential settings at that stage in development. I hope
that, if the Minister is saying that much wider and more detailed
thinking is to be done on the profiling and timing of who migrates and
when, there will be an opportunity to think imaginatively about the
migration of young people. As I have said, although it is not
particularly significant in relation to DLA transition, there are a lot
of surrounding issues. If anything goes wrong with the money for the
family when it is coping with those surrounding issues, that
undoubtedly makes things very
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the Minister’s comments that we will have the
opportunity to review detailed regulations and guidance, as the
migration is implemented. I am confident that they will be subject to
full scrutiny in the House and beyond. The debate has been very useful,
and I am grateful to the Minister for the care with which she has
responded. On the basis on what she has told us, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051327000112">&#160;</a>

We expected a further two and half hours of debate. There is a great
