<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am concerned that the Committee will enter into detailed debate of the Bill without key draft regulations having been made available to us. The Paymaster General said in a written answer that she had placed in the Library two sets of draft regulations we were sent copies of those which contain the main provisions for the introduction of the new tax credits. I am not sure whether that is true. For example, where are the draft regulations specified in clause 3? Where are the many key draft regulations that are set out in clause 5? Where are the draft regulations that apply to clause 10? The Social Security Committee said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that the main draft regulations on FWTC and DPTC should be published and made publicly available so that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment on the detail of the measures proposed."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have confirmed that draft regulations outlining the detailed design of the scheme will be published in time for detailed debate on primary legislation which is, as we all know, the Committee stage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A point of order must be fairly brief and it must be a matter for the Chair. The Financial Secretary will have heard those points.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I shall be brief. The Government are committed to publishing draft regulations in time to assist the Committee in its detailed discussion of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, we have published two draft sets of regulations in time for the start of our proceedings today. As we progress, we shall ensure that other draft regulations are published so that the Committee is provided with background information to the debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Does that mean that the Committee's procedures will have to be slowed down so that the draft regulations can be produced for members to study, or will we debate clauses without at the same time debating relevant regulations?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. A key aspect of the Bill is the regulatory impact assessment. The explanatory notes say that the regulatory impact assessment determines the cost of the Bill to the general public. No doubt the Department will be ready for detailed discussion of the Bill, but I do not understand how we can proceed with the Committee stage until members have seen the regulatory impact assessments and the draft regulations. It will be a short Committee stage 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is. The Bill is short and the Committee stage is likely to be relatively short. I do not understand how we can start proceedings without the regulatory impact assessments and draft regulations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can disabuse the hon. Gentleman. We can start straight away without a problem. Let us get this straight: the hon. Gentleman raised a valid point; the Minister heard it and, I think, will take not of it. However, that is a matter of disagreement. In general, Departments must understand that Committee members want full information when they debate aspects of a Bill, but I am satisfied that that is not a matter for the Chair and that we can proceed in the normal manner. Many of the points that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wants to make will come clear during our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Tax Credits Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and half-past Four o'clock, except on Thursday 4 March when the Committee will meet at half-past Two o'clock only.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I take this opportunity to say how delighted the Paymaster General and I are that you are chairing our proceedings, Mrs. Dunwoody? I have great pleasure to serve as a Minister under your auspices. Everyone would agree that you are that most valuable of Chairmen firm but fair. I look forward to an interesting and constructive Committee stage, as many hon. Members have shown great interest in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is with misty-eyed nostalgia, Mrs. Dunwoody, while I choke back the tears, that I find myself having the pleasure of being on a Committee chaired by you. I was honoured to serve with you on the Transport Select Committee and later on a sub-committee of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I learnt there that you are an extremely able and fair Chairman, but that you can also be a bit tetchy just occasionally.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Never!
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I had not intended, Mrs. Dunwoody, to smarm my way around you so early, but I think that hon. Members have already had an indication of that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Could I point out that the normal Yorkshire way of smarming women is not the one that is generally accepted throughout the rest of the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If my late father were here, he would describe me as "reet smooth"	. I was once described as sartorially inelegant, but I have put on my best suit for this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson </B>(Hull, West and Hessle): It is nice to see the hon. Gentleman giving it an airing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is the best one that I have.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman's remark is most unkind. I am not a champagne socialist, and this is the best that C and A could provide.
<P>
I am concerned that we may find the Committee going on for longer than you Mrs. Dunwoody, I or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would want, for lack of information. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to some of our concerns. As I said on Second Reading, the Bill is peculiarly dependent on a number of pieces of secondary legislation. It also involves a considerable change in how a popular benefit is to be administered, so we shall need to have a good, hard look at the regulations.
<P>
I am glad that the Paymaster General and the Financial Secretary published these two new regulations, particularly because it is nice to see the words, "child care tax credit"	 on a piece of paper relating to Parliament rather than in the newspapers. The Bill is most peculiar in that it does not mention the child care tax credit. We need to know how the regulations will operate, because we must be certain that the mistakes that a number of other countries have made in introducing similar schemes are not repeated.
<P>
I can illustrate why our sittings might be longer and more protracted, and might go well into the summer, by examining the dog that did not bark, to misquote Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Child care tax credits are integral to the Bill, yet it contains no word on how they will operate or affect the public purse.
<BR>

<P>
Over time, we shall need to consider a number of questions, particularly the cost of the provision and who will qualify. Experts such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that as much as £4 billion might be added to the public purse. However, the Government and some of their followers have suggested the more modest sum of approximately £250 million.
<P>
We need to know who will qualify for child care tax credits, and whether the scheme will relate only to registered child care or to a wider circle. The sittings motion gives us insufficient time to debate those matters. They have implications for local government, which will be responsible for regulating the scheme in respect of child care.
<P>
We also need to know the legislation's purpose. Is it intended to get people back into work? Is it intended to ensure equality between those on benefit and those in work, or to create a gap between the two groups? Will interaction between child care tax credits and the WFTC mean that someone who takes up child care as part of his or her profession will automatically trigger WFTC? Will the result simply be the setting up of child care for the mutual support of family members or neighbours?
<P>
Another reason why we need to spend time debating the Bill is the cost of the WFTC 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to put his remarks in context. However, the proposal is narrow and straightforward, and relates specifically to time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes, of course, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was getting ahead of myself, and you were quite right to call me to order. I was simply trying to persuade you of the need for extra time for debate. Much as I might like to spend Tuesdays and Thursdays listening to various points of order, we may well find that they form a regular part of our routine, and that our deliberations need to continue into the summer.
<P>
It is important that we can spend time on the matter. We need to understand and to consider the burdens that will be placed on business. The Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and organisations involved with small businesses have expressed concerns. We must consider the matter thoroughly because the Bill will require employers to deliver the Government's proposals, which will be a considerable burden. Employers would not be happy, therefore, to discover that we had skipped through the Bill in a couple of weeks.
<P>
The Financial Secretary is a reasonable woman, and all those matters can be sorted out. She could say to her colleagues, "I've had a look at Opposition Committee members, and they are reasonable people. If we produce the impact assessment and the various regulations, we might, in time, be able to ensure that Mrs. Dunwoody can plan her Easter break with a degree of certainty."	 I am sure that we are all keen to do that.
<BR>

<P>
In other words, if Labour Members want to expedite the Committee's progress I understand through the usual channels that that is what they want to do they will find that no Opposition Member causes unreasonable delays. However, we need to know what impact the proposals will have on the businesses community. The Minister was previously responsible for small businesses, and I have listened to her speak about them in this country and in Poland. I am sure that the last thing that she wants is for the proposals to cause bankruptcy or liquidation among businesses.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Another reason why our considerations might take longer than you, Mrs. Dunwoody, or I would want is that we are about to replace a successful family credit system with a system that might make our fellow citizens reluctant to apply for assistance. The experience in other countries shows that the Government's proposed method involves a highly stigmatised tax credit system, and that people will be reluctant to apply for assistance. That is why we need to spend some time considering it. It is important to give members of the public the opportunity to lobby Members. The list of Committee members was announced only relatively recently and members of the public and pressure groups will need time before writing to us with their concerns. The Government should take this opportunity to reconsider their proposals.
<P>
The question of fraud is another reason why our considerations may take some time. On Second Reading, hon. Members expressed grave concerns about fraud. Practitioners outside the House who are engaged in the detection of fraud will want to comment on the Government's approach. Unless the Government produce all the regulations, those practitioners will be denied the opportunity of communicating their concerns to this Committee and to the House.
<P>
The last reason why we need some time to discuss the proposals, Mrs. Dunwoody you have been extremely patient and most gracious, for which I am very grateful involves the proposed change in the benefit payments mechanism. The great advantage of family credit is that it is easily understood by the general public, who know how it operates. The new method is not understood by the general public. People who take a firm interest in such matters will want to make representations to us on the benefit payments mechanism.
<P>
For all those reasons, the Financial Secretary should give an undertaking today to go to her Department, give some stick and come back with the regulations. We should not be too bothered if they contained the odd spelling mistake we just want to know what the Government intend to do. She should also give us the impact assessment. If she does that, the Committee's proceedings will run smoothly and magnificently, even without your constant guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. If the Minister gives that undertaking our approach to the sittings motion will involve considerable feelings of bipartisanship.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. If my memory serves me correctly, I have previously sat under your admirable chairmanship in this Committee Room. I remember that the room causes difficulties for Committee members it makes it hard for us to discuss matters in our normal tone of voice and for those listening to our proceedings. Mrs. Dunwoody, I wonder if you could find out whether we could sit in another and more congenial Committee Room on future occasions to give those who wish to hear what we are saying the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> The hon. Lady is right about the acoustics in this Room, and hon. Members will do well to remember that fact when they are speaking. However, the allocation of Committee Rooms is carried out by a higher authority and, although I shall make gentle inquiries, I suspect that we are here for evermore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): Unlike other hon. Members who have spoken, this is my first opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody. Although I am a new Member of Parliament, your reputation goes before you. You are held in high esteem throughout the House, especially among Liberal Democrats, so I look forward to the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, which I am sure will be as wide as has already been suggested.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Suggestions that the Chairman is "wide"	 might not go down well. [Laughter.] Could we proceed with the motion on the amendment paper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I hope to bring to the Committee a distinctive perspective: one that welcomes the Government's approach in allocating extra funds to working families, offers constructive criticism and examines the details, which, after all, is the point of the Committee.
<BR>

<P>
My only other experience of serving on a Standing Committee was with the Committee that scrutinised the social security Bill. We often felt that we had won the arguments, but the Government marched through its troops to force a vote, only to reverse its decision in another place and give in to the very arguments that we had made. That was a somewhat fruitless way of spending our time. I hope that, in this Committee, the Minister and her hon. Friends will listen to reasoned arguments and be prepared to enter into constructive debate. When a valid argument is put to them, I hope that they will not feel that they must not give in as a matter of pride, but will feel that, as a result of such debate, a better Bill may be produced. I have no wish to delay the Committee further and look forward to our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I believe that I had a narrow escape at the beginning of our sitting this morning. Fortunately, I asked your permission before taking my jacket off, Mrs. Dunwoody, and escaped to remove my overcoat just before you noticed it.
<P>
The Committee may need to sit for rather longer than planned for two reasons. The first is because we have not received the impact statement. In our debate, I shall discuss some of the problems experienced by small businesses in my constituency. I should declare an interest at the outset: my wife works part time for a small business in my constituency, which employs nine people, and my father owns and runs a small business outside my constituency. In terms of the amount of time that we have to debate the Bill, I am particularly concerned about the fact that we do not have the impact statement. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) already raised the issue. I understand that we already have some undertakings from the Government on the matter, which was raised on Second Reading, but if there is no proper impact statement, we really must allow time for the various organisations that speak for businesses large as well as small businesses, although small businesses will be most affected to make representations to the Committee, so that we can take them into account in both framing and debating amendments.
<P>
This is a far-reaching Bill, which will effectively impose part of the social security system on the tax system. I understand that the procedure has been tried only once before, in Canada, where it conspicuously failed. To ensure that we debate the Bill properly, it seems to me that we should have the impact statement or at least have plenty of time to allow representations to be made. The second reason why we may need more time is to discuss the important issue of the child care tax credit.
<P>
Will you confirm, Mrs. Dunwoody, that this is definitely not a money Bill and that it will receive full scrutiny in the other place?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is no doubt about that at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I understood that that was the case, but I wanted to have it confirmed.
<P>
The other place will want to focus on those areas of the Bill that have not been fully scrutinised here. The most far-reaching provisions of the Bill are those covering child care in view of the extraordinary difference between the Institute of Fiscal Studies' estimate of the likely cost, which is 20 times the size of the estimate provided by the Government. When we come to the relevant clauses, we shall want to discuss the details, but the problem we face at this stage of the Committee is how on earth we can debate the matter when we do not have the relevant details, which have been left to regulations.
<P>
Given the vast gap between the Government's assessment of the cost and the assessments arrived at by independent bodies, the Committee will have a problem and I am sure that the other place will return to that problem. The very least that the Committee can do is fully to discuss the matter so that our comments are on the record within the framework of a proper committee structure. The regulations will eventually be steam rollered through in a statutory instrument. The view has been expressed on both sides of the House that statutory instruments are little more than a farce in terms of their impact on the legislative process. We must have on the record some proper debates of the likely impact on the family, which is a particular concern of mine I have written a number of pamphlets on the impact of social security and tax measures on the family and on the taxpayer of the gap between £200 million and £4 billion.
<BR>

<P>
I know that you do not want to hear long speeches at this stage, Mrs. Dunwoody, and it would be wrong if I raised specific matters that we shall discuss when we come to the relevant clauses, but it is clear that we shall need a long time in which to discuss those two far-ranging and important matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): I rise briefly for two purposes. The first is to throw myself on your mercy, Mrs. Dunwoody, for a youthful indiscretion. While I wish to join in all the commendations of your chairmanship, which I now have the good fortune to experience for the first time, I remind you that during a moment of youthful excess in the House last year, during a debate on the state of British railways, I fear that I clashed with you and even described your views as "tosh"	. I can only hope that, in confessing freely to that appalling indiscretion, you will take mercy on someone who was then in his first year in the House and that your neutral chairmanship will not be affected in any way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that I can say without upsetting the hon. Gentleman that I had not remembered the incident. Perhaps I should tell him that criticism of the Chair might get him into rather more trouble.
<P>
It is only this Parliament that seems to be awash with sugary contributions to Chairmen at the start of Committees. My advice is that the best way of keeping in with Chairmen is to get on with the task in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I shall bear that in mind, Mrs. Dunwoody, and will not seek further to sugar your tea.
<P>
Because of the decision that was taken just before Christmas on the sittings of the full House, we shall be sitting at different hours on Thursdays and Tuesdays. That is still unusual for Committees and we should bear in mind that if we are to meet regularly at 9 o'clock on Thursday mornings, that will place a strain on the Clerks of the House and of the Committee, given the early hour at which they may need to start in order to have all the paperwork ready. We need to consider that when we debate whether to sit on Thursday mornings and Thursday afternoons.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am intrigued to note that the sittings motion also refers to sittings at half-past 10 o'clock and half-past 4 o'clock, 9 o'clock and half-past 4 o'clock, 2 o'clock and so on. In an age when we are moving towards the use of the 24-hour clock, modernising the House and being told that everything must be new, why do not the Government table sittings motions that say 10.30 and 1600 hours? Were I of a nautical bent I confess that I am not I would know how to convert that into various forms of bells. It occurs to me that, as part of the process of updating and amending the provisions of the House, we may want to look at the phraseology of sittings motions.
<P>
Another part of the sittings motion especially intrigues me that on Thursday 4 March, proceedings will take place at half past 2 o'clock, or 14.30 hours. Why should different provisions apply on that Thursday? Does the Paymaster General or the Minister have an engagement that afternoon? Are important matters expected to be debated on the Floor of the House? Before the Committee decides whether the sittings motion is acceptable, will the Minister explain why those different provisions apply?
<BR>

<P>
The sittings motion contains many dangers, which my hon. Friends have already set out for example, the difficulty of ensuring that hon. Members have adequate information for consideration of this important Bill and I shall not try the Committee's patience by repeating those points. Before we decide on the sittings motion, will the Minister assure us that she and her capable team of officials will respond to all the points that have been made on the need for adequate information? I would also welcome an explanation of the different provisions for Thursday 4 March unless, of course, that is a misprint for Thursday 4 February.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> May I just say, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I welcome your down-to-earth approach to Committees. It is a typical female approach, if I may say so.
<P>
I should like some advice on how we can discuss some of the issues that I raised on Second Reading, which I have tabled as new clauses. It may be that I am not au fait with procedure, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I noticed from your selection of amendments that my new clauses had not been included. As we do not have the detailed regulations that are required, it will be difficult to discuss important issues such as how to divide the child care tax credit between parents with shared care of children, how to deal with the absence of provision for registered child minders of children between the ages of eight, 14 and 16 if they are disabled, and how to define the status of au pairs. It is important to discuss such details, but, from an examination of the Bill, it appears that it will be exceedingly difficult to do so in Committee.
<P>
It is therefore important to ensure that the sittings motion allows sufficient time for such issues to be raised and discussed. I am sure that none of us wish to be faced with the kind of case work that emerged from the Child Support Agency legislation. That legislation had the support of the House in principle, but he impact of the regulations was not thoroughly discussed. It is vital that we do not make such a mistake again. Discussion of the child care tax credit may require a considerable amount of time, as it will be of concern to all Committee members. The lack of available regulations and the regulatory impact assessment, promised though they are, is of major concern.
<P>
For instance, many of my hon. Friends have already referred to the impact on small business, but, despite Ministers' assurances that businesses have been closely involved in discussions on the Bill, even large businesses have not realised how much work they will be involved in or the problems that may arise with their own staff as news leaks out as it inevitably does about people's personal circumstances that those people may have wished to keep to themselves. Indeed, the impact of the wallet-to-purse debate also needs a great deal of discussion and clarification. There are options, as I understand it, but there are all the hidden traps that go with the many and varied circumstances in which people find themselves in our increasingly complex society.
<P>
Therefore, I too believe that we must spend a great deal of time on fairly detailed examination of the impact of the Bill, which will only be seen by regulation. Indeed, that regulation is not to hand yet. I support my Front-Bench colleagues' cautiousness about the progress that we shall make on the Bill until all the regulation is available to us and until we can assess it and have the comments of those most closely involved not only business, but the many organisations that represent those most directly affected: those who should, or could, have access to these tax credits, which go much wider than any that we have seen before.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> May I add my welcome to you,Mrs. Dunwoody, without being in any way sugary? I too, want to express concern that, because of the lack of a regulatory impact assessment and the absence of an important draft of the regulations connected with the Bill, you and I may still be in this Committee while the Finance Bill proceeds elsewhere without our participation, which would be a shame.
<P>
The point regarding the regulatory impact assessment is serious. It is not only Committee members who do not have access to this important study; those who have to implement the Bill, in businesses, small and large, who have not seen the regulatory impact assessment, cannot judge the Bill's impact on business and on their costs, and therefore cannot make representations to Committee members during our deliberations. My concern is that the Committee stage will be prolonged way beyond the dates mentioned in the sittings motions. The last date mentioned is 4 March, but the Committee may well continue beyond that, simply because people outside the House and Committee members will want to look at the regulatory impact assessment in great detail. I am surprised that Ministers have not managed to bring the study to the Committee on its first day, as they said straightforwardly on Second Reading that the impact assessment and the details of the Bill would be available for the Committee stage.
<P>
I am also concerned that the sittings motion does not allow enough time to debate some important issues. when the Bill was published, the Treasury announced with a great fanfare that the new working families tax credit would guarantee the lowest-paid families a full-time income of about £10,000 a year. We keep hearing from the Financial Secretary the figures of £10,000 a year and £190 a week. I want to be sure that every Committee member understands where these numbers come from and how they are calculated. I do not believe that the time allowed in the sittings motion will enable us to do that. For example, the £190 a week 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying not to be restrictive, but we must differentiate between a discussion on the sittings motion and one on the content of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is aware of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall try to adhere to your strictures.
<P>
I am trying to emphasise the importance of the timing of the Committee stage. I am talking not about a normal costing, but about the fact that the Government have trumpeted the figure of £10,000 a year £190 a week. I shall not try your patience, Mrs. Dunwoody, by going into the detailed calculation now because I would prefer to raise the matter when we have sufficient time, but it will show clearly that the difference between the weekly income from working families tax credit and the family credit that it replaces will be as little as £3 a week. To trumpet that as the first time that low-income working families will receive £10,000 a year is not right. The Committee needs the chance to determine whether my claims are right and whether the Government's calculations are correct.
<P>
In addition, all the other taxes the stealth taxes, such as increased duty on petrol and beer, and the lower married couples allowance that have been imposed on low-income and high-income earners in the Government's first 18 months have made many low-income people worse off. I hope that there is sufficient time for me to raise those issues during our debates.
<P>
I am also concerned about withdrawal rates. On Second Reading, the Paymaster General trumpeted the fact that she had removed all 100 per cent. withdrawal rates. I am not sure that the sittings motion will give the Committee time to debate that complicated and important issue in full. I believe that some withdrawal rates are way in excess of 100 per cent. I want the Government to convince the Committee that they have removed all the 100 per cent. withdrawal rates.
<P>
I am also worried about the concept of stigma. Little was said about that on Second Reading.
<BR>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must forgive me, but the sittings motion is narrow. It is in order for the hon. Gentleman to mention what he wants to consider during the course of our debates, and it is imperative that he should relate that to the question of time; but it is not in order to debate the detail of specific points that he will raise later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am trying to stick to your strictures,Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You will, Mr. Gibb.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is difficult to express how important timing is without sometimes touching on the arguments, but I shall try to avoid that at all costs.
<P>
We also want to debate at great length the issue of stigma, which was trumpeted by the Government as an important reason for introducing the Bill. Several sittings are needed to debate that in full and to be sure that it will reduce the stigma attached to claiming benefits. Because I am concerned that the Bill will increase stigma, I want the Committee to be sure that the proposal will increase take-up rates, not reduce them. It will take time and effort to grasp the issues at stake, and I hope that we shall have sufficient time in which to do so.
<P>
It is not just Committee members who are concerned; outside bodies are also worried. The Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses may want to make further representations on the issue during the Bill's Committee stage. I regret the lack of draft regulations explaining in detail how the tax credit will be administered, which should have been available at the beginning of our proceedings. Unless there is sufficient time to debate the issues and to enable outside bodies to make representations, we will not do the House or the public a service in our scrutiny of the Bill's detail.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Government have not considered the right hon. Member for Birkenhead(Mr. Field) to be an acceptable member of the Committee. I believe that he has useful points to make, as he did on Second Reading, and it would be better if he could join in our deliberations.
<P>
We also need to debate at great length the issue of fraud, which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead mentioned. A key role of Parliament is to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely. Therefore I make no apology for wanting to spend time discussing fraud. The system that the Government propose to adopt is similar to systems in the United States and Canada, where fraud is a crucial consideration. In the United States, 15 per cent. of spending went on fraud. If that figure were applied to the Bill, the Government's figures show that the British taxpayer would lose £750 million a year. Therefore, the Committee should spend significantly more time than is set out in the sittings motion discussing the important question of fraud. I was disappointed that the Bill's architect, Martin Taylor, had not even considered the Canadian system when he devised and recommended his system to the Government. The Committee should spend some time studying the Canadian system we should do the work that the architect of the Government's scheme failed to do.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a case for saying that the need to take evidence from abroad means that the Bill should be considered in a special Standing Committee.
<BR>

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will not be tempted to pursue that suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Select Committee on Social Security spent some time and three reports debating the concept of the working families tax credit. There is great merit in taking evidence, in particular because the sittings motion would telescope the whole debate into a short time and would leave insufficient time for outside bodies to make representations to Committee members. There is a case for converting the Committee into a type of Select Committee so that outside bodies can give their evidence directly to us. Alternatively, we could extend the sittings motion, which would give those bodies sufficient time to submit evidence to Committee members.
<P>
Another issue that concerns me enormously is accounting. Although some might term accountancy a "boffin"	 issue, I hope that the Committee will consider it seriously. One of the key roles of a Standing Committee and of Parliament is to ensure that when taxpayers' money is spent it is properly accounted for, presented in the books that the House of Commons produces and made available to Members and to the public.
<P>
I am concerned that Committee members have not yet grasped some of the accounting difficulties that are associated with the working families tax credit. In the Red Book, for example, 20 per cent. of that credit was accounted for as tax forgone and the Office for National Statistics insisted that all of that credit should be accounted for as public expenditure. The situation is complicated and the Committee should spend several sittings examining how that credit is accounted for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that one the problems with the sittings motion is the mysterious two hours' time difference on 4 March, when the Committee will sit not at 4.30 pm but at 2.30 pm? That might mean that if an accountant had information that was relevant to the matter that my hon. Friend raised and his lunch overran, he would not be able to present his information in time to a Committee member.
<BR>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can put Committee members out of their agony. There will be Treasury Questions on the day in question, and it was assumed that Committee members would want to take part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The issue of accounting goes further than the point that I made previously about presentation in the Red Book and the position in the pre-Budget report. The tables in the Red Book and in the Green Book present the whole of the working families tax credit as a reduction in tax receipts. That impacts on what is perceived to be the level of taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Could you clarify your statement? I am a little confused about Thursday, 4 March. I thought that Question Time on Thursdays was at 11.30 am. Is there any relevant business immediately following Treasury Questions on 4 March? I am confused, but perhaps I have missed something about the new system on Thursdays.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was going to deal with that matter briefly in my speech. Treasury Questions are on 4 March and it was considered that it would help all Committee members if we sat a little later than usual that day. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not want to get into a debate on this matter now. We could take it up during the Minister's speech.
<BR>
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As I was saying, the accounting issue requires considerable debate in Committee because it is not merely an issue for "boffin"	 accountants I am an accountant, as the Committee will know or chartered accountants, but an issue of enormous concern to the whole House and to the public. How the tables are presented in the Red and Green Books is important. It is wrong to take out working family tax credit and indicate that the percentage of tax taken by the Government is less than it would otherwise appear to be. So it is important that the Committee spends time to ensure that the costs of working family tax credit are properly accounted for.
<P>
That leads me to another concern: the cost of child care tax credit. How can there be such a huge discrepancy between the Government's figure of £200 million and the figure of £4 billion from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which is a respectable organisation? It will take considerable time to reconcile those two figures and we need to examine the evidence from the IFS to find out why there is such a difference between those two figures. I should like to hear a detailed explanation from the Government. Again, that will take a considerable time.
<P>
Those are large sums of money £4 billion is equivalent to about 1p or 1.5p in income tax. The Committee has a big responsibility to devote sufficient time to those issues so that the House and the public can be assured that taxpayers' money is being wisely spent, that the forecast and figures presented by the Government are accurate and that there is no discrepancy between the figures provided by the IFS and those provided by the Government.
<P>
Another important issue is the costs that businesses will have to withstand in administering the working families tax credit. I want members of the Committee to think how we can mitigate the cost, especially to small businesses. For example, should we give some sort of compensation to small businesses for administering the benefit in the same way as administrative help is given to small companies who administer maternity pay? A case can be made for doing so and I should like the Committee to examine it in detail and consider the concerns of the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses. It is yet another tax that businesses must administer and another burden on business, on top of pay-as-you-earn, statutory sick pay and maternity pay. It is all very well to say that it is just one more small thing, but those small things accumulate, and it would be unfortunate to impose such huge burdens on businesses in Britain as to make Britain uncompetitive internationally.
<BR>

<P>
I am also concerned that the Committee should spend sufficient time considering dependency. The key aspect of the benefit is that it will lower the tapers from 70 per cent. to 55 per cent. That will bring 400,000 more families within the net a figure that the Government are happy to trumpet but I am concerned that it will increase, rather than decrease, dependency. We need a long debate on dependency. Do we want to increase or decrease it? I believe that the Government have said that they want to reduce dependency, but that seems to contradict the measures in the Bill, which will increase the number of dependent people by some 400,000. Extending the taper will cost £1.5 billion and it also involves giving state benefits to people who are earning more than £30,000 a year. That is odd and the Committee needs carefully to consider whether we want the taper for the benefit to rise as high as £38,000 for a couple with five children, which seems extraordinary.
<P>
In conclusion, this is an important Bill, but it will have precisely the opposite effect to that which the Government intend. Therefore, the Committee must ensure that it devotes sufficient time to considering all those issues dependency, cost, fraud and the accounting aspects of the Bill. The sittings motion will not allow sufficient time for us to do so.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove):</B> I will echo some of the remarks made by my hon. Friends because I agree that the sittings motion does not allow sufficient time to discuss the many important issues raised by the legislation. Although the Bill appears to be short and to contain little, it constitutes a huge extension of the welfare state and the burden placed on businesses. They will be asked to become the delivery mechanism of the welfare state, which is a major difference from their current core activity to create wealth and provide jobs for the rest of us. The Bill therefore raises some major issues, and I agree with my hon. Friends that the sittings motion allows insufficient time for debate.
<P>
I am intrigued to see that no member of the Social Security Select Committee is among the Labour members of this committee. The Select Committee has produced three reports on the working families tax credit. I am a member of that Committee and I have therefore had significant exposure to the argument surrounding the introduction of the proposal. Many Labour members of that Committee seemed not to be persuaded by the merits of the measure. The Select Committee heard from left-wing lobby groups about difficulties that might arise from the measure with regard to the purse-versus-wallet issue. It also heard from business organisations that might be considered to be on the right of the political spectrum. The expressed deep concern about the measure's impact on business and the way in which it will diminish wealth-creating activity.
<P>
Many Labour members of the Social Security Select Committee were worried to hear that a whole spectrum of organisations is unhappy about what the Government are doing. They are loyal Labour Members who would hesitate to speak out against the Government. However, intriguingly, they are not participating in this Committee 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We can discuss Committee members, but it is difficult to use the sittings motion to discuss people who are not Committee members.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Forgive me, Mrs. Dunwoody. My point, which I perhaps made a little laboriously, is that the Bill raises difficult issues, which I tried to illustrate by reference to my experiences in the Social Security Select Committee. I was trying to bolster the Oppositions argument that the importance of the issues requires that we should be allowed more time to discuss them.
<P>
In our view, the case has yet to be made for the abolition of family credit, which has been a very successful benefit that really helps people on low incomes. The Bill will introduce an incredibly bureaucratic change, which people will not understand properly. We are expected to believe that it will give low-income families the incentive to work, but we have been given no evidence to support that assertion. We are changing our system in a complicated way on the basis of what is simply a belief. The Committee should therefore consider the matter further.
<P>
I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on the extension of the welfare state. According to the Government's figures, in addition to what is being spent on family credit, an extra £1.5 billion will be spent. That is a major extension of the welfare state, which needs to be considered further, as do the 400,000 families who will also benefit from the measure. People who pay top-rate tax will benefit from the working families tax credit. It is extraordinary to extend the welfare state in that way. To feel confident that we are doing the best thing, that public money is being spent wisely and that the Bill will carry a broad measure of public support, we need to spend a great deal of time deliberating that issue. It is hard to believe that people who do not pay top-rate tax will find it acceptable that people who do will be eligible for state benefits.
<P>
We also need to spend considerable time discussing the wallet-versus-purse issues, which were raised by the Social Security Select Committee. We want to ask the Government whether they will continue to allow people to receive the benefit by cheque through the letter box of their own front door, rather than through their wage slip.
<BR>

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are providing choice for two-parent families. The wife, if she does not work, can receive the benefit, as now, through family credit and it will not go to her husband through the working families tax credit. That choice should be widened to allow others to claim the credit in the normal way and we want to discuss that further.
<P>
We also want to discuss the great discrepancy between the estimates of the cost of child care tax credit. The Government's estimate is £200 million and the IFS estimate is £4 billion, which is a huge sum of money that must be examined carefully. The Bill should be framed in such a way as to ensure that the Government's estimate of the cost of the child care tax credit is accurate. We want to deliberate carefully on the framing of the proposals, so that the cost is in line with the Government's estimate and does not rise to the level of £4 billion suggested by the IFS which would be a severe strain on public finance. No member of the Committee wants that.
<P>
The burden of the provisions on businesses is a major issue. I am sure that all members of the Committee try to talk to businesses as much as possible about their activities and the issues facing them. Even major employers, to whom I have spoken and who are endeared to taking a long, hard look at the Government's proposals for changes in employment legislation and other legislation affecting their businesses have not woken up to the working families tax credit and how it will affect their businesses. Major employers do not yet understand that they are being asked to make an extraordinary change and to provide a delivery mechanism for the benefit system. If they have not worked out that that proposal is coming down the track towards them, the little jeweller's shop on Bromsgrove high street will not know what will hit him in one year. He will be greatly affected by the regulations. We need time to get the message to employers, so that businesses understand it and can make representations. We are short of an impact study from the Government on what will be required. Payment will not be made through the tax coding, but will be a separate item on the payroll. It is an extraordinary change and businesses need time to understand what is happening and to be able to make representations so that the Committee can take account of them.
<P>
I end on a note of further agreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on the way in which the Government intend to account for the change in the working families tax credit. It is important that the public understand where their taxes are spent and how much is being spent on the benefit system. People should be absolutely clear about what they are doing to support the less well off. The Government are proposing to account for the working families tax credit by putting it off the balance sheet so that they can pretend that it is not really being spent. Money that is raised in taxes is not the Government's money; it is taxpayers' money, which has been collected from them and they have a right to know how it is being spent. The Government's proposals for accounting for the money lead me to think that taxpayers will not understand how it is being spent. We need time to cross-examine the Minister on why the Government propose to account for the change in that way and whether she thinks that it is fair, and right and proper that they intend to proceed in that way, and to explain to the public what is happening. I urge that the sittings motion be extended, so that that important issue may be properly discussed.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> By leave of the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody, I am pleased that we have been able to tease out from the Government the reason why we are not sitting on the morning of Thursday 4 March. Although having to face Treasury questions immediately after this Committee finishes may be a problem for the Labour party, it is certainly not a problem for the Opposition. The decision not to sit on that morning may be for the convenience of only one or two members of the Committee who may have to take part in Treasury questions, but it is a consequence of the changes that the Government have driven through the Opposition were against 9 o'clock sittings on Thursdays and they should accept those consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is doing Labour Members a disservice. A number of senior Labour Members voted against the ridiculous new arrangements. I have consulted with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who says that he has no objection to meeting at the normal time on 4 March. Would the Government care to withdraw that part of the sittings motion?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am happy to accept the views of my hon. Friend. He went on to make my point, which was to plead for an amendment to the sittings motion to allow us to sit on the morning of Thursday 4 March and get through the business. We need as much time as possible to discuss this Bill. The Budget will be announced on 9 March and I am sure that Ministers will want the Bill to be out of Committee by that time. I cannot see a better reason for sitting at 9 o'clock on 4 March than that the Budget is on the following Tuesday. I do not know whether it is possible to amend the sittings motion. I seek your advice on that matter, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clearly, it is not possible to accept an amendment of that kind at this point.
<P>
<B>Ms Margaret Moran </B>(Luton, South): I have come to the conclusion that some Opposition Members believe, in the famous words, that their speeches have to be eternal to be immortal. I am sure, that under your chairmanship, Mrs Dunwoody, we will deal more briskly with some of the more substantive issues. It is an important Bill for many families 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must make it clear that hon. Members who are out of order will be called to order. Everyone has the right to debate the sittings motion and if they step out of order they will be told so firmly.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am sure that that is the case. I merely strive to seek your assurance that some of the comments directed at Treasury Ministers on the Floor of the House, some of which were sexist, will not be repeated. I am sure that Ministers are well able to take care of themselves and that you will ensure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that there is good order in the Committee. However, it would be a waste of the Committee's time and offensive to many Labour Members to hear such comments repeated in this important debate.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) pointed out, the Select Committee on Social Security has debated the working families tax credit at great length and there has been time for representations. I am sure that Opposition Members have received representations from voluntary groups, lobby organisations and businesses. I have received such representations, and if Opposition Members have not, I suggest that they look to their post bag. As outlined in the sittings motion, there will be time for further representations and I am sure that Opposition Members will not want to lengthen this debate unduly. There are serious issues for scrutiny, for example, the way in which the Bill relates to housing benefit, and the fact that some businesses are in favour of some aspects of the Bill and are not merely concerned about the cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Name them.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> I shall name some of the businesses in my constituency at the appropriate point in this debate; this is not the appropriate point. Businesses are concerned that previous policies have not fostered family-friendly employment and have worked to their disadvantage, to the extent that women returners and women employees in particular, and families in general, often found it difficult to stay in employment because of the previous Government's economic policies and employment practices.
<P>
In the interests of all of us, and particularly of families, who stand to gain £17 a week as a result of the Bill, which I know Conservative Members oppose, it would be 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise for intervening on a contribution on a sittings motion, but I want to demonstrate why we need time to debate the Bill at greater length. Can the hon. Lady explain how that £17 a week is calculated, given that she has just quoted it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. I am sure the hon. Lady will not be able to do that.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> The point that I was trying to make, which the hon. Gentleman appears to have wholly disregarded, is that we want to reach the substantive part of the debate, so that we can illuminate those calculations instead of arguing over how long we should spend on the Bill. My hon. Friends certainly wish to get to the substantive debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I apologise for my intervention, which relates solely to the sittings motion. Does the hon. Lady agree that, so that we can work our way speedily through the Bill, it would be helpful if we had some regulations in front of us that demonstrated the calculations? [Hon. Members: "There are some."	] I realise that there are some calculations, but we want to see the global sum. No one expects the hon. Lady to do the arithmetic in her head, but I have sufficient confidence in her to know that, if she had the appropriate regulations, she would be able to point to the way in which the figures were calculated.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that the Minister has already dealt with that point. We have draft regulations before us and we have been assured of speedy detail in relation to the calculations. The hon. Gentleman should look, as other hon. Members have done, at some of the figures that are before us and discuss them with some of the interested organisations, so that they too can give their views on the veracity of the figures. I am, reassured by the Minister that we shall have those details before us soon.
<P>
I sincerely hope that the attempts at procrastination and at lengthening our deliberations are not simply another sign of Conservative Members opposition to the principle of working families tax credit and that there will be full scrutiny of the Bill to ensure that it is enacted within a reasonable time for the benefit of all the families that we represent.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As you have pointed out during the debate, Mrs. Dunwoody, this is a narrowly framed motion for the Committee's consideration this morning.
<P>
The Bill is a significant step forward in the Government's aim to make work pay and encourage the move from welfare to work. I want to reply to the point about Treasury questions, as it reflects on the sittings motion.
<P>
Last Thursday, when the first Treasury questions were held under the new arrangements for Thursdays in the House, more than 100 Members of Parliament were present, which I understand is an all-time record attendance and an indication that the new arrangements are working well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I suspect that that might be because there were more questions about the Chancellor's travel arrangements that anything else, but there are not 100 members of the Committee. I suspect that only one or two will be inconvenienced. We shall sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Committees sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays while they are deliberating. Surely the Financial Secretary is not suggesting that Treasury questions are something special and more important than, say, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions questions, which are on a Tuesday. Despite the popularity of Treasury questions, why is it necessary to inconvenience this Committee for the sake of two Treasury Ministers? The Financial Secretary is more than capable of coping. I have seen her at the Dispatch Box. She does not need 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am just coming to an end. The Financial Secretary does not need to do any last-minute swotting. She has command of her subject. She can be here with us before she appears in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have many weaknesses and one of my key weaknesses is that I am susceptible to flattery, so I thank the hon. Gentleman. However, may I tell him as gently as I can I am sure that it has not escaped his notice that this is a Treasury Bill? That is why we were anxious to provide for the convenience not only of hon. Members but of officials, and to ensure that that particular sitting could take place in a way that was convenient for hon. Members.
<P>
I am shocked and stunned by the hon. Gentleman's slur on Members of Parliament and the reasons that he gave for, why they turn up to Treasury questions. Surely hon. Members on both sides turn up for Treasury questions to ask the Executive deep and searching questions about the state of the economy. I am sure that, after a moment of careful consideration, the hon. Gentleman will want to reconsider his remark.
<BR>

<P>
This motion is narrowly framed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry, but I thought that the hon. Lady was about to sit down. I am sure that she would like to assure the Committee about the remaining regulations. The hon. Member for Luton, South (Ms Moran) said that she was confident that the Financial Secretary would produce the other regulations. Can the Financial Secretary tell us when we will see the other regulations, roughly how many there will be and when we are likely to have the impact assessment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I said on the point of order that was raised at the beginning of our sitting, the detailed regulations, including the regulatory impact assessment, will be provided, so that hon. Members can take them into account during our detailed discussions on the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for her statement on when the regulations and the regulatory impact assessment will be available. With a bit of luck, we shall go on to discuss clause 1. Opposition Members have tabled amendments to remove the word "tax"	 from clause 1, which will have a regulatory impact effect on businesses but, as we do not have the regulatory impact assessment, we cannot bring that into the discussion of amendments to clause 1. When will we have the regulatory impact assessment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I take issue with the hon. Lady. The draft regulations that have been laid for the convenience of the Committee will give members of the Committee the full background to inform their discussions on clause 1. As the hon. Lady will know, of the issues relating to business and the impact on business are covered in clause 5. We shall ensure that all the information is available for the Committee by the time that we reach that clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Financial Secretary has been generous, but it may have escaped her notice that we are asking specific questions, most of which revolve around the word "when"	. When will we have the documents? Will it be this week, or next? Do we take it that other regulations will be produced before the Committee is finished? If so, when they will be produced and how many will there be? The principal question is, "When?"	 We are sure that the Financial Secretary will produce them, but we need to know when.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have told the hon. Gentleman and I do not want to labour the point. I have assured him and the Committee that the information will be available when we discuss the detail of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I must make some progress.
<P>
This is a narrowly framed motion, which sets out the days and times when the Committee will sit. A number of the Opposition's points are relevant and they were also made on Second Reading. I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of Opposition Members it would be impertinent of me to advise them on this, tempting though it may be to frame amendments that will be accepted for debate by you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The framework of the sittings motion sets out clearly how our deliberations ought to proceed it is for the convenience of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Financial Secretary's response is unacceptable and inadequate. She said that the regulatory impact assessment may not be ready until we debate clause 5. This is only an 18-clause Bill. Therefore, we will not receive the regulatory impact assessment until we are a third of the way through the Bill's Committee stage. It is vital information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I may have misread the Order Paper, but the Government seem to have planted a question that will result in the publication today of the regulatory impact assessment. I do not know whether that helps.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I know from experience that the Government often say that they will give an answer shortly. There is no certainty that the regulatory impact assessment will be published today, and I want an assurance that it will be. If the Financial Secretary cannot provide the assessment, I will raise a point of order to ask whether you will reconsider your ruling, Mrs. Dunwoody, about suspending the sitting and not allowing the Committee to debate clause 1 until we receive it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is that a point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On that narrow point of order, I must say that it is not only this Government who are in the habit of pursuing legislation when regulations are outstanding without giving sufficient information, or all the information to which Members think that they are entitled. There is nothing to prevent us from discussing clause 1. That is absolutely clear.

As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Certain benefits to be known as tax credits</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 7, leave out first `tax'.
<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 4, in page 1,line 10, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 5, in page 1, line 11, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 11, in schedule 1, page 10, line 6, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 12, in schedule 1 page 10, line 8, leave out `tax'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We reach a question that rather startled the Paymaster General on Second Reading. I asked the hon. Lady what was the purpose of changing the system to involve a tax rather than using the benefits system? That goes to the heart of the matter. Many points that we raised during our debate on the sittings motion relate to that question.
<P>
The Government are embarking on a major new venture and they are changing the role of Government Departments, including that of the Treasury, which will be actively involved in social policy. Committee members will have examined the research paper that the Library supplied. On page 30 of that paper, Professor John Hills neatly sums up the position. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The dominance of the Treasury in making welfare and social policy is new and striking. Not only have most of the significant developments been made as part of its Budget and spending arrangements, but the tax system is also being used as an explicit instrument of social policy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We tabled our amendments with that background in mind.<P>

<P>
The research paper also quotes the former Chancellor, Mr. Lawson, who discussed the tax credit system in his book "The View from No. 10"	 I apologise for my unintentional Freudian slip; his book is called "The View from No. 11."	 In his book, he points out a significant difference. In general, tax liability is based on individual income, but the working families tax credit involves examining an individual's and a family's income and capital. Mr. Lawson felt that that caused some problems.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to Mr. Martin Taylor's startling admission in the evidence that he gave to the Select Committee that he was not terribly familiar with the Canadian system. The Government are going to go down that road, so it is worth understanding the problems of that system. the working income supplement, which was introduced in Canada in the early 1990s, proved to be a disaster. It was extremely unpopular and riddled with opportunities to commit fraud. That demonstrates that when a Conservative Government are returned to office, one of the first problems that we will have to tackle is that of the working facilities tax credit. We may have to mirror 
<H4><center>[Mrs. Marion Roe in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis </B>(Bury, South): The hon. Gentleman spoke about the Conservative Government returning to office, which is slightly optimistic, but if they were to do so at some stage, would they repeal the working families tax credit, and what would they put in its place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as I had not noticed that you had taken over as Chairman, Mrs. Roe. It is a real pleasure to have you sharing the chairmanship of our deliberations. Mrs. Dunwoody warned us about being too flowery, but I recall serving on a Committee with the right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) and I must say that the sweetness that hon. Members of both sides of the Committee expressed towards Mrs. Dunwoody, and will undoubtedly express towards you, Mrs. Roe, is but nothing compared with what the right hon. Gentleman doles out to Committee Chairmen. You are very welcome, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall now deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis). I was once given some very valuable advice about Committees, which was I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) will defend me on this that the Whips are not always one's friends. They sometimes ask hon. Members to make silly points that they regret. [Hon. Members: "Withdraw."	] I know that that is a controversial matter and I shall probably regret saying it, but I believe that the advice is reasonably true.
<P>
When we return to power, as we undoubtedly will in slightly more than two years' time, there will be a considerable clamour among the populace I suspect that even the hon. Gentleman will be clamouring for us to repeal this measure and replace it with a family income supplement for working families, which is a better means of delivery. The hon. Gentleman should not think for a moment that we will repeal the social support that this measure provides that is not our intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have not finished my reply, but if the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
We are concerned because we are to replace a system that, we admit, could be improved with one that has wholly failed in two parts of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lewis:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
I am somewhat confused because I asked you whether you would repeal the working families tax credit, and what you would replace it with 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman kindly address his remarks through the Chair? The word "you"	 must not be used in that way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lewis:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to family income supplement as a possible alternative to working families tax credit and started to hint at what the Conservatives might do if they came to power. Will he clarify whether the Conservatives would repeal the working families tax credit if they were returned to power and, if so, say what they would replace it with?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he is confused, and his remarks reveal that he certainly is on this matter. We are saying, quite clearly, that when we return to power in a little more than two years' time, we shall almost certainly have to rejig this measure. The reason why we will have to do that relates to the amendment, which is concerned with whether the benefit should be delivered through a hybrid tax system or directly through the benefits system. I hope that we will debate that, and not "You said this. You will do this. You made this commitment."	 That is not helpful to the Committee. I would prefer us to deal with whether the proposed measure provides a good mechanism for delivering help to working families on relatively low incomes, and I contend that it does not. That is why working  income supplement has disappeared in Canada without any regret from people on both left and right of the Canadian political system. Superficially the system is similar to the United States earned income tax credit, but there are also some significant differences, which are largely cultural.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that he would prefer the assistance to working families to be delivered through the benefits system rather than the tax system. The previous Administration did not have a good record on keeping control of benefits. The social security budget rose enormously between 1992 and 1997. If the hon. Gentleman were to succeed in retaining the benefit within the benefits system rather than the tax system, and if his party were ever returned to power, the inevitable consequence would be a cut in the benefit, and working families would not enjoy the benefits that will be delivered to them as a result of this new measure, securely through the tax system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but he seems to be contradicting himself. He said that under the Conservatives there was no control of social security, which is bad, and then said that if the Conservatives return to power they will cut social security benefit, which is also bad. The hon. Gentleman should have listened to my point about the Whips not always being his best friends. I have before me a table produced by the House, which clearly demonstrates that during the penultimate year of the previous Conservative Government social security spending fell by 1 per cent. and increased by 1 per cent. the following year. Under the Labour Government, social security spending is due to grow by 4.9 per cent. this year, 2.7 per cent. next year and 3.4 per cent. the year after. That hardly coincides with the pledge given by the Prime Minister during his famous speech to the parliamentary Labour party at Church house, when he said that he would cut back on the social security budget.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The benefits budget was inflated under the Conservatives not because they had a great commitment to social security, but because delivery of benefits was not linked to generation of work. The Labour Government aim to reduce the benefits bill not by cutting benefit to those who need it, but by delivering it in a new way that will encourage people to return to work. That is the point of the working families tax credit. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has grasped that yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I think that I am a smidgen ahead of the hon. Gentleman. I have told him that he should not rely on hand-outs. If he is saying that the measure will be judged on the number of people who return to work, we accept that challenge. If he is saying that the measure will ensure that people leave benefit and return to work, there is good sense in that. But that will not happen. The bill will increase dependency, not reduce it. It will increase the social security budget and the Prime Minister's boast at Church house will become ashes in his mouth.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the working families tax credit is very similar to our family credit, except that it is paid by the Treasury instead of the social security system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right and has deprived me of a phrase that I intended to use later when I come to rebranding; the Government have rebranded the benefit. Clause 12 allows the same forms to be used. It is rather like the end of George Orwell's "Animal Farm"	 when the pigs turn into people. It will be difficult to tell the difference. The only difference is the way in which 
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a second because we share the same hairdresser.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> Where?
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Downstairs.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Obviously, downstairs for goodness sake.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. May I welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Roe? I am sure that you will keep us in good order. I hope that you will forgive me if I should fail to use the proper language. References to "Animal Farm"	 are apt in this place, although in saying so I do not wish to insult hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman commented on the expenditure level. I wonder whether he can bring himself to answer a question that was put many times on Second Reading, and which will doutbless be asked today and on subsequent days when the Committee sits. What is his party's intention regarding the benefit associated with the transfer from family credit to the working families tax credit? If I understand him correctly, if his party were lucky enough to regain office he would cut that benefit and thereby reduce the amount of money targeted on children and women in poverty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> In essence, there would be no significant difference.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> There would be a difference of £1.5 billion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady repeats, quite charmingly, the figure of £1.5 billion. However, the problem with the system, which resembles the Canadian system, is that it takes a scatter gun approach. It does not target simply those on low incomes; dependency is taken higher up the scale.
<P>
In her previous post, the Paymaster General said in reply to a parliamentary question that the threshold would rise to as much as £38,000 a year. Hon. Members replied that such a person would have to have five children. The point is that, in deciding the level at which families on low income should be looked after, it make not a jot of sense for the state to look towards those who pay higher levels of income tax.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for, shall we say, humouring me. Let me make the matter a bit simpler for him. On average, the provision will mean a £17 a week increase for families who currently receive family credit. As he knows, that constitutes a £1.5 billion spending increase on the current family credit budget. I am simply asking him whether, if the Conservative party were in office after the next general election, it would take that increase from the hands of those families?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I think that the hon. Lady is labouring under an illusion. As I said, a large proportion of the £1.5 billion will be spread further up the income scale. She attended Second Reading, and will have heard hon. Members produce figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that clearly demonstrated that a person who currently receives the maximum benefit is unlikely to gain by the proposed changes.
<P>
In case the hon. Lady thinks that I am trying to evade her question, I shall be even more frank. When we return to power, we shall have to deal with the problem as it is. We will try to ensure better targeting, so that help is concentrated on families on low incomes. The hon. Lady is being simplistic in asking whether we will take money away from people. We will have to deal with the existing situation. I assure her that one of our prime objectives will be to support families on low incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Will the hon. Gentleman explain whether, in the fantasy world in which his party returns to power and changes the system, his proposed system would leave families worse off, better off or just the same? Will he answer that and give the Committee the details?
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a significant admission and asks whether families will be better off. I notice that he does not ask whether families on low income will be better off. I can give a categorical assurance that families on lower income will be better off. We are treading down exactly the same road as the Canadians. If we were to look at the Canadian Parliament's equivalent of Hansard for 1991-92, we would see the same kind of discussions.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend has experience of the previous Parliament, so I wonder whether he could tell those hon. Members who only have experience of this Parliament whether it is extremely unusual for Government Members to want to hear in extraordinary detail what the Opposition's policies would be were they in office? When we were in power, we sought to defend and clarify our own policies, rather than constantly gripe about what the Labour party would do on its hypothetical though inevitable return to power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> To a degree it is unusual. We tried to find out what the Labour party would do in the last part of the previous Parliament. We thought that the Labour party had a secret plan, but on coming into office it appeared to take a Tory policy like family credit, tinker with it, rebrand it, give it a different name and relaunch it. The result is a sub-standard product. It may have go-faster stripes and a GTI logo, but that is all.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am also pleased to welcome you, Mrs. Roe, to the Chair. Before the series of interruptions, the hon. Gentleman was developing an interesting point about increasing dependency. His concern was that the tax credit would extend dependency and that that would be undesirable. However, when family credit was introduced, more people were brought into means-tested benefits than under its predecessor, family income supplement. He seems to be saying that dependency is undesirable among high-income families but acceptable among low-income families. Does he have a cut-off point in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I recognise that the hon. Gentleman has considerable expertise in this area. I do not believe people paying higher rate tax should receive working family tax credit we may seek to move an amendment to that effect later in the Committee and I do not think that that should be the Government's intention. It is largely the accidental result of a policy that has not been thought out too well.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> One of the main changes that the Conservative party made to the tax system when in government was to reduce the amount of churning that was endemic in the system. The Bill could result in churning money in, money out with no effect whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In a moment, I shall discuss some of the effects of the policy, which will largely shift burdens from the poor to the almost poor.
<P>
I shall now move on 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not answer the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Refresh my memory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> I asked the question because the hon. Gentleman indicated that when, in his words, his party returns to power, it would implement a different system. He must be aware of the nature of that system, as he claimed that it would provide benefits. I asked specifically whether those benefits would maintain the sum accrued by families under the working families tax credit system, whether families would be worse off or would remain the same. When he answers that, will he give the details?
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because I had forgotten that part of his question. It gives me an opportunity to say that it is absolute cheek to say, "Let's have your worked-out policies." Here we are in Committee deliberating on a new policy, and we still do not have the regulations or the regulatory impact assessment. The hon. Gentleman is criticising me for not having all the regulations ready two years before the event, and it is his party that is not producing regulations for us to discuss. What cheek!
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I too welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. In endorsing everything that my hon. Friend has said, I remind the Committee of the words of Disraeli, who I think is treated with respect by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. He said that only a fool tries to formulate detailed measures in Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is a considerable expert on Disraeli, and I thank him for that intervention. I give way to the Whip's hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. I want to raise the same point as my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) did, because Government Members are confused about the outline of the Opposition's tax proposals. Why does the hon. Gentleman oppose a tax credit for those on higher incomes when his Government gave tax reductions of £1.6 billion out of £2.6 billion to better-off families in the Tory heartland. There seems to be a contradiction. He is proposing a tax approach that is opposed to the one that his party took in Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the hon. Lady wishes to continue on message, she needs to monitor the message. Later today, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will make a speech, which has been widely circulated, in which he will say that the Labour party has been obsessed for too long with income distribution and should begin to consider the generation of wealth.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady, who I think is reasonably ambitious, is off message. She cannot make a remark of that kind any more. If I were her, I would ask Hansard to strike it from the record because it will not do her any good.
<P>
Let us return to Canada. Why is the Canadian experience so similar to that of the United Kingdom? First, there are various cultural similarities. We both have a parliamentary system, unlike America, which has a congressional system, and we both embarked on a series of social welfare reforms straight after the second world war. We were also keen, because of the history of the poor laws, to get away from means-tested benefits. There is an important difference in social policy between us and the United States, which takes a different view of people on, as they call it, welfare. The aim of the various states that make up that great country is for there to be a considerable difference between those in work and those on welfare.
<P>
The United Kingdom system, like the Canadian system, looks towards greater social cohesion, trying to ensure that people get off benefit in such a way that they are not penalised and stigmatised as they are in the United States, which has had a detrimental impact on United States inner cities. But I do not want to pursue that thought too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is more stigmatising to receive this sort of amount through the benefit system than through the pay packet and that it is far more dignified and less stigmatising for recipients of incentives to receive this credit in the wage packet than by giro cheque?
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> A number of studies have looked at family credit, and one thing that is encouraging is that its take-up rate is 75 per cent. 82 per cent. on income which may demonstrate that the hon. Gentleman is wrong about that. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's study said not only that there was virtually no stigma attached to family credit, but, even more interestingly the hon. Gentleman may care to think about this that most families regarded it as a top-up of child benefit.
<P>
The experience in the United States and Canada is that those who claim through this system have been stigmatised at work. We intend to table a number of amendments to ensure that employers do not breach confidentiality and do not have to pry too much into family life on the Government's behalf. The only people who have said that family credit is a stigmatised benefit have heard it only over the past two weeks and only in the Champer of the House of Commons from the Government Benches. I do not believe that anybody else thinks that.
<P>
We have found ourselves moving away from this system towards increased marginal tax. As I said earlier, it means that the nearly poor and the poor start to chase one another. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that marginal tax rates over 50 per cent. have not been removed by the switch from family credits to WFTC. The IFS figure shows that 469,000 more people will be subject to a marginal withdrawal of WFTC.
<P>
We also know, from an intervention by a Labour Member, that it proved to be a failure in getting people off benefit and into work. For every 100 Canadian dollars expended on this system, only six Canadian dollars got people into permanent employment. We know that this is a poorly targeted piece of work.
<P>
We also know that, by moving from purse to wallet, we may damage the rights of women, as the hon. Member for Luton, South was keen to say. We know that the money is spent on child care. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that when the money went to the person primarily in charge often a woman or to the mother, it would be spent on looking after children. The experience of Canada and the United States suggests that that will not be the case. It is hard to say, but one thing is certain: less money will be expended on children under these measures than under family credit. We intend to table amendments to reverse that trend.
<BR>

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The hon. Gentleman draws constantly on a comparison with the case study of Canada. That is a typical line of attack which raises fears about what might happen in this country by making spurious comparisons with what has happened elsewhere. In order to compare two things, it must be established that a comparison is possible, which is done by drawing out similarities between the two cases before the differences can be explained. A similar system may not have worked in Canada, but there is no reason in principle why it should not work here. We will not know that for sure until the measures are introduced.
<P>
Labour Members believe that the proposals will be of considerable benefit. The hon. Gentleman fears that the proposed system will not work and will have undesirable side effects. If these do not transpire once the Bill is passed and the system is up and running, will he support the measure once he can see that it is working in practice, or is his argument based on a principled objection to the WFTC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I would be happier with the hon. Gentleman's intervention if those whom the Government had selected to consider the matter had studied the Canadian system. That is a glaring omission because Canada's institutions and parliamentary system are similar to ours. The only difference is that under the old system, some Canadian provinces topped up child support, and they still offer additional support through the working income supplement.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether our objection was in principle. Our objection is that we do not think that the system will work. We do not believe that it will help low-income families. Indeed, we think that it will work against them and that the mechanism will be expensive to deliver. We are not saying that family credit is perfect, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) raised concerns about that. Our principal worry, however is that we are choosing a mechanism to deliver support to families that is worse than the current system. Although we may discuss technicalities over the next few weeks, that is the essential difference.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) that we are not playing games. We really believe that the Government are making a mistake. It could be argued that it is in our interests for the Government to make a mistake, but the people who have to pick up the tab the people who will be damaged are those on low incomes. That is why I am firmly convinced that on our return to power, we, like Canada, will have to rejig the benefits system, and we will probably have lost 10 years of opportunity to improve it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I will give way in a moment. I want to develop this point. The system will be in place by 2000 or thereabouts, and it will become bedded in. Its problems will be pretty evident by 2003 or 2004.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Sooner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Cries for change will mean that action will probably be taken in 2004 or 2005, and the consequent reforms will need to be bedded in. The system will not be properly operational until 2007 or 2008, and in that way we will lose 10 years. If the Government say "Okay, let's scrap this,"	 I can guarantee a degree of bipartisan or perhaps all-party support for a genuine attempt to reform the welfare system. The Government's proposals involve nothing more than rebranding.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give us some idea of the nature of the rejigging to which he referred? He mentioned the Opposition's fears about the system several times and he used the word "rejigging"	. Will he define that word and explain what the results of the rejigging might be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes. I refer the hon. Gentleman to several learned papers on the Canadian system, which neatly illustrate the problems that are associated with it. They include an increase in fraud, which will undoubtedly occur under the Government's system. It is important to remember how fraud begins. Newspapers are fond of stories about people with false identities who go from one benefit office to another picking up claims. Such cases do occur there are highly skilled, deliberate attempts to defraud the system. However, people who investigate fraud associated with housing benefit and other benefits suggest that, in general, people simply get trapped in fraud. They get an over-payment, make a mistake or fail to declare properly within a reasonable period, and say, "I'll sort it out next week."	 By the time that they get round to doing so, they are involved in serious fraud and from there their involvement gets deeper and deeper.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said, the Government's proposals are a prime way to drag more people both employee and employer into fraud. The Leader of the House warned us about inscrutable employers. [
{**epHon. Members: "Unscrupulous?"	] Whatever [Interruption.] I did not intend a slur on any particular ethnic group.
<p4**}Some employers tell their employees, "This arrangement is good for both of us. I'll rejig things so that you'll get a bit more money. I'll pay you a little less, but everybody's going to be okay."  That approach is endemic in the system. <P>
The right hon. Member for Birkenhead said that the system will offer huge bonuses for dishonesty. It is strange, but something of a paradox is involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> When I have made this point.
<P>
During the past week, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment introduced measures dealing with the workplace, but in this Committee the Government are introducing measures that will strengthen an employer's hold over working people by trapping them in a web of dishonesty and corruption, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said. Strangely, the Government will reward employers who pay low wages, relieve the pressure to improve productivity and remove the possibility of real wage increases. The Government are trying to introduce a raft of other measures, which will be seriously undermined by this Bill.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman provided an analysis, but did not describe the rejigging to which he referred earlier. Will he explain that rejigging and clarify his comments about ethnic groupings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am happy to do that. I mispronounced unscrupulous and said something that sounded like inscrutable. It was a joke, because I mispronounced something. That is okay; it is not a problem.
<P>
On the general question of rejigging, I referred hon. Gentlemen to learned research documents, which are freely available and which spell out what happened in Canada. My inability to offer a rejigging is caused by the fact that we do not have the regulations. They may be tremendous, but we have not seen them. I may have to come back early on Thursday morning to tell the Minister that I was completely wrong, the Government have got it right and the regulations are fantastic. That is a little unlikely, but I would like to think that I would be big enough to do it. We need to know what the regulations look like. That is the problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eccles referred to Conservative Members living in a fantasy world, but we are faced with a situation that puts me in mind of the trial scene in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"	 we have had George Orwell, so now we can move on to Lewis Carroll in which the Red Queen wanted to have the judgment, the verdict and the sentence before the evidence. If the hon. Gentleman gives us the regulations, we will do the rejigging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would not allude to having solutions when he has none.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that there was some point to that intervention and I shall certainly study Hansard tomorrow to try to discover it.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said, FTC is a venture fraught with great danger. That is another of our concerns. We understand that family credit can be subjectto fraud, but he working families tax credit offers considerably more scope for fraud. A lot of the money that Labour Committee members have spoken about this morning will have to be spent on fraud detection. That money will be spent not on supporting families, but on ensuring that families who are not entitled to money do not receive it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to answer the first part of my earlier intervention by clearly stating that his party did not oppose the measure in principle, although he has a number of practical concerns that he is now seeking to elucidate. The second part of my question concerned whether he would support the measure at a subsequent date if the dangers and threats I am not quite sure to what that he describes do not materialise, and the working families tax credit turns out to be a great success and of great benefit to working people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> To a small degree, the hon. Gentleman's playing with fire. Is he making a pledge before the Committee that, if the measure does not work, he will join me in opposing it? I shall give way if he wants to answer. I think that the hon. Gentleman's silence and embarrassed grin answers that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he will read Hansard tomorrow. When he does so, perhaps he will reflect on two words. He referred to "inscrutable"	 and "unscrupulous"	 in relation to employers. I accept that that was a simple mix-up in the use of language, but the hon. Gentleman then said that that was no offence to any particular ethnic group. When he reads Hansard, will he reflect on whether to apologise at our next sitting for linking "inscrutable"	 or "unscrupulous"	 employers with offending any ethnic group.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman deserves a prize for being sanctimonious. If he had done some research, he would know my record on race relation. He would know that I was in Railton road after the riots and that I stood linked arm in arm with colleagues from all political parties to prevent riots in Bradford. He would also know that I have done a lot of work to open the services of local authorities to ethnic minorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The hon. Member for Bury, South has only been here two minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I understand that, but intolerance is creeping into our debate if the right words are not used or a mistake is made. It is as though, if a slightly tasteless joke is made, the thought police may descend.
<BR>

<P>
I have made my commitment to race relations not just when speaking in Committee, but by putting my personal safety at risk. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would have done the same if he had had the opportunity and I am sure that he will do so if he is given the opportunity, but he should not prejudge us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that we are discussing an amendment and I do not want the debate to stray too far. Before I call the hon. Member for Bury, South, I remind him that we have had a question and an answer to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lewis:</B> I was not intending, Chair, to cast aspersions on the integrity of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar or his record of public service, nor to make any assumptions about any member of the Committee, but the language used and the link referred to could cause offence. That was the only point I was trying to make. In case any offence was caused, I gave the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to reflect on that. I was not trying to cast any aspersions on the hon. Gentleman's integrity or his commitment to race relations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> On a point of order, Madam Chairman. As it is clear that the Committee will run for a long time, do you wish to be addressed as Madam Chairman or Chair?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is Mrs. Roe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I accept the apology of the hon. Member for Bury, South and I think that we should move on. People make mistakes and I accept that.
<P>
To summarise our views, we believe that the mechanism chosen by the Government to deliver support to working families is fundamentally flawed. The payment mechanism is flawed. It is flawed because it will allow fraud, because it will create stigma and because of the take-up rate. The Opposition will table amendments to try to minimise the damage that that will cause to the nation's social welfare.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is clear from their interventions that many Labour Members have not read the Bill and are more concerned with their Whips' brief to attack the Conservative party. the purpose of the Committee is to discuss the Bill in detail. If any hon. Members wish to intervene, I shall first ask them to declare to the Committee that they have read the Bill from cover to cover they should remember that misleading the Committee is a serious matter. If hon. Members have read the Bill, they will know that there is little difference between the methods of calculating the benefit payable under the working families tax credit and under the previous family credit system. I see that Labour Members are laughing. It is clear that they have not read the documentation, otherwise they would not be making mirthful comments.

<P>

<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr Gibb:</B> I will, if the hon. Lady will confirm before she begins that she has read the Bill from cover to cover.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I intend to make my own point rather than any point that the hon. Gentleman wishes me to make. Parliamentary etiquette allows me to do so.
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the principle behind the transfer from family credit to working families tax credit? Perhaps it escaped him despite all the contributions that were made on Second Reading and before that. Labour Members, including myself, are aware that the principle behind that transfer is to make work pay. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that principle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> By that intervention, the hon. Lady has confessed that she has not read the Bill.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I have.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Then the hon. Lady should have said so. I asked her to make that clear. She has obviously not read the Bill. Had she done so, she would realise that there are only small differences between the calculation of benefit under the family credit system and the working families tax credit system. If she reads pages 32 and 33 of the House of Commons Library research paper 98/46, she will see the difference between the calculations. It is clear that the basic credit for families is the same in the case of both family credit and working families tax credit.
<P>
The child credit, which is called the tax credit for children under the working families tax credit system, is slightly higher. The child credit for 11 to 16-year-olds is the same as it would be under the tax credit for children in the working families tax credit system. Under family credit, the child credit for 16 to 18-year-olds is the same as the tax credit for children aged 16 to 18 under the WFTC system. The credit for an adult working in excess of 30 hours is the same under family credit as it is under the WFTC system. The key difference between the two systems is the taper, which is 55p in the pound for working families tax credit and 70p in the pound for the family credit system. The other key difference between the two systems is the payment delivery mechanism. In many instances, but not all, the working families tax credit system is delivered through the payroll.
<P>
Labour Members, particularly Treasury Ministers, are fond of quoting £190 a week as the minimum payment for low-income families, as a result of the working families tax credit system. However, that minimum of £190 a week applies not to all low-income families but to low-income families who work full time. What is meant by full time? I invite the Minister to respond to that point.
<P>
In the very impressive press release, what assumptions has she made about the families who will receive a guaranteed income of £10,000 a year? I asked the House of Commons Library to rework the figures and I was told that the figure would apply only if someone worked 34 hours a week. If we apply those assumptions, a couple with one child and a single earner working 34 hours a week at the minimum wage of £3.60 per hour would receive £190.58 a week under the working families tax credit system. The same calculation for the family credit system produces a figure of £187.19. So, there is little significant difference between family credit and working families tax credit in terms of the benefit payable to low-income families.
<P>
The amendment would delete the word "tax"	 from the clauses that refer to the working families tax credit so that they read "family credit"	 because the benefit is not genuinely a tax credit or a tax allowance. Working families tax credit is simply a benefit, which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who is a member of the shadow social security team, has been leading for the Opposition in Committee. We have seen from the figures that there is no difference between the way in which benefit is calculated under the previous family credit system and under the current system. As my hon. Friend said, this is merely the rebranding of an existing benefit. However, the significant and damaging difference is that it will be paid through the tax system.
<P>
Even the £3 difference that the House of Commons Library has calculated will be eaten up by the stealth taxes that the Government have introduced since they came to power: the reductions in the married person's allowance and in mortgage interest relief at source, and the increase in petrol duty, which will cost the average person an extra £90. Those stealth taxes will more than eat away the £3 a week difference between the two systems.
<P>
Low-income families have suffered enormously during 18 months of Labour Government. Labour Committee members should therefore scrutinise the Bill in detail to see whether they are justified in standing on their high horse to defend it and in attacking the Opposition.
<BR>

<P>
The definition of a tax credit for accounting purposes is the key to our wish to remove the word "tax"	 from the Bill. That definition is set out in detail in a publication by the Office for National Statistics, entitled, "UK National Accounts: Concepts, Sources and Methods"	. It gives the Government clear guidance on what can be construed as a tax credit, stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Households may receive assistance from government by way of cash benefits or allowances against tax."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It cites mortgage interest relief as the classic example of tax relief. The ONS felt it important, therefore, to set out the principle of what counts as a tax credit and what counts as public expenditure. Those principles are important not only for the wording of the Bill, but for accounting. The ONS states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A tax allowance is treated as negative taxation if ... the benefit to the individual taxpayer does not exceed the amount of tax paid by them; if it is made as a matter of economic policy; and the allowance is an integral part of the tax system."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if a refund or allowance can be calculated independently of the procedure for calculating the tax payable, and uses different criteria, and does not depend on the actual amount of tax to be paid, or the marginal rate of tax, then it is not integral to the tax assessment."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If it is not integral to the tax system, it should not be accounted for as, or construed as, a tax credit.
<P>
The following quotation from the ONS publication is key:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the availability of the rebate to non-taxpayers is normally a strong indicator that it is not negative taxation."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it the allowance should not be regarded as negative taxation. That is why the pre-Budget report, published last November, established that the 20 per cent. element of the tax credit that it is estimated will be paid through the payroll will be regarded not as tax foregone but as expenditure.
<P>
Martin Taylor, the architect of the system, gave evidence to the Social Security Select Committee. Heexpressed concern, and envisaged that any working families tax credit system would be paid through the tax code, which would make it an integral part of the tax system. He was asked by the present Economic Secretary whether he envisaged the working families tax credit being calculated once and then added by the employer to earnings, regardless of any variations during the subsequent six-month period. She asked:
<BR>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"do you envisage in effect a change to the tax code so that simplified tables in future would say, `If X, add Y'...?"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I think it would be better from the employers' point of view that the thing should run through the tax code, which would also allow the present cumulative principle to apply."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When he was further robed on the matter, he made it clear that he saw no reason why the pay-as-you-earn coding should not be used to deliver the benefit.
<P>
The Inland Revenue then tried, through some experiments, to work out whether one could have a tax code that, in certain circumstances, would not only take less tax from working people but would give tax back. In effect, that would constitute a negative tax code. According to Mr. Knox, a representative of the Federation of Small Businesses, who gave evidence to the Select Committee, the Revenue devised an N code, and ran a series of models. However, in each case, the code created a distortion after several payment periods.
<P>
In other words the system that was meant to deliver the benefit through the tax code, which is the entire basis
