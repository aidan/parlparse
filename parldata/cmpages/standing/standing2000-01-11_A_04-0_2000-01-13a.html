</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the next amendment, I should tell the Committee that there is a revised selection list for this afternoon's sitting. Amendments Nos. 66, 10, 69 and 19 appeared on this morning's selection list in error. They relate to the national accounts commission and, following rejection of amendment No. 3 on Tuesday, they cannot now be called.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Resource accounts: preparation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 3, line 8, leave out `may appoint an official of a' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall, in the case of each department which is obliged to prepare accounts in accordance with subsection (1), appoint an official of the'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 27, in page 3, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) The instrument of appointment of an officer under subsections (5) and (7), and the instrument specifying any responsibilities under subsection (6)(c), shall be laid before the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The amendment places a requirement on the Treasury to appoint an accounting officer for each resource account, as it does for each appropriation account, rather than simply allowing it to do so. It is axiomatic that each account must have an accounting officer. In discussion with Treasury officials, the National Audit Office stated that strengthening the wording of the Bill to make it a formal requirement would remove any ambiguity about our intentions. We are happy to accept that suggestion and have tabled the amendment accordingly.
<P>
The Government do not accept the need for amendment No. 27. The instruments appointing accounting officers—a letter of appointment from the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and the setting out of duties, as covered in the accounting officer memorandum—are already available. The letters of appointment are proffered as a matter of course to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Public Accounts Committee. The memorandum is reproduced in Government Accounting and there is no need for a statutory requirement to lay the instruments before the House.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept that amendment No. 27 is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis </B>(Haltemprice and Howden): I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Butterfill. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's comments on amendment No. 72. It is pleasing that the Government have recognised that the appointment of accounting officers to Departments is an important constitutional obligation on the Treasury rather than just a duty that the Treasury may choose to take.
<P>
Amendment No. 27, and an amendment in the next group, relate to subsection (6), which imposes only two statutory requirements on accounting officers: to prepare the Department's resource accounts and to transmit them to the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
The Economic Secretary rebuked us earlier for speaking at length, which I thought was unfair because our debate this morning was useful and informative. She must forgive me if I talk at length on the amendment because the position of the accounting officer is an important aspect of parliamentary oversight and accountability and I want to elaborate on that so that the Committee understands the need for amendment No. 27.
<P>
The accounting officer's role is much wider than that to which the Bill refers. He or she will have the personal duty of signing the accounts prescribed in the letter of appointment and, by virtue of that duty, the further duty of being a witness before the Public Accounts Committee, to deal with questions arising from those accounts or, more commonly, from reports made to Parliament by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the National Audit Act 1983. Further responsibilities are associated with those duties—there should be a high standard of financial management in the Department as a whole, financial systems and procedures should promote the efficient and economical conduct of business and safeguard financial propriety and regularity throughout the Department, and financial considerations should be fully taken into account in decisions on policy proposals.
<P>
The essence of the accounting officer's role is a personal responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which he or she is answerable—the keeping of proper accounts, prudent and economical administration, avoidance of waste and extravagance and efficient and effective use of all available resources. As a result, the accounting officer must first sign accounts assigned to him or her, and, in doing so, accept personal responsibility for their proper presentation, as prescribed in legislation or, mostly, under this Bill, by the Treasury. Secondly, he or she must ensure that proper financial procedures are followed, and that accounting records are maintained in a form suited to the requirements of management, as well as in the form prescribed for published accounts. Thirdly, public funds for which he or she is responsible should be properly and well managed and safeguarded, with independent and effective checks of cash balances put in the hands of an official. Fourthly, assets for which he or she is responsible, such as land, buildings or other property, including stores and equipment, should be controlled and safeguarded with similar care and checks as appropriate. Fifthly, in the consideration of policy proposals relating to expenditure on income, for which an accounting officer has responsibilities, all relevant financial considerations, including issues of propriety, regularity or value for money, should be taken into account and, where necessary, brought to Ministers' attention.
<P>
An accounting officer has a particular responsibility for ensuring compliance with parliamentary requirements in relation to controlled expenditure. A fundamental requirement is that funds should be applied only to the extent and for the purposes authorised by Parliament. The attention of Parliament must be drawn to losses or special payments by appropriate notation of the relevant account. We touched on that issue on Tuesday, in relation to the words ``service of''. On voted expenditure, any payments made must be within the ambit and amount of the vote, and parliamentary approval must have been sought and given. In cases not covered by the original estimate—for example, if a service had not been contemplated when an estimate was presented, or a temporary advance from the contingency fund had been sanctioned by the Treasury—the accounting officer must ensure that parliamentary approval is sought and given at the earliest opportunity, through a supplementary estimate, or, if necessary, an excess vote.
<P>
An accounting officer will be expected to furnish the PAC with explanations of any indications of weakness to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention, about which it might wish to question the accounting officer. The accounting officer is also required to appear before the Public Accounts Committee on value-for-money issues. An accounting officer has particular responsibility to see that appropriate advice is tendered to Ministers on all matters of financial propriety and regularity, and, more broadly, on considerations of prudent and economical administration, efficiency and effectiveness. The accounting officer needs to determine how, and in what terms, such advice should be tendered, and whether to make specific reference to his or her duty to justify to the PAC transactions for which he or she is accountable. Any hon. Member who has served as a Minister will be familiar with that requirement.
<P>
If the Minister in charge of a Department is contemplating a course of action involving a transaction that an accounting officer believes would infringe the requirements of propriety, regularity or value for money, the accounting officer is required to set out in writing objections to that proposal and the reasons for the objections, and his or her duty to notify the Comptroller and Auditor General should advice be overruled. If the Minister decides, none the less, to proceed, the accounting officer is required to seek a written instruction to take action. Having received such an instruction, he or she informs the Treasury of what has occurred and communicates the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General without undue delay—the letter of direction procedure. That might sound terribly dry, but, were it not for that responsibility on the accounting officer, the Pergau dam issue, for example, would never have been brought to Parliament's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Williams </B>(Swansea, West): To underline the importance of setting down matters clearly, I point out that in that case the NAO found out about the accounting officer's letter because it was investigating the dam. Without such an investigation, there would have been no obligation to notify the NAO. All members of the PAC, including its former chairman, the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) and me, had assumed that the matter would be flagged up automatically. Only since then have we introduced a rule that such matters must automatically be drawn to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is therefore vital that the rules are clearly understood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The right hon. Gentleman pre-empts what I was about to say in pointing out that that convention was not properly in place.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is better to reflect in statute the extensive nature of the accounting officer's duties and responsibilities to Parliament. His primary duty is to the House of Commons, and it is anomalous that, at present, there is no statutory requirement for the House to receive information. I shall discuss the relevant convention in a moment.
<P>
Amendment No. 27 would provide for the letter of appointment that the Treasury issues to each accounting officer to be formally laid before the House of Commons. At present, as the Economic Secretary said, the Treasury send the letters to the Committee as an act of courtesy. Again, the issue arises of Executive discretion over a matter that should be a parliamentary right. The purpose of the amendment is to signify the importance that Parliament attaches to the duties of accounting officers by establishing a statutory requirement, and thereby explicitly recognising their responsibility to the House of Commons and the PAC.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary does not rely on her argument that such matters are best left to convention. The Pergau dam issue illustrates how vital they can be. Since becoming chairman of the PAC, and at the behest of the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), I have instituted a notification procedure. All members of the PAC are now notified of letters of which I am notified, because I take the view that the subject is of interest to a wider audience—and not just the privileged members of the PAC. The duty is to the whole of Parliament. It is Parliament's right, not the Executive's, to exercise that courtesy. For that reason, I shall continue to support amendment No. 27.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Although your fellow Chairman has done an excellent job, Mr. Butterfill, we are delighted by your presence. I hope that your patience and sense of humour will sustain us throughout what may prove to be a prolonged investigation of rather dry matters. You have the misfortune, I believe, to number among the few potential Chairmen of this Committee who understand such matters, and you may therefore find our deliberations even more tedious than we do.
<P>
I admit that there is one element of the current discussion that I do not properly understand, and which is reminiscent of other subjects that we have discussed. The Economic Secretary has been wheeled on—if I may use an unfortunate analogy—in the same way that a tight, tough lawyer is wheeled on to quibble almost interminably about each point in a contractual negotiation, so that the matter is thereby complicated and the commercial essence never tackled.
<P>
Although I profoundly disagree with her, I realise that the Economic Secretary objected to the content of some of our previous discussions. In general, we were discussing matters about which there were genuine differences of view and principle. The other difference was that she was wrong and we were right.
<P>
The Economic Secretary sensibly said that it is, and will continue to be, the Treasury's intention to act in the way that amendment No. 27 states that it should act. The learned exposition that was given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), who is the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, made it clear that that process would involve no great risks. The Government should quietly give the amendment the nod and seize the convenient opportunity that it offers. Agreeing to the amendment would not require additional legislation or delay matters; it would expedite matters, because the Committee's discussion could move on. I thought that that was going to be the Economic Secretary's approach. However, even before my right hon. Friend had explained the situation, we were told that the Treasury intended to resist that approach.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am bound to say that I genuinely do not understand the situation. I am trying to assess what might be determining the Economic Secretary's utterances. I cannot believe that she has a rooted objection to Parliament's receiving the documents by statute. What have what I previously called the great forces of conservatism concluded is dangerous about enshrining this perfectly clear precedent in law? I assume that the august Permanent Secretaries envisage that at some stage they may want to act in a way that does not involve maintaining current practice.
<P>
 The Economic Secretary earlier adopted the admirable view that legislation was permanent—she even suggested that adopting a 100-year perspective would not be sufficient to perceive changes in legislation. Presumably, therefore, Permanent Secretaries are worried that, at some stage in the next 100 years, they may want to change the approach. That may be the Government's logic—the Economic Secretary did not make clear the logic of her objection to amendment No. 27—and Permanent Secretaries, in their august omniscience, may believe that the time will come when they want to change the relevant practices. If so, those are reasons for insisting that amendment No. 27 should be agreed to. We do not want changes in such a context.
<P>
It is evident—I can hardly believe that I have to argue this case—that such a convention is useful, and I do not think that the Economic Secretary was questioning it. If the only logic for resisting the amendment is that someone might want to change the convention, that is a reason for establishing the precedent in law. If the Economic Secretary considers the matter further, she might agree with my argument.
<P>
I want to touch briefly on amendment No. 72, not because I object to it—it is admirable—but because it draws attention to an oddity to which we shall return during the clause stand part debate: the Treasury's position.
<P>
Before I heard the Second Reading debate and our discussions in Committee over the past few days, I did not properly understand the Treasury's position—I probably still do not properly understand it. What is the appropriate relationship between Parliament, the Treasury and Departments? I had always adopted the naïve view that the Treasury and Departments lay on one side, and that Parliament and the public lay on the other. That is broadly the thinking that underlies the creation of the PAC and the NAO, the Comptroller and Auditor General's position and all the rest of the apparatus.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 brings into focus the fact that the Treasury does not conceive of itself in such a way. I do not know whether that is a new development or an old, established principle. I shall set in train investigations to find out how many of these proposals had been thought of previously. The Bill and the amendment make it clear that the Treasury sees itself as a kind of guardian. That may explain the Treasury's resistance to enshrining the powers of Parliament and Parliament's adjuncts and adjutants—the Public Accounts Committee, the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General—as the guardians. I use the term ``guardian'' in the sense of the propriety of the preparation of the accounts and the enforcement of the standards through regularity and a true and fair view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point, which reflects a view that I gradually arrived at over the course of the first year of this Parliament—about a year ago. He is right that the Treasury sees itself as a guardian, although those of us who sit on the PAC tend to view it less in the sense of his divided world, and more as allies in what we are trying to do. The starkest example of the correctness of my hon. Friend's view was provided by the Scotland Bill, which completely shut down the rights of the UK Parliament to investigate the £14 billion a year that is expended in Scotland. Clause 96 of the Scotland Bill arrogated those rights entirely to the Treasury. That is a highly anti-democratic and unfortunate trend, in the UK Parliament, which is responsible for raising taxes in this country and exercising accountability over them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As my right hon. Friend may recall, I was Opposition spokesman on constitutional affairs at that time, and I remember him making that point about clause 96 in the Chamber in his capacity as Chairman of the PAC. At the time, I did not understand the underlying significance of the Treasury's view of itself and its relationship to the Parliaments. It is now coming into focus.
<P>
Although I do not wish to oppose the amendment, I do not wholly share my right hon. Friend's view that the Treasury is always necessarily an ally. Sometimes, as far as accounting is concerned, the interests of the Departments of State are more closely aligned than those of the Treasury with the interests of the electorate who are represented in Parliament. That is because the Treasury inevitably has the most responsibility for trying to put a gloss on the Government's fiscal and economic management. As the Treasury is increasingly a mouthpiece of Government propaganda in the economic sphere, it will increasingly be the locus of the greatest possible conflict of interest between the need to account and show performance outcomes clearly, and the need to present matters in a rosy light.
<P>
That is not in any way an attack on Ministers or their officials. Were Conservative Ministers in power, they would be subject to the same temptations. Officials inevitably serve their Ministers, and Treasury officials are there to serve Treasury Ministers—indeed, they are constitutionally obliged to do so. I am not attacking anybody, but noting a feature of our constitutional arrangements that I am beginning dimly to understand.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have enjoyed this interesting philosophical diversion, which was initially relevant. However, to pursue it any further would be to stray too far from the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I may perhaps surprise you, Mr. Butterfill, by saying that I too was becoming aware of the gross divergence between my great interest in my subject and the amendment.
<P>
Although I do not wish to oppose the amendment, I point out that we should like to discuss the clause as a whole in more detail in the light of recent comments. However, I certainly wish to support amendment No. 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I should like to focus on the matters that my right hon. and hon. Friends have raised in relation to amendment No. 27, and on Ministers' resistance to that commonsensical amendment. There could be one of two reasons why those on the Opposition Benches—sorry, the Government Benches—[Laughter.] Give it a couple of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Less than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Or even conceivably less than that, as my hon. Friend says.
<P>
The Government could be resisting this sensible amendment for one of two reasons. The first is that the mandarins do not wish the harsh spotlight of parliamentary scrutiny to fall on their activities. The amendment would clearly identify an individual—presumably the Permanent Secretary—and specify the responsibilities that that accounting officer must have. That would put everyone in this place on notice. It would be a visible indication to us that we had the power and the duty to scrutinise what the accounting officers were doing. The Pergau dam issue is a salient example of civil servants not agreeing with the way in which Ministers were interpreting the rules. There was a fine and reasonable procedure for at least drawing attention to irregularities, if not whistleblowing.
<P>
The reason that the mandarins may not want this attention focused on them is that they do not wish to embrace the spirit of openness in which the new Government say that they believe. Has the Economic Secretary or her ministerial colleagues had discussions with the trade union of the senior mandarins—the First Division Association—or spoken to the Cabinet Secretary or to any bodies representing Permanent Secretaries to ascertain whether they object to the amendment?
<P>
Another possibility is that civil servants have no problem with the proposal, but that Ministers do. After the Economic Secretary has answered my question, will she tell us why she is unwilling, while wearing her ministerial hat, to accede to the amendment? Were she to agree to it, she would greatly comfort the House in the event of cases similar to the Pergau dam. That could happen under any Government; this is not a party political point. It could happen under Liberal Democrat Ministers, Conservative Ministers or new Labour Ministers.
<P>
Why does the Economic Secretary imagine that we would not be suspicious of her unwillingness to take on board the amendment? Her refusal to do so permits, under a future Government of whatever political complexion, the undermining of the safeguards that operated during the Pergau dam case. They could be swept away or ignored, and the procedure in that famous case, described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, circumvented.
<P>
Is it the Minister or the mandarins who object? I have not acknowledged a third possibility, which is that both mandarins and Ministers, for their own reasons, do not wish the cold light of day to intrude on their proceedings relating to the production of departmental accounts. I hope that the Economic Secretary will answer those questions in a spirit of openness, transparency and accountability.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I particularly enjoyed that contribution from the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), whose parliamentary majority is about 250, if my mathematics serve me well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Minister is not known for her dexterity with numbers, and she is out by a rather large margin. The figure is 368.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am deeply grateful for that correction, which shows that my mathematics are a great deal more soundly based than the hon. Gentleman's, and that the future points in a different direction from the present. I said that the figure was roughly 250, and roughly 250 it jolly well was.
<P>
Serious matters have been raised. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West spoke about the Pergau dam affair and the proceedings that brought it to light. I am sure that my right hon. Friend is aware that that matter led to the revision of the memorandum, demonstrating that current arrangements work and suggesting that legislation would not strengthen them. Previously, directions did not have to be disclosed to the NAO; they were merely placed on file. Committee members may not be aware of that, although I know that the right hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend are.
<P>
After the Pergau affair, sending papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General became obligatory, as set out in Paragraph 13 of the memorandum. I have a copy of the memorandum before me. On opening it, I found it contains all the things mentioned by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden. I cannot deny that: much of what he said draws closely on the memorandum. Responsibilities are founded on well established conventions, which are well understood in Westminster and Whitehall.
<P>
Some hon. Members have a tendency to muse—it lengthened the speech of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), for example. In his musings, he wondered why I did not think that some things should be included in the Bill. Of course, the fact that something is good and right, is supported by us, published in many quarters and universally accepted as a convention and—I hope—good practice everywhere does not mean that it should be so included. If we were to take such action in relation to other matters, many desirable things that take place as a matter of course in support of legislation would have to be fed into Bills, making them massive. Committee members know full well that that ought not to happen, as it would mean ending up with big, unnecessarily cumbersome Bills. We work to the convention and support it, and do not believe that it is necessary to incorporate it in the clause, as proposed by amendment No. 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I have frequently heard it argued in Committee that adding something would simply make a Bill more cumbersome. It is always argued that the Government will do such a thing anyway. Of course, the Bill will apply to the present and future Governments, unless it is further amended. Will the Minister confirm that future Governments will continue to act in such a way and that therefore the matter should be included in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Neither I nor any other Minister can say what future Governments will do. None of us can gainsay the future or make guarantees of the kind that the hon. Gentleman is encouraging.
<P>
Some Opposition Members' comments are unduly hostile to the Treasury and its officials. Given that some of them have worked in the Treasury, it is curious that they believe that it is not promoting the best public interest. The Treasury takes seriously its role of protecting taxpayers' interests—it would be strange if it did not—and upholding parliamentary oversight. The memorandum on the responsibilities of accounting officers lays out clearly how they must, as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, draw matters to Parliament's attention. I am sure that all people who hold those posts take that responsibility seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The Economic Secretary said that the Treasury drives forward probity. Will she confirm that it was only following a recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee after the Pergau dam fiasco that the accounting officer memorandum was changed? It was not changed by the Treasury, but as a result of a recommendation by that Committee of the House.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> My remarks did not address the circumstances surrounding the Pergau dam. [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but they related to the general document and the relationship between that and what goes on. The Treasury takes the matter seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In a second.
<P>
It is wrong to say that the Government are introducing resource accounting and budgeting out of anything other than the underlying motives, which we all support. Opposition Members are perfectly entitled to bring their concerns before the Committee, but we all agree that there are marked advantages in introducing resource accounting and budgeting We share a common platform on that. We must trust civil servants to carry out their duties within the remits of existing documents, conditions and frameworks that work well. The memorandum provides a good, sound framework that has been adjusted to reflect problems. Future problems may require it to be adjusted again, which bolsters the argument for not building all the detail into the clause. It is not necessary to build what works well at all stages into the Bill. Despite the fact that my view is no different from that of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden on what should happen and on the role of the memorandum, I oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I rise only briefly—I accept the Economic Secretary's justified criticism of my usual verbosity. She said something that was very interesting, which is worth exposing. She explained the logic behind her opposition to the amendment. It is not that she resists the intent of amendment No. 27, or that it will make the Bill unwieldy or too long, as the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) suggested. Instead, she made it clear that other people are concerned that if the convention is written into law, other matters that are also merely convention will need to be written into law at a later stage. That logic, which at last I understand, gives us a much greater reason for insisting on the amendment. We desperately need to move from arrangements that are conventional to ones that are clear and statutory. We currently have what my right hon. Friend the Chairman of the PAC accurately described in an earlier sitting as a disgrace in the control of public expenditure. Statutory clarity is needed in those circumstances. If the Bill becomes a precedent, as the Economic Secretary implied, hallelujah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I understand the comments of hon. Member for West Dorset, but I should like to make a further point. The Minister seemed to suggest that the only reason why she did not want to set such a precedent was that it would make other Bills lengthier. There did not seem to be any logical reason for excluding the proposals except the length of the Bill. The amendment, which could set a precedent for the insertion of such measures into other Bills, would do only the damage of meaning that an extra few trees had to be cut down to print a slightly longer Bill. If the change enables us to overcome the problem discussed earlier, which, as the Minister admitted, still arises, it should be made. However well intentioned the Government are, and however much they do what the amendment would force them and future Governments to do, future Governments may not act in the same way. They have a chance to overcome that concern and their objection to the amendment is minor. Merely cutting down the odd extra tree or lengthening some Bills in future is a price worth paying, and the Committee should support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I confess my surprise at the Minister's remarks. I thought that the amendment was uncontroversial and she has not addressed or disagreed with any of my arguments about it. I cannot believe that it is being resisted in order to save ink and vellum. We have, to some extent, been straining over a gnat, but my concern is more fundamental than this non-controversial amendment suggests. Parliament cannot take its duties on trust to anybody else. The Minister has said, ``We cannot do this because it might stop us changing things in future'', but that is precisely the point.
<P>
I shall make my next remarks with hesitancy and delicacy, as I have tried to stay away from political comments. I am concerned that incoming Governments may change the rules of Whitehall so as to alter the conventions and rights of Parliament. I believe that the Government are broadly very honourable and that the Minister means every word that she says about the Bill. We are, however, discussing a Bill that, when enacted, will last for the foreseeable future. Even the current Government were willing to do the controversial thing on coming into power: they moved an Order in Council to put political appointees in charge of civil servants. That is more controversial in the eyes of the press than changing accounting manuals and procedures, and it would be very easy for a future Government to get away with that. Such matters are always the definition of the phrase ``boring, but important'' and will not make the front page of The Daily Mail, The Sun or The Mirror, but that is all the more reason for us to defend the rights of Parliament against the making of such changes in future.
<P>
My remarks are not intended as a criticism of the honourable behaviour of the Government or of the Minister, or, indeed, of any of the civil servants who support her, many of whom I know and some of whom taught me. Parliament has a duty to protect its responsibilities—that is the intention of the amendment and I thought that it was straightforward, simple and non-controversial. It is clearly not straightforward, however, and I am afraid that I shall press the matter.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 3, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and Auditor General, and, (c) such other things as may from time to time be specified by the Treasury.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 28, 30, 31, 35, 38, 39, 45 to 47, 53 and 54.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I tested the Economic Secretary's patience with a long speech on the previous group of amendments, but I shall speak briefly to this amendment. To the responsibilities of accounting officers, the amendment would add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other things as may from time to time be specified by the Treasury.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would establish a statutory basis for the Treasury's right to lay down those responsibilities.
<P>
Recently, the Scottish Parliament set out the duties of its accounting officers extensively in statute— precisely the opposite line that the Economic Secretary has taken today. The amendment would not go so far, but it is right that legislation should make it clear that the duties of accounting officers are not confined to the two that the Bill sets out. It would simply ensure that additional duties imposed on accounting officers by the Treasury have a statutory basis.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I ask the Committee to support the Government amendments.
<P>
On Tuesday, Mr. Butterfill, when your colleague, Mr. Hood, was in the Chair, I mentioned the need to expand the clause's use of the phrase ``the Comptroller'' to the full title of Comptroller and Auditor General, and pointed out that parliamentary draftsmen had merely chosen to abbreviate that title. I appreciate that this is a sensitive and important matter, and we are of course happy to ensure that all such references use the full and proper title.
<P>
I hope to speak even more briefly to amendment No. 26 than did the right hon. Gentleman, but I am afraid that my response will not bring him any joy. We propose to reproduce in modern form the existing requirements of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1866, which is a somewhat ironic position in which to find ourselves. It places a statutory duty on accounting officers to be responsible for the preparation of their resource accounts or part of a resource account. It is unnecessary to establish a statutory basis for the wider duties of accounting officers. The provision has existed since 1866, and the right hon. Gentleman has not drawn any inadequacies to my attention. Permanent secretaries and other senior officials in departments are accounting officers, and their responsibilities and the associated conventions are well understood. Therefore, we see no need to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> May I welcome you, Mr. Butterfill, to the Chair? I forgot to do so earlier, and I beg your pardon.
<P>
I am slightly worried by the remarks of the Economic Secretary, who seems less than au fait with the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1866. She said that Comptroller and Auditor General was the full title of the office, but she should refer to section 3 of the 1866 Act, which states that the full title of that august office is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of the Public Accounts''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why the Public Accounts Committee was correct to bring to the Government's attention the fact that they had abbreviated an abbreviation. Section 3 of the 1866 Act allows that long title to be abbreviated to ``Comptroller and Auditor General''. It is important, for several reasons, that the title is not abbreviated further, unless that is the Government's intention. We must examine the history of the office to understand the importance of keeping the full abbreviation of the 1866 Act.
<P>
The office was created in 1866 from two other offices that have a great and long history in this country. The Audit Department and the Exchequer Department performed two different roles. The modern Comptroller and Auditor General has both functions. It is often thought that he has only the function of audit, but he also has a comptroller function to ensure that when public money is issued for spending it is issued correctly. The comptroller function can be traced back to 1314, when the office of Auditor of the Exchequer was first established. That office used wooden sticks to ensure that the money of barons and peasants—
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): VIPs and ordinary people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is trying to say that my analysis of feudal society is incorrect or that I omitted a member of a particular part of feudal Britain. I thought that peasant was a general term incorporating most people.
<P>
For 500 years the office of Auditor of the Exchequer ensured that taxpayers' money that was issued for the purpose of the public purse was issued correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I cannot resist the temptation to ask whether the hon. Gentleman agrees that, following the Economic Secretary's logic earlier today, the mere assurance that that had been going on for 500 years would not provide the slightest expectation that it might not be altered tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being mischievous and I would stretch your patience, Mr. Butterfill, if I were tempted down that line of debate.
<P>
In 1834, 520 years after foundation of the office of Auditor of the Exchequer, the office of Comptroller General of the Exchequer was established. That office had a much shorter history of only 32 years before the 1866 Act abolished it and merged it with the Audit Department. The Audit Department also has a long history, but not as long as that of the comptroller function. It goes back to 1559 when auditors of the Imprest Office, who worked in that office—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We all have the correct title of the official concerned clearly in our minds. I am not sure that we need to delve more deeply into that history, fascinating though it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall, of course, abide by your ruling, Mr. Butterfill. In order to abbreviate my remarks—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> We have all been enjoying the hon. Gentleman's disquisition. His interest in the matter may relate to the fact that 1866 was the last time that the Liberal party had a decent Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would be enjoyable and beneficial to hear the hon. Gentleman explain why it was necessary to create an Audit Department in 1866. Why was audit functioning, from which we still benefit today, first introduced into Whitehall?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should prefer it if the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) did not respond to that intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Parts of the hon. Gentleman's intervention were extremely tempting. He should consider the record of David Lloyd George, who was a distinguished Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a mistake that I am sure you would want me to correct, Mr. Butterfill. My earlier remarks were intended to show that audit functioning was introduced many years before the 1866 Act, in 1559. However, Mr. Butterfill, you told me not to dwell on that.
<P>
I shall bring my historical sojourn to a close. I refer Committee members to an excellent book called ``Audit, Accountability and Government'' by Fidelma White and Kathryn Hollingsworth. It is not a history book, although it uses an historical framework in its analysis, and it details many of the themes that underlie the subjects that we are discussing. The book was published recently—it is up to date—and it discusses the implications of resource accounting and budgeting. Committee members could use it to learn what happened between 1785 and 1866—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have tolerated this commercial because it may benefit Committee members. However, the hon. Gentleman must return his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall indeed do so, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I shall conclude by asking the Economic Secretary to confirm that the full title of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of the Public Accounts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I shall not go into the history of this subject or speak for as long as my hon. Friend, amusing though his speech was. I wish that I could make such an amusing speech myself.
<P>
I want to make a minor, technical point. I am delighted that the Economic Secretary agreed to make the change throughout the Bill. However, a minor technical fault remains. For reasons that I gave in our debate on the previous amendment, I hope that the Economic Secretary will agree to amendment No. 26. Apparently, however, she will not do so, which means that the words ``and Auditor General'' will not be added to clause 5(6)(b). That means that there will be only one place in the Bill at which this august post is referred to simply as ``the Comptroller''. I hope that the Economic Secretary will make the appropriate changes on Report.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I thank the Minister for correcting the situation and for explaining that the matter arose as a result of an oversight by parliamentary draftsmen.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are straightforward, and it is hard to understand why they are being resisted. They would form a fundamental part of Parliament's rights. I will therefore press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My already high estimation of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton rose significantly in the course of this afternoon's debate—an illuminating and amusing historical interlude. I regret only, Mr. Butterfill, that your eagle-eyed attention to the relevance of interventions prevented a longer disquisition. I am sure that Committee members would want to return to the discussion of the fascinating time to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I apologise for turning the attention of the Committee to serious matters.
<P>
Clause 5, to which many of the amendments that we have debated refer, is the centrepiece of the Bill. We find ourselves in the position described by T.S. Eliot as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . to arrive where we started 
And know the place for the first time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now understand the full force of clause 5. On further and deeper acquaintance, the clause does not endear itself to me more than at the start. I admit to some perplexity about parliamentary procedure—if we were to vote against the clause, I suppose that the Bill as a whole would become nugatory and certainly nonsense. On the other hand, if we allow clause 5 as drafted to stand part of the Bill, we will be subscribing to a very poor piece of legislation. It being the purpose of Standing Committees to prevent that from happening, we must consider whether it is sensible to allow it to stand as drafted.
<P>
I have it in mind to frame the pages containing clause 5 for future reference. The overwhelming feature that hits the eye as one stares at them is the term ``the Treasury''. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Resource accounts shall be prepared in accordance with directions issued by the Treasury.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury shall exercise the power''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) states: ``The Treasury may appoint''. Subsection (7) also states: ``The Treasury may appoint''.
<P>
This is, so to speak, the Treasury clause. I understand why you drew me up, Mr. Butterfill, when I was animadverting to the position of the Treasury in relation to the particularities of amendment No. 72. However, it is relevant here. A certain cast of mind underlies the clause. It sets up neither the national accounts commission—which has been rejected as a mechanism—nor the Accounting Standards Board, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the PAC or any other body external to Government as the guarantor.
<P>
Instead, the clause sets out to enshrine convention in statute, which is something to which the Government generally object—the Economic Secretary tells us—perhaps for reasons of precedent. However, in this case there is no objection. We are to enshrine convention in statute by enshrining the Treasury as the body that will be the guarantor. When we ask the question generally as to whether we should enshrine convention in statute—for example, where that might enshrine the powers of Parliament discussed in certain amendments, or the powers of an independent body described in another—the majesty of logic is deployed: there is no need to enshrine convention in statute. Why, then, is it suddenly not only necessary but desirable to enshrine the conventional powers of the Treasury in statute?
<P>
I hope that I do not need further to labour the heavy irony. The logic has broken down. The Economic Secretary cannot plausibly maintain with any degree of intellectual coherence an objection to the enshrining of convention in statute. That is what the clause does and it does so in a very particular way. I had genuinely thought that it was an oversight, but I now understand, having discussed the amendments, that it was intentional.
<P>
In subsection (1), and all subsequent subsections, there is a clear intention to give the Treasury maximum discretion. The centrepiece of the clause is to give the most powerful Department—which has by convention power over Government expenditure as well as fiscal matters, and monetary control through the Monetary Policy Committee—a statutory right to decide the shape of Government accounts. Is that the right approach? Is it even a defensible approach? Would any democracy approaching this matter with a genuinely open mind, asked how it would like to order its affairs, conceivably have answered in this way? I believe that the answer is no.
<P>
A wide variety of bodies could be made responsible for the public accounts. Opposition Members have revealed that we have an open mind about the choice of the most appropriate body. I suspect that that view is shared by many other members of the Committee, who have—not unusually—remained silent. During the long course of the Bill's preparation, the Government had ample opportunity to give that matter serious consideration and to come up with any number of possible loci of the power to settle the national accounts. However, they did not do so. They decided that it should be the Treasury.
<P>
I can almost see the instructions on drafting the clause that Ministers gave to parliamentary counsel: ``Give the Treasury maximum discretion. Limit that discretion as little as possible. Ensure that Parliament is given as little statutory function as possible.'' That must have been what was put into the mind of the parliamentary draftsman, because all the amendments tend to the opposite effect—to try to limit discretion, in one way or another; to try to give Parliament and its agencies more jurisdiction; to try to give Parliament more ability to exercise its jurisdiction through greater transparency by giving external bodies more power. We tried all those avenues, but all were rejected. The logic, therefore, must be that the Government wish to give maximum discretion to the Treasury.
<P>
This morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) drew the Committee's attention to subsection (1). He said that when he showed it to people who were naïve about legislation, and merely knew about finance and accounting, they laughed. It is an extraordinary subsection. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A government department for which an estimate is approved by the House of Commons in respect of a financial year shall prepare accounts (to be known as resource accounts) for that year detailing—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a)resources acquired, held or disposed of by the department during the year, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the use by the department of resources during the year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is majestic. It would be difficult to think of a way in which one could say that a Department should prepare accounts and make no other specifications in any respect—and yet occupy six lines in doing so. That is a triumph of the parliamentary draftsman's art, but bad legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> In the interests of fairness, I remind my hon. Friend of the Minister's argument. As I recall, she argued that any provision that was more tightly drawn would be a restriction on the possible future presentation—or, presumably, improvement—of accounting. In the context of the amendment, she implied that the words ``income'', ``expenditure'', ``assets'', ``liabilities'' and ``cash'' might somehow change their meaning, thereby rendering the Bill invalid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I regret to say that, for the first time in the course of the Committee's proceedings, my right hon. Friend has fallen into error. The Minister did not say that those words might change their meaning, which is a proposition that has some plausibility, however slight. She went further. She said that even an amendment that merely sought to enshrine those words, with their changing meaning across time—they have been in the conceptual vocabulary of accountancy for only 700 years or so—could change, and was therefore objectionable. Although it will go unnoticed in our history, that must be one of the most remarkable utterances that has ever been made by a Minister. I shall treasure it for a long time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Member yet again, but he should not be rehearsing matters that the Committee considered this morning under amendment No. 24. He can refer to aspects of the clause during his tour de force on clause stand part, but he cannot reiterate exactly the same arguments.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall, of course, be guided by your ruling, Mr. Butterfill. The Economic Secretary made remarks about which I was misled by the amusements of my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden. The serious point is that the logic of the clause—exposed in one particular subsection, but also in others—is that the Treasury must be given discretion. We must understand that proposition and decide whether we can remotely live with it.
<P>
Justification depends on the view that the Treasury—not Parliament or Departments—is the proper guarantor of the propriety of public accounts. I recognise that conceptual position. Ministers have not been open in announcing it as their view; I hope that they will be in future. We shall certainly make it our business to bring it to the attention of the public. It is a possible view that someone might have. However, that view, which lies behind and forms the essence of the clause, is wrong, partly for the reasons that I was outlining when you brought me to task earlier, Mr. Butterfill—that the Treasury is no longer and will not be in future a body concerned solely with the getting and spending of money. It is also increasingly concerned with presenting to the public the alleged virtues of the way in which the Government raise and spend money.
<P>
It is categorically wrong that a Department of State, one of the primary functions of which is to put a good presentation on accounts, should be the body to which the Bill gives discretion to settle the form and shape of those accounts. I suspect that hon. Members of all parties would agree that that is wrong. It is also wrong for the deeper reason of what it says about the role of Parliament—or, more accurately, what the role of Parliament should not be in these matters.
<P>
The clause invites us not to take Parliament seriously. It is the pronounced opinion of the Economic Secretary that it is improper to enshrine in legislation the rights of Parliament in relation to public accounts. I can think of no clearer exposition of the view that we should not take Parliament seriously in that regard. That does not mean that the Economic Secretary does not take the PAC seriously as a provider of further scrutiny. I am sure that she does. However, she states that Parliament should not, in legislative terms, be regarded as having a primary role. The Executive has that role. The Treasury is the supreme example of the Executive. In a sense, the Treasury is the Executive. Everything else in the Executive depends on it.
<P>
If we accept the clause, we subscribe to the view that the apex of the Executive—the Department of which the Prime Minister is First Lord—is the right place to invest the power of inspecting whether the Executive can account for themselves appropriately, which I find intrinsically implausible. It is like saying that the right person to audit a company is its finance director. If that proposition were advanced by the Conservative or Liberal Opposition—or, indeed, the PAC—with respect to the private sector, the horror would be evident.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend has a distinguished career in the City and in international finance. From his experience of transactions in respected City institutions and in Rothschild, does my hon. Friend know of any Governments who would allow their Finance Ministers to audit themselves in the way suggested by the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I certainly will not tread on your indulgence far, Mr. Butterfill, by responding at any length to my hon. Friend, but he reminds me that I have worked to privatise the industries of one regime that displays that characteristic—Cuba. It operates on precisely that principle. Legislation in Cuba is a rapid matter; it can be done in 24 hours, without fail.
<P>
Clause 5 tells us not that the Government do not want to go through due process, nor that they do not intend to obey the conventions—I take entirely at face value the Minister's earlier statements about the conventions—but that from a legislative point of view the Treasury should determine the shape of the national accounts. I do not think that I am exaggerating. I am seeking hard not to exaggerate one iota, but that is what clause 5 does. That is the architecture of clause 5.
<P>
I beg the Minister to go back and think this over further and ask whether the Government really intend to announce that as their policy. While of course the Chancellor and the Treasury should have the right and power to determine economic policy, and while of course they should have the right to raise the money and to spend it, someone else—I care not who—should surely have the right to determine the shape of the accounts that determine whether that money has been spent in accordance with the policy, just as the CAG, and in some cases also, regrettably, external auditors, has the right to determine whether the money has been properly spent in accordance with those accounts.
<P>
If one accepts the idea of the independence of the auditor as an enforcement mechanism, one is bound to accept the idea of some independent body—Parliament or other—to set up the standards. That is what we are debating in the clause. The Government are taking a position that is neither appropriate nor defensible. They have come to it, so to speak, by mistake because they have listened to the perfectly understandable wishes of the officials within the Treasury who see themselves as the group of people best able to manage the public finances with discretion and who do not want the intrusion of outsiders. That is no adverse comment. I stress that, as the Minister came close to accusing me of saying something insulting. I have the highest admiration for those people and indeed some of them are friends. There are none for whom I have anything but admiration. They are fine public servants, but because of their position, they have an interest, just as we all do, in conducting their business on behalf of the Government as expeditiously and with as little interference as possible. Ministers have over-subscribed to that agenda and are doing something that is not in the interests of democracy or good government, and which the Committee should reject.
<P>
I would recommend voting against the clause, but in so doing we would effectively wreck the Bill. I know, Mr. Butterfill, that you would prevent us from voting against the clause if to do so would technically wreck the Bill, but we also want to show that we hope that the spirit of the Bill will be realised in practise. We all want resource accounts so we are bound to accept the clause with all its woeful inaccuracies and inadequacies and hope that on Report or in another place it will be substantially revised, as it certainly needs to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I did not intend to speak on clause stand part, but the argument of the hon. Member for West Dorset has enraged me, not because I disagree with it, but because he pinpointed an issue at the heart of the way in which the British Government works and are accountable to Parliament, and an issue that I have long been concerned about and campaigned against: the ubiquitous power of the Treasury in Whitehall and its influence on how decisions are taken. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am a fan of many of those who work in the Treasury and a great admirer of much of its output, but it has sought over many years to take on power after power. It has also seen off many challenges to its powers—one thinks of the Department of Economic Affairs, which was created in the 1960s. The Treasury seems determined to ensure that all decision-making power rests with it, and clause 5 is just one more example of that.
<P>
This is a serious issue. Some people do not think that determination of all the different policy questions involved in running the economy and the public finances should be centralised. It is much better if outside bodies can have an input into decisions and judge whether a particular decision is right. Other bodies should share some of the decision-making power. To wear my party philosophy on my sleeve for a minute, as a Liberal I believe in decentralising power and allowing pluralism to develop and grow in the country. For many years, the Treasury has been a bastion against such decentralisation and pluralism in many areas. In this instance, it appears to want to prevent another body being involved in account standard setting and to ensure that no one else can have a say, which is deeply regrettable.
<P>
In the past 50 or 60 years, we have seen a different theory of government develop. In the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, people had great faith in government and in Government Departments—they trusted them to get it right and felt that as those Departments were the experts, everything could be left to them and there was no need to question the way in which civil servants carried out their duties on the public's behalf. But that faith was shattered, partly because of failures in government and in policy implementation, but also because people realised that centralising everything often led to bad decision-making. There are vested interests and people are asked to take too many decisions. People have neither the skill nor the time to take all those decisions.
<P>
The theory of government has thus changed from an unquestioning faith in it to the strongly liberal view that we should limit it and the power of its different parts. Liberal Democrats welcomed the Government's decision to make the Bank of England independent and to transfer power over monetary policy from the Treasury to the Bank of England. It was a major reduction in the Treasury's power—one of the first such reductions for centuries. In the context of clause 5, the way in which the incoming Labour Government achieved that transfer is instructive. They did it in their first few days because they knew that if they waited, there would be a backlash from the mandarins. Treasury civil servants would not have stood for it. They would have argued and battled and there would have been warfare throughout Whitehall. People would have objected to such a reduction of Treasury power, so it was done immediately and quickly. Unfortunately, however, the setting of accounting standards and decisions about who should have the power to set them—which have been debated for many years—is being tackled by the Government halfway through their tern of office, when they have been imprisoned by the mandarins' thinking.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> How many members of the Monetary Policy Committee under the auspices of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's newly independent Bank of England are appointed by the Chancellor or the Prime Minister?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That question has nothing to do with matters being considered by the Committee. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will not be tempted to answer it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Of course, I shall not. Naturally, I would have attempted to reply, had the hon. Gentleman asked a question that was in order.
<P>
In relation to the independent Bank of England and the parallel with account standard setting in clause 5, the Treasury is reluctant to have any of its powers taken away. It is fighting hard to prevent that. Indeed, it is always on the look-out to get more powers. Having lost power over monetary policy, over the past few years it has attempted to get ever more power and its tentacles extend further into Whitehall than ever before.
<P>
A key element of that relates to the Bill. Public service agreements are a contract between spending Departments and the Treasury and represent the biggest increase in the power of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury for many years. Following the Bank of England's independence, it is not surprising that the Treasury is looking for ways of regaining some of its powers. It is not worrying about interest rates now, so perhaps it wants to worry about other things.
<P>
Clause 5 demonstrates that the Treasury wants to worry about accounts and ensure that it directs how they are drawn up. That is a great shame. It is up to the Committee and—on Report—the House, to prevent the continuation of a Treasury-centralised culture. We have an opportunity to do that if we persuade the Government, or colleagues in another place, to reconsider between now and Report and ensure that the power in clause 5 is not given to the Treasury.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset was concerned that voting against the clause would make the Bill technically inoperable and effectively useless. He was rightly concerned because he, I, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and, indeed, the Government are keen on resource accounting and budgeting, which we believe to be a major step forward. We do not want to hinder that process; there is no point in throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
<P>
I seek your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. I wonder whether it is possible to vote against the clause stand part in order to send the Government a clear signal that, before Report, they should draft a new clause that answers all the questions that we have raised.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I have taken advice on the matter and consulted ``Erskine May''. There is no procedural objection to the clause being negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. Butterfill, which is instructive for hon. Members. If we voted against the measure, we could wait and see whether the Government come up with a clause that will do the job properly. If they do not do that before Report, Ministers can rest assured that my hon. Friends and I and hon. Gentlemen in other parties will get together to try to reinstate a clause that is similar but less objectionable. I should be interested to hear from the hon. Member for West Dorset whether, on the basis of the ruling from the Chair, he feels, as I do, that it would be appropriate to put the clause to the vote and defeat it today. Like the hon. Gentleman, I have grave reservations about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I add my welcome to you as chair of the Committee this afternoon, Mr Butterfill.
<P>
Dare I suggest that it might have been instructive for some of us to have sight of some of the parliamentary debates of the 1860s and 1920s, when this territory was last discussed? I have often asked myself why, on both occasions, the Governments of the day opted for cash accounting when resource accounting was well known about and companies used it.
<P>
I believe that the main answer is that, although cash accounting does not present a clear picture of how resources are being used, it is a straightforward accounting system which does not raise the major problems that resource accounting raises, and does not permit—to use the term in a polite sense—the distortion or cooking of the books to anything like the extent that resource accounting does.
<P>
Stepping back for a moment, I remind the Committee that, in principle, resource accounting should give us a better picture of the way in which we use our resources. But it also raises many big issues in the fairly obvious areas of depreciation policies and revaluation policies, and whether software is a big expense or an investment, and over what period it should be depreciated. As I have said, where in the public finance initiative and public-private collaboration are there contingent liabilities and where are there not, and on what basis does one determine whether something is a contingent liability? I suspect that past Parliaments concluded that it was safer to stick to the crudities of cash accounting than to go down a path that could easily result in meaningless figures.
<P>
The point about the clause—which was best made by the hon. Member for Swansea, West—was that it was extraordinary, and should be unthinkable, that we were switching to the much more complicated and difficult area of resource accounting while not accepting the traditional and straightforward definition of what is required and is embodied in the Companies Acts from companies. For the Government to claim, for some poked-up reason, that that would be difficult sends me a very bad signal that, in principle, the Treasury and the Government do not want to be bound by any form of independent outside principles, rules or directives on the basis on which they will implement resource accounting. They intend to retain flexibility in how they will do it, and what rules they will follow. That is going down a dangerous, unfortunate and undesirable path and, as night follows day, if we switch to resource accounting there is a need also to switch in a more defined and determined way to outside standards and accepted definitions, and all that goes with that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset talked about the mandarins, and, in a sense, clause 5 might well be called the Sir Humphrey clause. But behind the Treasury lies the Government of the day, whose business, in essence, it is doing. It occurred to me that there could be some very interesting debates in Cabinet. If one can change the depreciation policy a bit, one can also juggle around and decide to make a significant change for Minister A, who happens to he extremely powerful, and another change that will screw Minister B, if one wants to get rid of him. Such a possibility is open to whoever is in government via the powers that the Treasury is taking unto itself, which provide substantially greater opportunity to gerrymander the figures.
<P>
As I said, the fact that the Government are taking the wrong road on such an important accounting change sends me a signal about their creditworthiness. The Bill should be about independent standards and about defining more precisely what is to be done and how it should be done, but it does the reverse, especially in clause 5. I felt that the Minister was not fully committed to the arguments that she advanced in opposing amendment No. 24, which is easily the most important amendment in today's amendment paper. As I said, the right hon. Member for Swansea, West summed the matter up. It is unthinkable for the same basic standards and definitions that apply in the private sector not to apply in the Government sector. Those standards are required of companies by the Companies Acts, so why will not the Government accept that they are needed in the Bill? The Committee should vote against the clause, unless the Minister and the Government change their minds on the implementation of amendment No. 24. Whatever the outcome of the vote, an important signal will be sent to inform the Government that the clause covers crucial territory and needs to be thought out again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I am in favour of resource accounting progressing as quickly as is compatible with the introduction of decent legislation. I will not vote against the clause for that reason alone. I fully expect that it will be amended in the other place; it is certainly capable of amendment to make it better and to meet some of the concerns that have been expressed. It would be wrong for me, however, to let it pass without commenting on why I think that the philosophy behind it and the Bill is flawed, especially bearing in mind the subsequent scrutiny to which our deliberations may be subjected.
<P>
Hon. Members seeking to approve the Bill's audit and accountability arrangements keep hearing the same response. I heard it in the PAC yesterday from the Chief Secretary, and from the Minister on Tuesday in this Committee. We have been told that the Bill is not about audit. Officials have often used that phrase, but almost a third of the Bill, or seven out of 26 clauses, is about audit. It repeals 16 out of 17—perhaps one less, soon—of the key clauses in Audit and Exchequer Bills the dates of which range from 1866 to 1921 to 1983. Why is the Bill on the one hand not about audit, while on the other it changes such enormously important considerations relating to it? The reason, in my view, is that the Government's original approach to the Bill and the philosophy behind it are flawed. That philosophy is so flawed that if I were the Minister who received the draft Bill I would have sent it back. It is flawed because the problems in the clause and in the Bill cannot be addressed without making a decision on who decides a number of key issues. Who decides what information will be provided to Parliament and on the standards of that information? Who regulates those standards? Who decides how they will be amended to maintain the relevance and effectiveness of the Bill? This Bill cannot be presented without answering the question, ``Who decides?'' As hon. Members have said, the answer in virtually every case is the Treasury
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For two reasons, that is the wrong decision. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset eloquently said, it is wrong because the Treasury has an interest, albeit the good interest of maintaining the country's creditworthiness and the standing of the Government of the day. But that interest could bias its judgment in some key decisions.
<P>
Secondly, more fundamentally, the decision is wrong because it trammels the rights of Parliament. The CAG is an authoritative and independent figure in our constitution. He is also the creature of Parliament. Everything that has been done since 1866 has been aimed at making him solely the creature of Parliament. The explicit issues that we have talked about—sometimes humorously, sometimes at length, for which I apologise to the Economic Secretary—relate to why the CAG has been made solely the creature of Parliament. He does, however, have a great deal of independence on funding matters, decision making and appointments, and he can be removed only by a vote in the House of Commons and the other place. As such, the decision is constitutionally wrong.
<P>
Although I will vote for the clause, I want to make my feelings clear about the flawed philosophy behind the Bill and the clause in particular. The PAC has said a number of times that the Bill represents a missed opportunity of gargantuan proportions, but it is more than that; it is a wrong turning for Parliament and accountability in this country. If we do not manage to correct the flaws, I hope that they will be put right in another place.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful, especially to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden for the brief and succinct statement of his position. I understand why the issues concern him, but it was a bit unfair to say that the Bill was not about auditing but about other issues such as access. The Government see it as a vehicle to introduce resource accounting and budgeting. The intention is to introduce that with the minimum of change. Although we accept the need to modernise one or two measures, we want to swing existing arrangements forward to resource accounting and budgeting mode with the minimum of additional change. I hope that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and other Committee members understand that that is our motivation. They will not be surprised to learn that we believe that the clause has much to recommend it as it stands, although we have heard what has been said about it.
<P>
I should tackle some of the specific points that have been made. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked about depreciation policy. Depreciation rates are based on NAO scrutinised rates and are not changed in year. I was not clear, but I think that he suggested that policy might somehow be changed in the Cabinet. That is not so, and it is worth putting on the record at least the outline of the current arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also remarked on the possibility for creative accounting. It would be sensible to run through matters one more time. The contents of the Resource Accounting Manual have been reviewed by the FRAB, an independent body established for that purpose. Its members include representatives from the NAO, the Accounting Standards Board and various Departments, and academic specialists in finance and accounting. As we discussed, the members may include a Member of the House. The Public Accounts Committee exercised that right until 1997 but has not done so since, although the opportunity remains.
<P>
Although the FRAB acts in an advisory capacity, it periodically prepares reports on its activities, which are submitted to Parliament. If the board did not agree with what went into the RAM, it could highlight that in the report. We have discussed that, but it is worth doing so again because the hon. Gentleman is still saying that there is great potential for creative accounting with nothing in the way. There is much in the way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am certain that the Minister's intent and belief is as she describes. However, how can she accept that the clause reflects that which she describes? Clause 5(3) includes the wording:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``conform to generally accepted accounting practice subject to such adaptations as are necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Adaptations would be at the Treasury's determination. The practice may be sound, but the clause may allow it to go off the rails. Regardless of whether that happens—we do not know whether it will—that concerns me. Why do we want a clause that opens up such possibilities?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I may return to answer the hon. Gentleman's earlier points and what he has said now in my further remarks.
<P>
I should turn to the remarks of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. The Treasury accepts the standards set by the ASB; it does not set standards. Clause 5 moves away from that position. Ironically, it changes the basic statutory position in the opposite direction from that alleged by Opposition Members. I am sure that you will be glad, Mr. Butterfill, that I shall not be giving a book review, but the existing legislation—the Exchequer and Audit Department Act, 1866—already gives the Treasury powers to determine the accounting arrangements. The Treasury's position is therefore already statutory and is not based on convention, as has been alleged. The clause constrains the existing freedom of the Treasury to determine the form of the accounts by requiring resource accounts to follow GAAP, subject to adaptations necessary in the context of departmental accounts. That is contrary to the developing paranoia. I was becoming worried and wondered whether, along with the books, any people in white coats would arrive to help the Opposition. I even wondered whether the coats with the slightly odd arms would appear, given the Opposition's paranoia about the use of the word ``Treasury''.
<P>
The clause repeatedly refers to the Treasury because it will constrain the powers of the Treasury. Instead of simply rolling forward from 1866, we shall constrain it as I have outlined. I commend the clause to the Committee, because it will meet many of the points that Opposition Members have made. We do not want the Treasury to operate in a vacuum without constraint. The clause will do the job of constraining the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I confess that I do not fully understand why the Government have bothered to legislate if that is the Economic Secretary's view. They could have introduced resource accounts without legislation as a matter of administrative practice. There was no necessity to legislate, nor for the clause or even the Committee to exist. The Bill is needed only if the intention is to enshrine in law absolutely iron-clad procedures to determine the character of accounts. The Economic Secretary's logic does not hold just because the clause moves an inch in that direction.
<P>
I am persuaded by what the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said in the light of your ruling, Mr. Butterfill. Although we shall do something that is conceptually incoherent, it will be procedurally proper and act as a marker We want the Bill to be enacted because the Government have chosen to introduce the changes legislatively, but we do not want it to contain the clause. That is why we shall vote against the clause this evening, and we expect our colleagues in the House and another place to ensure that the Bill is enacted in a different form.

<P>
and he shall certify'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> It is a pleasure to reach a point where I can congratulate the Government. I am pleased to note from amendment No. 73, that the Government have accepted the issues raised in amendment No. 29. I look forward to hearing from the Economic Secretary. I have not had long to consider amendment No. 73 in detail, so I shall listen carefully to her comments and hope that I will be able to withdraw may amendment on the basis of them.
<P>
Under the amendment, the regularity aspect of the CAG's examinations of resources accounts would be updated so that they covered resources as well as cash. The CAG's consideration of regularity is a key difference between his work and that of auditors operating in the private sector because the CAG expresses the additional opinion whether the money provided by Parliament has been expended as Parliament intended. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and I debated that earlier with respect to the ASB. Recent improper payments in the UK's embassies were brought to Parliament's attention.
<P>
The requirement for the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide Parliament with assurances on regularity was introduced as a specific provision in the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1921. Clause 6 of the Bill provides the CAG with regularity work on the same terms as existing statute, but it covers only uses for which Departments have paid cash. However, under the Bill as a whole, Parliament will not only authorise Departments to spend cash but authorise their use of resources. It was a major omission that the Bill as originally drafted did not provide Parliament with the assurance that the use of all resources authorised by Parliament was not confined to cash. Parliament will want to know about the Department's use of assets and that its commitment of liabilities during the year is in accordance with the terms of parliamentary approval in estimates.
<P>
That was the purpose of my amendment. I shall listen carefully to the Minister, but I believe that her amendment shares the same purpose. I look forward to hearing her confirm that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Miss Melanie Griffiths—[Laughter.] I am sorry, it is the juxtaposition of Miss Melanie Johnson and Jane Griffiths in the Room.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will make no comment about the other lady to whom you referred, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The Government fully believe in the importance of rigorous and independent audit for resource accounts. Both Opposition amendment No. 29 and Government amendment No. 73 expand the audit requirement in clause 6(1)(b) to include resources as well as cash. Amendment No. 34 will require a regularity audit by the CAG of accounts produced under clause 7.
<P>
The CAG traditionally gives a two part audit certificate. The first is a report on the accounts. Under RAB that will, as noted above, become a ``true and fair'' view rather than a ``properly presents'' view as it is at the moment. The ``true and fair view'' opinion is the gold standard of auditing. The second part is a regularity opinion—that money was spent in accordance with Parliament's intentions. This part of the audit will remain unchanged under RAB, except that the amendments will extend it to cover the use of resources.
<P>
It is clear that under RAB the CAG's audit work on behalf of the House of Commons must include resources, as well as cash. Parliament will vote the use of resources as well as cash, so it must be given an assurance that such resources have been used for the purpose authorised. It was always clear from the point of view of parliamentary accountability and auditing practice that that should be the case, but it proved more difficult than we thought to express it in legal terms. That is why the important concept was missing from the original Bill. We have now introduced amendment No. 73 to rectify that deficiency. It is not far away from the drafting of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden. The intention is the same, but amendment No. 73 best meets the requirements of what parliamentary draftsmen believe is needed in the Bill.
<P>
Under RAB, Parliament will be voting resource amounts to Departments. However, resources are not the same as cash. With cash, Parliament is effectively giving money to the Department. With resources, Parliament will be voting to authorise the use of those resources. That is particularly important for non-cash items such as depreciation, which are not tangible.
<P>
What is important from the audit point of view is that Departments did, in fact, use the resources for the purposes for which Parliament authorised their use when it voted the estimate. Parliament still controls the use of those resources as it sets a limit in monetary terms on the amount of such resources that it authorises, and determines for what purposes—as set out in estimates—the resources can be used. We are, therefore, proposing an amendment expressed in terms of the authorisation of a ``use of resources''.
<P>
The Government do not believe that amendment No. 34 is strictly necessary. As originally drafted, the clause left the form of the CAG's audit opinion entirely to his discretion, which would have enabled him to report on the regularity of accounts prepared under the clause when he thought it necessary. However, we have no objection to making it a statutory requirement for the Comptroller and Auditor General to report on the regularity of the accounts, if he so wishes, and we shall table an amendment to that effect on Report.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in Clause 6, page 4, line 2, leave out `inform the Treasury and'.
<P>
It has never been the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General has had to inform the Treasury of the results of his audits and it is not our intention to introduce such a requirement. We therefore propose to remove such wording. The amendment should make it clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General who is, of course, an officer of the House of Commons—as we have emphasised already in our debates—carries out his work on behalf of the House and reports back to it. I hope that it will help to emphasise the independent role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to spend more than a minute on the amendment, but wish just to point out that, while we are all agreed on the amendment, it is an indication of the truth or otherwise of my remarks throughout our proceedings that parliamentary counsel slips into the Bill such innocuous phrases as ``shall inform the Treasury''. How did that happen, when it has never been usual practice? It seems that parliamentary counsel is looking for all ways in which to give the Treasury such power. The phrase is an interesting tell-tale point.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Mr. Butterfill, it is not.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 4, line 2, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Comptroller and Auditor General may examine any performance statement which he receives from a department under section 5(4A) and report hereon.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to the performance reports. Amendment No. 25 to clause 5, which we discussed earlier, was designed to require Departments to produce performance information. I outlined at some length earlier the case for performance reporting and external validation. The points that I made then are equally valid now. I propose to press the amendment to a Division, because I want a measure of the Committee's view about it.
<P>
Performance information that has not been independently validated is, at best, of little use and, at worst, it could be positively detrimental. Independent validation avoids the potential for misuse or abuse of performance data. Parliament has always considered the production and independent validation of performance measures to be a key component of the resource accounting initiative. The Treasury Joint Committee and the Procedure Committee have also reached that conclusion, as has the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
The PAC's interest in the matter is not new. It dates back to 1987 when it recommended that ground rules be established to govern the admissibility, relevance and reliability of performance data. My predecessor and I have reiterated that point at every possible opportunity when resource accounting was discussed. Admissibility means that public bodies cannot pick and choose between performance indicators and perhaps change them over time without proper reason in the public interest rather than some political interest. I mentioned this morning the disputes that occurred in the past with the previous Government on employment statistics, for example. There were changes over time and disputes in Parliament about whether such changes were appropriate. There was no validation of those measures, which would have made a sterile debate more functional in terms of policy.
<P>
The relevance rule was recommended so that Parliament could quickly see that performance information was central to a body's activities. I should have thought that that was a straightforward measure. Reliability will ensure that performance data is materially accurate. In l995, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew Parliament's attention to the lack of independent validation of performance targets and achievement, which caused the PAC to call for independent validation. That was in its 15th report of 1994-95. The Committee reiterated that point in its subsequent reports on resource accounting published in 1996 and 1998, and it has made that recommendation when relevant in other reports as well. It is not a valid response that there has not been time to consider the matter and that there would have to be a hasty change to the Bill. That is not an acceptable argument in this context.
<P>
We might be told that it is inherently difficult to measure the achievement of performance targets. It is not an exact science. Of course, I recognise that, but it is not rocket science. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), there are plenty of examples outside government, in the private sector, of measuring quantitative matters, such as marketing issues, and so on. I shall cite an example of how straightforward the matter can be. The Department for Education is committed to a performance target of increasing the coverage of nursery places for three-year-olds from 34 per cent. to 66 per cent. by 2002, focusing on the most deprived areas of the country. That is an eminently laudable aim, which I support. The Department will collect the relevant information and report the extent to which it has achieved its target. The Comptroller and Auditor General's role is to check the systems for collecting the information, the veracity of the conclusions and whether the outcome has been represented fairly. He will then report his findings to Parliament. How can the Government object to that?
<P>
Performance measures must be both meaningful and independently validated if they are to instil public confidence. There is a proliferation of performance targets. Only this week, the hon. Member for Bath published research on the scale of Government targets. He identified 2,500 different performance targets set by the Government since May 1997. The Government's annual report for 1998-99 identified 600 targets, but the hon. Member for Bath identified almost four times as many. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has set 500 targets. They are now thought to be so numerous that some agencies have begun setting targets for achieving targets. For example, the Highways Agency apparently has a target to meet
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``target indicators to measure the effectiveness of the agency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is certainly some proliferation going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Targets to reduce targets perhaps?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> That might be a good idea. The Government will try to take comfort from the targets that they claim to have achieved, but without independent validation there is a real risk that the performance information could be abused. The amendment provides for the Department's performance report to be subject to examination and report by the CAG. The failure of the Bill specifically to provide for the CAG to examine and report on departmental performance information will undermine the credibility and usefulness of that information.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I have a lot in common with what the right hon. Gentleman said about the importance of checking performance information, but his amendment gives that task in every case to the CAG. Why does he want that one-size-fits-all approach to be taken?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> If a drafting error is preventing what we intend, we shall of course correct it. We are talking about central Government targets here. The Audit Commission has specific legislated rights in other areas, as I mentioned this morning. The reason for this is the one I touched on in clause 5 stand part and relates to the rights of Parliament. The CAG is Parliament's creature. He is an independent adjudicator here, but he is also Parliament's servant. This is a matter for Parliament. We are a parliamentary democracy. Hard reliable facts are the currency in which a proper democracy works. That is how our disputes and debates are resolved.
<P>
The Minister alluded to a number of other points. The Committee may now have had a chance to look at the transcript of the PAC's interview yesterday of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. It was suggested that somehow this action would take the CAG too close to policy. The PAC operates entirely on the basis of unanimity. It is a wholly non-partisan Committee. More than one hon. Member present today has sat on it and will understand that. It is very careful, both in its own deliberations and in what the CAG does, to avoid pronouncing on policy. The CAG has undertaken a number of ad hoc assessments of performance measures.
<P>
The document on welfare fraud on which I commented on television and radio this morning assesses some measures in that respect. Indeed, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would be very familiar with that, given his previous involvement. He knows the difficulties of measurement in that area and the various actions that the CAG has taken to try to help the Department enhance its assessment of some of those difficult measures. He does that without impinging on policy. He assists the Government in one sense, and indeed Parliament, to make their judgment on policy because he ensures that the facts available to them are honest, true, accurate and reliable.
<P>
Let me point out quite how ridiculous this argument is. The CAG is explicitly tasked with the assessment of value for money in Government activity. Time and time again, that takes him close to the effectiveness of policy. There are 50 reports a year on value for money and we never see him step across the touchline into breaching our self-imposed limitations—self-imposed by Parliament—on not touching on policy. I have fought hard to avoid involving the CAG in matters in which policy might be implicated. There have been attempts by some Select Committees to have the National Audit Office serve them. Select Committees do deal in policy. As a result, the rule that we have established is that we can second staff to them, but the NAO cannot ever serve a Select Committee because if it did it would become implicated in policy the effectiveness of which it might later assess under a value for money study. This is a complete canard, an Aunt Sally. I do not see it as an acceptable argument in this case.
<P>
To summarise, I hope fairly, the discussion with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury yesterday, it would be fair to say that he had a deal of sympathy with the issues that we tried to address. He gave not an inch, not even a millimetre, in terms of changes to the Bill, nor would I have expected him to do so at our meeting, which was not the appropriate place. However, he appeared to understand, and indeed agreed with my description this morning of the performance measurement side of resource accounting as a reform with prospects for revolutionary change in the administration of Whitehall, in the public interest. That is what all this is about. It is about Parliament's involvement in and oversight of what could be a massive change in the way in which Government in this country is run, and held to account.
<P>
I said this morning that the original concerns of the Comptroller and Auditor General about it, and half of our discussions of the previous clause, related to the historic role of Parliament in control and supply. In my view, the second half of this matter, on which the Bill, sadly, is entirely silent will be the most important component of Parliament's future activity—which is assessment of the delivery of public service in this country and Members of Parliament ensuring that public services that go to their constituents are of the highest quality, give the best value for money and are the most effective that any Government can provide. For that reason, my second response to the Minister's comments is that I want the CAG to have a critical say in the validity of the figures so that the House can depend on them.

<B>Mr. Williams:</B> This morning I began a series of comments which I ended to allow a vote to take place before lunch. I should like to touch on them again.
<P>
I argued that transparency helped accountability and therefore democracy. But transparency also helps efficiency in Government. With transparency, it is more difficult for the machine to conceal from the Minister the fact that it is not delivering. If targets are not being met, transparency gives early warning to Ministers that the method of delivery may need to be addressed. So it is in everyone's interest to have transparent, reliable, authentic figures that we as Members of Parliament can rely on. Hon. Members who are lucky enough to be in Government now and future hon. Members will also be able to rely on them. It is preposterous to accept that targets are worth setting, but that it is not worth ensuring that they are right. Validation is necessary. It is better not to have targets if they are inaccurately and unreliably delivered. It is in the Government's interests as well as those of Parliament and of accountability.
<P>
One big difference between the Public Accounts Committee and other Select Committees—this is a matter of envy to the latter—is that in operating we have an enormous advantage over all other Committees. We have the NAO and 750 people burrowing in Departments finding and verifying facts. It does not produce a report and present the figures until those figures have been verified and accepted by the Department. As most hon. Members know, there are two discrete hearings a week. We can do that because, unlike other Committees, we do not have the yah-boo politics that we see in Question Time in the Chamber. We do not have to argue about the facts, because they are already there. When we have a discussion with civil servants, it will perhaps be about why they have not delivered as well as they should. I must emphasise that there is nothing insidious about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I want to reinforce the point that the right hon. Gentleman is making. He and I have both been Ministers in different Governments and we well understand how the pressure is transmitted. As he said, this measure would help Ministers. New Ministers might find it difficult to understand that, when Parliament exacts or demands information from them, their power with respect to their Department is transformed.
<P>
One of the problems that we face today in a Parliament with a relatively antiquated estimates procedure and control and supply procedure is that Ministers themselves are poorly informed because Parliament never challenges them. I am developing the point that the right hon. Member for Swansea, West made. The process of validation, legitimation and regularisation would materially improve the position of Ministers within their Departments because they could better understand how those Departments worked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Williams:</B> That is absolutely correct. Post Neill, Ministers are required to be accurate when answering parliamentary questions. If a machine is not feeding them accurate information, it is not the machine that will be called before the House of Commons to explain the mistake; it is the Minister, so it is in his or her interests to ensure that the machine is as efficient as it can be.
<P>
Reference was made to Pergau. I was the one who eventually managed to get Foreign Office Ministers to admit—after years of denial—that there was a military protocol. The only reason why I was able to do that was that I had the secret military protocol sitting on my desk, so I could phrase the question in such a way that it was clear to Ministers that I knew the answer. But we should not have to do that in Parliament. We could make life easier and politics more constructive.
<P>
I think of how cherished Question Time is and how difficult it is to get an oral question, yet how much of that time is frittered away in yah-boo arguments and shouting, ``Yes it is'', and ``No it isn't''? It would be far better if we could concentrate on the policy issues. Democracy, government and Parliament would benefit from that.
<P>
The Minister said that he wanted the minimum of changes, but there is no virtue in achieving the minimum. If a change will improve a Bill, it should be accepted. We have tabled amendments not to waste time but because we genuinely believe that they will enhance government and accountability to the House. We must put from our minds the thought that there should be no amendments and no significant giving way. We are arguing not from a political point of view but from the point of view of the Public Accounts Committee. Let us do what is right for Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not intend to speak at length, but I realise that it may nevertheless be necessary for me to stop when we reach the witching hour. I want to speak about the matter, which is in a different category from our discussions about the strict setting of financial accounting standards and from those that we will have about the audit of such standards.
<P>
The amendment is not essential to the Bill, but an opportunity would be missed if it were rejected. It would be perfectly possible to have a system of resource accounting like that for cash accounting that has long existed, without making any effort to have an audit of output measures. Indeed, there was no need, in the strict financial sense, to have introduced the value-for-money audit.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned—[Mr. Allen.]

Adjourned accordingly at Seven o'clock till Tuesday 18 January at half-past Ten o'clock.
