<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We have now reached another important part of the Bill covering the FSA's ability to make rules and to publish guidance. There are many amendments to discuss. The importance of part IX of the Bill to the new arrangements cannot be overstated. We are mindful that the practical, everyday success of the new regime will depend largely on getting the provisions right. When Parliament has finished its work on the Bill and it is enshrined on the statute book, part IX will be part of the life blood of the new regime.

<P>
As with many other aspects of the Bill, we are doing two things in part IX. First, we intend that the rule-making and related powers should give the FSA a powerful tool so that it may regulate with a firm and effective hand. Secondly, we have balanced those powers with a number of checks and balances so that the FSA is fully accountable in exercising its powers under part IX and that it is bound to act fairly and transparently in the exercise of those powers.

<P>
Within the checks and balances applying to the rule-making function, there are two main features. First, there is a number of detailed checks and balances specific to part IX—for example, the detailed consultation and cost-benefit analysis requirements in clause 125. We shall discuss those in greater detail as we come to the various clauses. Secondly, many of the more general accountability provisions which the Committee discussed in the context of part I and schedule 1 will apply to the FSA's rule-making functions and in particular the relative statutory objectives. Amendment No. 375 recognises that and proposes linking more directly the FSA's rule-making power to its statutory objectives. I shall comment on that in greater detail later and explain why the Opposition amendment is not necessary or appropriate.

<P>
The statutory objectives are relevant to the rule-making function. Clause 2(1) provides that when exercising its rule-making powers as a whole, the FSA should as far as possible, act in a way that is compatible with the regulatory objectives and in a way that the authority considers most appropriate for meeting them. The FSA must also have regard to various regulatory principles in clause 2(3), such as proportionality, facilitating innovation and so on when it exercises its general rule-making powers. The FSA must also abide by the relevant provisions of schedule 1. Perhaps one of the more important of those in the context of part IV is the provision in paragraph 5(2) to schedule 1, the effect of which will be that, in carrying out its general rule-making functions, the FSA must act via its governing body—essentially, its board.

<P>
Another important tool in schedule 1 is the FSA's annual report. Members of the Committee will know that its contents are to be agreed with the Treasury. It is proposed that the authority's report will contain an account of the way in which it has exercised its rule-making powers in the year in question. However, accountability, in the strict sense of checks and balances, is not the only factor that the Government have borne in mind. As members of the Committee will know by now, the Government are committed to as light-touch regulation as possible, but protection for consumers where necessary. Those principles were our watchword in preparing part IX. We are only too well aware that burdensome rules can stifle competitiveness and innovation. They can lead to high regulatory costs, and damage the United Kingdom's reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business. We fully appreciate that not only firms could suffer from over-burdensome regulations; consumers' interests also could be harmed. Higher industry costs are likely to be passed on to consumers and over-burdening regulation could stifle regulation and consumer choice. A balance has to be struck. Consumers need appropriate protection. We intend to ensure that where it is needed, they get it.

<P>
As for the FSA's rules under the Bill, broadly translated, the intention is that the authority has sufficient powers to make appropriate rules that protect consumers' interests. I will expand on what we think this means when we discuss the detail of amendment No. 375.

<P>
I will make a few general remarks about the FSA's rule-making powers under the Bill and about why we think that they are most appropriate to be vested in the authority, not, as has been suggested, in Ministers and Parliament. Essentially, it is because the nature of the rules that the FSA will make are so specialist in detail—not to mention numerous—that it would be entirely inappropriate for them to be made or exercised by, say, the Treasury, or Parliament. The rules must be made in the light of market knowledge by combining, for example, financial market practices and trends with supervisory risk modelling techniques on the other. To be able to deliver the right rules in the right circumstances, the person making them needs a detailed hands-on, everyday knowledge of the markets and the players, and a detailed understanding of their businesses, as well as a full understanding of how all those factors affect consumers' interests and rights.

<P>
The sheer volume of rules and other provisions that now exist and will need to be made under the new provisions is extremely significant. Currently there are three self-regulatory organisation rule books, the old Securities Investments Board rules and regulations, the FSA guide to banking supervisory policy, the Building Society Commission's rules and regulations, and regulations under the Insurance Companies Act 1982, not to mention the wealth of notices and more informal guidance that already exists. Although under the new regime there will be a considerable improvement on the existing position of the multitude of rules and regulations, the FSA's handbook of rules will inevitably be large. Rationalising and updating the current rules and requirements to which banks are currently subject and, more important still, keeping them updated and ensuring that they are appropriate, is a task which, in reality, the FSA is best placed to fulfil, reflecting the position under the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Act 1987, under which the authority has considerable discretion in relation to making policies and rules. However, the framework of accountability is much improved under the Bill.

<P>
We are glad that Lord Burns' Committee invited the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee to look at the draft Bill. Commenting in particularly on the authority's rule-making powers, they concluded that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is probably no sensible alternative to the approach set out in the draft bill. We have been supported in forming this view by having regard to the reality that it will be the Authority which will have the closest understanding of market conditions, and will consequently be best placed to deal with the detailed issues, including many technical issues, which will need to be covered in regulations.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Committee went on to note that, in relation to the exercise of the FSA's powers,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some further protections and disciplines . . . should be imposed''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have broadly followed them.

<P>
The Committee recommended, in particular, that the FSA should submit an annual report to the Secretary of State outlining the exercise of its rule-making powers. As I said earlier, our intention is that the report to the Treasury will involve the relevant provisions.

<P>
The Bill makes it clear that the exercise of the FSA's legislative functions can be carried out only by the FSA's governing body. Those powers cannot be delegated to individual FSA staff.

<P>
In other words, we are making rules, issuing standing guidance, publishing statements of principle and codes relating to, for example, the conduct of approved persons and market abuse. The authority must act through its board. The Bill states that the board shall comprise a majority of non-executive directors who are appointed by the Treasury.

<P>
In addition, the FSA is carrying out a major consultation exercise. It is preparing a new handbook of rules and guidance which will come into force at M2. The Bill will be implemented at that date under the rule-making powers that are contained in the legislation.

<P>
We intend the handbook to be one way in which the FSA will be able to deliver regulatory integration. The current hotch-potch of different rule books—there are, for example, 14 different versions of the conduct of business requirements—will be replaced by a single collection of regulatory standards. The intention is to deliver a consistent standard of protection for consumers and a level playing field for financial businesses, and to differentiate appropriately between different lines of business and different types of customer. In particular, the FSA said that inter-professional business will be treated differently from retail business.

<P>
I am assured that a complete FSA handbook will be in place by M2, but that its contents will be a mixture of new and old material. The FSA wants to strike a balance between continuity and change. Its intention is that the new material at M2 will concentrate on the new structures that the Bill will introduce, including the new persons provisions and other matters involving a high-priority need for rationalisation, including the regime for inter-professional dealings.

<P>
In some areas, such as the rationalisation of prudential requirements between different types of institution, the main changes will take place after M2. All that will be done in consultation with those who are interested in the regulatory system and with the public in general.

<P>
Consultation covered the proposed rules and guidance and the handbook's design and features. There has already been consultation on some important parts of the handbook, including the new FSA principles for business, and the approved persons regime. The next few months will be extremely busy. The FSA plans to publish consultations on the conduct of business requirements, the interim prudential arrangements and the authorisation, supervision and enforcement manuals, among others. We intend to allow sufficient time around M2 for firms to deal with the transitional arrangements. It is important to give firms the appropriate time in which to adjust their systems and other literature, where necessary.

<P>
The FSA signalled its determination to make the handbook user friendly and accessible. It will be available in paper form and work is under way to build an electronic infrastructure that will make it available on CD-ROM and the internet.

<P>
Clause 110 contains the Bill's basic rule-making power—it relates to what are known as the FSA's general rules. Those rules are required to authorise persons to protect the interests of consumers. I use the term ``consumer'' and shall continue to do so in this debate for ease of purpose. However, the clause does not use that term—it defines more fully the persons for whom the protection should be available, including persons who do not necessarily have a direct contractual relationship with the authorised firm to which the rules apply. For example, the FSA can make rules for the purpose of protecting the main third party beneficiary on an insurance policy.

<P>
Clause 110(1)(a) involves making rules to protect the interests of people who have used financial services. We broadly intend that, where appropriate, the basic rule-making power should cover reviews of past business, such as pensions mis-selling. We are considering whether further changes are needed to put that measure beyond doubt. What I referred to as the interests of the consumer rule-making purpose will have a broad application. We intend the clause to be broad enough to allow the FSA to make rules to further market integrity and to protect against systemic risk, as required by our international obligations under the investment services directive. Making rules in relation to such areas would be permissible in order to protect consumers.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although clause 110 does not relate generally to firms that do not carry out regulated activities, subsection (5) provides that rules that require an authorised person to maintain financial resources can take into account other members of the regulated person's group, even if they are not carrying out regulated activities. Clearly, that is important in order to ensure proper prudential supervision. For example, a bank, which is authorised and permitted to take deposits, might have in its group a leasing company or separate lending company, which is not. The authority would be able to consider the finances of the group as a whole to obtain a sensible view of its financial stability and resources.

<P>
The clause is expressly restricted in relation to European economic area passported firms. Subsection (6) makes it clear that rules made under clause 110 cannot prevent passported firms from carrying on business in the UK, as they are entitled to do by virtue of their passports. The FSA will, however, be able to apply its own conduct of business rules to firms that passport into the UK to do business. As required by the directives, rules relating to prudential supervision—in relation to capital requirements and basic fitness and propriety, for example—will remain a matter for the home state regulator.

<P>
Government amendment No. 431 is designed to make it clear that the rules under clause 110 will apply to authorised persons carrying on regulated activities, and not the other way round—regulated activities carried on by authorised persons. Keeping the existing formulation could be too narrow; on one level, it could be construed as meaning that the rule-making power would only apply to the carrying on of regulated activities, and not to the authorised person who carries them on. I trust that the amendment will not be contentious.

<P>
Government amendment No. 432 is a drafting amendment, which is consequential to the clarification proposed in Government amendment No. 431.

<P>
On amendment No. 375, I was a little surprised that Opposition Members seemed to be suggesting an expansion of the FSA's powers. I therefore find myself in the slightly unusual position of explaining why those powers should not be broader. Clause 110 is intended to provide rule-making powers in areas where the current legislation allows rules to be made. The central rule-making purpose is consumer protection, and we do not propose that the FSA should be given a broad, unlimited or blanket power to make rules for other purposes. Clause 110 provides that the FSA should be able to make rules for the broad purposes of consumer protection. To the extent that traditional rules are needed for purposes other than protecting the interests of consumers—furthering the FSA's other objectives such as maintaining market confidence or reducing financial crime—specific provision has been made in part IX of the Bill.

<P>
Clauses 115 and 117 relate to price stabilisation securities following a new issue and money laundering respectively. The clauses are an example of the Government making specific provision in addition to the basic consumer protection rule-making power, although, inevitably, there may be some overlap. For example, the FSA may wish to make rules that further market confidence and protect consumers. Under clause 110, the essential test is whether the rule is necessary or expedient for the purposes of protecting consumers. If not, it will not be permissible under the clause.

<P>
In exercising its rule-making power, the FSA will need to act, as far as is reasonably possible, in a way that is compatible with its regulatory objectives. It must also have regard to the so-called regulatory principles in clause 2(3). That is not to say that other objectives or principles considered in isolation would merit exercising the clause 110 rule-making power. I hope that that deals satisfactorily with amendment No. 375.

<P>
Government amendment No. 433 is another technical amendment to ensure that the FSA can make rules designed to protect a wider range of users of financial services or their beneficiaries. The amendment makes it clear that the FSA can make rules to protect a beneficiary under a trust. As Committee members will be aware, trustees would normally have a contractual relationship with an authorised person. However, as beneficiaries are the people who may ultimately be affected by an authorised person's actions, we propose that the FSA's basic rule-making power should extend to making rules to protect beneficiaries or, for that matter, anyone else who may be adversely affected by the use of authorised services. I hope that Committee members will agree with that, and support the amendment.

<P>
I could plough on, but given the length of my preamble, I shall pause to allow Opposition Committee members to comment on their amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for pausing. As she said, in many ways it is strange that the Opposition appear to be arguing for a greater range of rule making than the Government propose. Generally, the Bill provides specific arrangements for the other main areas. The logic is that the FSA's rule-making power should be limited to consumer protection. I assume that, in the light of market changes in respect of other key objectives, primary legislation will be needed should those objectives require updating. A practical advantage of our amendment is that it would enable such changes without the need for primary legislation. As a libertarian, I am in principle more than happy for the rules to be restricted to consumer protection.

<P>
We accept that the FSA will make the rules; we have not argued that the Treasury, or anyone else, should be the rule maker. We are pleased to note that progress has been made with the handbook. I make a plea for full consultation and a handbook that will last a reasonable length of time and not need constant updating. Speaking from personal experience during the past 14 years, the constant updating of handbooks has proved a nightmare, to the extent that understanding the rules is virtually a full-time career. We hope that one of the fruits of this legislation will be less change.

<P>
As we have four amendments only, perhaps I should allow the Economic Secretary to reply. With your indulgence, Mr. O'Brien, I shall ask her whether she reached amendment No. 436.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I got to amendment No. 433.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Perhaps this the time for me to pause, because most of our amendments relate to subsequent matters.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> First, I turn to the hon. Gentleman's point about making primary legislation sufficiently open to not require subsequent amendment. I never thought that I would live to hear him say that, given the number of times that he castigated us for occasionally arguing that that was the appropriate way forward, so that matters could be dealt with through secondary legislation. On this occasion, it would be wrong to use primary legislation in the way that he suggests. He appears to be wandering dangerously off the straight and narrow path that he set himself.

<P>
Every effort will obviously be made to make the handbook as up to date and permanent as possible because I am sure that those who work in this fast-changing industry would not want a handbook that was not up to date. That is the dilemma that is involved in keeping pace with change. Every effort will be made, and I have already given several assurances about how the consultation process will work.

<P>
Amendment No. 147 follows almost exactly the wording of amendment No. 128 to clause 17. That amendment, which was starred in the amendment paper, was dealt with by the former Economic Secretary, now the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) during the Committee's ninth sitting: her words can be found in columns 314 to 318 of the relevant Hansard. She acknowledged that it would be appropriate to return to the matter when the Committee reached clause 20 or clause 353 because Opposition Members apparently wanted to do so. The subject has also been discussed, to some extent, in the context of passporting.

<P>
I fear that I must preface what comes next with a health warning. Unless, Mr. O'Brien, you wish to direct us to consider the matter in the context of clause 353, which is perhaps the stage at which it would be most appropriate—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the Minister wish to deal with it now?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am happy to take direction from you, Mr. O'Brien, but I believe that it would be better to wait until we debate clause 353.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case we shall do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am also happy to accept your ruling, Mr. O'Brien. This important issue arises in a variety of contexts throughout the Bill.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall now move to the amendments to clause 111. Essentially, the clause complements the FSA's general rule-making power under clause 110 by giving it the power to apply, in appropriate circumstances, rules that authorise firms' non-regulated activities. In common with clause 110, clause 111 is aimed at protecting consumers—broadly, in this context, users of an authorised person's regulated activity services.

<P>
The clause empowers the FSA to make rules on matters on which the current legislation enables the existing regulators to make rules. For example, the regulators are currently able to make rules requiring that notifications of certain events be made in respect of a firm's non-regulated activities or in relation to other group members. We also envisage non-regulated activity rules potentially being used to cover matters such as systems and controls in non-regulated parts of an authorised person's business. Another example could be financial resources—the regulator may need to monitor the financial standing of a business as a whole.

<P>
However, we do not intend that non-regulated activity rules could be invoked as a pretext for applying FSA rules to unauthorised businesses in inappropriate circumstances. The broad intention is that the clause will be used to allow the FSA to make rules in areas in which the regulator can currently make them. We particularly do not intend clause 111 to be used to apply conduct of business rules to general insurance or deposit-taking, and the FSA shares that view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am genuinely confused. Having spent some time this afternoon trying to work out what clauses 110 and 111 are about, I think that we are now discussing amendments to clause 111 on non-regulated activities.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister is considering amendments to clause 111 which have been grouped with amendments to clause 110 because they overlap.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clause 111 is framed so that the authority can make non-regulated activity rules only where the interests of customers of a regulated business merit it. Let me illustrate that with the example of a bank that carries on authorised business but also runs an unauthorised lending business. Here we intend that the authority will be able to impose rules on the bank's non-regulated lending business—for example, in respect of the lending arm's systems and internal control—in order to protect the interest of depositors in their capacity as customers of its regulated deposit-taking business.

<P>
Additionally, we intend that where the basic rule-making purpose is met, non-regulated activity rules relating to financial resources can also take other group members into account. In calculating a bank's capital requirement, a bank's non-regulated subsidiary's exposures—for example, in a financial leasing subsidiary—can also be taken into account. The exposures of group companies should also be capable of being taken into account in making rules limiting an authorised person's large exposures. That is the measure of a bank's liabilities or exposure to third parties. It broadly reflects what regulators can currently do under the existing regime—

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>5.16 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming—

<P>
<B>Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household (Mr. Graham Allen):</B> Would it be in order for me at the end of the sitting to move that once we have concluded our consideration today, we resume on Tuesday at 10.30 am, with an afternoon sitting at 6 pm? We are making good progress on the Bill and if that continues it may not be necessary to have further sittings until after the Queen's Speech.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clause 111 as currently drafted also allows the authority to make rules prohibiting authorised persons who are permitted to deal in contracts or insurance or to act as managers of authorised unit trust schemes from carrying on non-regulated activities. That provision has been included to reflect our obligations under the relevant European directives; we have proposed some changes to the provision, essentially to deal with them in other places in part IX, but not to alter the substance which we will debate shortly.

<P>
As with clause 110, non-regulated activity rules cannot extend to matters that are reserved to a home state regulator under the European directive, nor can they prohibit an EEA firm from carrying on an activity in the UK which it is permitted to carry on under schedule 3.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 434, to 436 are essentially designed to achieve much the same effect as amendments Nos. 431 and 432 to clause 110. They provide that the rules may be made in relation to authorised persons with respect to their carrying on of non-regulated activities. The basic rule-making power would not relate specifically to the carrying on of the activities, but rather to the authorised person.

<P>
Government amendment No. 437 provides that non-regulated activity rules can be made only where the FSA thinks they will be likely to have an adverse effect on first, the carrying on by a person of regulated activities, and secondly, and additionally, the customers of the regulated activity in question.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 376 and 378 are drafting points and therefore in the light of the Governments amendments I have just described I ask the Opposition not to press them. Amendment No. 376 seeks to remove ``such'' from the first line of subsection (1) but the word is necessary as it relates to rules specified later in the subsection. Amendment No. 378 seeks to change ``him'' to ``them'' in the last line of subsection (1). Amendment No. 377 is more substantive and relates to the purpose for which non-„regulated activity rules can be made. I hope that hon. Members will be persuaded not to press the amendment in the light of Government amendment No. 437. In any case, the test proposed in amendment No. 377 could be too wide in one respect. Conceivably, it could allow the FSA to make non-regulated activity rules that are designed to protect persons who might only incidentally also be users of regulated activities.

<P>
I want to say a few words about the test in amendment No. 377, under which the FSA can make non-regulated activity rules only where it thinks that there will be an undue risk to investors. That test is too tough in the context of clause 111. I explained earlier that consumer protection is the very driver of the authority's general rule-making power. I am not convinced of the case for cutting it back in clause 111, as proposed in the amendment. The FSA's statutory objectives—in particular, those in clause 5—provide for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the appropriate degree of protection for consumers.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The FSA should have regard to different degrees of risk and experience, consumers' need for advice and information, and the general principle that consumers should take responsibility for their own decisions. That should provide a sufficient and appropriate constraint on the use of the power to make rules.

<P>
I hope that hon. Members will see fit not to press amendments Nos. 377, 378, 397 and 376; if not, I must ask the Committee to oppose them. However, I ask for their support for Government amendments Nos. 434 to 437.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> With your leave, Mr. O'Brien, I shall begin by going back to amendment No. 375, which we shall not pursue. The Government's notes state that the intention behind Government amendment No. 433 is to protect the beneficiaries of the trust, as well as customers. However, as we see it, clause 110(4) does that. As it stands, the wording provides double cover because there is protection for beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes under trusts and for trusts.

<P>
I turn now to the main batch of amendments to which the Minister spoke and to non-regulated activities. The FSA's general rules require authorised persons to have or to maintain financial resources. In the case of an authorised person who is a member of a group, those rules might also contain requirements to take into account any activity by another member of the group. The group companies concerned do not have to be authorised persons, to carry on regulated activities or to have any connection with the UK. Should the FSA be required to publish principles, as it is elsewhere in the Bill, as regards how it intends to take into account other group companies' activities when it formulates rules on financial resources?

<P>
That touches on amendment No. 377 and on Government amendment No. 437. Our objective with amendment No. 377 was to make the point that the authority's power to regulate non-regulated activities should be restricted to cases of real need rather than designed to ensure that an authorised person's unregulated activity is unlikely adversely to impact on investors. I think that I am comforted that Government amendment No. 437 addresses the same issue satisfactorily. I take the Minister's point that our amendment could be interpreted more widely and I am happy not to press it.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 376 and 378 deal with drafting issues. I take the Minister's point about amendment No. 376 and I am happy not to press it. On amendment No. 378, I have been unable to tie up the wording. However, the clause was grammatically incorrect as drafted and should have said ``them'', not ``him''. However, the Minister said that the redrafting removes the need for the amendment.

<P>
In summary, I should say—and I am not complaining—that we only got the explanatory note elucidating the Government amendments as we arrived in Committee this morning, so addressing them has been quite demanding. However, we are content that the Government have picked up the matters raised in our amendments. In addition, issues pertaining to amendment No. 147 will be raised again when we debate clause 353.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am pleased to hear what the hon. Gentleman said. Perhaps I may return to the issues that he raised at the beginning of his contribution, as I do not wish to make a detailed response at this point.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Following the previous debate was quite a struggle, so I wish to make a plea. The Minister gave us a detailed, extensive briefing on how the Government amendments will alter the clause. It is right that she should give such an explanation, for which I am grateful. However, it would have been hugely helpful to have had more extensive briefing notes at an earlier stage so that we could have worked out exactly what action the Government are proposing. Frankly, I am still at a loss in relation to parts of that action, which would be difficult for almost anyone to follow. Is the Minister prepared, in principle, to give us a friendly undertaking that she will do her best to provide more extensive briefing notes on similar clauses in future?

<P>
The Minister explained why the Government believe that the breadth of clause 110 is now too wide—she will correct me if I am wrong about that. There should be limitations to the huge, general powers in clause 110. Committee members may not have read the clause carefully, but subsection (1), relating to the general rule-making power, bears examination. I shall not read it out, but it makes clear that the provision is a blanket clause, giving huge powers to the regulator.

<P>
The Minister explained how those powers will be limited in several ways. She discussed the detailed consultation that will take place, as well as cost-benefit analysis and regulation relating to clause 125. She addressed, quite rightly, the general rule-making function of clause 2, which imposes statutory duties which will act as a check and balance on clause 110.

<P>
The Minister mentioned the annual report, which must be agreed with the Treasury. Much as I love the Treasury, that does not fill me with a great deal of optimism; I am sure that the industry feels the same. The Treasury is not the right policeman for much of the Bill.

<P>
The Minister referred to the aim of light-touch regulation. I repeat what I said before—I hope that I do not tax your patience, Mr. O'Brien—that it is implausible that the Bill should be described as light-touch regulation. It beggars belief how that idea could have got about.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I want to try to discover to what extent the Government have created a consumer test, which I believe to be the purpose of clause 110. The clause enables the FSA to set down rules for the purpose of protecting consumers and in pursuit of several other objectives. I wish to ask the Minister a few questions about that. For example, what is the meaning of ``consumer''?

<P>
Let us suppose that a stockbroker buys shares for a client and that the client sells those shares directly to a company. It seems that under subsection (1)(b), the company would clearly have an interest attributable to the use of the broker's services, because it covers persons

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who have rights or interests derived from, or otherwise attributable to, the use of any such services by other persons.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The company's interest would be attributable to the use of the broker's services, but would not that give the company the same protection as consumers would have under subsection (1)(a). Was that really the intention of the person drafting the Bill?

<P>
That brings me, more generally, to ask the Minister about the purpose of paragraph (b). Is it meant to ensure that the consumer beneficiaries of a trust are caught by the clause, or does it have a wider purpose? If there is a wider purpose, was it intended that it should catch companies, as I suggest; and, if not, does the Minister agree that something ought to be done about it to ensure that such companies are not caught?

<P>
More generally, but on a related point, it seems that the clause will turn consumers into authorised persons—or, rather, that, in many respects, authorised persons will be defined as consumers. I do not think that that is what was intended. We must consider those matters in conjunction with the consultation document to which the Minister referred—I presume it was consultation document 28 on the future regulation of inter-professional business. I have not read the document; indeed, I have not seen it and would like a copy. I strongly suspect that it is central to understanding the purpose of clauses 110 and 111, yet none of us has a copy. I cannot see one in the Minister's possession—perhaps it is hidden away, or is part of her bedtime reading.

<P>
The consultation document has been out since June, and it is presumably meant to help define a market professional. Once we have such a definition, we can say that a market professional is clearly not a consumer under clause 110. That would give the FSA a get-out. If I am wrong, I should be grateful if the Minister would explain where the logic of the clause is leading.

<P>
My next question is that, if I am right so far about the purpose of consultation document 28, why is it being left to the FSA to define market professionals? We could reasonably and sensibly have done that, and it should be in the Bill. By leaving the FSA to determine that definition, there is a risk that it will be given a wide berth on who will and will not be caught by the clause.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): There is a more fundamental question. Is there any need to have a definition of market professional? The word ``term'' either fits or should not be used. To allow the FSA to alter the purport of the Bill, so to speak, by producing a definition seems inappropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On the face of it, I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend but, as I say, I have not had time to think about the subject carefully enough to come to a clear view, nor have I read the crucial consultation document that might give many answers to his questions.

<P>
The question that I raise is closely related to the issue of caveat emptor. We all agree with the principle of caveat emptor but feel that there should be some stronger protection for a retail consumer than there is for a market player. The issue therefore concerns to what extent the caveat emptor principle should be compromised or weakened to take account of that, as that would give some protection on this highly complicated matter.

<P>
The caveat emptor principle does not appear in the clause, although it does in a general phrase in clause 5(2)(d), which states that the authority must have regard to:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the general principle that consumers should take responsibility for their decisions.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is a broad definition and arguably, in relation to such important clauses as clause 110 and 111, there is a case for clearly defining what we mean by caveat emptor in the Bill. I would be grateful for a response from the Minister on that point.

<P>
More generally, we want to avoid at considerable cost the risk that the market will have an authorised market professional category and an ordinary consumer category, which will lead to different kinds of products being designed and produced for each. If product design were affected, the market would be distorted. Have the Government thought that through? Has the FSA dealt with that in any of its consultation papers, and if so what are its views on the issue?

<P>
Everyone agrees that some collective investment schemes must be caught, but some that are aimed entirely at market professionals probably should not be. It is on that subject that we must be careful while debating the two clauses, which the Minister described as central, to ensure that we do not end up with the loss of competitiveness that she described.

<P>
I should be grateful for answers to those questions from the Minister.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall simply make a short speech in our debate on what my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) rightfully described as a broad, general clause. As the Committee knows, I am so sympathetic to the tasks faced by parliamentary draftsmen that I hesitate to criticise them, although I am fundamentally unhappy about the sheer length and volume of the Bill. I quoted Pascal earlier to the effect that if one had had a little longer—and there has been quite a long time to prepare the Bill—things could have been done a lot more concisely.

<P>
My thoughts focus on clause 110(4), which states that:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority's general rules may make provision . . . even though there is no relationship between the authorised persons to whom the rules will apply and the persons whose interests will be protected by the rules.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
From the explanatory notes, I see that that is so that, for example,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Authority will be able to make rules under this clause which further market integrity, as required by the Investment Services Directive, and protect against systemic risk.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That seems so obvious that it does not require this curious little subsection to permit it—indeed, it is not even consistent with it.

<P>
I do not see how there could be any arrangement that is regulated by the Bill and by the rules that are made under it—which rightly entitle the FSA to make rules to further market integrity—that is not fundamental to everybody using any of the services to be regulated by the Bill. Market integrity has to be one of the crucial factors. The same must apply to protection against systemic risk—make rules to see that the system is pure and that risk is minimised. Why are we including what to most people will be rather obscure verbiage in the Bill? Would it not be better to omit it?

<P>
I hope to stand enlightened by some clever or arcane reference to a judicial review or something, which will explain why this curious subsection has been included. If the Minister can enlighten me, I shall be grateful.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Let me begin with the remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester on the Treasury in relation to the FSA and its annual report. I am disappointed that someone who I believe was formerly a special adviser at the Treasury has so little faith in that institution—presumably only since his absence from it.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not sure what the politically correct way of putting this is, but does the Minister remember the adage, ``No man is a hero to his valet''?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do indeed, but I still believe that the hon. Member for Chichester knows from his time in the Treasury the quality of the work that is done there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I touched a nerve there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Treasury is full of good men and true—honest men and women—and I have nothing but admiration for it, but that does not mean that I want it to run the whole country. Even I—steeped in it—just occasionally wonder whether there should be some restraint on its authority. I am afraid—as I have said repeatedly—that the Bill gives the Treasury blanket discretion to decide huge issues. The Minister mentioned annual reporting, but it is also to determine whether there will ever be independent reviews of the Bill after it is enacted; indeed, the very word ``independent'' is statutorily defined by the Treasury. I am afraid that such powers are a step too far, even for a Treasury man like me.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am very interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but of course in this case, the Treasury is a brake on the FSA—[Interruption.]

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. Before we suspend for a Division in the House, may I express my apologies to the Minister because I shall be unable to hear her reply to my very interesting question?

<P>
<H5>5.44 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>5.59 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming—

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I will begin despite the absence of Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester asked about the powers. They are widely drafted to allow all laws that are made under existing legislation to be made under clause 110 or 111, or under more specific powers in later clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have with me the Financial Services Act 1986—

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Not on that one page.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Well, I do have the real McCoy, but I need to quote from only one page.

<P>
Section 48(4) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Rules under this section may also regulate or prohibit the carrying on in connection with investment business of any other business or the carrying on of any other business which is held out as being for the purposes of investment.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In other words, the catch-all clause in the 1986 Act covers only those activities that constitute investment. Is not it the case that clause 111 will catch activities other than investment?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will continue the gist of my thinking.

<P>
It is because the Financial Services Authority has forced us to bear in mind its objectives that we need to have a light touch. The hon. Gentleman was scathing about the FSA's light touch. It is important to understand how the Bill will govern the way in which the FSA will do its job.

<P>
The word ``consumer'' is not used in clause 110 and I explained why I used that term. We have spelled out the categories of people to be protected. As for the stockbroker example, whether the company has the same protection depends on how the FSA makes its rules. Companies may be entitled to protection, subject, of course, to statutory objectives and principles.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is exactly my point; we need certainty. We want to know what the FSA's position on that will be, but we have no way of knowing because the rules are so widely drafted.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We do not intend to exclude professionals from possible protection under clause 110. There needs to be some regulation of inter-professional dealings—light touch does not mean no touch. So it is necessary for the power to extend to market professionals, otherwise they will be treated in the same way as individual consumers. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
Moving on to the different rules relating to professionals and retail customers, the protection for consumers in clause 5, to which the hon. Gentleman also referred, recognises the different needs of different customers. In fact, the principle of proportionality in clause 2(3)(c) is also highly relevant here, as are the other principles contained in clause 2(3).

<P>
Clause 5 envisages that the FSA will make different rules for wholesale and retail businesses, and the FSA has been consulting on that. The hon. Gentleman seems to be a little confused about the consultation process. The FSA produced a paper in June—not consultation paper 28, to which he referred, but a feedback paper on that issue, and the FSA has been consulting on that since October 1998. Therefore, there is no need to include a caveat emptor provision again in clause 110.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Can the Minister say why a definition cannot be included in the clause, given that she accepted that the principle of proportionality can apply, and given that the consultation document establishes that the Government accept that there should be a clear distinction between different classes of investor?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I have just told the hon. Gentleman, there is no need to do that. The hon. Gentleman has frequently exhorted me neither to complicate the Bill further nor to add greatly to its length. The hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) would be horrified at the thought that we were adding unnecessarily to the Bill, were he still sitting beside the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire was right—the rules should cover market integrity and systemic abuse. Such rules benefit all users of the financial system, but not all persons who so benefit will have a contractual relationship with an authorised person to whom the systemic rules will apply. We need clause 110(4) so that we may make changes.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester exhorted me to do my best. I assure you, Mr. O'Brien, and the Committee that I shall always do my best to ensure that information that has been requested is received.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I thank the Minister, especially for the last remark. I was not exhorting her to do her best—I am sure that she was already doing that. Rather, I was asking whether, when we encounter further such difficult matters, we could have a copy for our consideration of her thorough and detailed briefing notes, such as the one that she read quickly at the start of our discussion on the clause. Will the Minister give an indication of her thoughts on that?

<P>
Regretfully, I did not make my final point earlier because of the confusion about clauses 110 and 111 and the way in which we were considering the amendments. That point concerns whether the Government accept that an addition to the clause on Report is required to prevent double regulation. That addition should be to the effect that general rules should not limit the powers to exclude branches outside the United Kingdom. Amendment No. 147, which would have had that effect, has already been debated and I shall not rehearse the arguments for it. I would be grateful if the Minister could give guidance on the principle underlying the clause and say whether she would be minded to accept such an amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We do not agree with that point. There is no need to distinguish further between retail and wholesale. There is no black and white distinction between retail and wholesale—there are shades of grey. Our proposal will allow the FSA to take an appropriately differentiated approach.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 438, in page 50, line 18, leave out `subsection (1) or (4)' and insert `this section'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 439 and 450, Government new clause 5—Restriction on managers of authorised unit trust schemes.

<P>
Government new clause 6—Insurance business rules.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The group of amendments and the new clauses address two points, which, I fear that I should warn members of the Committee, are technical. However, they concern important matters that must be addressed adequately.

<P>
The first point is relevant to managers of authorised unit trusts and to insurance undertakings—both companies and friendly societies. Some changes covered by the amendments reflect the restrictions currently imposed, in line with EC directive requirements to prevent such persons undertaking other types of activity. The second carries forward arrangements relating to linked long-term insurance policies under section 78 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 and section 56 of the Friendly Societies Act 1992.

<P>
I shall describe the amendments' purpose and effect in that order. As currently set out in the Bill, clause 111(4) gives the FSA powers to specify that an authorised person who has permission to act as a manager of an authorised unit trust or to deal in contracts and insurance may not also carry on specific types of non-regulated activity.

<P>
That approach was right in so far as it went, but it involved two difficulties that had to be addressed. We proposed the removal from the clause of subsection (4), which confers on the FSA general powers to make non-regulated activity rules and to make specific provision in that respect. The first difficulty was that the scope of the rules under the clause was too narrow, as they could prohibit only non-regulated activities. However, fundamental to the arrangements underpinning supervision of the firms involved is the restriction ensuring that they may not carry on other activities of any kind. As a slight aside, it may be helpful for hon. Members to know that in this case the Government are considering only companies and friendly societies. Individual people cannot usually engage in the activities in question in their own right.

<P>
Under current arrangements, the manager of an authorised unit trust may not carry on a non-financial services business, such as a travel agency or a car sales business, alongside the unit trust activities. Also, the firm may not give financial advice on pensions and endowments to retail investors. Similar restrictions apply to insurance companies and to friendly societies.

<P>
Those restrictions are contained in section 83 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which covers managers of authorised unit trusts. The insurance company equivalent is contained in section 16 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, which states that such a company

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not carry on any activities . . . otherwise than in connection with or for the purposes of its insurance business.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Friendly societies are covered by an equivalent provision.

<P>
The FSA could have made rules restricting the carrying on of other types of regulated business, using the general rule-making power provided for in clause 110, but that leads us to a second difficulty. If the authority had to make rules under clause 110 to carry out regulated activities, it could do so only on the grounds set out in that clause for exercising the power to make general rules.

<P>
As I explained during our discussion on clause 110 and the previous group of amendments considered, the Government have tried carefully to restrict the grounds on which the authority may exercise its powers to make general and non-regulated activity rules. Those grounds are to be linked closely, in simple terms, to the protection of the interests of the customers of the authorised firms in question.

<P>
In order to exercise those powers to introduce restrictions on the business that may be carried on in connection with insurance business or the management of an authorised unit trust, the FSA would need to demonstrate that it complied with the grounds set out in clauses 110 and 111. As I said, however, the FSA will have no option but to make such rules because of the United Kingdom's international obligations. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to impose the same restrictions on the exercise of the particular power involved.

<P>
The Government concluded that the power to make rules about the activities that might be carried on by relevant firms should be a separate power. That issue is addressed by amendment No. 438, new clause 5 and new clause 6(1) and (2). Amendments Nos. 439 and 450 are purely consequential to the matters that I have just addressed. Subsections (3) and (4) of new clause 6 address the matter of linked long-term insurance contracts, about which the Bill has so far been silent.

<P>
As I said in my opening remarks, powers covered by section 78 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 and section 56 of the Friendly Societies Act 1992 enable the regulator to take steps to prohibit or vary terms in long-term insurance contracts that link the value of the benefits payable under such contracts to the value of particular types of investment or commodity.

<P>
I think that I had better explain that. Usually, in a long-term insurance policy such as an endowment, the amount that the contract pays out when the policy matures will reflect the performance of the money invested in a relevant fund. The precise amount is likely to reflect, for example, the performance of the stock market and interest rates during the period of the policy—as well of course as the amount invested. Normally, investments are spread to ensure a reasonably predictable return.

<P>
However, sometimes the benefits under a policy may be defined by reference to something quite specific. Examples might include small company or technology stocks or the price of some commodity, such as oil or bananas. That presents two risks for consumers. One is that they have, as it were, to put all their eggs in one basket. The other possible risk is that the index or commodity to which their investment has been tied may be especially volatile, and may change dramatically from day to day, as well as over longer periods of time. For example, we all know how much the price of oil can change.

<P>
The current legislation, which we are seeking to carry forward in subsections (3) and (4) of the new clause allows the regulator to intervene in such contracts, by either prohibiting them altogether, or requiring an amendment to the terms of the contract to substitute the index or value to which the benefits payable are linked.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Can the Economic Secretary explain why, if it is absolutely and abundantly clear to the consumer that he is putting all his eggs in bananas, as she put it, the FSA should have power to forbid that?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can come back to that in a moment.

<P>
So, if the benefits had been linked to technology stocks, the regulator might require that an alternative index, such as the FTSE 100, was used. In itself, such a power is not particularly unusual—the regulator has a range of powers to tackle such matters. However, there is one possible consequence of action taken under this power which means it is necessary to make it a self-contained power, rather than wrap it within the generality of clause 110.

<P>
To illustrate the point, I will return to my earlier example of intervention by the regulator to substitute the FTSE 100 index for technology stocks. Let us assume that the authority had done that a couple of years after the consumer had taken out a life insurance plan, because it took the view that technology stocks were too new and volatile to provide a basis on which to offer savings products to private, retail investors. After 20 to 30 years, it is not inconceivable that technology stocks might in fact have out-performed the FTSE 100 index. Had the authority not intervened on behalf of the private investor, he would have been considerably better off, and might well feel aggrieved. Of course, had the reverse occurred, he would have been rather more upset that the FSA had not taken action.

<P>
The likelihood is that any intervention of this kind will benefit the consumer, but because of the possibility that ultimately he may turn out to be worse off following intervention under these arrangements, we believe that the Bill should address the point directly, to avoid the risk of the FSA being subject to legal challenge where its actions had clearly been to the benefit of the consumer, in that he had been shielded from an undue risk.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 439, in page 50, line 24, leave out subsection (4).—[
Miss Melanie Johnson.]


<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I will not be long, I promise.

<P>
Clause 111 has many of the features and deficiencies of clause 110. It does not in fact replicate existing legislation, but extends the scope of the FSA's authority to regulate. I illustrated that point a moment ago—and will not rehearse it again—by describing how previous legislation dealt only with investment activities.

<P>
As I understand it, current legislation provides that regulation can occur of an investment activity, or another activity, such as holding assets in safe custody, but cannot be extended to cover just any activity. However, the clause clearly provides that the FSA can move into areas of non-regulated activity. There are few constraints on how far it can go. I give the example of spread betting, which may sound unusual but which I was thinking about after lunch today. It is covered by the Act, it is regulated activity and I think it is in the indicative list in schedule 2. If I am wrong, I am sure that the Minister will correct me. In any case, it is an activity that is liable to be regulated.

<P>
Let us suppose that a spread better is going about his business and his company decides—it is a logical extension of his business—that it will also get into horse racing and invest in the bloodstock industry. Quite possibly, under these rules, the FSA may decide that that betting should be regulated if, in its opinion, betting on horses and investment in bloodstock might have an adverse effect either on the firm or on customers of that firm operating their spread betting activities. Thus a spread better, in a perfectly legitimate business, may find himself forbidden from getting into another area of activity under this clause. That is not a power that exists in current legislation and it is a clear illustration of how the Bill will extend powers, which worries me. I should be grateful for reassurance on the matter, but I do not think that the Minister will be able to give it to me, as I am pretty sure that my interpretation of clause 111 is correct.

<P>
My example may sound unusual, but it is in these unusual areas that the FSA will be capable of exercising, and possibly willing to exercise, a considerable degree of regulation. I want to flag up that point for the Minister and I will be interested in her reaction. She may not have a view now, but if she wants to write to me about it I shall be extremely grateful.

<P>
I want to reiterate an earlier point, which is that the Minister gave a full explanation of the amendments that were tabled, but it was virtually impossible to follow what they meant and difficult to digest it, even though I made an effort to understand the clause and the amendments, and there were some light banana and oil drum moments.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would consider giving the Committee in advance much more detailed briefing notes on the more complicated amendments.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall continue to do my best to help the hon. Gentleman, as I always do.

<P>
On the matter of consumers—the hon. Gentleman's earlier point—the power already exists in section 78 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, and that power is aimed at retail products purchased by non-expert customers. It is aimed at ensuring long-term security and it is needed to avoid excessive risk.

<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's more recent point, clauses 110 and 111 will cover things other than investments because the Bill covers a broader range of financial services. Thus, for example, it could not make rules in relation to the sale of general insurance or advice on deposit under clause 110 as it is not our intention to make those regulated activities. Nor do we intend that the non-regulated activity rules could be invoked as a pretext to applying FSA rules under clause 111 to all unauthorised businesses in appropriate places. The broad intention is that the clause will be used to allow the FSA to make rules in areas where the regulators can currently make them. In particular, it is not our intention that clause 111 will be used to apply conduct of business rules to general insurance or to deposit taking. Indeed, the FSA shares that general view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> May I crave the Economic Secretary's indulgence, and ask a further question? I am pleased that she agrees with my logic—she has made it clear that the Government do not intend what I described. However, the Bill gives the FSA the scope to act in the way that I described, and there are insufficient checks to prevent it from doing so. Will the Minister give further thought to clause 111, so that, on Report, the Bill can be amended to make the Government's intentions clear to the City and the FSA?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of parliamentary draftsmen. Clearly, the Bill is being drafted with the intention of meeting the Government's objectives, and we want to address any problem in that regard.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 111, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 112</center></H4>

<H4><center>Miscellaneous ancillary matters</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 379, in page 51, line 13, at end insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) make provision for clients of specified categories to agree that such rules shall not apply to them'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I shall not detain the Committee long. This is a mop-up clause, which deals with miscellaneous ancillary matters. The amendment proposes the insertion, under subsection (3), of the following additional paragraph:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(e) make provision for clients of specified categories to agree that such rules shall not apply to them''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (3) deals with the handling of money rules, and imposes various protections that are especially pertinent to private clients. Currently, non-private clients can contract out of the client money regulations, and therefore not impose such stringent capital adequacy requirements in their dealings with financial firms. The amendment merely flags up that provision. All we want is greater definition so that the provision can continue to be exercised by the FSA in the future.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause is intended to elaborate on the rule-making powers created by clauses 110 and 111. It clarifies and provides certainty as to the type of rules that the FSA may make in a number of situations. All these rules are intended to provide various forms of consumer protection; for example, to ensure that client money is safeguarded. It is necessary to provide for such rules specifically, rather than to rely simply on the general provisions of clauses 110 and 111, as the making of such rules may be considered unusual for a private body.

<P>
The amendment is designed to modify subsection (3) to allow the FSA to make provision for certain clients to opt out of the protection that client money rules will provide. I have no problem with the intention behind the amendment; however, as the Bill will allow the FSA to make such provision anyway, it is unnecessary. The FSA's consumer protection objective, which is enshrined in clause 5, recognises that consumers come in different shapes and sizes, or, more precisely, with different degrees of sophistication, knowledge and resources with regard to financial products. Therefore, some classes of consumers will be able to make an informed judgment on whether or not they wish to opt out of the protection of a client money rule. The FSA will be able to make rules to cater for that. Indeed, it already happens under the existing regulatory system. We would not wish to prevent the FSA from continuing to provide for that possibility through the rules that it makes. However, we believe that the power that subsection (3)(a) gives the FSA is sufficiently broad to allow it to produce precisely such rules. Although I have every sympathy with, and am grateful for, the intention behind the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the point has been dealt with satisfactorily and withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary, who made it clear that she has considered the intention behind our amendment. That intention has now been placed on record, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 51, line 32, at end add—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) If the Authority proposes to notify an authorised person under subsection (2)(a), it must give him a warning notice and, if it decides to impose the requirement, a decision notice as if the requirement to maintain resources at the appropriate level was the imposition of a penalty; and the authorised person may refer the matter to the Tribunal accordingly.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Again, this is a short amendment, which would add a new, ninth subsection to clause 112, and concerns the appropriate level of financial resources that is dealt with in subsections (1) and (2). The question of what constitutes an appropriate level of resources could give rise to dispute between the authority and a regulated firm. It would appear that, should a firm disagree with the level of resources that the authority considers appropriate, there is no process through which an appeal can be made. We propose that, in the event of such a challenge, the process is dealt with in the same way as earlier disputes, by concluding in referral to the tribunal, as was discussed this morning. In other words, potential disputes over capital adequacy would be subject to the same appeals procedure as other disputed areas, culminating in the tribunal.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause gives the FSA the power to make rules directing the level of financial resources that should be held by authorised persons. They are commonly known as capital adequacy requirements or capital asset ratios. The clause also makes it clear that those requirements need not be imposed at the same level on all persons in a particular category, but might vary between individual firms, depending on their circumstances.

<P>
The clause will carry forward the long-established practice of banking supervisors by setting individual requirements for banks in the light of the overall riskiness of their business. It will enable the regulator to take account of factors that relate to the firm itself, such as management inexperience, past problems with credit controls, or its future plans. The clause is necessary to ensure that the authorised person's capital resources are commensurate with the risk of loss to consumers. As such, it is an important device that supports the qualifying conditions, particularly the adequate resources condition in paragraph 5 to schedule 6. Committee members will recall from our debates on part IV of the Bill that those conditions need continually to be met by all authorised persons.

<P>
The amendment would apply the same procedure to the fixing, or variation, of a firm's capital adequacy requirement as would apply to the imposition of a penalty. Therefore, the firm would first have to be issued with a warning notice and time would have to be allowed for making representations. If the FSA still intended to proceed with the proposed change, it would then have to issue a decision notice. At that stage, if the firm was dissatisfied, it could refer the matter to the independent tribunal.

<P>
The Opposition argue that a capital requirement should be treated as if it were a disciplinary penalty. Of course, it is right that, when the FSA imposes a penalty, the individual concerned should have all those protections. However, the setting of a capital adequacy requirement is not a penalty in form or substance. A penalty is a punishment for past misconduct. The FSA's power to set the capital adequacy requirement is not triggered by misconduct and it is not concerned with the past. It is intended to give concrete form to the on-going requirement that funds are sufficient to deal with present and future risks. I am therefore not convinced that it would be appropriate to apply the same procedure in this case. I hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not convinced. No Committee member doubts the need for the requirement on firms to maintain resources—we have discussed capital adequacy requirements many times. However, the Economic Secretary did not comment on the length of time that it takes to resolve a dispute or on what constitutes the maintenance of resources at an appropriate level. Are those requirements set out in black and white in an FSA code book? The proposal will impinge particularly on smaller firms, which are less able to tie up the necessary working capital because they may need it for other purposes. What the FSA believes to be appropriate may be regarded by smaller firms as being too stringent and demanding. The requirement could seriously impinge on a firm's ability to continue in business, and it would have a legitimate cause for complaint. However, the Economic Secretary's comments do not suggest where that cause for complaint could be taken in the dispute process. I argue not about the need for the provision but about the need for a system to establish whether the amount has been fairly judged. That was the point that I tried to make earlier.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The FSA will obviously have to take into account its objectives and the clause's principles about setting capital adequacy requirements. The practices and policies that are adopted can be examined under the Bill's competition scrutiny mechanism. The hon. Gentleman asked about where people could go. In relation to individual notifications for capital adequacy requirements, the FSA's actions will be susceptible to judicial review.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In the interests of speed, I shall not press the amendment. However, there is a case for arguing that the FSA should examine the matter more closely, especially in relation to smaller firms. Ultimately, the safety net of judicial review is of course available, but one would hope that the matter could be dealt with before that. Our proposal was to bring the mechanism into line with those relating to other disputes between an authorised person or firm and the FSA. I hope that the Economic Secretary will bear that in mind. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

The clause is aimed primarily at the long term and at life insurance companies.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 380, in page 54, line 29, at end insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) In determining whether compliance is unduly burdensome for the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the Authority shall take into account what conduct is permissible in comparable circumstances in other jurisdictions which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The clause covers the FSA's ability to waive or modify rules and the circumstances in which it may do so. The provision is welcome, but I am worried about the circumstances in which the FSA may do so. Those circumstances are laid down in subsection (4) and one of the conditions concerns whether the rules would be unduly burdensome to people in the market. I am worried that the provision may never be used because it is too subjective. Some people may say that the rules are burdensome and the FSA may say that they are not, but there is no reference point by which to make a judgment. Our amendment would provide one by comparing the burden with that applying in similar jurisdictions among other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That provision would be useful, particularly as the Government are anxious to keep burdensome costs at least in line with those in other jurisdictions and, if possible, below them. For that reason, as well as providing a specific point of reference, it is desirable that the Government accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the amendment, but, before dealing with it in detail, I shall explain the purpose of the clause.

<P>
Clause 118 addresses the way in which the application of certain rules may be modified or waived in respect of a particular firm or number of firms. The clause relates to all sorts of rules that we discussed earlier on clauses 110 to 117, as well as to rules concerning the appointment of auditors and actuaries under clause 297.

<P>
Some of the provisions will apply in the context of collective investment schemes, but a broadly equivalent provision regarding some rules relating to collective investment schemes also appears in part XVI, which we shall discuss later. With the importance that we attach to flexible and proportionate regulation, clause 118 is particularly important to firms in carrying on their regulated activities.

<P>
As we said in our July 1998 consultation paper on the Bill, we believe that a similar outcome to the United States' ``no action letter'' procedure can be achieved by making use of the waiver and guidance powers in the Bill. We shall discuss guidance when we come to clauses 127 and 128, but in relation to the waiver requirements, we propose that in appropriate cases an authorised person will be able to go to the FSA to seek a direction that any of the rules which would otherwise apply to him are not to apply to him, or to obtain a direction that the rules will apply, but subject to certain modifications.

<P>
The effect will be that, if the FSA agrees to issue a direction that a particular rule will not apply, the person to whom the direction has been issued will not be in breach of the relevant rule. The FSA will not then be able to take action for breach of a particular rule if someone has acted in accordance with a waiver, and individual customers' rights to take action in respect of non-compliance with that rule could be severely limited.

<P>
In practice, it is vital that the FSA is ready and willing to grant waivers or modifications on request to develop the open and flexible regulatory regime that we intend. Its recent policy paper in September this year on giving guidance and waivers discusses the waiver power; we fully expect that the FSA will make good use of it.

<P>
I turn to the detail of the clause. Subsection (4) sets out the circumstances in which the FSA may consider giving a waiver or modifying a rule's application. The circumstances are pitched at a level to ensure that the direction would not result in undue risk to people whose interest the rules are intended to protect. Amendment No. 380 relates to that test. It appears to provide that, in determining whether compliance is unduly burdensome, the authority should take into account what conduct is permissible in comparable circumstances in other OECD countries.

<P>
I am afraid that the amendment is not an entirely plausible suggestion. In deciding whether to issue a particular waiver, it is for the FSA to determine what it considers to be unduly burdensome in the context of investment protection concerns. Of course, the FSA's general approach would be conditioned by awareness of the international dimension, in line with the need to have regard under clause 2(3)(e) to the international character of financial services.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will recall that the FSA, following a suggestion of the Joint Committee, made it clear that its annual report under paragraph 10 of schedule 1 will include compliance cost comparisons with other jurisdictions. The test proposed by Opposition Members could lead to all sorts of difficulties in practice: should the FSA take into account the OECD countries with the highest or the lowest standard in this context—or somewhere in between? What if it follows one approach and not another? It is difficult to see how the FSA could realistically carry out that analysis every time it took decisions on waivers.

<P>
I suspect that Opposition Members may be anticipating that I shall make a statement elaborating what is meant by ``unduly burdensome''. If so, I shall not disappoint them, but they may already know the answer. Whether something is unduly burdensome is to be determined ultimately in the light of all the relevant circumstances. In considering whether compliance with a rule would be unduly burdensome, the authority would probably want to consider the cost that the firm would incur; whether the rule was framed in a way that made it difficult for the firm to comply in view of the firm's internal organisation; the characteristics of its client base; or even perhaps the methods that it adopted for marketing its services.

<P>
In addition, ``unduly burdensome'' is a phrase used in the context of a broadly equivalent provision in section 47B(2) of the Financial Services Act, so it is not an entirely new concept. In applying the test in conjunction with the second limb of the test—that the waiver or modification would not place people at risk—the FSA will need to consider other ways of achieving the aims of the rule, which are more appropriate to the particular circumstances of the firm. I hope that, in the light of my remarks, the right hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.

Government amendment No. 452.

<P>
<B>Mr Loughton:</B> The rationale for amendments Nos. 381 and 382 lies in the fact that it is appropriate for the authority to notify other firms of the existence or availability of a modification or a waiver, but inappropriate to bring it to the attention of investors who will not thereby be exposed to undue risk under subsection (4)(b), as such information may well be misunderstood.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Given that a waiver or modification of a rule could limit an investor's rights to claim against a firm, it is vital that waivers are widely publicised wherever possible. Amendments Nos. 381 and 382 together would have the effect that waivers and modifications would need to be publicised only to authorised persons who might be likely to apply for a similar direction, and not to consumers. That surely cannot be right. Not only would consumers be kept in the dark, but professional advisers such as accountants and lawyers might be unaware of the FSA's market practice and would thus be unable to advise their other regulated clients properly.

<P>
Nor am I convinced that simply changing the word ``others'' to ``authorised persons'', as amendment No. 382 proposes, would on its own be right. The effect of the change might be to preclude waivers from becoming known to firms which were about to become authorised such as, for example, an overseas firm wishing to establish itself in the United Kingdom or a firm that is going through the authorisation process. I hope the hon. Gentleman will see fit not to press their amendments. I encourage the Committee to support the Government amendments.
