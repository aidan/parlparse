							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): On a point of order, Lady
Winterton. I seek your advice on the tabling of amendments. As we all
know, we have had a bank holiday, and a number of people were hoping to
table amendments to the latter parts of the Bill in the normal way. If
they are tabled today, they will clearly be starred amendments. Would
you would look favourably on such
amendments?</div>

							<a name="08050628000388"></a>The

there have been weeks in which to table amendments, and I would not
look favourably on his suggestion at
present.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Lady
Winterton.</div>
					<a name="08050628000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24
empowers the approvals board to hold inquiries. I envisage that those
inquiries will be an important part of the work of the board. Members
of the board will want to investigate the evidence provided to them by
the local authority that is proposing the quality contracts scheme.
They will want to examine any other representations made as part of the
consultation process. They will also want to consult as widely as they
consider necessary to reach an informed decision about whether to
approve the
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08050628000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, therefore, that my first substantive amendment to clause 24 will
not prove controversial. Proposed new section 126C(4) provides that
inquiries held by approval boards should be held in public. Proposed
new subsections (8) and (9) provide that confidential commercial
information should not be disclosed, which seems sensible to me. There
is, however, a missing link, for it would be hard for the board to meet
in public and discuss commercially sensitive information without
disclosing such information. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>There may therefore be certain circumstances when it would not be
appropriate for the board to meet in public.</div>
					<a name="08050628000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment would add the
words &#147; Subject to subsection (8)&#148; to the end of the
provision that
reads:</div>
					<a name="08050628000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
inquiry held by the board for the purposes of section 126 must be held
in public.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050628000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
of the amendment, which I trust is not contentious, is to enable
confidential commercial information to remain just
that&#151;confidential. I do not think that the Bill will allow that
to happen.</div>
					<a name="08050628000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 74 also relates to the provision that any inquiries must be held in
public. At the end of proposed new subsection (4), the Bill
says:</div>
					<a name="08050628000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
subsection is subject to any provision made by
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050628000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned to probe exactly what sort of regulations might affect the
board&#146;s ability to conduct its inquiries in public, other than
those that would be tackled by amendment No. 73. Therefore, I look for
guidance from the Minister on what regulations she is thinking
of.</div>
					<a name="08050628000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000392"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Lady Winterton. I
hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance here. The Bill
already takes account of the need for commercial confidentiality in the
circumstances he described. It allows for regulations to be made that
might restrict public attendance at inquiries where appropriate. We
have it in mind that that might be used to restrict members of the
public from attending those parts of an inquiry that are concerned with
confidential financial information. A similar provision to that which
we envisage already exists in regulations on inquiries held by traffic
commissioners.</div>
					<a name="08050628000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will also make it a criminal offence to disclose protected
information. We will be consulting on the draft regulations later in
the year. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman some reassurance
that the Bill covers his concerns and that he feels able to withdraw
his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000393"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I think the Minister has just said that protected
information will cover commercial and commercially confidential
information. That being so, will she clarify another point before I
withdraw the amendment? What other reason might there be for an inquiry
not being held in public, other than information being commercially
confidential? Are there any other reasons that the Minister
anticipates?</div>
					<a name="08050628000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000394"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I cannot think of many other reasons why there
might be a need for confidentiality. However, no doubt when we consult,
the experience that traffic commissioners already have of some
inquiries that they have held might offer further enlightenment. At the
moment, though, the main reason is commercially confidential
information.</div>
					<a name="08050628000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000395"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation, but I am still troubled by the fact that the subsection
says</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>
					<a name="08050628000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to any provision made by
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050628000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
shall see what the Minister comes up with in the guidelines on this
point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08050628000396"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 75, in
clause 24, page 22, line 28, at
end insert</div>
					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;and shall supply a copy of that
document to all the persons listed in section
125(1)&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050628000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to explore exactly what &#147;prescribed
manner&#148; might mean. When the approvals board plans to hold an
inquiry, it will be required to publish a notice of inquiry in the
prescribed manner. I want to ensure that the words &#147;in the
prescribed manner&#148; ensure that all the people who are entitled
to receive a copy of that notice receive it. It seems only logical that
all people who are supplied with a consultation document should also be
told about any inquiry relating to the proposed scheme. The list of
people and operators includes local operators and various others,
including the chief police
officer.</div>
					<a name="08050628000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled an
amendment, which I believe had some support from the Liberal Democrats,
on extending the list of people to be consulted. Unfortunately, the
Minister was not minded to accept it. The crux of the matter is that
members of the approvals board must be given access to all the relevant
information and the full spectrum of opinion before they come to their
decision. </div>
					<a name="08050628000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, it is possible to conceive a scenario where a person or a group
of persons or an organisation that had made a representation to the
local authority objecting to the authority&#146;s proposal to bring
forward a quality contracts scheme might have done so as part of the
consultation process. However, for whatever reason, the authority might
dismiss that objection, push ahead with its process and pass it to the
board for approval. There is nothing to ensure that the approvals board
will necessarily know of the objectors. It seems to me that the board
must be made aware of the objectors to the scheme, as well as the
reasons for it. Therefore, those affected must be made aware of the
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08050628000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment,
therefore, says that the board, in addition to publishing a notice of
the inquiry in the prescribed
manner,</div>
					<a name="08050628000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall supply a
copy of that document to all the persons listed in section
125(1)&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08050628000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is the
provision detailing to whom the local authority must send a copy of the
document.</div>
					<a name="08050628000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look to
the Minister either to accept the amendment or to reassure me that all
persons to whom representations are made as a result of the
consultation procedure automatically get a right of hearing at the
approvals board.</div>
					<a name="08050628000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000397"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. It is
obviously right that people, particularly someone who has objected to a
scheme, should be informed of the fact that there will be a public
inquiry. </div>
					<a name="08050628000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will accept that we want to cover that in
regulations, rather than in the Bill. Given that assurance, I hope he
will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08050628000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 126C(6) will empower the approvals board to ensure that any
costs incurred by the Secretary of State or by the board in connection
with holding the inquiry are reimbursed. That seems to me to be well
and proper. Oddly, however, such payments are limited in that the only
person to whom they can be made is the Secretary of State. Given that
costs may be incurred by the traffic commissioner chairing the board,
other members of the board or, indeed, a third party organising the
inquiry, why does only the Secretary of State stand to be
reimbursed?</div>
					<a name="08050628000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
public inquiry is being organised by an independent approvals board, is
it right that the Secretary of State should be the one reimbursed? In
what circumstances does the Minister foresee the Secretary of State
incurring costs in helping the board to arrange an inquiry in a
particular area or case? Is that appropriate? Why is the Secretary of
State incurring the costs? Those costs are more likely to be incurred
by others. The board will organise and hold the inquiry; therefore, the
board will incur the costs. The Secretary of State is not a member of
that board.</div>
					<a name="08050628000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing and it seeks to find out why the Bill is so
worded. Why should other people not be entitled to reimbursement should
they incur costs in the organisation of the
inquiry?</div>
					<a name="08050628000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000400"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
clarifying the purpose of the amendment, as we were slightly confused
about what it is trying to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08050628000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the provision that the hon. Gentleman seeks to amend is to enable an
approvals board to require one or more parties to contribute to the
costs incurred by the Secretary of State or the approvals board itself
as a result of holding the inquiry. Costs incurred by an approvals
board will ultimately be funded by the taxpayer, which is why the Bill
says that the costs will be paid back to the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08050628000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will set out
my objections to the amendment. First, as the Bill is drafted, an
approvals board can require a person to contribute to the costs of the
inquiry only if they are a party to the inquiry. It is unclear to me
why the hon. Gentleman wants to widen that provision. Under his
amendment, people not even involved in the inquiry would be required to
contribute to the cost of
it.</div>
					<a name="08050628000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the Bill
states that parties to the inquiry might be asked to make a payment to
the Secretary of State in respect of the costs incurred by the
Secretary of State or an approvals board. Under the amendment, the
costs incurred by the Secretary of State or the approvals board could
be reimbursed to other parties. I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>am not sure why costs that are ultimately borne by the taxpayer should
be reimbursed to anyone other than the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08050628000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over and above
that, there are objections in policy terms to the amendment. Its effect
would be that one party&#151;either a bus operator or a local
authority&#151;could be required to contribute to the costs incurred
by the other party during an
inquiry.</div>
				
					<a name="08050628000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="08050628000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with that would be that if, say, a bus operator knows that a local
authority would have to reimburse his costs there is no incentive for
the operator to keep those costs to a sensible level. Indeed, a
disruptive operator might deliberately spend a great deal of money
simply in the hope of frustrating the local authority which would
ultimately have to meet those costs.</div>
					<a name="08050628000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that explanation,
particularly in terms of why it says the costs would be repaid to the
Secretary of State, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000401"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> If I heard the Minister correctly, she is saying
that the Bill as drafted uses the Secretary of State as the collecting
point for costs whether they are incurred by the Secretary of State or
the board of inquiry. My concern was that costs would be payable to the
Secretary of State and not necessarily to the approvals board. However,
given what the Minister has said&#151;that the Secretary of State is
acting as the collection point which was my concern&#151;I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the

I offer the Minister this opportunity to comment, having, I hope,
reflected over the weekend on the strong views that were put to the

Hammond:
						</b> The amendments look to the next stage of what the
Bill discusses. We have moved on from the approvals process to the
making of the scheme itself. I have made it very clear that we support
partnerships, but that we are very concerned about the impact and
effect of quality contracts. I see some scope for improving what is to
be on the statute book.</div>
					<a name="08050628000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
place where I detect that scope for improvement is in the length of
schemes. The Transport Act 2000, which introduced quality contracts,
specified that schemes should operate for no longer than 10 years. The
Bill does not try to change that time period, although it does make
provision in subsequent clauses for extensions of a scheme beyond its
original duration.</div>
					<a name="08050628000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the Bill should change the quality contract. The maximum duration
should be brought down from 10 years to five years. The reason for that
is simple: I remain unconvinced by anything I have heard from the
Minister or anyone else that quality contracts will do anything to
improve bus patronage. They bring back a significant element of
regulation. It does not seem to me that in most areas there will be the
astronomical amount of financial backing that the central Government
have given to London, which is why the regulated market in London has
flourished.</div>

							<b class="B">Graham
Stringer</b> (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab): I
have listened on a number of occasions to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the difference between London and the
rest of the country. What is not clear to me is the Conservative
intention when the Bill becomes law. Are the Conservatives giving a
commitment that&#151;in the unlikely event that they ever become the
Government&#151;they will repeal the sections relating to quality
contracts?</div>

for the last week, but I would have thought it highly likely that the
Conservatives would be in government relatively soon.</div>
					<a name="08050628000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our position is clear. As we
said on Second Reading, and I have already said in Committee, we are
not convinced by anything we have heard that quality contracts will add
to bus patronage. I tabled a number of extra amendments regarding
quality contracts, which would have given the Government a chance to
prove that they would do that, but so far we have heard nothing but
assertion. We have seen no evidence. On that basis, our Front-Bench
position is that when we come into power in a couple of years we will
look very carefully at the system. At the moment, our intention would
be to repeal quality
contracts.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): It is
interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he is not in the
business of telling his councils how to behave. If he intends to repeal
quality contracts, should he get into government, so that local
councils do not have the option of adopting them, surely he is telling
them that they will not be able to adopt quality contracts. That is
exactly what he is doing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000417"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is taking an extraordinary
position. Central Governments of all hues pass legislation that has an
impact on local authorities. Is he seriously telling
us that central Governments should not pass any legislation because it
would have an impact on local authorities?
<i class="I">[Inter</i>
						<i class="I">r</i>
						<i class="I">uption</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> That is the logic of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position. All the way along we have said we
supported partnership and partnership routes, whether they be voluntary
or statutory, and we will continue to support them. It has been a
consistent position.</div>
					<a name="08050628000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000418"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
giving way again. My position is not at all
extraordinary. I completely accept that central Government have a right
to propose legislation to the House, and that the House can pass it
and, therefore, direct local authorities to behave in a certain way.
However, I thought the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party wanted to devolve
more powers and responsibilities to local authorities. Surely what he
is saying about quality contracts is that if those powers were given to
local authorities, he would want to take them away if he got into
government. That is the reverse of the philosophical position his party
is now adopting.</div>
					<a name="08050628000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000419"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has already made that point,
but as I have already told the Committee there is no evidence yet that
statutory partnerships work. I want a chance to see them work. That
seems the right road to go down. I prefer voluntary partnerships, and
if they do not work there are powers for statutory
partnerships.</div>
					<a name="08050628000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
made the point that most companies and most areas will not receive the
financial backing from central Government that we have seen in the
regulated market in London, which is why it has flourished. The
inevitable consequence is that there would be potential for bus
operators and local authorities not to increase bus routes but to cut
them. What is more surprising is that if we look at what will happen
under the Bill, some of the operators&#151;particularly some of the
smaller, independent operators, who provide a valuable
service&#151;will face a real impact.</div>
					<a name="08050628000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the Minister&#146;s
attention to the operator Trent Barton, which, as she
may know, operates in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire
and runs a fleet of about 270 modern buses on a network of local
routes. In the company&#146;s response to the consultation on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>Bill, it talked about the impact of the legislation, saying it may be
forced to close or to reduce its size. Unlike larger bus operators,
Trent Barton cannot necessarily move to another part of the country.
The company mentioned some of the benefits it has brought to
passengers, which it might not necessarily be able to do under a
quality contract; for example, the Spondon flyer, which doubled the
amount of bus usage in a particular suburb of Derby and was openly
praised by the local authority in its local transport
plan.</div>
					<a name="08050628000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trent Barton is an example of a
smaller operator that has successfully brought investment, innovation
and improvement to bus services in an area. There is a possibility that
quality contracts will destroy that and if we cut out small,
independent operators, we will cut out a potentially valuable source of
bus services and patronage. Cutting them out for 10 years seems wholly
arbitrary and detrimental. I accept that the figure of five years is
somewhat arbitrary, but it is significantly better than the original
figure of 10 years.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000420"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman does not like
the quality contracts process. Inevitably, it is inevitably quite
complicated and relatively bureaucratic, as it needs to be to protect
people, for the reasons he has given. If we have such a process every
five years, will it not load up costs and make the whole business of
quality contracts less desirable and
attractive?</div>
					<a name="08050628000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000421"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> There is that possibility, but local authorities
are forced by central Government to do plenty of other things every
year or every three years, which could put much greater costs on them.
The proposal may or may not add extra costs, but there is a greater
benefit, because quality contracts remain an unknown
quantity.</div>

							<a name="08050628000422"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I intend to come to some of those issues on
amendment No. 127. The hon. Gentleman says that the amendment on five
years is arbitrary, but is it not completely out of kilter with
depreciation of a bus, and is that not genuinely related to innovation
and to the length that a contract should be&#151;if we want new,
better buses with access for the disabled, for
example?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000423"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I certainly accept that five years is out of
kilter with the depreciation period of a bus, but equally one might
argue that so is 10 years. I understand that the total depreciation
period is between 15 and 20 years. I am not sure whether the hon.
Gentleman is suggesting that we go to the total depreciation
period.</div>
					<a name="08050628000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quality
contracts remain an unknown quantity: not one exists anywhere in the
country and we do not know what their impact will be. I and my
colleagues fear the worst. No one has produced any evidence in their
favour. We have heard assertion&#151;that is all it is&#151;that
they will be significantly better than bus partnership schemes. Making
assertions about 10 years is a brave and dangerous step to take. I
shall test the will of the Committee on this
matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000424"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman began by decrying quality
contracts. We understand that that is his position, but the amendment
relates to how long they should run, rather than the concept of quality
contracts, which, whether he likes it or not, we have largely dealt
with. I fear that he was seeking to re-run the argument, rather than
deal with how long the contract should run, and to undermine the
concept of quality contracts by reducing the period to five
years.</div>
					<a name="08050628000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
to be quality contracts, which I support, there has to be a sensible
time period. There is the question of depreciation of vehicles,
referred to by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley; the question
of the cost of setting the contracts up; and the question of making
them work, rather than continually having to revisit them and prepare
for the next round of bidding and processing. If bus operators and
local authorities are continually looking to the next process rather
than getting on with delivery, that will lead to a worse service. It is
not sensible to approach this in such a way.
</div>
					<a name="08050628000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Wimbledon also raised the issue of small bus companies. I accept that
that is an issue, as I did in earlier discussions. I raised the example
of Norfolk Green to add to his
example.</div>
					<a name="08050628000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
very small chance that good small bus companies will be disadvantaged
as a consequence of the introduction of quality contracts&#151;I
raised the issue with the Minister earlier&#151;but I happen to think
that the likelihood of that happening is quite small and remote, so it
is worth taking the chance. I accept that there is the possibility of
it occurring, but if it does occur and the Norfolk Greens of this world
have their bus routes taken away, it will not matter whether the period
involved is five years or 10, because such companies will not come
back. If they disappear, they will not hang around for five years
waiting for the next quality contracts to be
created.</div>
					<a name="08050628000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s objective is to defend those companies, this, if I
may say so, is not the right way to do
it.</div>
					<a name="08050628000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000425"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Lewes
are right to point out that the hon. Member for Wimbledon has said that
he would abolish quality contracts if a Conservative Government were
returned to power. That is quite clear. It is part of the undermining
of the system of quality contracts&#151;trying to pare away at it,
obviously with the ultimate threat that if a Conservative Government
were to be returned&#151;no matter what councils had done in the
meantime to set up quality contracts in what they felt was in the best
interests of their constituents and the people in their local authority
areas&#151;quality contracts would be
abolished.</div>
					<a name="08050628000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
discussions with Conservative councillors &#151;I have said
it before, but I will say it again&#151;I think that there is a lot
of enthusiasm for the approach that we are adopting in the Bill and
that they will be severely disappointed that there has not been a
change of heart on this particular policy by Conservative Front
Benchers, even during debates in
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08050628000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
be clear. The Transport Act 2000 gives quality contracts 10 years to
run. That is the current position, and we are not changing that in the
Bill. What we are doing is allowing the tenders for contracts, or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>the contracts themselves, to be for 10 years rather five. That is
because a quality contracts scheme is likely to involve a quite major
reorganisation of local transport in an area, and a well-constructed
scheme should form part of a long-term strategy to improve public
transport. It is also likely to involve a high degree of investment,
both by the local authorities in infrastructure and by the contracted
operators in better-quality
vehicles.</div>
					<a name="08050628000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that a 10-year time scale will often be necessary to justify such
investment and to achieve the desired outcomes. It is possible for
local authorities, if they so wish, to have a shorter period. Again, we
have said that that is up to local authorities to decide. We believe in
devolving decision making and trusting people at local government level
to make the best decisions for their areas. The Bill is part of that,
and that is why we are sticking to what was in the original
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050628000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, as I
have said, because of the investment necessary on both sides, we do not
believe that a five-year maximum would be sufficient in the majority of
cases. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member for Wimbledon to
withdraw his amendment.</div>

only assertion, so I wish to test the will of the

amendment is designed to be probing. The original provisions on quality
contracts in the 2000 Act gave the appropriate national authority the
power to vary the date on which a scheme will come into operation.
Clause 26(10) will amend that so that the national authority has the
power to vary the date on which the scheme is made and any date
relating to an appeal on such a scheme.</div>

from several Labour Members who were anxious to jump to their feet to
defend quality contracts as a localist measure put in place by local
authorities, I am surprised that they are not now jumping to their feet

power?&#148;.</div>

the Minister say under what circumstances she envisages the Secretary
of State interfering in such a localist measure in such a manner? Why

						</b> The consultation stage, as I recall it, drew
attention to a number of comments from individuals who were concerned
that the time lag between a scheme being made and coming into operation
was, at 21 months, unduly long. That was seen as a difficulty that had
to be overcome if we were to see implementation of quality contracts. I
see the Minister nodding, so she accepts the point that that is a long
time lag. What steps has she taken to reduce that time lag and what
should the time lag be in most
cases?</div>

							<a name="08050628000443"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The amendment would remove what we believe is a
very necessary flexibility to be able to amend aspects of the quality
contracts scheme timetable through secondary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08050628000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000
Act provisions, as amended by the Bill, provide that a quality
contracts scheme must be made not later than six months either after it
has been approved or, in England, after any appeals against decisions
of the approvals board have been finally disposed of. The Bill also
continues a requirement in the 2000 Act that there must, in England, be
a period of at least six months between the making of the scheme and
its coming into
force.</div>
					<a name="08050628000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Lewes said, the period was originally 21 months. That was
changed to six months through secondary legislation at the request of
local authorities and others who felt that the original 21 months left
too long a time lag. However, the original position of 21 months still
remains in Wales, although that will be harmonised through the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050628000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any of those
periods can be varied by an order made by the Secretary of State or the
Welsh Ministers. That gives flexibilities to shorten or lengthen the
six-month period if, with the benefit of experience, that is considered
necessary. In the past, there has been a change from 21 months down to
six.</div>
					<a name="08050628000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">To remove the
order-making power as the amendment suggests, so that it would not be
possible to change those periods, would remove the flexibility that we
want. The only way that the periods could be changed, if it was proved
necessary, would be through primary legislation. As all members of the
Committee know, passing primary legislation is a lengthy
process.</div>

lengthening the period. Here, we have in mind perhaps a situation where
there are difficulties in ordering new vehicles or in constructing a

flexibility in the

					<a name="08050628000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bus operators
may fear that the order-making power might be used to reduce a limit to
below six months, but it may be used to lengthen a limit if that is
considered desirable. I assure the Committee that no changes will be
made without full
consultation.</div>

is
omitted.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050628000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment continues the debate that the hon. Member for Wimbledon
introduced and would make the length of quality contracts more flexible
and potentially longer, in line with the process in rail franchising
and that in Greater London.</div>
					<a name="08050628000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two issues here
and&#151;with your permission, Lady Winterton, as we are speeding
along this morning&#151;I will discuss the length of quality
contracts and the scheme itself, which is related to this issue.
Listening to what the hon. Gentleman said in proposing the previous
amendment and looking at this amendment, we see that while quality
contracts are a considerable improvement on what we have, they are by
no means a perfect mechanism. There is a lot of evidence&#151;not
just in this country, but around Europe&#151;that quality contracts
would and will improve the quality of bus services. However, there are
problems, which members of the Committee will have seen with rail
franchises and, indeed, the franchises for the tram system.</div>
					<a name="08050628000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a franchise is let to a
private operator to achieve all the benefits of commercial
operation&#151;response to the market, the innovation that the hon.
Member for Wimbledon mentioned and investment that allows that
innovation and response to happen&#151;the contracts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>necessarily become front-loaded. The commercial operator will want to
spend the money and get the return on it at the beginning, and towards
the end of the contract there is
deterioration.</div>
					<a name="08050628000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment says that the process should be in line with permissive EU
legislation, which would allow 50 per cent. extension to the
contracts&#151;that is normal in rail franchising and in
London&#151;so that they could be extended from 10 years to 15. There
would be an immediate benefit in doing that in stabilising the whole of
the public transport system that relies on buses. If a quality contract
were coming to its end and the operator was unsure about retaining that
contract, whether because they had not been very good or because there
were aggressive competitors in the market, there would probably be less
interest in it. However, that would be exacerbated if the scheme itself
came to an end at the same time, so the marketplace would not know what
sort of scheme was going to be in
place.</div>
					<a name="08050628000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come back to
the point, is what is good for London good for the rest of the country?
It is assumed that in London the schemes for franchising buses go on
and that when it comes to the end of the scheme in 10 or 15 years, the
market will know what to apply for. What is envisaged in the
Bill&#151;the scheme itself is covered in more detail in later
clauses, but it is relevant to the amendment as well&#151;is the
scheme having to go back to square one and be looked at again. That
seems disruptive and it will bring a lack of stability to the
system.</div>
					<a name="08050628000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
says that it should be possible to extend 10-year franchises by 50 per
cent., as is allowed under EU regulation. The stability of the process
would be helped if the scheme was allowed to continue unless there was
some very good reason that it could not, which could be picked up in
the local transport
plans.</div>
					<a name="08050628000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000448"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s amendment relates to
clause 29. As I said earlier, the clause extends the maximum length of
each individual quality contract from five years to 10. At present,
while a scheme can run for 10 years, a contract can run only for five.
We have responded to points made to us by local authorities and others
that it is more appropriate for it to be able to run for the same
period as the scheme.</div>
					<a name="08050628000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the points that my
hon. Friend has made, but under the system that we propose a quality
contracts scheme will replace deregulated services with a series of
contracts and, at the same time, suspend the free market in the area.
The task of setting up a regulated network from scratch, which is what
we are talking about, is rather different from adapting an existing
one, which is more the case that we have in London. That is why the
Bill provides for a review
point.</div>
					<a name="08050628000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">After the
period for which the scheme is approved, which may not exceed 10 years,
it must be reviewed. If the authority is minded to extend it, a further
consultation must take place to ensure that it has delivered at least
some of what was promised, and that a scheme is still relevant and
likely to deliver more. If, however, the scheme is not intended to
expand in scope and will not involve new areas or new bus services, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>can go ahead without approval, although there will be an appeal
mechanism in it. If it is going to expand, the approval of the
board&#151;or in Wales, the Welsh Ministers&#151;will still be
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08050628000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would affect the length of individual contracts within a
quality contracts scheme. The 2000 Act extends the contracts from five
years to 10; the amendment would allow further extension. However, we
consider that the best way forward is to set the contract length at the
same length as the overall scheme. We believe that much can change in
10 years&#151;whether it is demand for services, travel patterns,
technology and so on. It is not unreasonable to require authorities to
review quality contracts schemes at least once a decade. If the
duration of the scheme is to be limited to 10 years, the duration of
individual contracts must be similarly
limited.</div>
					<a name="08050628000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley believes that there
should not even be a 10-year quality contracts scheme duration, and
therefore that it is reasonable to extend the contracts themselves.
However, for the reasons I have set out, we believe it reasonable to
ask local authorities to look at the schemes after 10 years to ensure
that they are delivering what was promised and that if they are to
continue they can do so without having to go through a whole approvals
board if they are not particularly different. We believe that that is
the right balance to strike, and in view of that I hope that my hon.
Friend will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000449"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I welcome the increase in the length of the
contract from five years to 10, although I would quibble with the
phrase &#147;removing a free market&#148;. One kind of market is
being changed to another where there is off-road rather than on-road
competition. It is important that we continue to make that point. What
I do not think my right hon. Friend the Minister really
addressed&#151;I am happy to give way now or wait until we consider
this on Report&#151;is the fact that the coincidence of the end of
that period and the end of the scheme is bound to bring uncertainty and
instability to the market. I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend
reflected on that, either now or at a later stage. How could current
operators and, potentially, new operators take decisions in their own
companies to invest if they did not know what was going to happen? The
coincidence of the end of the scheme and the end of the contract
represents a serious
point.</div>
					<a name="08050628000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is the length of the contract. As hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee know, I am not the greatest advocate of EU
regulation&#151;by and large, I think we are better off without most
of it&#151;but I do not understand why in the rest of the country
there should be less flexibility and less application of European laws,
including the ability to extend those contracts by 50 per cent., than
is the case in London and within the rail franchising
system.</div>
					<a name="08050628000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding my
right hon. Friend&#146;s final point, on which I ask her to reflect,
I completely understand that this is a new scheme. The London scheme
changed slightly over the period after privatisation. There had been a
publicly-owned system and there was a relatively smooth transition to a
franchise system, whereas in this instance we are moving from a very
lightly regulated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>system to a franchise system. That, I accept, is a much bigger change
within the market. I also accept that it may need to be assessed. What
I do not necessarily accept is that this needs to be assessed at the
end of 10 years. Why cannot it be dealt with while the scheme is going
on? If there are failures or if extensions are needed&#151;as my
right hon. Friend correctly points out, that might be the
case&#151;that might be dealt with in the local transport plans,
which would be consulted
upon.</div>
					<a name="08050628000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
come back to those points on Report, but I think that there are real
market issues. That is a different debate from the one about whether to
accept quality contracts. If one accepts quality contracts, there is a
real practical debate here about how to help the market to work to
maximum
effect.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000450"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The 10-year time period provides a good
opportunity to review the scheme itself and, if an authority had
decided to let a contract for the full 10 years, to say what would be
the new parts of a new tendering process. Running the two together
would not necessarily bring instability but could provide a good
opportunity to look at how the scheme is operating, to see whether it
had delivered and whether there should be different specifications in a
new tender process. The two might fall quite well together.</div>
					<a name="08050628000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to EU regulations,
I understand that the Community regulation to which my hon. Friend
refers recognises the difference between, for example, a design, build
and operate system for a light rail system compared with a bus
contract. There is a period of 15 years for rail contracts and 10 years
for bus contracts. Community regulation does specify difference in the
maximum.</div>
					<a name="08050628000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened to the points made by my hon. Friend but it is still within
the local authority&#146;s ability to vary either of the two periods
if it wishes to do so. There is a maximum when an authority would be
required to review the success of the scheme. If there were no major
changes to the way the scheme was to be run it could go ahead without
having to go an approvals board. I hope that reassures my hon.
Friend.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000451"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> It does, in parts. As I understand it&#151;I
do not mean to be sarcastic&#151;the London bus system, which does
not have trams or trains, has the right under EU legislation to extend
those contracts if it wishes. I do not see why that should be
changed.</div>
					<a name="08050628000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
genuine difference between us on assessment of how the market might
respond to the ending of both the contract and the scheme at the same
time. My right hon. Friend has been very helpful and open-minded in
this debate and I ask her to remain so for further discussions on these
practical issues before we consider the Bill on Report. They are not
matters of principle but of making the scheme work, and on the basis
that we can return to the matter on Report and that there will be
ongoing discussion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> As the Minister said, clause 29 has the effect of
extending the maximum duration of the contract from five to 10 years by
amending section 130 of the 2000 Act. As I said while we were
considering amendments Nos. 255 and 256, I am unsure whether the move
can be justified given that quality contracts are an uncertain beast at
the moment. The ramification is that the clause and the succeeding
clauses, far from extending the quality contracts rules from five years
to 10, might in a number of cases extend the quality contract to 20
years. That is an extraordinary provision for something that is untried
and untested. It creates an unnecessary restriction on the market and,
therefore, I will be asking my colleagues not to support the
clause.</div>

							<a name="08050628000453"></a>Ms

						</b> Once again, the hon. Gentleman is showing his
complete hostility to the idea of quality contracts. As I have said,
there is a review of the quality contracts scheme after 10 years. Yes,
if it has not changed substantially, it can continue. We think that is
the right balance to strike, but the hon. Gentleman&#151;because he
does not really believe in quality contracts in the first place&#151;
is simply opposing the clause to illustrate more clearly than ever that

					<a name="08050628000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment looks at the
whole concern about extending quality contracts beyond their initial
period. We have discussed the consultation process that a local
authority must engage in if it wants to introduce a
quality contracts scheme. I have argued that the consultation document
should contain certain additional elements and be made available to a
wider range of individuals and organisations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>
					<a name="08050628000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad to
see that where a local authority wishes to extend a
quality contract scheme, it must engage in a similar process of
consultation: that seems only logical. My intention
with the amendment is, as with my previous set of amendments, to ensure
that the consultation procedure is robust and effective. Those who
receive the consultation document, and are invited to respond to it,
must be aware of all the facts about the proposed extension of the
scheme. That is probably already adequately
covered.</div>
					<a name="08050628000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
consultation document is produced by the local
authority, and the very production of the document is evidence that the
authority thinks the extension would be a good thing. I am concerned,
too, that the document should also contain the evidence or views of
people who think that the extension would not be a good thing. They
should be entitled to have their points of view expressed and
understood by those who are consulted, so those points of view should
be in the document. In that way, people reading the document would be
able properly to assess and analyse the successes and failures of any
schemes in place, and members of the Committee will know from what I
have already said that I think there will be more concerns than
successes. Nevertheless, unless the consultation document includes the
views both of those in favour of an extension and of those opposed to
it, the consultation process cannot be as fair and open as possible. I
hope the Minister will reassure us that the document will be balanced,
even-handed and able to contain the views of both
sides.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> The clause and these amendments will introduce
a new process to be used where a local transport authority wants to
continue a quality contracts scheme beyond its initial approval period.
This process would allow it to do so without having to make a new
scheme. Under the current legislation, it is not possible to continue a
quality contracts scheme in that way, and the authority would have to
go through the full process of making a new scheme if it wanted to do
so. The Bill would introduce a more flexible system, which will enable
a lighter-touch approvals process to be applied depending on the extent
of the changes. Under these provisions, if an authority wanted to
extend a quality contracts scheme, it would be required to publish a
consultation document reporting on the effectiveness of the scheme so
far, as well as making a case for continuing it for a further period of
up to 10 years. Where it is proposed that the scheme should not be
expanded to cover additional services, the scheme will not need to be
submitted for approval. This is, as I have said, a much lighter touch
than exists under current legislation, which requires in such
circumstances a whole new scheme to be
made.</div>
					<a name="08050628000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my view, a consultation document should be drafted in impartial,
neutral terms with the objective of seeking open views from any
stakeholders with an interest in the proposal being considered. To
include details about objections to the proposal in the consultation,
including the identities of those who have objected, would cloud
neutrality and, as a result, could unfairly influence responses to the
consultation. I do not think that should be the objective of any
consultation, whatever the issue being
discussed.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> I gather that certain exceptions are applied.
As I have said, however, the consultation is not supposed to be a
summary of everybody&#146;s views. It is supposed to gather those
views. Until the consultation process has been carried out, it would
not be possible to have the objections, unless the hon. Gentleman means
to go back 10 years to when the scheme was originally made. Again, I do
not think that would make sense. The idea of the consultation document
is to say, &#147;This is the view of what has happened in terms of
the scheme, and this is why we want to take it forward.&#148; If
there were an objection to its being taken forward, it could go through
an appeal process. However, if the local authority wants to continue
with the scheme, and if it is the same, with no new proposals for
different services, it should be able to go ahead. The process gives
the opportunity to set down why the authority thinks it should
continue, and what has been achieved so
far.</div>

							<a name="08050628000472"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> On the consultation point, the image I had in my
head was akin to a planning application where, if a planning
application is made, it is possible for individuals to write in to say
they are for or against the application. Those letters are on a public
file and can be inspected by the public at large. I hope the Minister
will tell me a similar sort of process will apply in this
case.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> There would be a consultation document. If the
scheme was coming to the end of its 10-year period, the local authority
would set out why it believed it should go ahead with the scheme. If
there are no new proposals in the scheme, and it is roughly the same as
it was before, it does not need to go through the approvals process. It
can be appealed against, but it does not need to go through the
approvals
board.</div>

not want the scheme to go ahead, I am going to appeal against it going
ahead&#148;, it would go through that appeals
process. That is the system that would be adopted. If the scheme was
changing entirely it would need to go to the approvals board and
through a similar process whereby individuals would write in saying,
&#147;We do not believe that the scheme should go ahead, will you
take our views into consideration?&#148;. The approvals board would
see all those cases. That would be more of a consultation exercise but
there could be appeals against it.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Clause 31 provides the same approvals process
that we have discussed previously. As I understand it, it is stating
that the approvals process can apply to extensions as well unless they
are deemed to be exempt extensions. That and the strong independent
process of approval are vital and I am wary of circumstances in which
they may be bypassed.
</div>
					<a name="08050628000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause sets out
circumstances in which such an exemption would apply
but the rules are somewhat complicated. If the Government believe that
they are formulating an approvals process that does the job it is
intended to do, can the Minister tell us why should there be exemptions
from the process? It does not seem that there is any particular reason
or benefit to the public validity of an approval or an extension that
certain ones can suddenly become exempt from the process.</div>
					<a name="08050628000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approvals board is designed
to be independent. It is a qualified group of individuals with the
power to make decisions in the best interest of local people. That is
the purpose of the board and that is what it should be allowed to do. I
am, therefore, looking to the Minister to give us some clear
indications of circumstances in which such exemptions might
apply.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000478"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The amendments would move us back to the
position where, in all circumstances when a local authority proposed to
continue a quality contracts scheme beyond its initial period the
scheme would have to be made again from scratch, with a full approvals
process in every case.</div>
					<a name="08050628000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to change the current
legislation because it is not possible under that legislation for a
quality contracts scheme to continue beyond its initial
period&#151;the authority has to go back through the full process of
making a new scheme. We want there to be a more flexible, lighter
touch, which we are bringing in under the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050628000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the provisions, an
authority that wanted to extend its quality contracts
scheme would need to publish a consultation document reporting on the
effectiveness of the scheme so far, as well as making the case for
continuing it for up to a period of a further 10 years. The proposals
would be subject to the same consultation procedure and approvals and
appeals process as a new scheme, but with appropriate modifications and
certain exemptions from the approvals process.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>
					<a name="08050628000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, where it was
proposed that the scheme should not be expanded to cover additional
services, the scheme would not need to be submitted for approval. The
new approvals process with certain modifications and exemptions would
apply to any application to continue a quality contracts scheme beyond
10 years. We have set out the conditions that would need to be met if
the scheme is to be exempt from this process and impose a requirement
on the local authority to publicise any such proposal. Other than for
exempt proposals the application would need the approval of the
approvals board or Welsh Ministers. Only schemes that had achieved
their stated objectives or were well on the way to doing so, and where
there would be public benefit, would be likely to be
approved.</div>
					<a name="08050628000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come
to the exemptions. Proposals in the draft Bill would have required
every continuation scheme to go through the approvals process. However,
one of the key functions of the approvals process is to ensure that the
effect on deregulated services is properly taken into account. If a
quality contracts scheme is already in force and will usually have been
in force many years, as long as the scope of the scheme is not widened,
there will be no such services to take into account. In those cases,
there seems little point in submitting the continuation scheme to the
approvals board or Welsh Ministers.</div>
					<a name="08050628000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we accept that some
authorities will want to modify the schemes when they continue them,
either to adjust the boundaries to take account of road or planning
developments since the existing scheme was approved or to vary the
description of services that are excluded from the scheme or to bring
in additional services. If any changes of that sort meant that services
previously operating outside the scheme would be part of it, it seems
appropriate for the approvals process to apply. That is a necessary
safeguard because without it a local authority could greatly expand the
scope of an existing scheme, making it virtually a new scheme, without
going through the approval process.</div>
					<a name="08050628000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order for a continuation
scheme to be exempt, two sets of conditions need to be satisfied. The
first is that there is no increase in the geographical area, or only to
such a minor extent that no existing bus services or additional local
authority would be taken into the scheme. Any one of those conditions
must be
satisfied.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000479"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> Where the approvals process kicks in, in the
circumstances described by the Minister&#151;for example, an
extension to geographical area&#151;I assume the approvals process
would look only at the impact of any amendment rather than looking at
the entire scheme
again.</div>
					<a name="08050628000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000480"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> No, the scheme as a whole would be looked at in
terms of the continuation process because in those instances it has
reverted, and because it has changed it does not come under the
continuation process.</div>
					<a name="08050628000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we said earlier, an
approvals board is able to talk about modifications.
I am sure that in those circumstances there would be a look at the
scheme as it had been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>running and a look at the effect of the new geographical area in it.
That would be quite reasonable. Otherwise, the current scheme would not
be looked at all and it would simply be a new scheme starting. In those
circumstances, where it was expanding, it would be quite reasonable to
say that the approvals board looks at the scheme as a whole and at how
it would continue as a whole. Otherwise, there would be two
processes&#151;one the continuation scheme and one a new quality
contracts
scheme.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000481"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> Would the approvals process be able to take into
account comments people had fortuitously taken the opportunity to make
about elements of the scheme that would not in fact be affected by a
geographical
extension?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000482"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Obviously, if the scheme went through the
entire approvals board process again, people would be able to make
comments about the existing scheme. The continuation scenario would be
that if the local authority issued a consultation document, people
could appeal against it. If the scheme reverted to going through the
whole approvals board process because it had changed, people would be
able to make representations to the approvals board in the same way as
previously.</div>
					<a name="08050628000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000483"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> The point I am trying to get at is this: if it is
deemed sensible to make a small geographical extension to the scheme
and that triggers the process, I understand why it has to be looked at,
but if the whole process or scheme can be looked at again, that is a
disincentive to make that small geographical
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000484"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Again, we have to strike the right balance
between changing the current legislation, which requires any scheme to
go through the approvals board process all over again, and having
flexibility, so that if a scheme is extended outside the geographical
area or there are additional services, the scheme can be considered as
a whole. Frankly, the alternative is to have a continuation in one area
and a new scheme in another area. It is obviously in a local
authority&#146;s remit to be able to do that.</div>
					<a name="08050628000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second set of criteria that
come under the exemptions are that there should be no reduction in
registered bus services previously excluded from the scheme. Both of
those conditions must be satisfied for a continuation scheme to be
exempt from the approval process. As I have said, that is the right way
forward in striking a balance between the two processes. I hope that,
in view of that, the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 223, in
clause 38, page 34, line 8,
after  &#145;authority&#146;,
insert  </div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>

Committee&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050628000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
regard clause 38 as slightly ominous. It deals with the whole issue of
guidance and what may or may not be in guidance, regulations and the
Bill. Proposed new section 134A of the Transport Act 2000
states:</div>
					<a name="08050628000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
appropriate national authority may issue guidance concerning the
performance by local transport authorities of their functions under
this Part in relation to quality contracts schemes&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050628000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitably, it goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08050628000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
authorities must have regard to any such
guidance&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050628000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
the Minister has been helpful to our understanding of the Bill and its
language, and I am sure that she will be helpful again now. However, I
am unsure that she will be able to satisfy us why only the
&#147;appropriate national authority&#148; will be able to issue
the guidance.</div>
					<a name="08050628000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not suggesting that every body should be allowed to issue guidance to
which local authorities must have regard. That would clearly be
unsustainable. However, but two bodies in addition to the
&#147;appropriate national authority&#148; are competent and
qualified enough to issue guidance: first, the senior traffic
commissioner, whose functions include the registration of bus services
and the overview of bus services in local areas; and, secondly, the
public transport users&#146; committee, which is the dedicated
passenger watchdog.</div>
					<a name="08050628000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should remind ourselves that
the guidance is about the performance of local authorities in respect
of quality contracts. As has been discussed, the stated aim of quality
contracts schemes is to bring about improvements for bus users. Who
better to judge whether that aim is being achieved than bus users
themselves, through the organisation set up to represent them? Another
stated aim of the quality contract is to ensure that other bus services
will not be adversely affected. Who better to pass judgment in relation
to that criterion than the traffic commissioner?
</div>
					<a name="08050628000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond the
appropriate national authority, the senior traffic commissioner and the
public transport users&#146; committee could offer useful,
appropriate and constructive advice to local authorities when carrying
out their function of regulating bus services, particularly in this
part of the Bill. The thrust of the amendment is to say to local
authorities that there are two other bodies beyond the appropriate
national authority that could help them to formulate better
policies.</div>
					<a name="08050628000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will accept that the senior traffic commissioner and the
public transport users&#146; committee are experts; they are
independent and qualified and they should be able to issue guidance to
local authorities on this matter, which rightly falls within their
remit. That would help local authorities and ultimately, help
passengers by encouraging local authorities to ensure, by having regard
to what they have said, that the bus services for passengers will be
better. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.
</div>
					<a name="08050628000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000490"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I have a simple question. The Minister has been
telling us throughout our discussion of the Bill that we do not need to
have everything written into it and we should rely on regulations or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>other informal means. I am struggling to understand why the clause needs
to be included at all, given that the Minister or any national
authority can issue guidance at any time it
likes.</div>
					<a name="08050628000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000491"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As has been stated, the Bill confers a power on
the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to issue statutory guidance
to local authorities about quality contracts schemes. Local authorities
would be obliged to have regard to such guidance. The amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Wimbledon would empower the senior traffic
commissioner and the public transport users&#146; committee to issue
such statutory guidance, as well.</div>
					<a name="08050628000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance is intended to
assist local authorities in deciding whether a quality contracts scheme
is a realistic option for their area and, if it is, how they might
introduce it. The Department has produced draft guidance, which is
available to the Committee and is also on the Department for Transport
website. We will be issuing a revised draft for formal consultation
later in the year.</div>
					<a name="08050628000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as involving the public transport users&#146; committee is
concerned, the hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware that the Secretary
of State announced on 8 April that we intend to widen the remit of
Passenger Focus, the rail watchdog, to include functions relating to
local bus and scheduled coach services in England. That followed public
consultation on how to deliver strengthened bus passenger
representation. Subject to working up the details of conferring these
official functions on Passenger Focus and further consultation, that
means that the powers to establish a public transport users&#146;
committee for England would not be taken up immediately. Retaining the
powers in the Bill, however, gives us the flexibility to establish such
a multi-modal committee in the future.</div>
					<a name="08050628000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, we have already
issued draft guidance and will revise it later in the year. Waiting for
the bus component of Passenger Focus to be established so that it could
help to write the guidance would delay the process of making guidance
available to local authorities. Passengers might be best served by
their passenger representative groups offering comments on individual
quality contracts schemes when
consulted.</div>
					<a name="08050628000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000492"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I hear the Minister&#146;s point about the
potential delay, but surely that can be covered by issuing additional
guidance?</div>
					<a name="08050628000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000493"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Would that be different to the original
guidance that has already been published? If we wanted to publish some
guidance fairly quickly to be able to assist local authorities that
wished to take up quality contracts, we would not like to then delay
further. I will deal with the matter of consultation later.
</div>
					<a name="08050628000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear why
the hon. Gentleman thinks that the relevant national
authority&#151;the Secretary of State in England and the Welsh
Ministers in Wales&#151;is not best placed to develop statutory
guidance. The purpose of the guidance is to provide authorities with an
overview of the legislation and to assist them in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>development of schemes to ensure that they can work up realistic and
well structured proposals where that is the right thing for their
area.</div>
					<a name="08050628000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
question put by the hon. Member for Lewes, the reason that this
provision appears in the Bill is that the guidance is statutory
guidance. Local authorities will be obliged to have regard to it, which
gives the guidance more weight. In any appeal against a scheme, the
local authority&#146;s actions and decisions will be considered in
the light of the guidance. That is why it is included in the Bill in
this way.</div>
					<a name="08050628000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The traffic
commissioners and the passenger representative body will look at
quality contracts from a particular perspective. The traffic
commissioners will have a major role in the approvals board for
schemes, and a separate power is introduced in the Bill for the
Secretary of State to issue guidance to that board. One of the
strengths of the approvals board structure is that it provides an
independent and impartial assessment of proposals to make a quality
contracts scheme. As I have said before, we believe that it is
important to preserve that independent role; we do not want it to be
compromised by the senior traffic commissioner having the power to
issue statutory guidance to local authorities. That is why we believe
that the best method of issuing guidance is to have it prepared by the
Secretary of State and the Welsh
Ministers.</div>
					<a name="08050628000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
have concerns about statutory guidance potentially emanating from three
different sources: the relevant national authority&#151;the Secretary
of State or Welsh Ministers&#151;the senior traffic commissioner and
the passenger representative body. We think that that would be rather
confusing for authorities, especially if they were expected to have
regard to guidance that sought to represent the stance of very
different bodies.
</div>
					<a name="08050628000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, we will,
of course, consult the traffic commissioners and passenger groups on
the guidance and will continue to seek their views, particularly those
of the traffic commissioners as they gain approvals board experience. I
hope that that explains why we have taken our stance and that the hon.
Member for Wimbledon will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000494"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I listened very carefully to the Minister. I am
not entirely satisfied with the explanation or the rationale behind the
senior traffic commissioner not being involved in issuing guidance. I
take the point that there may be some confusion, but I still think that
that gentleman has a role to play. None the less, I wish to go back and
have another look at this. I give notice to the Minister that I might
raise this matter again on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08050628000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000495"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in
clause 39, page 35, line 22, leave
out from first &#145;is&#146; to end.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>
					<a name="08050628000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say at the outset that
this is a probing amendment and I think that the Minister will see
fairly quickly where my argument is going. The clause is important
because one of the great concerns about quality contracts is to ensure
that staff will be treated fairly during and after the crossover period
to the provision of services under a quality contract. The Minister
knows that the clause provides that such a change shall be treated as a
relevant transfer under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations
2006.</div>
					<a name="08050628000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause has
evolved during the Bill&#146;s pre-legislative scrutiny and during
its passage through the other place. The Lords had a very interesting
debate on the matter, and the Minister will remember that the
Government tabled amendments both on Report and on Third Reading in the
other place.</div>
					<a name="08050628000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08050628000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand
it, one of the main issues arising from the original wording of the
clause was that protection might only be available to employees taken
on by a new employer that had won a quality contract. It would not
provide protection for those in existing schemes and existing services
transferred to a new operator. I think that amendment was moved by Lord
Bassam, and it was right and proper.</div>
					<a name="08050628000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Report, it was also proposed
that the incumbent operator be required to provide information to the
local traffic authority about its current work force, which could be
used as a basis for tendering. The successful tenderer would be obliged
to employ that work force, provided they were willing or it was looking
for new employees. I do not see anything wrong with that
either.</div>
					<a name="08050628000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Third Reading
added a further element, which was to make it an offence for an
operator to provide information that is false or misleading in a
material way, if the person providing the information knows that it is
false or is reckless as to whether it is. Again, I have no problem with
the intent of that Government amendment. It makes sure that there is
adequate protection.</div>
					<a name="08050628000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I am trying to find out
through amendment No. 224 was not answered by Lord Bassam in another
place on behalf of the Government, and I hope the Minister will be able
to answer. It relates to the word &#147;reckless&#148;. In addition
to providing false information, an operator will be breaking the law if
it is &#147;reckless&#148; about whether that information is false.
Will the Minister clarify the precise meaning of
&#147;reckless&#148; with reference to this behaviour, how the
definition of &#147;reckless&#148; behaviour will be set out in
guidance, and who will set out that guidance? It was on that point,
when asked directly, that her colleague in another place could not
answer.</div>
					<a name="08050628000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000496"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions and I hope I can be of some help. I will set out a little of
the background and purpose of the requirement in subsection
(5)(c).</div>
					<a name="08050628000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">In normal
circumstances, when a local authority is providing a public service
that is to be contracted out, it would, as part of the tender process,
provide anonymised details of the members of staff who would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>be likely to be available for transfer to the contract on TUPE terms.
Similarly, if a contract is re-tendered, the outgoing contractor can be
obliged, as a contractual duty, to provide this information for the
benefit of any other employer that wins the new contract. Without
information of that sort, it would be very difficult for a new company
to make a realistic bid for the work, as an important cost element
would be missing from the calculation.</div>
					<a name="08050628000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, where a commercial bus
service falls to be replaced by a contracted service, the existing
operator would not be under any form of contract with the local
authority that could oblige him to provide the information. Our TUPE
provision therefore includes a regulation-making power under which
operators could be placed under a statutory obligation to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08050628000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all the
operators in an area are keen to bid for contracts, and recognise that
they could be winners as easily as losers, it is likely to be in their
interest to provide the local authority with accurate information about
staffing, but in some cases, that will not be so. An operator that has
little prospect of winning a contract, does not intend to put in a bid,
or is even so opposed to the whole idea of the scheme that he would
like to cause mischief, may have no incentive to provide correct,
complete and accurate information, and might not bother to check the
facts and assumptions. It is also possible that an incumbent might
provide deliberately false information to mislead competitors into
bidding higher than necessary, either with the prospect of undercutting
them, which would obviously be fraudulent, or simply with the hope of
wrecking the scheme by making it unaffordable. The offence could
therefore cover a wide variety of behaviours, from mere carelessness to
deliberate attempts to deceive. It would be for the courts to determine
the severity of the behaviour and the appropriate penalty, if any, on a
case-by-base basis.</div>
					<a name="08050628000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a court is satisfied that an operator simply made an innocent mistake,
it might decide not to impose any penalty at all. However, there could
be instances where it is clear that an operator has not correctly
represented the facts available to him, but it is difficult or
impossible to prove a deliberate intention to deceive. That is where
the question of recklessness becomes important, for if it were
necessary to prove knowing deception beyond reasonable doubt, many
negligent or irresponsible operators would go unpunished.</div>
					<a name="08050628000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with all criminal offences,
the purpose is to deter rather than to punish. A responsible or prudent
operator, weighing up all the odds, is not likely to behave in such a
manner that could lead to a criminal prosecution, but if there were no
obvious remedy in criminal law, the temptation to cheat might well be
too great. I hope that explains that explains the thinking behind the
term &#147;recklessness&#148; and that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000497"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I want to probe the Minister a little more,
because it seems to me that all the circumstances she described were
covered by the fact that it is an offence for an operator to provide
such information that is</div>
					<a name="08050628000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;false or misleading in a material
particular&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>
					<a name="08050628000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand entirely what she is trying
to cover, but it is already covered by that provision. What she is
saying is that in this situation, recklessness&#151;the test of which
we have discussed under previous Bills&#151;is a lower test of
deception. Is that what she is saying to
us?</div>
					<a name="08050628000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000498"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It is a failure to take due care to provide
accurate information. That is the difference between a deliberate
intention to mislead and not taking due care to provide accurate
information.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000499"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The problem with what the Minister is saying is
that someone could be reckless without any intention to mislead. The
Minister has spoken about an intention to mislead, and that is already
covered. I am still not clear that reckless is anything other than a
lower test that might catch a number of people who may have provided
false information, but did not necessarily intend to do so and had no
intention to deceive.</div>
					<a name="08050628000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
ensure that in any guidance she produces she gives a very tight legal
definition to the word &#147;reckless,&#148; because I think that
the provision is open to an extraordinary number of misinterpretations.
I am glad we have had the chance to explore it today; I hope the
Minister will take on board my concerns about the meaning of
&#147;reckless&#148; and that she will consider tightening the
definition to avoid unintended consequences. For now, I beg to ask

							<a name="08050628000501"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> To refer back to the previous debate, a wide
variety of bus operators operate in the private sector in this country;
some of them have the greatest integrity and provide a good service,
and some of them are cowboys. It is as well to be prepared for reckless
intentional and unintentional behaviour, given the statements of Brian
Souter, who said that he would withdraw all services if he lost a
contract, leaving the people of South Yorkshire without service. That
is the real world in which we
operate.</div>
					<a name="08050628000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 8
deals with how TUPE could apply. In one sense, TUPE normally applies to
a business or occupation&#151;grass cutting, or whatever&#151;which
continues, and the employees are protected doing a similar job with a
new company. That could happen in the bus industry. If a bus
operator&#151;not Stagecoach, but some operator with
integrity&#151;applied for a quality contract, lost it, and carried
on its operations until a transfer of undertakings, its employees could
transfer to a new bus company if there was an exact match between the
previous scheme and the new scheme.</div>
					<a name="08050628000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that that situation
will be rare indeed, and that two things will happen. There will be
people such as Brian Souter, who take their bat and ball home, damaging
the service. Protection is needed for employees in that situation.
There will also be confusion, which I suspect will apply in all
metropolitan areas where a small number of bus companies and one or two
large bus companies operate across boundaries. The purpose of the new
clause is to protect employees who operate services in such areas by
allowing them to transfer to the new operator&#151;the winner of the
contract. It also provides that if such people are contracted to
provide public services, they should be able to join and have the
benefit of the local government pension
scheme.</div>

							<b class="B">Ian
Stewart</b> (Eccles) (Lab): First, I declare that I am a
member of the union Unite. I spent 20 years as a regional officer for
one of the unions that merged into Unite, the Transport and General
Workers Union.</div>
					<a name="08050628000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trade
unions are needed to protect vulnerable workers. Workers and their
families are vulnerable in times of redundancy and uncertainty. New
clause 8 would provide protection for bus workers, security of
employment and pensions for bus workers employed in an area that
becomes subject to a quality contract. Proposed new sections 134B, C
and D of the Transport Act 2000 are intended to strengthen the
application of TUPE and allow trade union involvement in the quality
contract process. Proposed new section 134B would protect the pensions
of bus workers who transfer to a quality
contract.</div>
					<a name="08050628000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three hurdles that local and transport authorities must cross before a
quality contract is made. Quality contracts will give specified areas
such as routes, timetables and fares to local authorities. That power
would be welcomed by my constituents in Pendlebury, Swinton, Eccles,
Irlam and Cadishead, and by people throughout the country. Once the
three hurdles&#151;consultation to determine whether people want a
quality contract for their area, approval from traffic commissioners
and, should an operator not agree about the contract, an appeal to the
traffic commissioners&#151;are cleared, an operator under a quality
contract effectively becomes a monopoly provider. Although that type of
regulation of bus services will result in greater control over the
services than is possible under complete deregulation, which is the
system outside London, important employment matters need to be dealt
with. That is the purpose of new clause
8.</div>
				
					<a name="08050628000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08050628000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">One clear
benefit of quality contracts is that once one is in place there will be
stability of bus service provision and&#151;I hope&#151;of
employment. The difficulty, which the Bill has not yet adequately
addressed, is in ensuring stability of service and employment during
the transition to quality contracts. Unless protections are
forthcoming, the process of introducing quality contracts has the
potential to result in significant redundancies among bus workers, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley mentioned. That is
surely not what the Government intend to result from what is clearly a
good-news measure. Fortunately, the Government will, I hope, table
their own amendments either in Committee or on
Report.</div>
					<a name="08050628000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The potential
threat to jobs stems from the fact that there is no legislation
providing for staff transferring from a wholly private
company&#151;any bus operator outside London, for example&#151;to a
company regulated through quality contracts. Under the current
arrangements, therefore, there is nothing to stop service operator
employers terminating the service on learning of the intention to
introduce quality contracts. There is nothing, apart from the 56-day
notice requirement, to stop such a service provider simply walking away
from the service in question at any time.</div>
					<a name="08050628000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention of proposed new
section 134B is, therefore, that persons being transferred to quality
contracts will come under the provisions of
TUPE&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations
2006&#151;whether TUPE applies or not. The proposal is that TUPE
protection should apply as early as possible and should be assumed to
run from the date on which the quality contract was made. The provision
would give the entire protection afforded under TUPE to all cases in
which the introduction of quality contracts meant the transfer of
employees from one employer to another. That implies that variations to
terms and conditions, and/or dismissals arising by reason of the
transfer, would be void and/or rendered automatically unfair, with
liability vested in the transferee. That protection would relate back
to any prior changes or dismissals made by the transferor, provided
that they were made by reason of the impending quality
contract.</div>
					<a name="08050628000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importing
the protections of TUPE would ensure that the transferee had an
interest in the continued employment of the staff in question and in
the protection of their terms and conditions, given that it would stand
to pick up any liability for dismissals and so on relating to the
quality contract.</div>
					<a name="08050628000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would not only improve on the Government&#146;s clause in
relation to when TUPE should apply; it would make an important
improvement with respect to which people it should apply to. Proposed
new section 143B provides for TUPE to apply to one or more
persons&#151;that is, all workers involved in the operation of bus
services in the area to which a quality contract scheme related would
transfer to the operator who won the quality contracts bid. That would
provide operators with a disincentive to run down resources, with the
consequent redundancies and effects on passenger services. It would
also create a level playing field for operators that tendered, because
they would all understand the possible TUPE consequences. The
information and consultation provisions of TUPE would apply, so those
who tendered would understand where they stood and what the proper
employment costs were.</div>
					<a name="08050628000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
importation of TUPE might not, however, address the concern that former
service operators and employers could simply terminate the service
early on learning of the intention to introduce quality contracts. I
would therefore like local transport authorities to have the power to
act as providers of last resort in that respect. Proposed new sections
134C and 134E would mitigate such an effect by providing local
authorities with a sanction and allowing them to take such behaviour
into account when awarding future quality contracts. Similar practices
are provided for in other local government contracts, such as the code
of practice on work force matters in local authority service
contracts.</div>
					<a name="08050628000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause provides further protection for the work force by allowing for
consultation with trade unions, and for trade union involvement in the
tendering preparations and the evaluation process in accordance with
any guidance issued. That would allow, at an early stage, the
employment implications of introducing quality contracts to be fully
factored into the preparation of invitations to tender and into
consideration of whether bids would adversely impact on
employment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the serious issue of pensions. The new clause highlights the aspiration
of trade unions and workers that bus workers who transfer to quality
contracts should be eligible to become members of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>local government pension scheme by virtue of the fact that they will be
employed under a local government contract. That would not only provide
them with obvious benefits, but tackle one of the biggest challenges
facing the bus industry&#151;high staff turnover and poor recruitment
and retention. All the evidence has shown that a secure and fair
pension secures stability in employment.</div>
					<a name="08050628000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the new clause
would protect the existing pension benefits of employees who
transferred to a quality contract. That is necessary because TUPE does
not provide full protection for existing pension benefits. I therefore
hope that the Government will amend the Bill to ensure that bus workers
who transfer from the deregulated market to a quality contract have
their pensions protected. As the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman,
the hon. Member for Wimbledon, said, the proposal received cross-party
support during the Lords debate. The Government have also given a
commitment to give serious consideration to providing such
protection.</div>
					<a name="08050628000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pension
rights and benefits are not protected by TUPE. Occupational pension
schemes are not transferred by reason of a relevant transfer. Sections
257 and 258 of the Pensions Act 2004 require that where there is a
relevant transfer within the meaning of TUPE, a transferee must offer a
transferring employee the opportunity to participate in an occupational
pension scheme following the transfer if they were eligible to
participate in such a scheme before the transfer. The new scheme must
meet a minimum statutory standard, but it need not be as favourable as
the scheme provided by the
transferor.</div>
					<a name="08050628000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by Lord Rosser in Committee in the Lords would have
had a beneficial effect on protecting pension rights. When the
Government responded on Report, they recognised that that was an
important issue and were sensitive to the fact that pensions should be
properly preserved. The need to protect existing pension benefits
attracted cross-party support in the
Lords.</div>
					<a name="08050628000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have previously introduced legislation to protect existing
pension benefits in other reorganisations of the transport
sector&#151;the privatisation of British Rail and the public-private
partnership for the London underground, for example. The Department for
Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government have,
as I understand it, recognised that pensions protection is important
not only for employees affected by quality contracts, but for
companies, as it provides a level playing
field.</div>
					<a name="08050628000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister table an amendment on Report to protect existing pension
provision? I hope that those two issues, which can be among the most
devastating parts of a family&#146;s life&#151;they affect not just
the workers, but the whole family&#151;will be addressed and that
this good legislation, which is good news for passengers, will also be
good news for
workers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000503"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friends for
their explanation of their new clause. As they said, substantial
improvements were made to the Bill in another place to ensure that some
of the concerns about the potential effect of quality contracts schemes
on bus workers have been addressed.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>
					<a name="08050628000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">In preparing those improvements,
we wanted to ensure that there was the right degree of protection for
workers&#151;in particular, by ensuring that the TUPE regulations
apply while also ensuring that we do not prevent quality contracts
schemes from being a realistic option for local authorities. I
appreciate that the period of transition to a quality contracts scheme
may not be easy for local authorities to manage. There are some
measures that we can take in regulations to help with that. In
particular, there is already a power to change, in specific
circumstances, the period of notice that an operator must give before
he may stop running existing services. Increasing that notice period
during the transition to a quality contracts scheme might make a
substantial difference, giving local authorities more time to make
plans for filling any gaps in service that might arise.</div>
					<a name="08050628000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also provides a power
to make regulations modifying or disapplying the usual tendering
requirements that apply when a local authority wishes to enter into a
subsidy contract with a bus operator. There may be scope within the
constraints of EU law to make some changes that streamline the process
to give authorities a better opportunity to fill short-term gaps in
service provision during the transition to a quality contracts
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08050628000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can assure
my hon. Friends&#151;particularly my hon. Friend the Member for
Eccles&#151;that we have had quite detailed discussions with the
trade unions and with some members of Unite, and I pay tribute to the
work of the all-party group in pressing those cases. The discussions
with the trade unions have been fruitful and led to some of the changes
that we made in the other place.</div>
					<a name="08050628000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect
to the changes to the regulations modifying or disapplying the usual
tendering requirements, I would like to consult on the proposals for
regulations in those areas later in the year. I can assure my hon.
Friends that I will involve the trade unions in those
discussions.</div>
					<a name="08050628000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the application of TUPE during the transitional period, my
hon. Friend the Member for Eccles expressed very strongly the points
that were made during some of the discussions with the trade unions. In
the light of his arguments, I am prepared to consider further whether
we can move in the direction that he and my hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester, Blackley
seek.</div>
				
					<a name="08050628000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08050628000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Important
questions were raised about the degree of pension protection that
should be afforded to bus workers. Difficult issues need to be
considered here, such as the potential costs to local authorities. I
will have to give the matter a good deal of further thought. The
Minister for Local Government has been involved in some of the
discussions. He and I have written to Jack Dromey of Unite regarding
the agreement that a quality contracts operator will be eligible to
apply for admitted body status, but, as in other local government
contracts, there will not be an automatic right to join. The decision
on whether to join will rest with the operators. I have had discussions
about that and they will
continue.</div>
					<a name="08050628000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would also ensure that trade unions were duly engaged in the
process of moving towards a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>quality contracts scheme. It is right that trade unions should be
consulted when a local authority is working up proposals to make
quality contracts schemes. The obligation on local authorities to
consult appropriate persons on proposed schemes is already
comprehensive and includes a general requirement to
consult</div>
					<a name="08050628000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
persons as the authority or authorities think fit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050628000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot imagine a situation in which
representatives of the appropriate trade unions would not fall into
those categories. I am happy to reassure my hon. Friends that that is
something we will consider reinforcing in the statutory
guidance.</div>
					<a name="08050628000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000504"></a>Ian
Stewart:
						</b> Will my right hon. Friend ponder on the
distinction between when a contract is made and when it is implemented?
Will she also be mindful of the fact that we are keen for her to
understand that we want the protections in place when the contract is
made?</div>
					<a name="08050628000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050628000505"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I said, those are all matters on which we
hope to give some
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="08050628000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
also asked what we will do about bus operators that fail to provide the
employment protection to which employees are entitled. It has been
suggested that we should specify it in the Bill that such failure
should be taken into consideration when that operator bids for other
quality contracts in the future. I have some sympathy with the
suggestion made by my hon. Friends, who seek to ensure that operators
who successfully tender for quality contracts have a good record in
honouring their commitments to employees. However, I am not convinced
that the matter should be dealt with in the Bill
itself.</div>
					<a name="08050628000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
when a local authority is considering tenders for quality contracts, it
must take into account a wide range of factors, not least the
reputation and standing of the operator submitting the bid. The
authority must also act in accordance with procurement legislation.
Where such legislation applies, it specifies the criteria on which a
contracting authority either must or may reject a tender. Obviously,
the appropriate procurement legislation is the right place for such
restrictions. I think it would wrong for us to apply different
restrictions in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050628000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, I am
prepared to consider whether it would be appropriate to include
references on that point in the next draft of the quality contracts
scheme guidance. I am certainly happy to explore that
further.</div>
					<a name="08050628000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have indicated a number of steps that we might be able to take in
future regulations to help to manage the period of transition to a
future quality contracts scheme. I will very carefully consider the
points made about the application of TUPE during the transitional
period and the need to secure a fair degree of pension protection.
While I cannot guarantee it, I am happy to see whether there is
anything that we need to bring back on Report with regard to this and
also to look at regulations and guidance in relation to some of the
other points that have been made. I hope that, with those reassurances,
my hon. Friends feel able not to press their new
clause.</div>

large number of bus services up and down the country are being revised
as a result of voluntary partnership agreements between a bus operator
and the local authority. These are not statutory quality partnerships
yet; they are not affected by those. As I have said many times,
voluntary partnerships are the best way to move forward. We have seen a
number of excellently performing bus services. Any provision that
encouraged such partnerships would have the support of my party. For
that reason, I welcome clause 41, as did my hon. Friend the Member for
Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) on Second Reading.</div>
					<a name="08050628000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 41
addresses the scenario in which bus operators and local authorities
want to form a voluntary agreement for the benefit of the travelling
public but are constrained by competition law, going through some of
the competition tests. While I understand and appreciate that there has
been a huge amount of relatively extensive consultation on this matter,
there are one or two things on which I wish to probe the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08050628000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 2,
which we will discuss later, introduces the new competition test. Any
agreements that are subject to that competition test will become an
exemption from the relevant elements of competition law. The purpose of
the amendment is to explore further the issue that was raised in
another place. Lord Berkeley tabled an amendment that would have
extended the scope of the competition test such that it applied to
agreements between two operators. In other words, it would have allowed
two operators to have an agreement without being subject to some of the
competition law and not have the involvement of the local authority if
it were proven to be helpful to bus patronage. The gist of my amendment
is not
dissimilar.</div>
					<a name="08050628000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
situations in which operators might wish to enter into agreements
relating to bus services that would definitely benefit bus passengers.
An obvious example might be timetable co-ordination. If two operators
were discussing something that could clearly be of benefit to
passengers, that should not be hindered by competition
law.</div>
					<a name="08050628000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause was
amended in another place by means of a Government amendment. That
represented some progress. What I am unsure about is whether that
amendment covers an agreement of the sort that I have mentioned.
Schedule 10 of the Transport Act 2000, as amended by the Bill, sets out
the competition test and its application to voluntary
partnerships and other agreements. I would like to know whether the
Government amendment covers two operators discussing
something&#151;particularly timetable co-ordination&#151;that would
be to the benefit of bus passengers.</div>

							<a name="08050628000507"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The amendment would extend further the new
competition test that will apply only to voluntary
partnership agreements and certain agreements between bus operators.
Through the changes that we are making to the competition test, we have
tried, for example, to allow two operators to agree to co-ordinate
their timetables to provide even patterns or services that connect with
each other. That was in response to representations received from local
authorities and bus operators about obstacles in the way of them
working in partnership, through voluntary partnership agreements, and
agreeing with local authorities on improvements, in the best interests
of passengers.</div>
					<a name="08050628000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Bill was introduced in another place, the new competition test
applied only to agreements between one or more bus operators and one or
more local authorities. However, the Government were persuaded to
extend it, so it now applies also to certain agreements between
operators only, provided that the local transport authority has
certified the agreement as meeting the necessary requirements, which
are that the agreement is in the interest of persons using local bus
services in the relevant area and does not impose unnecessary
restrictions on the operators concerned. It may impose only
restrictions necessary to achieve what are referred to as the
&#147;bus improvement objectives&#148;. Those objectives are
identical to those used to assess whether potentially anti-competitive
measures in a quality partnership scheme may be justified.</div>
					<a name="08050628000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, those amendments
were made in another place. I think that bus operators were pleased
with the changes, as too were the Campaign for Better Transport and
local authorities. Furthermore, it is right to put on the record my
thanks to the Office of Fair Trading for its help in preparing the
provisions. However, my problem with the amendment is that it would
allow bus operators to come to an agreement without the local authority
having certified that it meets the requirements that I set out. Such an
agreement should not be allowed unless the local authority agreed that
it would improve public transport in the area and that it was to
passengers&#146; benefit.</div>
					<a name="08050628000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that the amendment
is probing and aimed at finding out the reasons for the changes made in
another place, which further extend the requirement. However, we do not
believe that agreements should be made without the local
authority&#146;s endorsement and
certification.</div>
