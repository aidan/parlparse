<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 112, in page 5, line 1, leave out `a' and insert `an independent'.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I did not get very far before lunch, so some of my arguments may be worth reiterating in case the minds of members of the Committee were elsewhere at the time. We welcome the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission. It will deal with the problem whereby several services are still unregulated. Currently, there is a split in the functions for inspecting services that are regulated among local authorities, health authorities and the Department of Health. Over the past 20 years, enormous changes have taken place in the way in which society is organised that put pressure on the services that the new commission would regulate. I refer, in particular, to the growth in demand for accommodation that reflects the changing social structure in which elderly relatives in their twilight years no longer live with their sons and daughters.
<P>
It is worth putting that point on the record because we are trying to regulate a dynamic situation to reflect changing structures in society. Some problems that have arisen, and some of the tragedies that have occurred, which we hope will be dealt with by the commission, have become more frequent because of family breakdowns, the increasing number of children in care and so on. It is against that changing framework that we must consider the very nature of the commission. Under subsection (2), the commission must, in the exercise of its functions, act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in accordance with any directions  given to it by-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and under-the Secretary of State.<P>

<P>
It is because of how the clause is crafted that we seek to insert the word ``independent''. Stressing at the outset of the provision the importance of the commission being independent, would afford better protection. We are regulating against a background of failure to regulate correctly. Inspections have sometimes been carried out by the provider. The lack of such independent action has led to some well-publicised disasters in relation to children's service-hence our insistence on the need for independence. The commission should be an independent, corporate body to allow it to make objective and impartial decisions without political interference from the Government.

<P>
The matter brings us back to our debate on clause 1 about the need for a clear split between the provision and regulation of care. As the state will continue to be a significant provider of care through establishments that will be regulated by the commission, that body must have the complete freedom and integrity to act clear of direction by the Secretary of State. I readily anticipate that the Government will argue against the amendment, but I draw the Committee's attention to our debate at length of the degree of independence that the Food Standards Agency should have. The Food Standards Agency Bill has now been enacted, but there were some parallel arguments about the degree of public confidence in a body that was put in place to inspect and regulate. Public confidence is improved by the independence of such bodies and the independence of the Food Standards Agency was seen as important in the Government's attempt to restore public confidence in food safety. From the Government's perspective, an independent body has the added advantage of being easier to hold accountable under the inspection regime that has been put in place. The Government are therefore left at arm's length from that decision making.

<P>
We feel strongly that the National Care Standards Commission needs to be more independent than the clause provides. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the fact that the public will look to the body to make a better fist of dealing with the kind of situation, detailed in the Waterhouse report. They will want the new body, which we support, to have more teeth, and be quicker, more effective and more transparent in the way that it deals with poor provision, lack of provision or a misdemeanour in the provision of that service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I am curious about the stress that the hon. Lady puts on the word ``independent''. I agree that we want confidence that the body will properly carry out its regulatory role. Is there not a danger that, by overstressing the word ``independent'', we will end up with a body that is not representative of the sector? How can we have confidence that people like small home owners, whom we will discuss later, will be properly represented in the commission if it is wholly independent, as the hon. Lady is arguing it should be?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> There might be a slight misunderstanding about the word that I used. I meant that the commission should be independent of the Secretary of State. At no point did I say that I see the commission as in any way a representative body-it would be wholly undesirable to try to make it so. We would end up in the difficult position of trying to negotiate what percentage of representatives should reflect provision within different sectors. That would be almost impossible to achieve, because provision is changing and will carry on changing, as authority provision of care diminishes. It is nothing to do with representativeness; the accent is on independence from the arm of state. We believe that that is so important because the state is still a principal provider of care. The fact that the state is both provider and regulator of its provision gives insufficient independence.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I am not sure that I follow the hon. Lady's point. As she will know in relation to social care, the state is not the majority provider; 85 per cent. of social care is provided by the independent and voluntary sector.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The commission will regulate many different types of care. The Bill covers a huge range of diverse areas: adoption, fostering, social care, residential nursing care and independent health care. That enormous spectrum makes it almost impossible to ensure that the commission is representative. The fact that the state is present in some of those areas makes it imperative that the body should be independent-hence our desire for that provision to appear in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Our debate is the preclude to more detailed discussions about the function and purpose of the commission and the way in which it will work under clause 7. I have a question-[
Interruption.] When I said ``a minute'' I may have been optimistic. Minutes can be very elastic, especially in Committees. I suppose that that remark was a bit too sharp.

<P>
I want to refer to the royal commission report on long-term care, in which the idea of a national care council or commission was conceived. The idea of establishing a body independent of Government may have originated from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation some years before that. The intention was that the body should adopt a strategic view of the provision of social care across the voluntary, private and public sectors. It was also conceived as an advocate acting on behalf of service users, but working with them. During debate on the royal commission report on 2 December 1999, the Government announced that they had reflected upon their original White Paper proposals. The decision to create one national care standards commission rather than several regionally based commissions was portrayed as an embracing of one of the two main royal commission recommendations.

<P>
A letter from Help the Aged was sent to all those who participated in the Second Reading debate and was probably sent to those on the Committee. That letter identified some aspects of the subject that we had not covered on Second Reading, and stated that there was a gap between the National Care Standards Commission that the Bill will implement and the one recommended by the royal commission. There were two major differences between the recommendations and the measures. One was in the extent to which the commission would be allied to Government and an agency giving effect to Government policy-a delivery agency. The other was in its ability to act strategically, which is a question to which we may return later.

<P>
Does the Minister accept that the criticisms made by Help the Aged are fair? Can he explain why the Government, in the run-up to the debate on long-term care on 2 December, came to the decision not to establish a body of the sort recommended by the royal commission? Many would like to see such an independent institution established as the amendment suggests. The problem with the amendment as it stands, on its own, is that it would give independence to a body that is principally a regulator, an inspector of care standards, and lacks a larger role.

<P>
Finally, I wish to consider whether the amendment has been tabled to the right part of the Bill. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) said that much of the state sector provided care, and that there would therefore be a question mark over the commission if it was associated too closely with Government; its ability to act might be fettered. However, the bulk of the care to which she refers would be provided directly through social services departments and the agencies with which they contract. The purchasing and commissioning role for those care services and the direct provision would already be at arm's length from central Government, with the agency and the body responsible for setting standards. Although I agree with the hon. Member for Meriden that we should discuss the importance of that body's independence, I am not convinced that her argument gives much additional weight to the case.

<P>
I hope that the Minister can tell us more about why the body will not have that strategic role. Could it be added to the Bill or developed in the future?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden has made a mountain out of a mole hill. It is clear to anyone reading the Bill that the National Care Standards Commission will function as an independent body. We have made that clear in the White Paper and every time a Minister has spoken about the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does the Minister define an independent body as one required to act in accordance with directions given by the Secretary of State?

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall come to that point, as it lies at the heart of the argument made by the hon. Member for Meriden. At one stage, I understood her to say that she wanted the commission to be free and clear from directions. Later Opposition amendments would not go along with that, as they would revise the nature and content of the Secretary of State's directions to the commission. From those amendments, I understand that the Opposition accept the need for the commission to act under some kind of directions from the Secretary of State, which is the weakness in her argument.

<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Meriden has confused the argument about independence with the issue of accountability. It is appropriate for the Secretary of State to have the powers that he will enjoy under subsection (2), as that is the way to ensure proper accountability, not only vis-à-vis the Executive and the commission, but between Parliament and the operation and function of the commission. I would be surprised if she and her hon. Friends drafted legislation at any time in which they set up a body corporate such as the commission and allowed it to be entirely free of any proper lines of accountability to the House. That accountability is what subsection (2) ensures. It allows proper communication to take place between the Secretary of State and the National Care Standards Commission. Her argument that the commission should be entirely free and clear from directions is silly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister rightly identifies the need for accountability not only to the Executive, but to Parliament. Would he therefore accept an amendment to secure a report on the agency to Parliament, so that Parliament can properly hold it to account?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We shall come to amendments on that subject later. If the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill, he will know that there is, for example, a procedure for the accounts of the National Care Standards Commission to be laid before Parliament. It would misrepresent the Bill to suggest that the commission's operation will take place in some vacuum into which Members of Parliament will have no tie whatever. I am trying to be fair to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden started from a sensible position, which all members of the Committee would adopt-the National Care Standards Commission should be an independent body. It will be; we have made that repeatedly clear. The way in which she developed her argument did not entirely help her cause, as she suggested that the only way for the commission to be independent would be to liberate it from any sense of being subject to the directions of the Secretary of State. For the reasons that I have given, that would be unworkable and undesirable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister seems to be making the slightly tortuous argument that accountability to Parliament is achieved via the Secretary of State. As later amendments suggest, would it not be better to achieve accountability by directions being in the form of regulations that Parliament must approve?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is arguable, but I am not prepared to accept it. Most of the regulation-making powers in the Bill will be subject to the normal parliamentary procedures. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, as the directions under subsection (2) will not be. However, I would be surprised if he wanted parliamentary time set aside to discuss issues in relation to, for example, how the commission might want to communicate information electronically across social services and health authorities. Would he want us to draft statutory instruments related to the commission's basic housekeeping functions? I would be surprised if his party's business managers would thank him if they found out that he argued for all those housekeeping issues to be the subject of delegated legislative time in Standing Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Obviously, that is right. However, I am astonished that the Minister thinks that the Secretary of State should make directions on the subject. Should not the commission do that itself? Does it really require such an exalted person as the Secretary of State to make directions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is an exalted person. I accept that I may have used an example that is not entirely appropriate. However, if his argument were followed to its logical conclusion, all aspects of directions that the Secretary of State might be minded to issue to the commission would be subject to the negative resolution procedure. If that is his argument, perhaps he should discuss it with the Opposition Chief Whip, who, I think, will be less than enthusiastic about that as a model or way forward in the future of this legislation.

<P>
We have had a long and, in a sense, unnecessary argument, as we have acknowledged the need for the commission to be truly independent, which it will be. It will replace the fragmented arrangements that the hon. Member for Meriden described, which do not maintain a proper division between those who provide services and those who regulate and inspect them. That is the fundamental problem, which the new, independent body corporate will begin to address.

<P>
I have tried to reassure the hon. Lady that the commission will be independent, which, as she said, is necessary to command widespread public confidence and support. However, I think that she would accept, on reflection, that retaining the powers in subsection (2) is justified. It is not, of course, an attempt to undermine the independence of the commission. It is simply an attempt to ensure proper accountability to the Secretary of State and, ultimately, Parliament for the commission's activities and the way in which it exercises its functions. If she looks at historical antecedents and precedents, she will find that that is a standard way in which Parliament sets up new institutions and bodies. Nothing in the Bill is exceptional or dramatically at odds with previous legislation setting up independent bodies. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) said, we shall return to some of the matters raised when we discuss clause 7.

<P>
The hon. Lady has made good points, which we have taken on board. In a nutshell, however, the amendment is unnecessary. It adds nothing of substance to the establishment of the commission. I hope that the hon. Lady will acknowledge that.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. My difficulty is that I will have to take it on trust that the body will not be interfered with. The objectives that Opposition Members are trying to achieve might become clearer when we discuss the next amendment, which refers to a not unrelated matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 5, line 6, leave out from beginning to end of line 8 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in accordance with regulations in respect of the exercise of its functions as revised from time to time.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 45.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The debate on this amendment will enable me to explain further why we want to amend subsection (2). The amendment returns to the question of directions given by the Secretary of State, which are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the same way as regulations. Our intention is not to create a vacuum but to give substance to our argument that the National Care Standards Commission must be free from political interference and directed by regulations that are subject to public scrutiny. That would offer more transparency in the commission's workings and greater integrity for the organisation. The disasters in care provision that occurred in the past, especially in Mrs Spelman<P>
relation to children, surely prove a great need for clear and above-board regulation, which can be accessed by democratically elected representatives to call individuals to account.

<P>
The power to direct the commission is a strong one to give to the Secretary of State for Health. Other so-called independent bodies that have been on the receiving end of Government directions have sometimes protested about the way in which such a power has been exercised. Having heard those protests, and given our concern about the abuse that could occur, we want regulations to be placed before Parliament to bring greater transparency to the way in which power is exercised through the commission. The Bill is framework legislation and gives the Government enormous flexibility in making regulations. That is too much of a blank cheque. There is no assurance about how the Secretary of State will exercise the power to direct the commission, as baldly set out in the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): In order that we may understand her objective more clearly, will the hon. Lady give us some examples of the other organisations that have objected to interference?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> For example, recently the newly created regional development agencies have found that, even if democratically elected local councillors refuse to grant planning permission for a development and the matter goes to a public inquiry in which an inspector rules that he refuses to grant planning permission, a direction from the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions can overturn that decision and override that decision-making process. There is no parliamentary or democratic opportunity to do anything about a decision made at that level. I realise that my example comes from another Department, but my experience is in another Department. That example shows why we feel strongly about removing the subsection.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Can you clarify the procedure that we are to follow? This group of amendments includes a Government amendment. I would prefer to hear the Minister explain his amendment before I speak, but I am not certain about whether that would preclude me from catching your eye.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> So long as the hon. Gentleman does not stand or seek to catch my eye, he will not be called, and I shall call the Minister. Thereafter, any hon. Member is at liberty to catch my eye.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> In the previous debate, we strayed into some of the terrain that we will now discuss. I apologise for that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden concluded by saying that she felt strongly about the amendment. Her view puzzles me. It might help if I make it clear that we hope that the Secretary of State will not have to use the power to issue directions under subsection (2) unnecessarily. We expect the commission to do many important and worthwhile tasks, such as setting up the internet site that I just talked about, but of course, we need that reserved power. Most people of good will would accept that we should have a power to issue directions, because it is ultimately the Secretary of State's responsibility to ensure that the commission operates efficiently and effectively.

<P>
Let us pursue the logic of the argument made by the hon. Member for Meriden. It requires every matter on which the Secretary of State obliges the commission to act to be subject to regulations made under the Bill, which would be subject to procedures in the House. No matter how mundane or basic those regulations were, her amendment would require the House to consider them.

<P>
I am sure that on reflection the hon. Lady will agree that that is not a sensible position for her party to take. She may, however, disagree with me; she is probably trying to get a sense of how we intend to use subsection (2) and I have tried to reassure her on that. We do not intend to interfere, willy-nilly, in every aspect of the commission's functions, as we have more important things to do. There is a logical case for taking the powers in subsection (2).

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the directions that are given be made public, so that we, as observers, can distinguish between the commission acting on its own initiative and on instructions from the Secretary of State?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It will be possible for the Secretary of State to publish those directions if he feels it appropriate. It could be done in the form of answers to parliamentary questions; traditional methods are available to hon. Members to extract information from the Executive about such issues. We would not necessarily want to commit ourselves to publishing every direction that we issue to the commission, but there are ways and means available to Members to obtain information from Ministers. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, this is a red herring; I do not believe that the amendment is a serious attempt to amend the Bill to require the House to be consulted on every detailed aspect of the relationship between the commission and the Secretary of State and to have the final say on those matters.

<P>
In parts of the Bill where there are important matters of public interest, we have made it clear that the powers can be exercised by regulation. In those cases, the House will be involved in that process. We are talking about issues that may not attract a high level of public interest and concern, but the amendment would commit the House to debating every aspect of those issues.

<P>
Earlier, the hon. Member for Meriden said that she wanted less political intereference in the operation of the commission. I am not sure that that objective would be achieved by translating subsection (2) into a power to make regulations, rather than to issue directions. If that is the hon. Lady's fundamental concern, the amendment does not address it. I cannot advise my hon. Friends to accept the hon. Lady's amendment, but as she rightly said, that will be no surprise to her.

<P>
Amendment No. 45 is a straightforward proposal to make it clear that the Secretary of State's powers to give directions to the commission include the power to give direction about its structure and organisation; the Secretary of State may direct the commission about the way it carries out its functions. That power will be used, for example, to require the commission to deal with applications for registration and appeals against its proposals, within strict time limits and to set up a proper procedure for dealing with complaints made about its staff, all of which relate to how it carries out its functions. We may also need to give directions to the commission about its structure and organisation and that is the purpose of the amendment.

<P>
I shall give the Committee a brief illustration of how the power might be used in future. We are anxious that the commission should not be seen as a remote national body. Schedule 1 already makes it clear that the commission will be required to appoint regional directors; those directors and their support staff will work from offices based in the regions that they serve, but it is not intended that all the commission staff will work out of those regional offices. Instead, there will be a network of local offices within each region and all the inspectors will work out of those local offices. That should help to ensure that the commission has a strong local presence, and that both the regulated services and the public will have ready access to the commission.

<P>
We hope that the commission will want to operate in that way, but it is essential to make it clear that the powers of direction over the commission extend to giving directions about its structure and organisation. During the Bill's passage in another place, we made it clear that we intend the commission to set up a separate division for the regulation of private health care. That will be headed by the director of private and voluntary health care to be established under paragraph 11 of schedule 1. The amendment will ensure that the commission sets up the separate division, as we intend.

<P>
The Committee will agree that those are strong reasons for needing the power of direction over the commission and I hope that my hon. Friends will support the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining more about the amendment's purpose. When amendments are moved that are intended to avoid doubt about how powers are to be exercised, it is often argued that such amendments are not needed, because if there is a general power, it can be used. It is good that such a power is being clarified.

<P>
Will the Minister say more about the network of local offices? We welcome the fact that the Government will ensure that the structure set up by the commission is more than just a regional structure, that it operates at a more local level. Clearly, close working relationships will need to be developed and some, at least in the early stages, will be based on the pre-existing health authority inspection units and local authority inspection units.

<P>
Can the Minister say whether the more locally based network will be based on health authority boundaries, primary care group boundaries, local authority boundaries or some other construct? It will be useful to know just how local the Government envisage it being.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman has covered some of the ground that I was going to ask him about. The independent sector is worred that the measure will simply transfer one group of people, albeit wearing a different hat, into another office. The local structure that the Minister mentioned reinforces the anxiety felt by the independent sector, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Only yesterday, I was at a reception given by the National Care Homes Association, which expressed concern that, although there may be a new institution, the same people will be involved. When there has been a good, positive and constructive relationship concerned with raising quality, they are delighted that those people will continue. However, they are horrified at the prospect of the regime continuing with people with whom the relationship has not been so good. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the commission's training and personnel should be explored and later amendments may allow us to do that.

<P>
The Minister referred to the separate division to deal with health-care matters. There was a welcome concession in the other place by the Under-Secretary, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. However, the Minister has gone no further than restating what the Under-Secretary said; the British Medical Association wants to know more about the Government's view on how the separate division will work. Will it report to some specifically named commissioners? Any insight into how it will work will be useful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked me where the offices would be located, but I cannot tell him much more than my noble Friend. We shall, of course, talk to local authorities and health authorities about where the regional network of local offices should be based. [
Interruption.] We currently envisage that perhaps as many as-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot allow private conversations to take place in the Room. There is plenty of space outside if hon. Members want to talk to each other.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. When I respond to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, I sometimes have the feeling that he and I are having a private conversation. I hope that that is not the case.

<P>
There could be as many as 80 networked local offices established by the National Care Standards Commission, which would certainly give it a substantial presence across England. However, we have not yet taken any decisions about the locality boundaries of the offices. We will try to keep the Committee informed during the passage of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister acknowledge that although it may be only symbolic, if people were operating from the same premises that inspection teams currently use, it would probably send the wrong signal to deal with the apprehensions of some people in the independent sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am prepared to accept that people in the independent sector might genuinely have those Mr. Hutton<P>
apprehensions. I am not in a position today to say precisely where the offices will be, but we will consider that carefully as we develop the proposals. I can reassure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that there will be a substantial network of local offices. They will give the commission a substantial national, regional and local presence, which is necessary. We have said repeatedly that people must have access to the commission. That includes providers, as well as members of the public. A network of up to 80 local offices will certainly give the commission a substantial local presence.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Government amendment No. 45 illustrates well the question of how much physical interference there will be. It sounds as if there is scope for substantial central Government involvement in setting up the structure and organisation of the commission, down to the lowest level. The Minister has not said much to allay my fears, but I decided that I would wait to hear what he said about the amendment, because it raises several concerns among those who read it. It certainly brings us full circle, because eight regional care standards commissions were originally envisaged in the White Paper. Many people were disappointed when that went down to one National Care Standards Commission. We picked up on that disappointment from the organisations concerned, so I am sure that regional care standards commissions will be welcomed.

<P>
I have a question about the structure, because the Minister referred to a separate division for private health care. Will there be regional children's rights directors? Does the Minister envisage the devolution of those roles to regional level? What will happen about a separate division for private health care in Wales, where the Welsh Assembly is the equivalent body to the National Care Standards Commission?

<P>
Will there be consultation on the location of the regional and local offices? I imagine that that issue might cause concern at local level. If an office were located in Truro, rather than Tiverton, there might be a little local tension about the choice. If the offices end up being run by the same people in the same places as before-as I think that we are picking up-there will be much concern and scepticism among those who have dealt with them before. We must accept that a rebranding exercise, perhaps with slightly higher salaries for doing the rebranded jobs, will not do much for confidence in the new mechanism at local level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall briefly respond; I do not want to prolong the debate, because, as with another amendment, the hon. Member for Meriden is labouring the point extensively. I have already said that we will consult health and local authorities about the local boundaries of the 80 local offices, but I am happy to repeat that, so that the hon. Lady understands that there will be consultation.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales will deal later with the hon. Lady's concerns about private health care arrangements in Wales. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) might also want to deal with that. I am sure that that is the appropriate way in which to deal with that point.

<P>
Again, the hon. Lady is misinterpreting what I have said. She complained that my comments revealed extensive Government involvement in the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission. Of course the Government have been substantially involved-it is a Government proposal. The establishment of the commission was forecast in the White Paper and we are now legislating for it, so I will not apologise for confessing that the Government have been substantially involved.

<P>
I am determined that the hon. Lady should understand the point that I tried to make clear in answer to a question from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). We have a power to issue directions under subsection (2), but we do not intend to use them on a routine basis and interfere in every nook and cranny of the commission's workings. It is essential that we have that power to issue effective directions because that is the right way to ensure a proper line of accountable governance to this place, but without involving the House, which is busy enough as it is, with a tranche of regulations that will require detailed discussion.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, I will not. I am sure that the Opposition Chief Whip, the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot), would not thank the hon. Member for Meriden for tabling such an amendment if such consequences were to occur.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, I shall not give way. We have had a lengthy debate on the matter and I shall conclude saying that the hon. Lady is mistaken in her understanding of the Bill. Her amendment is unnecessary and I strongly advise my hon. Friends to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I have listened carefully to what the Minister said. Having served in the Whips office, I know full well how such procedure works. Even when regulations are made, it is entirely within the gift of the Opposition to decide whether to pray against such action. However, such a measure allows Parliament to know what the Government are doing, which is an important principle. If our amendment gives rise to confusion about the idea that we do not expect the Secretary of State to give any direction at all, we expect the direction of the commission to be reasonable. We shall have to rest with the provision remaining a reserved power that we hope will be used only in exceptional circumstances and when necessary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawm.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 5, line 8, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Commission shall present to Parliament at least once in each year a report on its activities.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is part of a series of proposals designed to ensure that the workings of the commission are as transparent as possible and that it has the highest level of democratic accountability. We believe therefore that the presentation to Parliament at least once year of a report on the commission's activities would provide yet another better vehicle to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of its workings. It would be of paricular importance in the early years as the work of the commission evolves. Unforeseen difficulties may arise at the start that could be subject to proper debate in the public domain. We could all learn from its early experiences and suggest how its work could be improved. We are much attached to the idea of a report being presented to Parliament once a year.

<P>
One anomaly that has come to our attention is that the National Assembly for Wales will receive a report, and that that is the equivalent body in Wales to the National Care Standards Commission. England should be presented with the same opportunity to ensure parliamentary scrutiny, and Parliament should receive a report that can be debated. One of the unfortunate consequences of devolution is the divergence in the way in which Parliament is supplied with information about the workings of the Government, new agencies and commissions. Such an anomaly should be rectified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I fully understand the intention behind the amendment, but I wish to reassure the hon. Lady on why it is unnecessary. Paragraph 19(1) of schedule 1 already makes it clear that the commission is required to produce a report on the exercise of its functions as soon as possible after the end of each financial year. We expect that report to include the number of inspections that had been carried out in respect of registered services and the volume of applications processed, as well as details of the enforcement activity that was undertaken.

<P>
The commission will be required to publish the report in a manner that it considers appropriate. The intention is that the report should be printed and copies be made generally available. We intend that the commission will place a copy of its annual report in the House of Commons Library, and we shall if necessary issue directions to the commission to ensure that it does. The commission will generally be expected to act transparently and to take account of the principles of open government in all that it does.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden will also be aware that, as the National Care Standards Commission is a non-departmental public body, the Bill provides, in paragraph (18)(4) of schedule 1, that the commission's accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on them must be made available to Parliament. I hope that the Committee is sufficiently reassured that the commission's annual report will be available to Parliament and the public and that the amendment can therefore be safely rejected.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am obviously delighted to hear that, in theory, that will happen, but I should have been happier if a requirement had been specified and made explicit in the Bill. That is why we tabled the amendment. It seems slightly inconsistent that schedule 1 requires the accounts to be laid before Parliament-we welcome that and look forward to reading them-but that we must reside with an intention in relation to a published report and, once again, rely on the Secretary of State's giving direction for the action. That is why we had greater confidence in amending clause 6 to ensure that that was perfectly clear and apparent to everyone.

<P>
One of the difficulties involved in the flexibility of the framework Bill is that, to those in the outside world who have not been present in the Standing Committee and never get around to reading the Hansard report of our debate, that information will be less apparent. I hope that the practice will establish itself from the beginning and that, once direction is given for an annual report to be laid before Parliament, there will be no deviation over the years and no need to hide the information in the report from public scrutiny.

<P>
We have made our point that we would have preferred that to be specified in clause 6, but we shall have to accept the Minister's assurance that he will see this intentions through to delivery as he described. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 147, in page 5, line 26, after `quality', insert `or availability'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Those of the amendments for which I am responsible would extend the requirement on the National Care Standards Commission to investigate and keep the Secretary of State informed about availability of provision and quality of service to include fees payable for care purchased by local authorities and individuals who must pay for care themselves so that it examines the cost and value-for-money impacts of the changing regulatory environment on the sector. All hon. Members would readily agree that the availability of provision and the quality of services, which are already specified in the Bill as matters for which the commission will have a responsibility to keep the Secretary of State informed, are inextricably intertwined with cost and value for money.

<P>
Some outside bodies are worried about whether the requirement in subsection (1) to keep the Secretary of State informed is intended to be merely a mechanistic exercise of gathering and reporting back information or whether the commission is expected to take a more proactive role in finding solutions to problems relating to the availability of provision and quality of services. I am sure that the Minister will tell the Committee about his current thinking on that matter.

<P>
Without wanting to pre-empt later debates, we should look at the proposals to extend the scope of subsection (1) in the context of the current situation of nursing homes and care homes. In the past few years, the needs of people admitted to both care and nursing homes have increased considerably. That reflects the more stringent thresholds criteria for admission and eligibility for assistance from social services authorities as they react to the current environment. The Minister and I have frequently disagreed about whether social services departments are being squeezed for resources. He regularly quotes figures of percentage increases in total social services funding availability, but as Ministers well know in some parts of the country-notably, the south-east-social services departments have found themselves considerably squeezed.

<P>
The Secretary of State, interestingly, in support of his declared intention to move frail elderly people after surgery and acute interludes from NHS hospitals into nursing home care as soon as that is appropriate and possible, recently told the press:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It costs only £400 per week to keep someone in a nursing home.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will know that the average local authority payment for a placement in a nursing home, following the increases in April, is about £330. There is a telling gap between what the Secretary of State thinks it costs to keep someone in a nursing home and what the average local authority pays. The local authorities are not seeking to squeeze the sector or to do anything nasty to it, but in many areas, and certainly in mine, they are under tremendous pressure. They must keep fees as low as possible to ensure that the maximum number of placements can be made within the budget.

<P>
I am told that every day at least one nursing or care home closes its doors. The sector as a whole has found it increasingly difficult to get access to capital. Although I would not want to exaggerate the situation, I think the Minister will accept that there is a crisis. It would be extremely helpful if the commission, when it reported to the Secretary of State on the availability of provision and the quality of services, also reported on the impact of the fees that are paid to providers on demand for and supply of part II services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that there is a shortage of beds? There is a surplus of beds in my constituency. Indeed, the crisis is a reflection of the market, and has nothing to do with any shortcoming in the number of beds available. Does he suggest that there is a problem in some areas, or is he perhaps making a not particularly good point?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The two are not mutually exclusive. Again, this is a discussion that I have had on other occasions with the Minister. There is a surplus of beds nationally and in some areas there are acute shortages. Both statements are true. Increasingly, areas of the country, and I cite Hertfordshire as a current example, have empty beds, but the owners of the beds are unwilling to take placements as the fee level that the local authority is able to pay. There is a problem: it is not universal, but it is serious in the areas where it occurs. Ministers are aware of it. I hope that, as we go through the next few groups of amendments and talk about some other ideas, we will begin to see glimpses of the Government's view of how the sector will evolve under the new regulatory environment and how the Government expect to move us out of the current crisis.

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 121 would require the commission to publish an annual review of the provision of part II services and levels of fees paid to providers and payable by services users. It is part of the exercise of asking the Government to face up to the financial realities of the improved quality environment that they want to see. The Bill is pie in the sky if there is no recognition of the costs that will be involved. We are talking about ensuring quality and raising quality standards, something that 99 per cent. of people involved in the sector would support. However, they are desparately unsure whether the Government recognise the cost implications of doing that and are prepared to enable local authorities to reflect that in the fees paid. The blunt fact is that, if the fees do not cover the cost of a high-quality service, which will now be defined by regulations and standards, there will be a continuing loss of beds from the sector.

<P>
It is disappointing that the Government have not addressed the issue of cost. They have not told us how much introducing the quality environment will cost. Are we talking about £100 million, £500 million or £1 billion? How much do they expect they will have to spend to achieve the Bill's many laudable objectives? People out there want to know how much, who is paying and how it will be funded. The Government appear not to want to address those hard issues. They want only to talk about the desirability of improving quality, which we all acknowledge. I have never spoke to a care home or nursing home owner who would not like to deliver a higher-quality service, but those people would also like to be paid for doing so. That issue must be addressed if we are to live in the real, rather than the virtual, world.

<P>
As I pointed out at Second Reading, if the Government acknowledged that there is a significant cost in delivering a higher-quality environment, better training, buildings and staff, we could deliver it now, before the regulations are in place and the Bill is in force, through the contracting process. If the Government could commit a sum of money to meet those higher-quality aspirations, the vast majority of providers would respond, but they cannot do so at present because the fee levels do not provide adequate recompense.

<P>
We must also recognise different levels of need, which the present system does not always effectively recognise or pay for appropriately. We perhaps need a more refined system that not only recognises subtle gradations in the needs of individuals and geographical cost differences but recognises that quality costs money. Perhaps when we move on to the next group of amendments we will start to probe the Government about putting those ideas into practice.

<P>
I shall explain the current realities from the horse's mouth, as I attended the meeting mentioned by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and spoke to care home owners about what is happening in the sector. That meeting was attended mainly by owners of smaller, independent homes, but I had spoken the previous day to some of the larger corporate operators of nursing and care homes. Both groups told me the same story-that the current level of fees dictates how much building maintenance is done, so buildings are gradually deteriorating because much maintenance is not carried out. Staff training is also suffering because it costs money and, in some cases, the quality and quantity of food are worsening.

<P>
The Minister will say that the regulations and the environment put in place by the Bill will address those problems by providing absolute minimums. However, if it happens without tackling the reality that these provisions cost more money, the number of beds available in the sector will be reduced. No one should make the mistake of thinking that problems are the result of many greedy, profit-making private providers of care trying to squeeze the size of food portions to keep their profits intact. The reality is-it would be helpful if the Minister would supply some figures-that private and independent providers are offering care at a considerably lower cost than the average cost of local authority-provided care. In terms of value for money, the private providers are, although extremely squeezed, delivering the goods.

<P>
The amendments relating to the publication of advice would ensure greater transparency. The Bill's full impact must be properly assessed and be capable of examination by everyone. Information should be made publicly available to facilitate debate. The Minister should agree that costs, value for money and the impact of any change in the regulatory environment, as well as availability and quality, are important.

<P>
I shall touch briefly on amendment No. 4, tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, although I do not know what he will say about requiring the commission to report on ``unmet needs'' for social care. On the hon. Gentleman's point about the shortfall in the ability of social services to meet demand, does the Minister agree that a standard assessment process, which could measure need more objectively than at present, would be helpful? Local authorities today have their own assessment systems and thresholds for eligibility, so the goalposts are being moved to match available funding and difficult decisions have to be taken.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has touched a nerve. In the interests of transparency, much could be said in favour of a standardised, uniform assessment that measured need objectively. If the threshold for access to services were set by an accountable person-most obviously, the Secretary of State-the gap between objectively assessed need and available supply would be apparent and the ball would bounce back into the politicans' court, which is where it should be. The politicians would then have to take the difficult political decision about whether to increase funding to meet the need gap.

<P>

<B>Mrs Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, but what about people whose needs are unmet because they do not come forward for assessment? Many elderly and disabled people in the community could and should, but do not, apply for assessment by social services. How will that problem be addressed in the hon. Gentleman's prescriptive scenario, and where will their unmet need appear in the statistics?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Lady makes a good, but separate, point. I am not advocating a system of roving compulsory assessors who would assess people's needs irrespective of whether they wanted them to be assessed. The hon Lady's argument applies across the social welfare system. Many people, for various reasons, do not come forward to be assessed for benefits to which they are entitled. My different concern is about a flexible threshold that conceals the level of unmet need and makes it impossible for us to address it as a political issue. As in the health service more widely, it becomes a rationing issue. We in Parliament should be debating the level of funding that allows such need to be met.

<P>
Currently, funding decisions are made centrally-through revenue support and other grants to local authorities-but the responsibility for assessing needs, defining thresholds and taking hard decisions is left at the second-tier or unitary local authority level. Many such authorities are highly squeezed, especially in the south-east, and sometimes follow conflicting guidance.
Mr. Hammond
<P>
All members of the Committee obviously have a particular interest in social services-otherwise they would not be here-but, equally, we all know that second-tier and unitary local authorities have attempted to respond to what was perceived as a clear policy steer from the Government that education was to be regarded as the highest priority. To some extent-it certainly applies in Surrey-that has damaged the funding stream available within authorities for social services. Many bodies are doing extremely difficult jobs and it is unfair to make them take all the decisions themselves. The Bill allows them to conceal the scale of the problem. Does the Minister have any sympathy with a uniform standard assessment system to enhance transparency? If so, I would be tempted to explore the possibility in greater detail with another amendment or a new clause later in our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I enjoyed hearing my amendment moved in such detail with such eloquence. It is useful to have a detailed discussion about ``unmet need''.


<P>
We and others outside the Committee are concerned about the extent to which the commission will be proactive and strategic in its advice to Ministers. It might perform better strategically if it had a better fix on the level of need and unmet need in the provision of social care. That is the important missing ingredient in our debates about the adequacy of resourcing for social care.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister often displays his annoyance when we challenge him on the level of resources that the Government are putting into social services. That is understandable if, in his opinion, the Government have allocated substantial sums through the comprehensive spending review. However, many of us, from our experience in local authorities, know of social service departments that continue to feel under pressure. That is why the commission ought to have the responsibility of monitoring unmet need. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs Humble) rightly draws a distinction between the unmet need that could be recorded through need assessment and that which does not present itself because the person in need does not take up the opportunity of assessment under community care legislation. The commission could undertake qualitative and quantitative research to gauge and measure that second type of unmet need; in discharging that role, it might usefully inform the debate about social care.

<P>
I want to focus on the unmet need in the system that is constrained and controlled by eligibility criteria. The need for those criteria, and their diversity, moved closer to the heart of the debate after the Gloucestershire judgment of several years ago. I do not want to consider that entire case: the Government have always been clear that the law remains as decreed by the Law Lords. The case highlighted the extent to which social care is rationed, however. The Needs Must campaign, the Coalition on Charging and the Audit Commission have recently published reports that highlight the wide range and variation in eligibility criteria and charging. If the Government give the commission that role, we may have a better understanding of the unmet need.

<P>
Under the present system, two people-let us say twins, for the sake of this example-who live in different local authority areas may receive different treatment although they are assessed as having the same care need. One may get access to a whole range of services while the other does not, owing to the way in which the eligibility criteria are drawn up. That difference represents the unmet need that ought to be recorded.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to the need for uniformity and standardisation of measurement tools for assessment. When I spoke recently to several social workers about those issues, some of them put the point forcefully that one must not lose sight of the individual when introducing such measures. If one is looking at a piece of paper with tick boxes on it, one is not necessarily thinking about the person who filled in the form. There is a need for objective measures to enable us to consider the issue nationally, but we would be failing a lot of people if we did not, in addition, tailor packages of care to meet their needs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I take that point, but everybody in the loop, including private sector providers, must have confidence in the assessment of need. I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to the case that payment levels must be more closely matched to the levels of individual need, in the longer term at least.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to come to fee levels in relation to amendment No. 21. We should not wholly rely on mechanistic and standardised procedures; we must recognise that we are dealing with human beings, so each case will be unique.

<P>
I hope that I have sufficiently outlined the reasons why the commission could discharge its remit in respect of measuring unmet need. It want to speak briefly to amendment No. 21, which would have a similar effect to that desired by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It is about the need
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to monitor and report to the Secretary of State on the level and impact of fees on the demand and supply of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
care homes and other part II services. As he said, it was forcefully put to several hon. Members at yesterday's reception organised by the National Care Homes Association that the level of closures is extremely high at the moment. The hon. Gentleman said that one home is closing a day. I asked about that figure, and look forward to seeing more evidence in support of it. If it is true, it is a cause for concern.

<P>
Yesterday, I met several owners who are closing their homes for a complicated equation of reasons, within which fees are a factor. Wellesley Lodge in my constituency has reached the stage at which its owners feel that the fees that they secure for providing residential care cannot meet the level of care that they want to provide. As a voluntary, Christian organisation, it effectively has to cross-subsidise and find other options.

<P>
The problem of the current structure is that it is not related to the expected standards as thoroughly as it might be. The problems then impact on recruitment and retention of staff. We know that the least trained staff and highest levels of staff turnover are in residential care homes. That must be tied at least in part to the level of payment that can be afforded, which brings us back to the level of fees that local authorities are willing to pay.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) rightly asked about the over-supply of nursing and residential home places. The impact assessment that the government produced in their ``Fit for the Future?'' proposals shows that, from a market analysis, there is an over-supply. However, as I understand it, it is fairly short-term. The numbers of people requiring residential care will continue to grow within the next few years simply because of the ageing population, even if we keep more people at home because we have appropriate services.

<P>
There is a future for residential care, although it may be slightly different from its past. It is therefore important that, through this legislation, we ensure that the fees match the sorts of standards that we want those homes to provide. Yesterday, we were given the excellent case study of the star ratings scheme that operates in Blackpool, which the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood detailed in a debate on long-term care in December. It is an encouraging example. It tries to reward quality, and so directs additional fees to quality providers and does not provide any increase in fees to poor providers. That is a way to get more out of the existing money. We should all encourage such a creative approach, in terms of the way in which purchasers and commissioners of services use their budgets. There is no straight correlation between the sum of money put in and the quality of outcome. There may be some relationship, but it is not direct. One has only to consider the unit costs of various homes and the quality of care provided to see that.

<P>
So that we are all better informed, the commission should be required to monitor those services, as the industry tells us that it is under severe pressure and that more closures are coming. We are talking about not only the residential homes sector, but the domiciliary care sector as well. I hope that the Government can allay those concerns and ensure that the Bill contains a provision so that those facts and figures are to hand.

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The two speeches that we have just heard evoke the Second Reading debate. The speech of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was certainly similar to the speech that he gave on Second Reading, as he graciously acknowledged. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made some important points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was criticised this morning by the hon. Member for Don Valley for raising an issue that I did not raise on Second Reading, so it is difficult to win.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> There is a danger that we will start to feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman-he might feel sorry for himself, which is fair enough. Many Government members on this Committee know how difficult it is to be in opposition on a Committee; the hon. Gentleman is experiencing the reality that the opposition spokesperson is in a no-win situation.

<P>
Some important issues have been raised during our debate, but there has been some misunderstanding and confusion between the respective roles of the commission on the one hand and central and local government on the other. I shall return to that point in a moment. The large group of amendments has raised some inportant and basic issues on the role, particularly the advisory role, of the National Care Standards Commission, which I shall address. The amendments would give the commission the responsibility for providing advice on services that, by and large, would fall outside its regulatory responsibilities. The Bill is concerned with the regulation of care services, not in the main with trying to second-guess the investment that the Government and the independent sector should make in those services. It is vital that the commission has a coherent and viable role that will improve the situation of everyone who needs long-term care. Amendment No. 4, moved by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, runs the risk of confusing the function of the commission and compromises its ability to operate successfully. The phrase that he chose to use in amendment No. 4:

-services that the amendment does not define-is by its nature a subjective measure which, as he acknowledged, would be extremely difficult to map and to monitor. It would not be an appropriate function for a statutory body, whose prime function is the regulation of those care services.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a serious point. Services regulated by the commission are only one way of meeting people's needs. As bodies such as the royal commission and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have pointed out, housing has a vital role to play in meeting people's wider support needs, as do, for example, aids and adaptations to people's accommodation. The Government's policy on supporting people reflects those concepts fully. A body such as the commission, which looks only at services that people regulate under part II of the Bill, will not have the benefit of looking at the whole picture. Any recommendations that it might want to make about, in his expression, unmet needs for services could therefore be considered less than comprehensive. The commission would focus only on the services that it monitored and would not be able to take a view on other support that might be necessary and available.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made some important points, with which I largely agreed, on difficulties in regard to needs assessment and eligibility criteria. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson)-from what I thought was a sedentary position-expressed concern about the hon. Gentleman's point. The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Sutton and Cheam will know that the Government, in the White Paper, committed themselves to publishing advice-we hope in the autumn-to local authorities on what we have styled fair access to care services. It has proved a Mr. Hutton<P>
difficult project to develop and get right. We want our initiative on fair access to care services to guide local authorities on what they need to do to make it clear to the public and to Government what needs local authorities have deemed eligible to meet and which they have deemed ineligible. The guidance proposes that local authorities' performance in setting eligibility criteria be closely monitored by the Government. There will be no need for the commission to be involved in such matters. In relation to fair access to care services, we intend to address some of the concerns that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly raises. The purpose of the exercise is to find a better framework for assessing care needs. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the new guidance is intended to operate as section 7 guidance under the Local Authoirty Social Services Act 1970. It will therefore be statutory guidance, which local authorities will have to take into account.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> When the Government introduce their new policy framework in respect of fair access to care services, will they set out how objective measures of unmet need, and the attendant definitions, will be met? Many are concerned that the current system skews the monitoring of unmet need, and makes it impossible to monitor and record properly, which, as a consequence, most local authorities do not do. Nevertheless, it would be an aid to planning the allocation of staff and resources.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Such an issue might arise, almost inevitably, as a consequence of developing the statutory guidance along the lines indicated. The new performance assessment framework is being developed to promote a better understanding of how local authorities are meeting care needs.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I was just about to turn my attention to amendments Nos. 21, 115 and 116, none of which is acceptable to the Government. They would require the commission to undertake work not related directly to its core functions. Its role, as set out in clause 7, is centred around care standards and the information that it collects as part of that process. Collecting information about providers' contract rates is not related to those activities, nor is information about the fees and charges levied by local authorities on people whose care they arrange.

<P>
Providers of part II services, as defined under clause 7, operate in a market. For example, the operator of a residential care home will set the fees based on what competitors charge and on what the purchasers of their services will bear, be they local authority commissioners or individuals who self-fund their own care. When a home is efficient, its cost base depends on two factors: first, the quality of care provided and, secondly, the level of ancillary activities and comfort. The second factor depends on where in the market a specific provider wishes to position itself. It is for the home to decide at what end of the market it wants to operate. That is not the responsibility of the commission as long as the care home meets the national minimum standards.

<P>
It is not the business of the commission to concern itself with the fees that local authorities charge to people who use services that are commissioned by social services departments. If someone is receiving residential care, the means-testing rules are set out in the charging for residential accommodation guide that is issued each year. If someone is receiving non-residential care, the charges that are paid will be subject to the guidance that we shall issue in the future as a result of the Government's amendment, about which I shall say a few words in a moment.

<P>
The Government recognise people's worries about the cost of long-term care. Our current spending review is looking in depth into funding for long-term care services to see how we can improve their quality and delivery. When the review has been completed, we shall publish a White Paper that will address and set out those issues. We are committed to developing a system that is fair and sustainable now, and for the future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister said that it should not be an on-going function of the commission to gather information about fees and services. He talked about a marketplace, but that would be strange with one dominant purchaser in it. I suspect that he would not like the ultimate market sanctions to be brought to bear to make the necessary regulation in the marketplace. The information needs to be gathered. Which body does the Minister want to gather and transmit the information? Is there a role for the social services inspectorate? How does he regard its future?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall deal with those points later. Various processes are under way, some of which involve the social services inspectorate. For example, some will be pursued through the best value obligations under which local authorities operate. There are several ways in which to crack the nut. For many reasons that I have given, and some of which I am about to give, loading the principal responsiblity on to the National Care Standards Commission, which is the hon. Gentleman's solution, would be inappropriate. I am not saying that such issues are not important-they are. We have made clear our worries about the present arrangements for contracting residential care. We have made observations about it in the White Paper and have pursued the matter in discussions with various providers throughout the public and private sector. Further announcements will be made in due course. To be honest, I do not believe that the proposal adopted by the hon. Gentleman is sensible.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the report of the Audit Commission, which was published early last month. He was right to say that it found wide variations in the charges levied for similar services for people of similar means. Charges unrelated to ability to pay and the lack of transparency in charging mechanisms can create anxiety and deter vulnerable people from seeking the help that they need. Users are sometimes admitted prematurely to residential care because of perverse financial incentives in the system. As a Government, we are determined to solve those problems. Home care is an essential component in improving the quality of life of many older people and younger disabled people. Officials are consulting service providers and user representatives to determine how best we can improve the current situation.

<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, we shall be tabling an amendment that would enable us, for the first time, to issue statutory guidance about home care charges. I hope that I have persuaded members of the Committee that giving the commission responsibilities in respect of providers' rates and local authority fees would not be the most appropriate or effective way in which to tackle the worries-which I am sure we all share-about reasonable and equitable charging for social care services.

<P>
Amendment No. 121 is a strange and curious mix of ideas. It is not acceptable to the Government. Issues to do with rates that providers charge or with the fees that local authorities pass on to users are not part of the commission's remit. It makes no sense to require the commission to publish a report, annually or otherwise, on issues that do not primarily concern it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand what the Minister is saying to a certain extent, but is it not an old-fashioned view to say that a body should look at availability and quality, but should be utterly blind to cost and value for money? The four things go hand in hand and it would be natural for the commission, which gathers information, to consider all such matters together when it looks at the overall situation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> In part, it may be that we simply disagree about the matter. I said at the beginning of my remarks that underlying the amendment is a confusion of roles and responsibility between central and local government and the commission. Others have the responsibility to concern themselves with fees and the rates at which care services are provided. Primarily, those are matters for local authorities. We provide the resources and they negotiate the rates at which care is provided at a local level. That has been the tradition and, unless he would like to correct me, I do not detect from the remarks of the hon. Gentleman that he believes that it is central Government's responsibility to determine the individual rates at which care home services are provided. Is that his view?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the opportunity to elaborate. At the start of his argument, he rejected the idea that the commission should play a strategic role in looking at the global situation. Individual local authorities will deal with providers in their areas, but Opposition Members see the need to look at the impact of Government-imposed regulation throughout the sector at a strategic level on the aggregate supply of services and their cost. That is what I am getting at.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I believe strongly that the commission should have a proactive strategic responsibility in such matters. If the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill-I am sure that he has-in the same way that I have, he will see that the commission will have responsibilities to keep the Secretary of State informed about both the ability of the provision and the quality of the services. I refer also to the commission's views on what changes may be necessary to the minimum required standards. The general legal framework within which the Bill establishes the commission gives it an important strategic opportunity to make that advice available to Ministers. The hon. Gentleman is arguing for it to assume responsibility for advising the Government about fees and the rates at which they are paid to local care home owners. That is the difficulty with the amendment. The current arrangements, under which the Government provide the resource envelope and local authorities determine the precise allocation and the rates at which they are prepared to contract, constitute the most sensible approach. Social services are local, and it is entirely appropriate that they remain so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We have established that we are discussing an unusual and rather false market, given that there is almost a monopoly purchaser and a multiplicity of providers. As the Bill determines standards, which are partly what fix prices, would it not be right for the Government, the SSI or perhaps the Audit Commission to ensure regular monitoring of how those matters that are the responsibility of central Government and those that are the responsibility of local authorities impact on the performance of care homes? Even if that is not the right way, a real issue is at stake, about which many outside this Committee feel strongly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> If that is the essence of the hon. Gentleman's argument, I do not disagree with him. We are discussing whether the Bill should be amended as he proposes. To achieve his objective, such amendment would not be necessary. He should consider the performance assessment criteria, which attempts to measure the unit costs of residential care and other services. That information is collected by the Department from every local authority and is produced comprehensibly within the performance assessment framework. Of course that has an implication-no one disputes that the rate at which care is purchased has an implication for the provision of services, which, fundamentally, it does. However, we are discussing whether the amendment is the right way to give the commission its statutory responsibilities. His amendments, especially amendment No. 4, are unhelpful. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to feel that I am picking on him and his amendments, but a Minister must have some pleasurable moments, and the hon. Gentleman is furnishing me with many.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument does not have real substance. I accept his point, but I do not accept that his amendment is the right way to approach the matter. There are a number of different solutions. Clearly, the provision of part II services is the commission's business. Subsections (1) and (3) require the commission to provide the Secretary of State and public with information on such matters. However, there is no reason to stipulate that the commission should be tied to the production of a particular annual Mr. Hutton<P>
report on provision. The commission should decide how best to meet the requirements placed on them, taking account of the pace of change in the industry-which, as the hon. Gentleman said, is substantial-and the work involved in aggregating the information that it collects.

<P>
Amendment No. 125 would stretch the commission's functions even further. It is not acceptable. The role of the commission is to judge the quality of provision against set standards and to advise when any changes in the standards might be necessary to secure that quality. For example, changes may take place in what is regarded as good practice in individual care planning or the appropriate equipment to meet the needs of particular disabilities. We would expect the commission's staff to keep up to date with those developments and advise the Secretary of State accordingly. However, it would not be appropriate for them to determine what model of service provides best value for money. That must be a judgment for the person who purchases the care, who has the confidence of knowing that all the services being considered meet certain standards, and who, through the brochures and inspection reports, has information about what range of facilities the money available will purchase.

<P>
Amendment No. 147 would assign to the commission responsibility that we do not intend it to have. The commission is not intended to make judgments on how the availability of services could or should be altered in relation to national minimum standards or otherwise. That is an issue for local and national government, purchasers and commissioners of services and those with a strategic role in their planning. The Government have undertaken to publish a regulatory impact appraisal when setting standards and drafting regulations. Part of that exercise is to estimate their impact on availability. If we consider that any significant changes are necessary to regulations or standards, we have given a clear commitment to consult, and would include consideration of the impact of any of those changes on availability.

<P>
I am grateful for the opportunity that the amendments have given me to set out what the Government are doing. For the reasons that I gave, I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am delighted to hear that my amendments have served one purpose, even if it was only to give the Minister some moments of joy. I trust that I will not have any sleepless nights worrying about the repercussions of that remark in the next few weeks.

<P>
The debate has shown that, although in December the Government paraded the establishment of the commission as the fulfilment of one of the main recommendations of the royal commission, it is not. I say that not to devalue the National Care Standards Commission. It is an important body, but it will not do the job that the royal commission, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and others recommended.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government clearly have other routes by which to attempt to implement those recommendations, but no other proposals could achieve the same clarity, transparency and accountability as the recommendation by the royal commission and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation would have achieved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> May I correct the hon. Gentleman on one point? He is right to say that we have not accepted all the royal commission's recommendations. We have never pretended that we have. However, in each of the four key areas in which the royal commission wanted a national care commission to have responsibility, we have given the National Care Standards Commission a role.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister is right to say that the Bill takes on board some of the royal commission's recommendations. I do not dispute that. The point still stands about the differences, the nuances and the important role that such a body should play, but we will not make progress on that today.

<P>
However, I welcome the Minister's comments about unmet need. It will be helpful if the Government go along the lines he described for dealing with that knotty problem, because we need more accountable and clear information on unmet need. I will read what the Minister said to ensure that I am satisfied about that, and I will not press the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was rather disappointed by what the Minister said. I wonder whether there is an element of confusion. I will be charitable and say that perhaps my amendments are not clearly drafted. I did not want to create confusion. It occurred to me only as I listened to the Minister that the amendments could be interpreted differently. I never intended to suggest that the National Care Standards Commission should be involved in reporting on fees, costs or value for money in individual cases. However, at a strategic level, it could consider the effect of changes in the environment-principally the regulatory environment-on the aggregate cost of providing services.

<P>
In the role that they give the commission in subsection (1)(a) and (b), the Government rightly recognise the need for a stream of feedback to the Secretary of State about availability and quality. Fees are not to rise, and in such a revenue-static environment, those aspects will have a trade-off against each other. Financial issues must be considered. The Minister spoke of bodies other than the commission bearing that responsibility. The amendments suggest not that the commission should be responsible for securing an adequate supply or forcing remuneration up to the level that secures that supply, but simply that it should be the conduit for ensuring that such information, alongside information on availability and quality, is fed back to the Secretary of State. Somebody at a strategic level-I do not mind who it is-needs to examine such information.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, the market is not real in any meaningful sense because it contains one overwhemingly dominant purchaser and several suppliers. The Minister referred on several occasions to the fact that those suppliers will operate in a market, but I do not believe that he would want to use the mechanisms of the market to get the message, as markets transmit messages in a rather harsh way. If fees did not change while quality was increased by regulation and thus costs were increased by regulation, quality would increase, costs would increase, fees would stay static, and supply would decrease dramatically. That could happen, and the Secretary of State would eventually get the message when he started reading in newspapers that frail elderly people were being turned down on streets throughout the country.

<P>
I do not believe that the Minister genuinely wants to use the market mechanism in order to find out what is going on at the sharp end. It seems to me that, because the market is imperfect, although the Care Standards Commission may not be the right body, someone must intervene to gather information in the marketplace about what is happening and, in particular, about the impact of regulatory changes, before the market creates the sort of disaster to which I referred and sends the message screaming back to Whitehall. That was the intention behind my comments.

<P>
Rather curiously, the Minister is arguing that we need not worry because the marketplace will send the message, while I am arguing that we cannot rely on the market alone because it is such a peculiar market. That is slightly strange. He seems to have a curious lack of interest in such important information coming from the sharp end.

<P>
Another matter causes me considerable alarm. As I said earlier and on Second Reading, one of our biggest worries is that we have not heard from the Government a clear and open acknowledgement that the proposal will cost a lot of money and that the public purse will have to pay. In his response to the amendments, the Mininster seemed to be saying that a marketplace exists in which fees will be set according to what the competition is charging and what purchasers can afford to pay. That sounds to me like code for saying that if any of the providers think that they will receive more public money to support the quality agenda, they had better think again. That was the message that I received from listening to the Minister. I hope that that is not the case and that the Government do not believe that they can deliver the quality agenda that they want to deliver in the Bill without it being reflected in higher fees for providers. If they do believe that, the sector is heading for a disaster, and care users will suffer.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would make the position clear and say whether I have drawn the wrong deductions from his remarks. Many people outside will be alarmed by his comments. Having said that, there is no point in my persisting with the amendments if he is determined not to accept them, but I hope that he will at least draw from them some of the anxieties that have been articulated. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want the opportunity to pass without correcting some of the misunderstanding of my remarks that the hon. Gentleman revealed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised that if I allow the Minister to respond after the request to withdraw has been made, his response will constitute an objection to the withdrawal. That places us in a slightly unfortunate position, but I do not believe that this is his intention.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 5, line 14, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including standards of clinical care provided in those services'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 117, in page 5, line 15, leave out `encouraging' and insert `promoting'.

<P>
No. 120, in page 5, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) In pursuance of its duties under subsection (3) above the Commission shall develop and promote a ``star-rating'' scheme classifying establishments according to the quality of service provided to assist the public in comparing quality and to allow local authorities to recognise objective measures of service quality in their contracting arrangements.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendment is designed to explore the work of the commission in improving standards of clinical care in all settings. I believe, as do a number of organisations, that one of the Bill's objectives should be to improve the standards of clinical care, not least because the quality of life of many people is becoming increasingly complex as a result of the range of social care that they may receive. It is therefore important to explore how we ensure that clinical standards are not monitored in isolation from social care standards.

<P>
The Bill does not appear to have a mechanism to monitor clinical standards in care homes where health care is increasingly being provided. Subsection (1)(b) relates to the commission's duties towards the quality of services in care homes. I hope that we can get on the record today whether the Government acknowledge that the duty should extend to health care needs, as well as to nursing and personal care. There is an increasing trend for nursing homes to be used to treat NHS patients-I have alluded to that before. There is speculation about how that might develop in future. I can give a couple of examples to illustrate that.

<P>
The first is someone who has a hip replacement in an NHS hospital and is transferred to a private nursing home to facilitate his convalescence. Another example might be the winter pressures money that the Government have put into the health service. It has been used in a number of cases to purchase places in nursing homes and other private facilities such as private hospitals to release beds in the acute sector. What procedures will be in place to assess the clinical care delivered to individuals transferred to care homes from hospitals as part of their treatment? Who will carry out that inspection? Will it include a medically qualified person?

<P>
Clause 21 includes a reference to the promotion and protection of the health of persons. Does that give comfort to those who feel that there is a polarisation of different responsibilities for inspection in that regard? It is fine if the clause already gives the comfort that is sought, but it does not appear to do so. We want to establish how the Minister envisages health will be promoted and protected. That also applies in respect of intermediate care.
Mr. Burstow
<P>
I know that the Government have tabled a new clause that deals with the relationship between the National Care Standards Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement. Some of these points may be addressed there. The amendment seeks to place in the Bill-so that it can no longer be a source of concern or dispute-a requirement that in monitoring and inspecting standards, the teams look not just at the social care and personal care aspects, but at the clinical standards. Otherwise inspection after inspection could go on in homes, rather than the one seamless inspection that we all want to see.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 117 and 120. Amendment No. 117 is essentially a probing amendment. It touches on areas that we have touched on in the previous debate. It promotes rather than encourages improvement in the quality of part II services. To me, promoting implies a greater level of engagement than encouraging. Encouraging is done standing on the sidelines; promoting is much more involved. The purpose of this rather strange amendment is simply to probe the Minister about how proactively he interprets the term ``encouraging''. Does it mean being involved at a strategic policy level, or at the sharp end in individual cases to improve quality?

<P>
We heard this morning that there are genuine concerns about understanding the precise role of the commission, and to what extent it will be a proactive body. I have my own worries, as is apparent from our debates in previous sittings about what happens when one mixes the roles of regulator and improver or trainer. With that concern at the back of my mind, I seek to probe the Minister by asking him to accept ``promoting'' rather than ``encouraging''. I invite him to explain his interpretation of the role of the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 120 is more important. It seeks to impose on the commission the duty to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>develop and promote a ``star-rating'' scheme classifying establishments according to the quality of service provided to assist the public in comparing quality and to allow local authorities to recognise objective measures of service quality in their contracting arrangements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to embarrass the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood. We always cite the Blackpool example, which I think was the original scheme. Several other local authorities are either introducing such schemes or seriously considering doing so. I understand that Trish Davies, on behalf of the Department of Health, recently visited Blackpool to evaluate the scheme there and was reported to have commented favourably on it. The idea is to enhance transparency to enable individual purchasers or local authorities in the marketplace to have some clear measure of the different quality levels of care provided. Anything that enhances amounts of information and knowledge must be positive in any marketplace.

<P>
I understand that the Government have proposed to introduce a star rating system for the national health service. I quote from an article that states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A star system, similar to the guide book gradings awarded to hotel facilities, will be published so that the best hospitals are recognised and the worst humiliated. Each will be awarded up to five stars on 20 different criteria.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that report is correct, it suggests that the Government see the value of some kind of transparent acknowledgement of quality in delivery, which would serve two practical purposes. For individuals trying to find a care home for their elderly relatives, it could have a significant positive impact. I would like to quote briefly from a letter to the Prime Minister. I hasten to add that it was forwarded to me not by him, but by the sender, a lady in my constituency. She wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My Mother has multi-dementia caused by mini strokes and we must find her a residential care home. I did not realize how difficult and tricky this is to do, in finding a decent, caring, clean environment in which to spend her final years. Could we have some sort of grading system for residential and nursing homes?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She goes on to state that she
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>contacted Surrey County council . . . only to be told that, even though they would support such a system, they are not allowed to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the Government's view of the merits or otherwise of introducing such a system? It would assist the many people such as my constituent who find themselves urgently having to find care homes, probably with little knowledge of what they are looking for.

<P>
Local authorities could also use the star-rating system, where appropriate and where they felt inclined to do so, to pay premium fees to recognise quality. That is important, because there is another issue. The problem with the Government's minimum standards approach-I am not suggesting that it is a bad approach-is that those minimum standards will almost certainly, in a resource-constrained environment, become the only standards. The Minister spoke about the competitive marketplace in which care providers will operate, tendering their prices to the local authority as purchaser. Almost inevitably, the price that the local authority is prepared to pay will be set at the level of the provider who is providing the minumum standard. Those who provide higher standards will perceive a danger that they will be squeezed out of the marketplace if they do not lower their costs and prices to the same level. I take it that the Minister would not want to encourage that.

<P>
The star-rating route allows recognition of additional elements of quality and delivery. I am talking not about greater choice on the wine list or more doilies under the cup of tea, which is the example that was given recently, but about the more serious end of provisions, such as staffing ratios, physical provision and so on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a good argument, but I want to explore one issue with him. Does he envisage the proposed star-rating system being an additional functional service provided by the National Care Standards Commission? Would the system require an additional charge to be levied for every care home that wanted to participate or would it be compulsory?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My view is that the system should not be compulsory. There would be a working assumption that a care home that did not apply for a star registration would probably be unlikely to receive one. I would approach hotels that did not have a star rating in that way. I am not sure whether an additional fee would be required, but it may be that a fee would be required. Perhaps the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood will inform the Committee precisely how the Blackpool system works and whether a fee is payable there. I know that the local authority in Blackpool, as a purchaser, the independent care home owners and members of the public who use the service all find that the system works well and welcome it. I am not aware of anyone who has not embraced the system wholeheartedly. Therefore, we might usefully consider it. The scheme would not represent a desperately onerous responsibility to place on the commission.

<P>
Our amendment deliberately does not say that the commission must carry out the inspection and star rating, only that it must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>develop and promote a ``star-rating'' scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The scheme would have the authority of the commission behind it. However, if the commission felt that it was more appropriate for the inspection and grading to be carried out differently, it would, within the scope of the amendment, be open for the commission to say so. I look forward to hearing the Minister's broad views on the subject and how he would like to take that idea forward, if the amendment is not appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mrs Humble:</B> I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and shall make special reference to amendment No. 120, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would expect. I am pleased to hear so much cross-party support for the star-rating scheme that I outlined twice during debate in the Chamber, because there is much to commend it.

<P>
However, there are issues to be raised. Some people in Blackpool object to the scheme and they happen to be members of the Conservative party. The hon. Gentleman supports the scheme, but I have received through my door a leaflet from the Conservative candidate standing in my ward in Blackpool, referring to ``things we stand for'' and ``things we are against''. At the bottom, it says that Conservatives are against the star-rating scheme. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have a word with his party colleagues in Blackpool and tell them that they need to reconsider. The hon. Gentlemen are complaining about the fee. It is true that the scheme run in Blackpool by RDB-residential domiciliary benchmarking-is expensive, and onerous, to use the word employed by the hon. Gentleman. When a home pays its fee, inspectors come and make a detailed inspection that takes a couple of days, during which they talk to staff, residents and relatives. They ask far more detailed questions than would an inspector from an inspection unit. We need to consider the cost of that system before we support the amendment and give new powers to the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Full marks to the hon. Lady for anticipating my remarks and for doing her homework. I shall have a word with the Blackpool Conservative Association at the earliest opportunity. However, I do not regard the issue as party political. She is probably aware that Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent county councils, to name but three, are all Conservative controlled and currently evaluating star-rating systems with a view to introducing them. The Lancashire Care Association tells me that members are happy with the scheme, notwithstanding the fact that they have to pay the fees.

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> The RDB scheme is a commercial product and the other parts of the country that are considering a similar scheme are also considering commercial products available on the market. I am concerned that, in accepting the amendment, we would involve the commission in that commercial area.

<P>
I listened carefully to what the Minister said in response to the earlier amendments. He and the Government clearly consider that the commission should have a role in determining new standards that will, admittedly, be minimum standards. I sincerely hope that they will be higher than the standards that we have now. The commission's primary role will be to encourage and drive up those standards. I am not sure whether it should also be involved in promoting a star-rating scheme, given that the only examples of such schemes before us are from commercial organisations. The amendment does not give a clear definition of star-rating scheme; it does not offer costings or clarify whether all care homes and nursing homes would be involved.

<P>
The scheme in Blackpool works well in encouraging homes to improve standards by improving training and considering the way in which they are caring for people, and the brochure helps people to choose care homes. Under the choice directive under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, a local authority can only produce a list of all homes in its area. In Blackpool, there are a lot of homes and, if I were looking for a home for a relative and received a huge list from social services, I would not know where to start. The star-rating scheme helps people to choose.

<P>
Can there be a role for a star-rating scheme within the regulatory framework of the care standards commission? Does the minister see the task as a function of local authorities or of a Government department? Another worry is that the amendment would also reduce the scope for local flexibility. Such a scheme will work better in some areas than in others. It certainly works in Blackpool, which has so many homes.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thought about intervening in the hon. Lady's speech a moment ago to refer to local flexibility. It is important to have a national scheme of star rating that is understood throughout the country. It will often be the case that younger relatives who are looking for a home for the parent will live in a different part of the country, and a diversity of star-rating schemes on different bases in the country could be confusing and would have a negative impact. Standardisation is important.

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> Wherever people live, they will be reassured that the new National Care Standards Commission will encourage standards for the first time throughout the sector. We must look at individual circumstances. For example, the RDB scheme that been in operation for a couple of years is being re-examined. I met Trish Davies in Blackpool and I hope that the Minister will reassure me that he has considered the Blackpool scheme and the examples of good practice that it has set, and that he has looked at the best way in which to incorporate them within the Government's drive to improve standards. I am not convinced that the amendment is the way to do that, but there are important areas within the star-rating scheme that the Government must take into account. I hope that my hon. Friend has studied the report of Trish Davies and the Blackpool scheme and will take on board some of the lessons learned as a result of that scheme and others.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I second the comments of my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs Humble). While the homes in my constituency are not within the area of Blackpool borough council, my hon. Friend and I had the same discussions with the same private sector organisations that were involved in the Lancashire Care Association and which have been involved in the star-rating scheme in Blackpool.

<P>
Kent Health Care, which runs a private nursing home in my constituency that meets the highest standards of nursing home care, runs a scheme in Blackpool that has also achieved very high star rating. The scheme has much to commend it. I have discussed it with workers in homes and residents and their relatives. The programme has emerged as challenging; it goes far beyond the exploration of the physical standards of homes into every aspect of personal care, relationships, training, and the ability of staff to carry out both crucial nursing and social care functions in the homes. It sets very high standards to which homes can aspire. In effect, it creates a plan against which homes can measure their achievements and progress for the future.

<P>
I have commended what I have heard about the scheme to Lancashire county council social services and to my hon. Friend the Minister. I understand why amendment No. 120 in particular should not be accepted in its present form, but it raises an important and empowering issue because it gives good-quality information to potential residents and their families about what they can expect. It gives full attention to the highest standards of residential care and should be given much consideration over the coming days, weeks and months.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We have had a useful debate about the role of the National Care Standards Commission in improving the quality of services that it will have the responsibility to monitor. In the debate on the previous group of amendments, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge sought, rather unfairly, to traduce my arguments. The fact that his amendments and those of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam deal with quality and how to improve it gives me an opportunity to revisit that issue. The hon. Gentleman strongly implied that the conclusion that he drew from my earlier remarks was that the Government believe that the issues can all be left to the market. That is a bogus conclusion. If that were the Government's view, we would not be discussing a Care Standards Bill that is all about providing a more comprehensive framework of statutory regulation. The hon. Gentleman's argument is therefore insubstantial.

<P>
His other argument was that there would be no more money for social services in future. He just needs to wait until the announcements of the spending review are made later next month, when he will find himself in an embarrassing position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that trailer of the comprehensive spending review. I did not seek to traduce what he had said. When he tried to speak earlier, he said that he wanted to clear up any misunderstandings; I sought to give him that opportunity. Unfortunately, procedure did not allow it. I hope that the Minister will not continue to paint that as an attempt to traduce his position. If he reads the report, he may realise that some of his earlier comments were capable of being interpreted in that way. I am glad that he is able to clarify the situation now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I must confess to a certain fondness for ``traduce'', which is why I wanted to say it. I accept that the hon. Gentleman misinterpreted my remarks, but I feel better for having used the word.

<P>
The National Care Standards Commission is first and foremost a regulatory body, but clause 7 bestows on it several additional duties that broadly follow from the royal commission's recommendations on long-term care and will certainly help to improve the quality of care services. The clause also empowers the commission to advise the Secretary of State of any changes to the statements of national minimum standards that it thinks necessary to bring about improvements in the quality of registered care services. The commission will be well placed to advise where standards no longer achieve their purpose or could be improved. The commission will also have a duty to keep consumers informed-the point made by my hon. Friends-by making information about part II services available to the public. Inspection reports will be an extremely useful source of information for prospective service users, their families and friends.

<P>
Amendment No. 11 would mean that the commission would have a duty to inform the Secretary of State about the general standards of clinical care in care homes. The commission is already required, under clause 7(1)(b), to keep the Secretary of State informed about the quality of part II services. An assessment of the quality of services will cover the standards of all care provided by care homes, whether personal, nursing or clinical care. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary. One further problem with it, which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam may not have spotted, is that it could inappropriately require the commission to inform the Secretary of State about the standards of clinical care provided to the residents of care homes by the NHS, through GPs and community nurses who may be caring for those residents. That is not the remit of the National Care Standards Commission, as it is beyond the control of care home owners themselves. The Commission for Health Improvement will monitor the standards provided by the NHS.

<P>
The National Care Standards Commission will be well placed to observe trends in the provision of social care services as a whole, as it will be regulating both statutory and independent sector providers. The private sector provides much of the publicly funded social care in England, yet comparatively little information is available at national level about the availability and quality of those services. It is important to use the commission's national overview of social care provision to keep the Government abreast of developments, especially after the royal commission's recommendations.

<P>
The clause is intended to achieve that. It is not intended to relate to establishments or agencies providing medical or psychiatric treatment or listed services. However, the standards of care provided by other registered establishments will be covered in the commission's assessment of the quality of provision. The amendment would unwisely include reference to the standards of clinical care in the NHS, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have one question for the Minister. Will the teams doing the inspection work include people with appropriate medical qualifications who are able to address the relevant problems?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, they will. The hon. Gentleman should also consider amendment No. 66, which partly addresses his concerns about clinical standards of nursing care. I tabled the amendment partly to respond to the concerns of his noble Friends in another place.

<P>
Amendment No. 120 would specify a particular mechanism for improving quality, which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge described as a star rating scheme. He referred to the scheme that operates in Blackpool: and my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and for Lancaster and Wyre also referred to it in their helpful remarks. I am sure that the Blackpool scheme has many other admirers.

<P>
We certainly agree that providers should be encouraged to adopt a quality assurance system and to demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement. The star rating scheme is one good example but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood rightly said, these are commercial products and they come at a price. She mentioned a figure of £3,000 for a care home establishment. Ultimately, it is for individual providers to decide to which particular version of any quality assurance scheme they wish to subscribe. I would say to her and to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who are obviously admirers of the star rating scheme, that the National Care Standards Commission will be under a general duty of encouraging improvements in the quality of part II services, including care homes in subsection (2).

<P>
I hope that, in the spirit of our previous exchanges, the National Care Standards Commission will take a proactive approach to encouraging improvements in quality. The particular schemes referred to by my hon. Friends may be a good example of the sort of quality assurance system that the commission itself could, once it assumed its regulatory responsibility, explore with local authorities, care home providers and others. Amendment No. 120 should not be built into the Bill and my hon. Friends provided some good reasons to support that view, which I do not intend to repeat.

<P>
Amendment No. 117 would replace the word ``encourage'' with ``promote''. I took the opportunity to consult a dictionary about the meaning of those two words. The hon. Gentleman says that he wants to probe my intentions and I have gained the strong impression that he has been probing me all day. I am looking forward to taking a short break. There is, in fact, little difference in substance between promote and encourage. One definition of ``promote'' is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to raise to a higher grade<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and another
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to raise . . . to the rank of queen<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I am not sure where that would take us, so we had better move on.

<P>
We modelled the advisory role of the National Care Standards Commission closely to meet the royal commission's recommendations. If the hon. Gentleman reads paragraph 7.2 of the royal commission's report, he will see that the royal commission envisaged its national care commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Encouraging the development of better services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He will note that we have tried to follow that closely. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam enjoyed some support from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when he criticised the Government earlier for not following the royal commission's recommendations, but this is an example of our having done so. The amendment would prevent us from doing that so, with respect, it would not add much of substance.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have already envisaged a proactive role for the National Care Standards Commission in encouraging the development of high quality part II services. I hope that the Opposition will be reassured by what I have said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Notwithstanding the Minister's somewhat churlish remarks at the start of his speech, which related largely to the previous debate, I am grateful to him. I am sorry that he feels probed excessively during the course of the day; I hope that it does not cause him any unnecessary discomfort.

<P>
I am not only disappointed, but surprised by the Minister's comments in relation to the star rating scheme. The amendment was not tabled with any genuine expectation that the Government would Mr. Hammond<P>
accept it, but I expected to hear some kind words about such schemes, and thought that he might suggest a general enthusiasm on the part of the Government.

<P>
I want to underline something said by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre that I omitted to say initially, but it is probably the most important point of all. If properly put together, the star rating scheme focuses on the delivery of care rather than the achievement of certain physical standards. The Minister will expect that theme to recur when we reach clause 22. As a result of this debate and of issues raised on Second Reading, I hope that the Government will acknowledge the widespread cross-party feeling that some form of star rating scheme, to put some objectivity into the measurement of establishments' quality, is necessary. I hope that the Government will give due weight to that feeling in the future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister has tackled the two points that I raised, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was going to suspend the Committee at 5.30, but shall do so now to give the usual channels the opportunity to work out precisely how we shall manage the business for the rest of the evening. It is clear that there are conflicting and genuine pressures, and I want to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to resolve them. I hope that they do so as amicably and courteously as they normally do.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 5, line 16, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Commission shall have the general duty of assuring the quality of excepted services provided in England.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 58

<P>
Amendment No. 128, in page 5, line 37, leave out `provision of'.

<P>
Amendment No. 130, in page 6, line 5, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, having due regard to the size of the hospital and the scope and extent of treatment it undertakes.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government new clause 23-Co-operative working.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The presence of Government amendment No. 58 will be the focal point of our discussion on this group of amendments. If it were not included, we would have a different type of discussion about the amendments that we have tabled. Our amendments have been tabled in a spirit of genuine co-operation and are designed to improve the Bill, with all their imperfections, which the Government are in a far stronger position than we are to point out. Our amendments will take a great deal less time to debate than they would otherwise.

<P>
Government amendment No. 58 removes the Lords amendments, which were debated at length and are of considerable significance. We do not support the amendment because in our early efforts under clause 1 to defend our position in favour of a uniform regulation of both public and private health care, which we believe that the Bill creates the opportunity to introduce, we were soundly rebuffed. To use an analogy from military warfare, this is the trench to which we have fallen back and from which we feel strongly we must defend the amended wording proposed by their lordships.

<P>
We are supported in that view by, among others, the British Medical Association, which is of the view that the role of the Commission for Health Improvement is important in ensuring equity between public and independent health care establishments. The BMA is of the view that the Commission for Health Improvement's role in ensuring a uniform inspection process would help ensure public confidence. That important point is worth mentioning.

<P>
The Government's amendments would overturn the decisions made in another place about the contracting of the Commission for Health Improvement for inspection. We have the residual concern that, without those amendments, the standard of the inspection of health care establishments would be uneven. We question the Government's logic in that they are willing for a common inspection and regulatory regime to be in place for residential care, so that residential care provided by a local authority and privately provided residential care are inspected and regulated uniformly, but do not accept the same logic applying to health care.

<P>
The consequences are that, while independent health care establishments will receive a thorough and professional process of regulation and inspection under the Bill and of which the BMA is fully in favour, none the less the NHS health care establishments will remain unregulated. We fear that that could result in second-class treatment being available to those who depend on the use of NHS health care establishments. It is an illogical stance for the Government to be taking and one that is wholly inconsistent with their view of residential care. That is why we are fighting the battle from the trenches.

<P>
Amendment No. 118 would simply bring to the Bill a general duty of ensuring quality of the accepted services of medical and psychiatric services. It is part of our endeavours to achieve a level playing field and a quality assurance that those services are properly part of the regulatory function of the National Care Standards Commission. Amendment No. 128 would make a small drafting change and would delete ``provision of'' from subsection (8). Those words are unnecessary. Surely the definition of accepted services themselves and not their provision should be the subject of the subsection. However, we could have misunderstood matters.

<P>
Amendment No. 130 would introduce regard for the different size of establishments. That is important because there is such a variation in the size of hospitals and health care establishments that there is a danger of taking the wrong measurements to different establishments, which may pursue different types of work. Obviously, there are big differences between, say, teaching hospitals, district general hospitals and hospices. We must compare like with like. We would argue about comparing the private and public sectors like with like. It would be wrong to make assessments about, and comparisons with, the type of work undertaken in a teaching hospital and that undertaken in a very small health care unit. That is the purpose of our amendment.

<P>
New clause 23 deals with the practical role of cross-inspection between the National Care Standards Commission inspectors and the inspectors made available through the Commission for Health Improvement. It is designed to create interdependence on the inspection process, which is fine in theory, but it goes nowhere near substituting for the power of the amendments that were introduced in the other place on a comprehensive uniform inspection regime throughout both public and private health care establishments. The temptation would be great to avoid such cross-referral. If two different organisations attempted to undertake the same work, there will be some fear of duplication and of the work being judged by slightly different standards. In practice, therefore, the inspectors will seek to concentrate on what is intended as their mainline activity, and resist being drawn into the process of cross-referral. The fundamental weakness of new clause 23 is that it leaves NHS hospitals unregulated. That is why we object to the removal of the amendments tabled in the other place.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government seem to be taking an extraordinary position. They are the manager and regulator of the NHS, but are not immune to problems within the service, which, as they should accept, should be independently inspected. We do not understand the resistance to uniform regulation of public and private health care. In the debate in another place, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath expressed his concern that, given the increasing tendency for NHS patients to move from an NHS setting to a private setting, especially in intermediate care, the Government have a duty to assure those patients' care standards as they pass from the NHS into the private sector. The only way to do so with confidence is to introduce uniform regulation.

<P>
We thought that the Minister had come close to accepting that principle during Health questions on Tuesday. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) cited an example of people being moved from NHS units to private nursing homes. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Should there be any suggestion that people should vacate NHS beds and move to units that do not maintain the same standards, many of us, as we would not accept that for members of our own families, would not accept it for our constituents.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My hon. Friend is exactly right, and neither would we. That will not happen.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the only way to ensure that that does not happen is to have uniform regulation across public and private health care establishments. He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When those new services are developed, we shall make clear the specification that we expect in return for the investment  Let me make it clear to her  that there is no question of the new intermediate care services being in any way second tier or second class.-[Official Report, 6 June 2000; Vol. 351, c.153.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To ensure that that does not happen, common regulation is imperative. Without it, no one can say with confidence that there will be no deviation in standards.

<P>
For those reasons, we shall dig in on the question of the amendments tabled in another place. Having had our logic rebuffed during discussion of clause 1, and given the inconsistency of its acceptance in relation to residential care, we have no alternative. We are not alone in our view. We are supported by the BMA, and an interesting angle has been provided by the Royal College of Nursing, which has drawn attention to a particular aspect of nursing in a public health care setting and a private health care setting. The Royal College of Nursing is concerned that the new structure might encourage social care and health care to polarise further and that quality levels might diverge if public health care develops according to a set of standards different from those applied in private health care. Patients who depend on both public and private nursing care might increasingly lose confidence in the service that they receive. The college argues strongly that the inspectorates should have a nursing presence to ensure that standards are adequately maintained or made as consistent as possible across the different providers.

<P>
We are not alone in taking the view that there is a substantial danger that standards in unregulated NHS provision will become second rate, and that is why we argue for fair treatment of patients, whether they are in public or private health care establishments. We need the uniform regulation and the common inspection regime that their Lordships fought long and hard to include in the Bill. We are sorry that the Government are making efforts to remove that, and we will strongly resist those efforts.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In some ways, we have already debated the issue. I will not apologise for the fact that we will probably debate it several more times, because that is the only way for the Opposition to register their points. Although I can imagine what it must be like to sit and listen to the same arguments time and again, it is nevertheless important to make those arguments. Many Government Members will know exactly what I mean, because they were in opposition for many years.

<P>
I make no apology for repeating some of the points that I made on Tuesday and for underlining some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Meriden. She rightly talks-using a wartime analogy-about defending the trenches. My noble Friend Lord Clement-Jones dug the trench in the Lords. I pay tribute to his diligent work in pursuing several issues that needed to be raised, although, to be fair, the Mr. Burstow<P>
Under-Secretary in the other place responded adequately to many of his concerns.

<P>
As I said on Second Reading, much effort has been made to seek consensus wherever possible. I regret that we have not been able to reach consensus. There are principled and practical reasons for establishing a single inspection system for the health care sector. The Committee explored some of those reasons today and in its second sitting, but we still have serious concerns about some of the changes that the Government are rightly introducing to intermediate care and about whether extended use of nursing homes for other NHS purposes will be inspected.

<P>
In response to an earlier debate, the Minister gave the welcome assurances that the National Care Standards Commission would have a role relating to clinical standards and that the inspection teams would include someone with medical experience. However, given the recognition that such skills will have to deployed to inspect nursing homes and will be needed to inspect the private sector, it is hard to find a logical rather than an ideological argument to justify the position. For most aspects of care dealt with in the Bill, it is legitimate to argue that it does not matter who runs the services, because they will be inspected and regulated through the same system. That is now said with respect to boarding schools, residential homes and domiciliary care-and it is absolutely right. However, why cannot the same principle and practices be extended to the independent health sector?

<P>
In view of the limited pool of expertise and skills available adequately to set, inspect and monitor standards across the sector, it is an unnecessary encumbrance to establish the sort of procedures in Government new clause 23-an elaborate system of checks and controls that give the Secretary of State the power to decide whether the Commission for Health Improvement will play a role in supporting the National Care Standards Commission in its work.

<P>
In the early stages of this Parliament, the previous Secretary of State often referred to the Berlin wall, though it fell out of fashion after a while. The phrase was appropriate then and it applies now to the establishment of this regime of inspection. A Berlin wall is being created between the NHS system and the independent health care system. That wall should be torn down in order to achieve consistency and assurance of standards right across the board.

<P>
I regret that the Government are minded to remove from the Bill amendments that their noble Lordships decided were appropriate and necessary. When the opportunity arises, I shall vote against the Government amendments. Even at this stage, I hope that the Government will reflect further-if not on what the Opposition are saying, on the views of people outside the Committee. If we cannot persuade the Minister of the justice, rightness and correctness of the cause and principles that we are espousing, she should listen to others outside. Many people are concerned that what is being set up will have to be revisited in due course. I hope that the Minister can tell us that the Government are still listening, learning and understanding on this issue.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart):</B> I rise to speak to Government amendment No. 58 and to introduce new clause 23. There have been many references to trench warfare and I am reminded of my noble Friend Lord Healey's first law of politics-when in a hole, stop digging. I hope that I can allow us to do so.

<P>
I shall start by demonstrating areas of confusion in the argument. The relationship between the National Care Standards Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement has been debated at length in another place and when we discussed clause 2. The complexities and subtleties of that relationship were used as a smokescreen to bring a misguided and inappropriate amendment to the Bill. Amendment No. 58 will overturn the subsections introduced into clause 7 by an earlier amendment. New clause 23 relates to the same issue and will address the working relationship of the National Care Standards Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement more effectively.

<P>
It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge express his concerns, on amendments Nos. 117 and 120, about mixing the role of regulators and improvers. We share those concerns and we have a clear duty, with respect to the NHS, to manage and improve. We see our clear duty with respect to other sectors as regulation.

<P>
The hub of the issue is that the commission and the Commission for Health Improvement will have certain common interests, which it is important to recognise, in the quality of health care. At the same time, there are substantial and significant differences between the two bodies. Their differences in fundamental purposes and roles revolve around the key principle of how their respective responsibilities for ensuring quality of care for patients is best achieved, and in how they will operate. Set against those differences is the need to live, co-operate and work closely.

<P>
The clumsy and blunt instrument of the subsections introduced into the clause by amendments in another place requiring the commission to contract all its inspections of independent hospitals to CHI does not recognise the subtleties of the relationship and would do nothing to help to foster it. I do not think that it helps people working in the NHS to describe it as an unregulated system that delivers an inferior service. It is also unfair to say that we manage the service arrogantly, assuming that it is not capable of improvement. That is the whole point of CHI-it is capable of improvement.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I would like to finish-we need to get the argument on the record. Let me clarify the different purposes and roles of the National Care Standards Commission and CHI. The latter was designed and developed to help the NHS to improve the quality of clinical care. Its primary interests are with NHS patients and the arrangement that NHS bodies have in place to ensure high-quality health care for those patients. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said so eloquently and robustly on Second Reading, the Government are responsible for the NHS, but not for the management of the private health care sector. As an extreme measure against an NHS trust, the Government could remove the trust board and the chief executive; is there any suggestion that we should take on that role in the private sector?

<P>
In connection with the Government's responsibility for the NHS, CHI has been established as an important part of our 10-year modernisation programme. It will help to drive up standards in the service by providing an independent external check of NHS processes for monitoring and assuring the quality of clinical care. I emphasise the fact that it will be independent. Any system that monitors and assesses a service sends powerful messages about what that service is expected to deliver. The commission will play an important role that will complement NHS accountability arrangements, ensuring that both quality and efficiency are central to the way in which the NHS is held to account. It will also provide organisations with access to the skills and expertise necessary to tackle problems when local efforts have been unable to make a difference. With the wider quality agenda, CHI's work will mean that fewer problems occur and that, when they do, they will be spotted and addressed earlier.

<P>
It is the responsibility of NHS regional offices and health authorities to ensure that the commission's recommendations are enacted and that there are agreed plans for addressing shortfalls. The commission may also have a role in following up specific recommendations, or be invited to review progress when the need for significant further work has been identified.

<P>
The National Care Standards Commission, on the other hand, is being established to provide and regulate safeguards and apply national minimum standards for patients in independent health care. It is not responsible for private hospitals and clinics, nor for advising the Government about the private sector or nurturing it.

<P>
The key principle of the way in which the National Care Standards Commission and CHI will achieve their respective responsibilities is the second main area of difference between the two bodies. The National Care Standards Commission is a regulatory body that will register independent health providers and inspect them against regulations and set standards. If an independent sector provider does not comply with the regulations and standards, the commission will be able to apply sanctions.

<P>
CHI, on the other hand, is not a registration-holding, sanction-imposing regulatory body. It will review the clinical governance arrangements in NHS bodies and will provide advice on how the arrangements might be improved. It will be vigorous, but it will also provide support to help NHS organisations with problems to tackle them effectively themselves.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister acknowledge that, in the model that she has just described, she cannot criticise my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden for describing the NHS as an unregulated service? That is precisely what it will be. CHI will be toothless; it will report back to the very managements that may be responsible for the problems that it is identifying. That is the opposite of a properly regulated service.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> CHI will report back. The regional offices and health authorities will have a function but, ultimately, Ministers are responsible and answerable for the NHS.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> For the dirt under the bed?

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to substantiate that assertion, I would be happy to take it up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My point is that it is unrealistic to say that Ministers sitting at desks in Whitehall are responsible for the standard of cleanliness or quality of food in individual hospitals. It is impossible for Ministers to operate such a centralised command and control system.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Health authorities and regional offices have a role but, when serious mistakes happen, CHI can move in to investigate on the special instructions of the Secretary of State. No one is hiding things that have gone wrong, as I thought was the implication of the hon. Gentleman's phrase about pushing dirt under the bed. We are answerable. The process is extremely accountable, which should not be overlooked or minimised, especially not by the party that always accuses us of not taking Parliament seriously enough.

<P>
The third key distinction between the National Care Standards Commission and CHI is the way in which they will operate in practice. When undertaking its three-year to four-year rolling programme of clinical governance reviews in the national health service, CHI will be concerned with the arrangement and systems of an NHS body to ensure and improve quality. When an NHS body has a contract with the independent sector to provide health care services to NHS patients, CHI will review the provisions in those contracts for assuring the quality of services that those patients receive as part of the bigger picture of the NHS body's clinical governance arrangements.

<P>
In contrast, the National Care Standards Commission will be responsible for inspecting, at least once a year, every independent health care provider that it regulates. It will concentrate and specialise on the specific safeguards and quality assurances that each of the individual providers has in place for all patients. Its remit will go beyond considering arrangements to provide quality in clinical care.

<P>
Those key differences between the National Care Standards Commission and CHI are why the relevant subsections of clause 7 are misguided and should be removed. That is the view of not only the Government, but many of those in the field who want the National Care Standards Commission to be established successfully. The April edition of Registered Homes & Services reflected those views. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at a practical level there are clear benefits in a broad-based NCSC. With private and voluntary healthcare outside its remit, Ms Stuart<P>
the skills and experience which will be developed within its Healthcare Division will suffer. In the long run, the quality of nursing and other healthcare delivered in nursing homes and a widening spectrum of social care settings will also suffer  a National Care Standards Commission which fully encompasses the regulation of both health and social care is essential.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
For those reasons, amendment No. 58 would remove subsections (8) to (11) from clause 7. However, the Government want to see the National Care Standards Commission and CHI work together closely. We recognise that, despite their differences, they also have common interests about the quality of care that patients receive. That is why we have tabled new clause 23, which will enable the two bodies to work together effectively. It recognises that their relationship calls for a considered and flexible approach that is simply not provided by the relevant subsections of clause 7, which would force the commission to delegate all its inspections of independent hospitals to CHI.

<P>
The new clause will provide the power for regulations to be introduced, enabling the National Care Standards Commission and CHI to arrange for their functions to be carried out by the other body if and when necessary in future. Those functions will be set out in regulations. In a world of rapidly moving developments in health care and its provision, that is the required type of flexibility of approach. The new clause recognises the common interests that the commission and CHI will have and will allow their relationship to grow and adapt in the most effective way as changing circumstances dictate. Unlike the current subsections of clause 7, it will not force either body to delegate its functions to the other body.

<P>
The approach makes sense and will produce the most effective results. I ask the Committee to agree to remove subsections (8) to (11) of clause 7 and to add new clause 23.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 118, 128 and 130 are largely concerned with the impact that the National Care Standards Commission will have on the quality of services provided in independent healthcare establishments, and the inspection arrangements that the commission will have in place for such establishments. New clause 23 and amendment No. 58 would also have an impact on those issues.

<P>
Amendment No. 118 seeks to place on the National Care Standards Commission the duty to assure the quality of independent health care services in England. I do not believe that the amendment is necessary or appropriate. Under the Bill's current provisions the independent health care providers that are regulated will have to meet requirements set out in regulations and national minimum standards. Under the provisions of clause 21(6)(k), all such providers will be required to demonstrate mechanisms for quality control and assurance in the health care that they provide. Those mechanisms and controls will have to be shown to be audited and reviewed. Rigorous testing of those processes by the commission will ensure that quality standards are met and maintained.

<P>
The commission's role in regulating independent health care will mean that providers who do not meet the quality of standards will be subject to the enforcement provisions of the Bill. In carrying out its regulatory functions, the commission will therefore be assuring quality in those private health care establishments. The amendment is not necessary as the function of the commission is to regulate private and voluntary health care and to ensure that the standards set are met.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall make one more attempt to draw the Minister's attention to what I see as the contradiction here. Would she not be tempted to think that where the National Care Standards Commission finds unacceptable practice in a private establishment, the best solution would be to report back to the managment or the head office, if it was a large corporation, and let it sort it out, thus mirroring exactly what she proposes the Commission for Health Improvement should do in that circumstance in the NHS?

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Under the regulatory function, if the commission finds anything that is seriously wrong it has a range of powers available. The most severe sanction would be to withdraw the regulatory certificate. I am not convinced that the function cannot be properly fulfilled within the commission. It should also be recognised that there is considerable overlap between the private sector and some NHS patients. CHI will also have a role and will look at it. That is why new clause 23 provides the flexibility for that interplay. It is a much more appropriate approach to a subtle relationship.

<P>
I turn briefly to amendment No. 130. In carrying out its regulatory responsibilities, the commission will also take account of the size and scale of each hospital, clinic and so on and the scope and extent of the treatment it provides. Proportionality will be an important principle in the commission's regulatory task. Indeed, it is one of the five key principles for better regulation identified by the better regulation task force to which we have said the commission will work. I have no problem with the intention behind the amendment, but it is not necessary.

<P>
Finally, amendment No. 128 is another drafting amendment. I cannot say for certain whether the hon. Member for Meriden is correct in proposing the change. However, if I can take the liberty of assuming that Government amendment No 58 will be carried, we not need to worry, as the relevant subsection will be removed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The problem with trench warfare is that one does not make a great deal of progress either way. One gets stuck in the trenches as shown by the Minister's response, graciously given though it was. For that reason I shall certainly vote against the amendment. The argument is still that the NHS, as a managed service, needs to be dealt with by a separate regime, but other publicly managed services need to benefit from a regulatory regime. We still have not clarified the arguments for that.

<P>
With the advent of pooled budgets and league commissioning and some of the other changes introduced in the National Health Service Act 1977, there will be more and more hybrid arrangements. Some social care providers, who will be regulated by the National Care Standards Commission, will also provide services that will be potentially under the remit of CHI. The Government have not yet understood our worries and when the opportunity arises, I shall certainly use my vote to back up that assertion.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Another feature of trench warfare is that, from time to time, when Christmas is approaching, people climb out of the trenches and play football-something that we might be about to do. I do not mind making a humorous allusion, because the point is not so serious as to make too much clear blue water between the Government and the Opposition.

<P>
I was reassured to hear the Minister refer to ``proportionality'' in relation to amendment No. 130. We accept his assurance that that is the guiding principle, and we shall not press it to a Division. Predictably, other amendments would fall if the Government were successful with their amendment No. 58, as we assume that they will be, given their significant firepower. I wish to pay particular tribute to Earl Howe, who pointed out diligently and at length the anomalies that would arise as a result of the provision, unless what was sought in the other place was allowed to remain in the Bill. However, clearly the Government do not accept that argument.

<P>
Having listened carefully to the presentation of new clause 23, I believe that the term ``toothless tiger'' applies most accurately to it. I am not given to cynicism, but it may be one of the ways in which the Government can assure the smooth passage of the Bill back through the other place. We do not object to the new clause in principle, but we do not consider that it will deliver all that the Government hope. It will certainly not be as potent as the amendments proposed in the other place would have been. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Further consideration adjourned-[Mr. Jamieson.]

Adjourned accordingly at twenty-eight minutes to Seven o'clock till Tuesday 13 June at half-past Ten o'clock.
