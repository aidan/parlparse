<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 4, line 30, at end insert--

<P>


<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(6A) Schedule (The Consumer Panel) makes further provision about the Consumer Panel.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss new schedule 1--The Consumer Panel--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Functions

<P>
1. The functions of the Consumer Panel are to include--

<P>
(a) advising the Authority on the appropriate degree of protection for consumers,

<P>
(b) considering how to make the financial system and markets more accessible, fair and efficient in the interests of consumers,

<P>
(c) advising the Authority on the development of the financial system and markets,

<P>
(d) referring proposals for changes in the financial system and markets to the Authority, and

<P>
(e) carrying out research.

<P>
2. The Consumer Panel may publish a copy of any research carried out by it under paragraph 1 in such a manner as it thinks fit.

<P>
Annual Reports

<P>
3. (1) The Consumer Panel shall make an annual report to the Authority on the discharge of its functions during the year to which the report relates.

<P>
(2) The Consumer Panel shall provide the Authority with such information relating to the discharge of its functions as the Authority sees fit.

<P>
(3) The Authority must publish a copy of any annual report made to it under sub-paragraph (1) in such a manner as it thinks fit.

<P>
Budget

<P>
4. The Authority may, to such extent as may be approved by the Treasury, defray or contribute towards the expenses of the Consumer Panel.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> We welcome the fact that the consumer panel will be put on a statutory basis under the Bill. The amendment would add a new schedule to place a duty on the consumer panel on a clearer statutory basis than is already allowed for, and would ensure that if fulfils certain minimum functions.

<P>
The amendment is intended not to be exhaustive, but to establish a reasonable remit for the consumer panel to follow. Ultimately, one of the Financial Services Authority's most important functions is the protection of consumers. I strongly consider myself to be a consumer, and perhaps it is good that I am present today to make that point. Unlike my hon. Friends the Members for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), who are very experienced in the field--I see some blushes--I struggle considerably with matters such as pensions.

<P>
Under the Bill as drafted, there is a real danger that the consumer panel could easily be sidelined, which we want to avoid. It could become a mere appendage rather than an important element of the authority. Clause 9 and its related schedule would allow for mechanisms to ensure that the panel has the credibility that it needs to operate effectively.

<P>
The consumer panel should have the statutory right to carry out its own research. New schedule 1 would provide that. Otherwise, the consumer panel may be dependent on the FSA for the flow of information on which it must deliberate. There has been much debate throughout this parliamentary Session about the importance of clear access to information.

<P>
I do not propose to speak at great length to the new schedule, because our intentions are clear. I hope that the Financial Secretary will agree that the consumer panel's inability to commission its own research would seriously compromise its effectiveness, and I look to her to assure the Committee that that will be within its powers.

<P>
The need for openness is paramount. If the FSA is able to keep the consumer panel's advice to itself, how will we know the extent to which the FSA acts on that advice? If we cannot be satisfied that the consumer panel will wield some clout in respect of the authority's thinking, it may as well not exist. Accordingly, the new schedule would enable the panel to publish an annual report, which would describe exactly what it had been doing throughout the year, and which could be viewed in conjunction with the authority's own action. Such a procedure would reassure us that the FSA was taking proper note of the consumer panel's advice, and in turn we would know that the consumer's interests were being properly represented.

<P>
The amendment is clearly a probing one which is intended to flag up important points arising from the sparse details in clause 9. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would expand on some of the matters that I have raised.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire) : Clause 9, which concerns the consumer panel, is important. It is therefore vital that, in debating it, the Treasury Ministers should take the opportunity to explain the function of consumers.

<P>
One of our first questions should be: who are consumers? It is not easy to answer that. Indeed, the more I ponder it the more I wonder to what extent consumers include professionals. They certainly ought to include professionals as well as amateurs.

<P>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr Cotter) described himself as a consumer. I have not looked up his background; therefore, I apologise for not knowing in what capacity--other than a Member of Parliament like myself--he counts himself as a consumer.

<P>
I am a consumer of financial services to some degree, as I usually go to an independent financial adviser when buying a pension. I did so as a barrister. The Government rightly expected me, like other self-employed people, to save for my old age, so I sought appropriate advice.

<P>
However, were I appointed to the consumer panel, I would be floundering. That is because my experience of consulting an independent financial adviser would lead to exchanges such as the following. "Where should I buy my pension?" I might ask. My financial adviser would say: "You should have a bit of Scottish Widows and a bit of Standard Life". In response, I might ask: "Should I have a pension with Equitable Life as they do not charge a commission?"

<P>
That will not be good enough on the consumer panel, if it is to consist only of people who have no personal knowledge. The Bill draws together all the different financial services. Presumably, therefore, the consumer panel should consist of consumers who can produce some useful input on the vast majority, if not all, of the areas covered by the Bill.

<P>
Having taken advice in preparation for debate on this clause, we focused on pensions, the purchase of unit trusts, the more complex areas of corporate finance--which will be regulated under the Bill--and banking. Many of us are consumers of banking services; however we are not sufficiently well qualified to ensure that the interests of consumers are adequately represented.

<P>
That brings me to clause 9(5), which states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority must appoint to the Consumer Panel such consumers--"

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the right hon. and learned Gentleman. However, he is straying into matters relating to amendment No 88 or the clause stand part debate. New schedule 1 is narrow in scope, and relates to the consumer panel's functions and annual report. Should Committee members wish to broaden debate on this group of amendments, I shall bear that in mind when we come to the stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> As I quoted those words from clause 9(5), I wondered whether I would provoke you into calling me to order, Mr. Atkinson. However, I did not intend to stray out of order, and, of course, I accept your ruling. I referred to clause 9(5) to introduce the functions of the consumer panel, which are the subject of new schedule 1. I hope I am not being disingenuous, but that was why I mentioned it. Clause 9(5) relates, as I said, to the statutory duties of the authority and, after all, the purpose of new schedule 1 is to supplement clause 9(5).

<P>
Amendment No. 90 was selected in preference to amendment  No.  89. It states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6A) Schedule (The Consumer Panel) makes further provision about the Consumer Panel".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That brings us solidly back to the firm and not marshy ground of new schedule 1 and enables me to make my point. The functions of the consumer panel are defined as

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"advising the Authority on the appropriate degree of protection for consumers"

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"considering how to make the financial system and markets more accessible",

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
which is more a matter of education. The consumer panel is also to advise on the development of the system and changes to it, and to carry out research. I commend all those suggestions and I commend the idea that the consumer panel should make annual reports.

<P>
That raises questions for the Minister to answer. First, is she in favour in principle of such activity by the consumer panel? Secondly, if it is to carry out research, will there be funding? Research cannot be undertaken with no finding at all. I am not suggesting large sums. The sums disposed of by financial services businesses, which will be regulated by the Act, are massive: sensible research justifies appropriate funding.

<P>
I return to the key point about the amendment and the new schedule. I know that the Minister will have thought about this--if not, it will be because she has a lot on her plate. The Treasury and FSA ought to be thinking carefully about, and responding to--if not instantly, on the next occasion when an opportunity arises--our debate on the structure that the Bill is creating.

<P>
Let us examine pensions. Who will be competent to advise the authority on the appropriate degree to consumer protection? Will it be an intelligent person who may have brought a pension through an independent financial adviser?  If independent financial advisers purchase pensions from providers, is the independent financial adviser in that context a consumer? Or is he prevented from being a consumer because he may be an authorised person in another context? That is one of our worries.

<P>
Someone could be an authorised person in one area of financial services and still be a provider. The independent financial adviser who obtains my pension will decide where my annual single premium should go--to Scottish Widows rather than Scottish Life--and will receive commission. That makes him more a provider than a consumer. In taking decisions about whether to opt for one life assurance house or another, he is also a representative of the consumer. Can such people be included in the consumer panel, or can anyone who knows what they are talking about be disqualified from speaking up on the consumer's behalf? I cannot believe that we want that. Equally, we do not want the consumer panel to be a cosy club of professionals who make life more satisfactory for themselves but leave the consumer unprotected.

<P>
Let us consider the example of unit trusts. I have never bought a unit trust, but I could have done and used my bank as the intermediary. I would have been the consumer in that I purchased the unit trust. If I wanted to buy a unit trust today, I would probably go to a stockbroker or to his current equivalent. Someone gives me that type of advice and I think that he is called an investment adviser. He is probably an independent financial adviser, but, because I pay such close attention to these matters, I do not remember whether he is regulated by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): He would be regulated by the Personal Investment Authority.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who says that he would be regulated by the PIA. However, is the chap who buys my stocks and shares--such as I have any--regulated by the PIA?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> No, by the Securities and Futures Authority.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Everyone will be regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and it is important to find suitable representatives for consumers. I am rapidly talking myself out of that job by showing that my knowledge is incomplete.

<P>
The member of the Securities and Futures Authority who would advise me on the purchase of a unit trust might be suitable to stand in the shoes of the consumer on the consumer panel. Does the Minister accept that, or will such a person be disqualified because he is a professional and approaches the subject from a different angle?

<P>
Let us consider another example. The consumer of corporate financial advice is probably represented by the Confederation of British Industry. Businesses receive corporate financial advice and are provided with corporate financial services. Therefore, someone nominated by the CBI might be an appropriate person to sit on the consumer panel to deal with corporate finance issues. What does the Minister think about that suggestion?

<P>
If one considered the subject off the top of one's head, one would go to the Consumers Association and ask it to provide someone to represent consumers. People gain the benefits of pensions when they are old, so one could also ask Age Concern to nominate someone. I do not pooh-pooh such ideas; they are part of the approach and such broad-brush representation of consumers will be necessary.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is again straying from the subject. He is considering the membership of the panel, which is not dealt with in new schedule 1.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. I thought that I was dealing with the appropriate degree of protection for consumers. If they are to have adequate protection, they must be represented by people who have some nous.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is most ingenious, but he should wait for a more appropriate amendment to consider that aspect of membership.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I accept that, Mr. Atkinson, and I will do my best to steer myself firmly back to the new schedule. I am not seeking to stray away from it, because I want to tease out answers to real questions about the functioning of the consumer panel. They are real questions, so the Minister will probably confound me by providing beautiful answers to them. However, if they are not answered, they will need to be addressed.

<P>
Paragraph 1(b) of the proposed new schedule states that one of the functions of the consumer panel would be to consider

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"how to make the financial system and markets more accessible, fair and efficient in the interests of consumers".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Paragraph 1(c) states that another function would be to advise

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on the development of the financial system".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I believe that the consumer panel has a role to play in those matters. Does the Financial Secretary agree that they would be appropriate functions? How does she think that the panel would set about fulfilling those functions, and what sort of people would she imagine on the panel if it were to do so?

<P>
I shall recapitulate my argument and draw to a close. We need to know whether the Financial Secretary is in favour of amplifying the panel's functions in the proposed way and whether she agrees that it would be desirable for the panel to produce annual reports on the discharge of its functions. Also, if she agrees that the panel should be able to carry out research, what sort of research does she think would be appropriate and how will the panel be enabled to carry it out?

<P>
How large will the consumer panel be in order to fulfil its functions?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is talking himself out of a clause stand part debate. Other parts of the clause deal with membership, and if we continue, there will not be a clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I would not want that to happen so I shall not continue in that line. I simply direct my questions to the Financial Secretary and look forward to her answers.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare for tabling the amendment and the new schedule. He said that he did so in the spirit of probing amendments to tease out some of the Government's views on the subject, which he is right to say is an important part of the legislation.

<P>
I do not have any objection in principle to the tone of what is set out in new schedule 1. However, as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I have said in Committee, we are concerned that to add to the detail of what the panel can do might cast doubt on whether it should also do things that are not listed. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare made it clear that that was not his intention, but I am concerned that it might be the effect.

<P>
The matters referred to in paragraph 1(a) to (d) of the proposed new schedule are already covered, as they relate to matters of interest and concern to consumers. However, unless such matters are in some way limited to ones with a consumer angle, I am not sure that the consumer panel will always be able to perform those functions.

<P>
It is also not clear that the matters referred to are entirely within the competence of the FSA as regulator. For example, many developments in the market will be commercially driven and therefore will not be under the FSA's control.

<P>
The other proposals for the panel to be able to commission and publish research and for it to produce an annual report for the FSA are not necessary. The Bill does nothing to prevent the panel form taking such action, so express permission is not required in the statute.

<P>
Finally, I note that paragraph 4 of the new schedule requires the Treasury to give its consent to the FSA before it can incur expenditure on funding for the consumer panel.  That requirement would concur with the general thinking behind the fee-raising powers conferred on the FSA and the accountability arrangements which provide checks on the FSA's actions, including expenditure.

<P>
We carefully considered the matter raised by the Joint Committee report on funding. Our response to the Committee noted that we had introduced a requirement that the FSA should take into account the consumer panel's representations, which will, of course, include representations on funding. The suggestions made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare do not add anything to the Bill, although I understand the thinking that lies behind his amendment. I am grateful to him for raising the matter, but his proposal is unnecessary.

<P>
I am aware of your injunctions to keep in order, Mr Atkinson, so I shall not comment at length on the panel's ability to assess the protection of consumers, an important matter raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell).

<P>
Clause 9 requires the consumer panel to be representative of consumers whom the Bill defines as not including authorised persons. Clause 9 does not prevent an authorised person from representing the interests of consumers; it will enable the FSA to establish the panel and give it the flexibility to do so.

<P>
I hope that I have convinced the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare to withdraw his amendments.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I was listening carefully to the Minister, but I have not found the necessary definition. Is she saying that the Bill prevents consumers from being authorised persons? I did not understand what she was saying.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The definition is in clause 9(7), which states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'Consumers' means persons other than authorised persons, who use, or are or may be contemplating using, services provided by authorised persons in the course of carrying on regulated activities."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It does not mean that authorised persons may not be members of the Panel; it is for the FSA to use flexibility that we have given them. I do not want to tie the hands of the FSA in making its arrangements; in some circumstances it is unlikely that unauthorised persons under the definition in the Act will be members of the panel, but we have not tied the hands of the FSA in that regard.

<P>
As I said, I hope that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare--

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester) : Frankly, I do not understand what the Minister has said. As I read clause 9(7)--

<P>
<B>The Chairman :</B> Order. To keep the Chair happy, hon. Members should wait until the debate on clause stand part before they pursue other parts of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B>  I thank the Financial Secretary for her usual courteous and clear comments. She clearly said that she had no objection in principle to what is set out in schedule 1, the detail of which is most important. The debate is also important if the operation of the FSA is unsatisfactory, or problems arise.

<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire spoke about funding and about the panel having a wide remit. I say in response to the Financial Secretary that funding is important. The panel must be able to conduct its own research and I hope that she will consider that. I do not accept that the requirement for an annual report should not be set down in tablets of stone; that is necessary to ensure that there is openness and that people know that the panel is doing its job.

<P>
Having said that, I thank the Financial Secretary for considering the point. I hope that she has taken it on board. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "using," to end of line 33 and add

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"financial services of any kind.".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The context of the amendment is the broad scope of the Bill--a scope that is not entirely set out within it, but which extends to secondary legislation. That scope can be widened, in the light of problems, changing circumstances and experience. The FSA will therefore need antennae to detect and understand what is happening in consumer affairs and to be alerted to the fact that things may need to change. One of the roles of the consumer panel should be to carry out research to identify where problems may arise so that it can forewarn the FSA. As the clause stands, the activities of the consumer panel are confined to 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"services provided by authorised persons in the course of carrying out regulated activities."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The consumer panel is therefore precluded from investigating such things as mortgages, credit unions, long-term-care insurance, general insurance and other financial services that are currently outside the definition of regulated activities. However, it is in those spheres that monitoring would be most valuable. Defining the services used by consumers as "financial services of any kind" would enable the consumer panel to carry out research in a wide range of activities not currently included under the regulatory authority of the FSA and to make a case for including them under the secondary legislation. That is the aim of the amendment. That widening of the definition, although not congruent with the FSA's own responsibilities, is paralleled in the Bill by the range of activities given to the ombudsman, for example. It also has a precedent in the wider range of activities that the PIA consumer panel dealt with, for similar reasons. The amendment has the support of the three main consumer organisations, the Consumer Association, the National Consumer Council and the consumer panel of the FSA.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford for giving me the opportunity to clarify the representative role of the consumer panel. I understand why he tabled the amendment, but I hope to give him reassurances that will persuade him to withdraw it.

<P>
The effect of my hon. Friends amendments would be that members of a consumer panel would have to be representative of consumers of all financial services. The current definition in legislation is similar to that in clause 5, which sets out the FSA's consumer protection objectives. In both cases, consumers are defined as those using or contemplating using services that are regulated activities--that is to say, activities included in an order under clause 20 and subject to the Bill's core regulatory regime. In addition, clause 9 excludes from the definition of consumer those who use financial services but are themselves authorised under the Bill, and whose interests should be represented by the practitioner panel under clause 8.

<P>
The amendment would provide that, as well as representing users of regulated financial services, the panel would need to represent the interests of people using financial services that we do not currently intend to bring within the regulatory regime--for example, consumer credit or general insurance brokering services.

<P>
I understand my hon. Friend's point in that there could indeed be a case for this, because some of the FSA's responsibilities, notably those relating to public awareness, affect the public in general. That is along the lines of what my hon. Friend had in mind. However, as it is unlikely that such people will also use regulated services, the amendment is unlikely in practice to have a real impact. I understand fully why my hon. Friend raised the matter, but I hope that I have reassured him that his amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, which largely covers the point that under the provision as drafted an investigation would not be precluded. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I hope that I am out of the bog and on firmer ground in pursuing the question of which I gave notice, whether within, or outside the rules of order.

<P>
Clause 9(7) defines consumers as

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons, other than authorised persons, who use, or are or may be contemplating using, services provided by authorised persons in the course of carrying on regulated activities."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I understood the Minister to say that the fact that someone was an authorised person would not prevent him from being a member of the consumer panel, but I may have misunderstood. My reading of the subsection inclines me to think that it would prevent a person from being on the consumer panel even though he stood in the shoes of consumers. The Minister helpfully shakes her head, to give me to understand that she thinks that it is all right, that an authorised person could nonetheless be a member of a panel, looking after consumers' interests, notwithstanding that wording. I am comforted by that because it is desirable in the right circumstances. However, I ask the hon. lady and those who advise her to think again about this, simply to satisfy themselves that it can have that meaning because my first impression--and I am willing to change my view--is that an authorised person would not be a consumer. A person may get in as a representative of a consumer notwithstanding that he is not a consumer, perhaps under clause 9(5), which states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority must appoint to the Consumer Panel such consumers, or persons representing the interests of consumers, as it considers appropriate."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That could be widened to let in authorised people as representatives of the consumer, albeit not consumers themselves. If that were the case--and, my goodness, this sounds like real Pepper v Hart country--so be it. There is an argument for clarifying under a future amendment exactly what will be permitted. We have already had a stab at it, although I cannot remember whether the raft of amendments that I tabled last night and which will appear on the blue pages of today's Order Paper also contain a suitable suggestion.

<P>
I want to re-explain the points on which I may have strayed a little out of order, when the Minister was understandably anxious not to join me in that quagmire, and say how the panel should work in practice. Those representing pensioners--one of the most important groups of consumers--must have real experience of purchasing pensions. Some can be highly intelligent people who have had pensions bought for them, but there is much to be said for having someone on the consumer panel who really understands how pensions are purchased.

<P>
The pensions industry has been a mystery to most of the public for most of my adult life--as it has been to me, even though I am a reasonably intelligent, legally qualified consumer. The first question that a self-employed person had to ask himself was whether he would buy a pension on a continuing contract--in other words, whether he would agree to spend £500 a year on a pension for five, 10, 15, or 20 years or whether he would buy a one-off single pension. The theoretical advantage of entering into a contract was that one might receive a better rate of return.

<P>
A disadvantage was that the first year's contribution usually went completely in charges and that if a person did not keep the contract going for at least seven to 10 years, he never got his money back. If someone entered a pensions contract, but stopped after about three years because he wanted to freeze it or wanted to get back his contributions, he would find that there was very little to get back. The advantage of buying a one-off annual pension was that one would pay only 5 per cent. in charges and all the rest went into investments, although there might be charges thereafter.

<P>
I do not want to witter on about such points, but they illustrate the difficult questions that consumers will face, and I have mentioned only self-employed consumers. Those chosen by the Treasury or the FSA as being appropriate for the panel need to be selected with care. They cannot just be the wives or husbands of the supposedly great and good who may have some intelligent interest in the matter. They must have something real to contribute from the consumer side. That is even more so in the case of sophisticated investments, such as unit trusts, securities, stocks and shares and futures--the futures part of the Securities and Futures Authority--or asset management.

Surely, someone who has worked for Mercury Asset Management Group or another of the big asset management companies would be highly suitable to be a member of the consumers panel. Although, in one sense, those companies are providers, they are also very much consumers in that they are extremely genned up on the market. They could therefore represent the consumer. Other people similarly placed could represent the interests of practitioners. However, it is vital that the consumer panel should have a good mix and include some who are purely consumers--perhaps from the Consumers Association or Age Concern, or recommended by them--and others with genuine professional knowledge. I should be grateful if the Minister would illuminate that particular point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I wonder whether my right hon. and learned Friend has considered that appointments could be made by the Confederation of British Industry to represent big business. Such companies are the biggest consumers of financial products because they have their own pension funds on behalf for their employees. Those funds have invested many billions of pounds in the stock market, gilts and other forms of investment.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for suggesting that the CBI might have a contribution to make. I had forgotten to consider that in the context of the stand part debate, although I did mention it earlier. My hon. Friend draws the Minister's attention to an important aspect, and I adopt his sensible suggestion.

<P>
I have mentioned the CBI also as a consumer of corporate finance. That is another area that the Minister might want to consider. I look forward to her answers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, I am not clear about what is wanted of the consumer panel. The relatively narrow concept is that it should monitor whether the legislation achieves one of its key objectives--the protection of consumer interests. That is quite a defined role. The wider concept is that it should take a broad view of financial services--of whether customers are getting good value for money, whether the industry is meeting demand and so forth.

<P>
Under clause 9, it seems that the consumer panel can do what it wants, although, as has been pointed out, its membership is crucial. I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire that it will be quite difficult to get the right balance, but the panel should certainly include members of the industry that advises on those products, even though they may themselves be regulated.

<P>
Secondly, in connection with banking and related services, I am not entirely clear whether the territory of investment products, including pensions, is definable. The question of whether banks and banking charges are competitive is of great interest to consumers. The Bill obviously empowers the FSA to regulate the banking industry, but will the consumer panel's work overlap with the functions of the various competition bodies? At present, competition has been considered only in principle, but the panel would certainly be entitled to consider competition.

<P>
I would welcome the Minister's comments on the panel's brief. It has presumably been discussed with the FSA. The Bill pretty much gives the FSA carte blanche to say who it wants on the panel and what it wants from the panel.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall deal first with the issues raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. I think that I can reassure him. I hesitate to argue the legal point with him, but the wording of the clause is clear. Subsection (1) states that the panel must

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"represent the interests of consumers."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (5) will oblige the FSA to appoint consumers to the panel, but does not exclude others being appointed. That means that authorised people can be appointed even though they are not consumers as defined in subsection (7), so long as the panel as a whole is representative of consumer interests. Subsection (7) does not define who may or may not be eligible to become a member of the panel, but provides the definition of "consumer".

<P>
It is important to give the FSA the necessary flexibility under the clause. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire referred to who may or may not be appropriate members of the panel. Various organisations were canvassed, and it is important to consider the many views that exist. I understand his view that the panel should include members who have hands-on experience of such matters. The existing consumer panel contains a wide variety of experience. I shall circulate to all members of the Committee details of the existing panel's composition and some brief biographies that list the experience of those involved. The right hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members will be impressed by the wide range of experience represented on that panel.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked some general questions about the function and nature of the panel. Clearly, we are not creating an umbrella body that would represent the interests of consumers generally and act as a substitute for the  existing organisations that represent consumers, such as the Consumers Association and the National Consumer Council. Those bodies have made important responses to the Treasury's and the FSA's consultation exercises, and I hope that they will continue to do so.

<P>
The purpose of the panel is to give the FSA access to people with an understanding of the difficulties faced by ordinary consumers and to ensure that it is aware of the impact of its actions on relevant consumers. Putting the panel on a statutory footing underlines the Government's commitment to ensuring that the FSA is answerable to those affected by its actions, but it is not our intention to create a supervisory body or a panel to which the FSA board is in some way subservient.

<P>
The clause is designed to place what is, after all, an already existing panel on a statutory footing. We are using the Bill to ensure that the panel is capable of performing appropriate functions and that it is--and remains--properly representative of consumers.

<P>
The panel exists to help the FSA to perform its regulatory functions in accordance with its statutory duties. Subsection (4) places a duty on the FSA to have regard to the panel's representations. It is an important clause, which I commend to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I thank the Minister for her helpful explanation. I agree that the words in clause 9(5)

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or persons representing the interests of consumers"

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
clearly show that that can be someone who is not within the consumer definition and that there is nothing to say that he cannot be an authorised person. I am satisfied with what the Minister has said. If the FSA thinks it right to have a certain number of professionals who represent consumers, they can do so. That is extremely comforting and I am grateful that a list of the current panel will be circulated, and we look forward to seeing it.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<P>
Amendment No. 71 refers to "regulatory objectives" and the merits or otherwise of separating the roles of the chairman and the chief executive. We have already had a long debate on those subjects. The clause is about reviews, and to use the analogy of the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire, if the Committee goes that way, it will be going into boggy ground.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I shall do my best not to stray, but I am sure that you will let me know if I do, Mr. Atkinson.

<P>
The clause is crucial because if there are serious problems with the FSA a couple of years down the line, there is a chance of sorting them out in a very public way. The amendments would do several things. First, they would ensure that reviews of the FSA's work are undertaken. Secondly, reviews would be carried out by an independent body that is seen to be so. Thirdly, the reviews would be carried out in such a way as to maximise accountability to Parliament, as covered by amendment No. 104. Fourthly, the review would be concerned not only with economy, efficiency and effectiveness, but with general policy and principles in pursuing regulatory objectives. Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 cover those points and are the reason behind the need to delete clause 10(3), as suggested in amendment No. 72. Fifthly, we want to ensure that at least once there is a thorough review of whether we have managed to get the legislation right, which is the purpose of amendment No. 70. Sixthly, several crucial questions, which have already been addressed, can be revisited in a review. The purpose of amendments Nos. 71, 99 and 105 is the need to consider objectives and principles and to see whether the balance between the two is right; to decide whether the role of chief executive and chairman should be divided; and the need to re-examine that issue and the relationship between this Bill and devolution, taking into account the industry in Scotland. We need to find a means of ensuring that there is a review and downward pressure on fees, as referred to in amendment No. 99.

<P>
I shall not go through all of these in detail, but I should like to begin by clarifying one crucial question on which we all need to agree. Is there a need for a comprehensive and tough review procedure of the Bill? We need to remind ourselves what the Bill entails as we are taking a far-reaching step here. Huge power is being given to a new institution and it is not yet clear what, if any, checks and balances will counterweigh that power. A strong review procedure would do something to provide a counterweight. Its very existence would probably influence the actions of the FSA and act as a restraint on it.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Having a review might seem a  fairly reasonable suggestion, but the Bill does not provide for it. It says:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Treasury may appoint an independent person to conduct a review".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
However, it may decide not to. It is up to it. The clause is an enabling  clause. Any doubt about that is removed by the explanatory memorandum, which says on page 10:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This clause provides that the Treasury can commission independent reviews".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Indeed, the Treasury can do just about what it likes under the clause. Not only can it decide whether to have a review in subsection (1), it can decide to limit the scope of the review in subsection (2). Subsection (3) specifically excludes the opportunity for a fundamental review such as I suggested a moment ago, even on a one-off basis.

<P>
As the Treasury is paying for the reviews under subsection (6), I cannot believe that it would be eager for anything too exhaustive by way of review. Some may find that remark flippant, but I do not think that it is. There will thus be an added pressure on the Treasury not to have too big a review. Nor is the independence of the reviewer guaranteed. The Treasury can decide what "independence" means. Subsection (7) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'Independent' means appearing to the Treasury to be independent of the Authority."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That says a great deal about the extent to which the Bill hands power to the Treasury.

<P>
The enabling provisions amount to an unacceptable level of discretion in the hands of the Treasury, and we must find ways to limit it. I hope that the Minister will concede that reviews should take place, not merely when the Treasury decides but even when the Treasury and Treasury Ministers might not necessarily find it expedient to have one. I also hope that she will concede that leaving the scope of the review entirely in the hands of the Treasury cannot be satisfactory and nor will the industry consider it satisfactory.

<P>
As the clause is drafted, the terms of reference of a review could be framed so narrowly that almost everything of concern to the industry could be excluded, even if much of the industry were screaming for the Government to think again on a particular point. That cannot be right. I expect that the Minster will shortly say that the FSA is accountable to the Treasury and the Treasury is accountable to Parliament. She will also point out that we have consumer panels and practitioner forums to assist with the review process as the Bill is put into force.

<P>
The Government have conceded some form of review--the clause was a concession after consultation--but their concession starts to crumble a little as one looks at it. Does the Minister really not agree that far too much power has been left in the hands of the Treasury and that that is unacceptable in itself? Do we not have the real risk of the appearance, but not the reality of accountability? Is it not true that, as the Bill stands, the consumer and practitioner panels have serious shortcomings regarding who is appointed to them? On clause 9, we discussed who would be on the consumer panel. There is a question over who will chair the panels. How much notice the FSA and the Treasury will need to take of the panels' recommendations is unclear. The chain of accountability from the FSA and the Treasury to Parliament is weak as it does away with questions on the Floor of the House. We need something stronger for such a body.

<P>
How can we get something better? That is where amendment No. 104 comes in. It concerns who should conduct reviews, and suggests that the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office should take that role. The Comptroller and Auditor General made a bid for the job in his written evidence to the Joint Committee. Several of his points were germane to the amendments. He questioned whether the Government's commitment would satisfy those who feel that there should be independent scrutiny of the FSA's performance. He also noted, not surprisingly, that giving the job to the Comptroller and Auditor General would 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"bring the necessary authority and independence to the role of independent assessor and would be well placed"--

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
that is, he would be well placed--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to report on the Authority's performance against its statutory objectives."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I agree with him, as does the industry.

<P>

<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why there should be a change to the power to appoint a wide range of people to conduct a review, including from well-known firms of consultants or accountants? Why should that freedom be limited, with the choice of the Comptroller and Auditor General built into the Bill, thereby excluding everyone else?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> There is something to that point. Were the NAO to be given a basic role in conducting the fundamental review, it would be open to it to bring in other bodies that it felt had a role to perform.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> That is exactly the Treasury's current position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not really taken my point. I am suggesting that giving such a power--the power to delegate the job entirely to the Treasury--is a different kettle of fish from giving it to a body that Parliament is confident is independent.

<P>
One cannot compare the Treasury and the independence of Treasury Ministers with the NAO's role--Treasury Ministers have a Government to run and a party political agenda to pursue. The NAO is, and has been seen to be, unimpeachably independent. It has the power to produce reports which go to the Public Accounts Committee. It can provide a more thorough and detailed form of parliamentary scrutiny than the proposed system. I note that building societies and friendly societies are already audited by the NAO. That is a limited form of audit, but the NAO is already involved in part of the industry.

<P>
I hope that the Government will have the opportunity to consider the proposal that the NAO be given the job. So far, they have rejected that suggestion, although I do not fully understand why. The NAO could be involved in several ways. One would be for it to have a thorough right of access to all papers. I notice that the Joint Committee did not approve that. Another idea would be to enable the NAO to produce periodic independent reports, at least on efficiency and economy, although they could be more wide-ranging. The NAO would also be capable of conducting value-for-money studies, and a study on the FSA of the sort to which other institutions are currently subject would have a great deal of merit.

<P>
The chairman of the FSA, Howard Davies, had a large hand in developing value-for-money studies when he was, I think, Controller of Audit at the Audit Commission. I do not think that he could object to value-for-money studies of his new institution, as they would mean the imposition on him of instruments that he helped to invent, although not all people who have made inventions would agree--M. Guillotin probably did not think the same way as he was led to take another look at his own invention two years after he had invented it. [

Interruption.] Other suggestions are being made all around the Room, but I shall not pursue them as I am sure that, in doing so, I would be out of order, or in the bog.

<P>
The NAO conducts audits of other main regulators, and is heavily involved in the sort of work proposed. I think that it produces reports on the regulators of the gas, water and electricity industries, among others. It is experienced in that field, and its economy, efficiency and value-for-money role is meat and drink to it; it would clearly have a head start in such a role. Many people in regulated industries think that the NAO should have a wider role.

<P>
The Comptroller and Auditor General has taken soundings on that, and he reported his conclusions in written evidence submitted to the Joint Committee. He stated:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"notwithstanding their representation on the Practitioner Forum, regulated firms would not be in a good position to assess the Authority's performance against the statutory objectives or provide pressure for value for money."

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
He went on to state:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A number of representative bodies have suggested such a role for the NAO".

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
He listed a few of those representative bodies, which include the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds and the Securities Institute. I gather that the NatWest bank has made it known that it is of the same view.

<P>
The case for a fundamental and thoroughgoing review and for giving the task of conducting that review to a body that is independent and that is seen to be independent is very strong. We must, however, consider the two main issues that arise from that proposal: the scope of the review and the frequency with which reviews should be conducted. In respect of scope, everybody is agreed that there should be reviews of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the FSA. I refer to everybody except the Treasury, which is not prepared to concede that the review should take place and says that it "may" take place, and only if the Treasury so decides. Almost everybody is agreed that the NAO is ideally equipped to do the job.

<P>
How much further should we expect a reviewer to go? As I said, several major issues are at stake in the Bill, and they are crucial to one of Britain's most successful industries. The issues include the relationship between objectives and principles, which we discussed earlier. 

<P>
I remain deeply concerned that the Bill may be flawed because competitiveness--or economic performance--is not at the heart of the FSA's objectives. As with many other amendments that we have tabled, the reviews can be seen as necessary patching-up operations to try to deal with the fact that the leviathan--or, to mix metaphors, huge ship--that we are creating may be setting off in the wrong direction with the wrong objectives in mind. The authority needs to be reviewed at least once, and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 70 and 71.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Another major issue is the structure of the FSA and the sheer scale of the enabling powers that the Bill gives it. Closely related to that is the internal accountability structure of the FSA, which is why amendment No. 71 refers back to whether the role of chairman and chief executive should be divided.

<P>
Several of the amendments are probing amendments designed to illustrate a range of areas that a review might cover. For example, concern may grow about the effects of devolution on the Bill. Although financial regulation is a reserved power under the devolution Acts, the possibility remains that the Scottish industry, for example, may decide to provoke the Scottish Parliament to push for a measure of independence and discretion--especially if London were to turn out to be over-regulated as a consequence of the Bill. Amendment No. 105 raises that matter, and gives the Minister the opportunity to reassure us about it.

<P>
The financial burden of running the FSA is another issue. We have created a huge, more or less self-sustaining organisation that is very powerful. It is therefore necessary to have some means of keeping it in check. One of the ways in which that could be achieved would be to restrain the amount of money at its disposal to hire more staff and conduct more activities. That is why we tabled amendment No.99, which would require a review to be triggered if costs were to rise faster than the RPI. If the costs of running the FSA grew and grew, there should be some means of publicly reviewing why that was happening, and finding ways of restraining it. Such a trigger clause could act as a sensible restraint on what could all too easily become a burgeoning bureaucracy.

<P>
The most important of the amendments that we have tabled on the conduct of the reviews is amendment No. 70, which would ensure the undertaking of at least one comprehensive review of the authority after a certain period--we suggest 18 months to two years--to check that what has been set up is working and is a satisfactory way of regulating the City.

<P>
I conclude by summarising what is wrong with clause 10. We cannot create a leviathan without also creating some check on it, and a review procedure would provide an opportunity for such a check. That procedure must satisfy several criteria, which the clause, as drafted, does not. It must provide reassurance to the industry, ensure the possibility of at least one comprehensive review and maximise the scope for accountability to Parliament. The traditional narrow form of accountability--from the FSA to the Treasury to Parliament--is inadequate for an organisation that has been given so many powers. Bringing the NAO and the PAC into the system would be a great step forward. 

<P>
Clause 10 as drafted does none of the things that I have outlined. It defines extremely narrowly what type of review may be undertaken. It leaves almost all the judgments about the review, such as its scope and the independence of the reviewer, to the Treasury. It even leaves the decision whether to have a review at all to the Treasury. I also believe that accountability to Parliament under the clause is inadequate. That is why I hope that the Minister will feel able to give us some comfort when she replies to the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do not wish to repeat the admirable presentation given by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester Mr. Tyrie of our clear and straightforward amendments. They would make the review process work and would achieve the objectives that everyone has discussed.

<P>
The big issues are clearly these: the Bill will set up a major legislator in this economic area of activity. Accountability to Parliament through the Treasury is a meaningless myth unless Parliament has a decent independent brief from which to assess how the authority is operating. Appointing the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce regular reviews would result in standardisation, whereas if the reviewer could be an accountant firm or someone else, there would be no consistency of approach. 

<P>
The history of regulation since 1986 has been one of considerable change. Much of it has wasted a lot of time because there have been internal debates rather than an open, independent assessment of what was right and what was wrong. Had the machinery that we are proposing been in place then, I suggest that it would have improved and made more digestible the changes and developments that have occurred. In a sense, our proposals follow the Select Committee approach to review, in taking evidence and considering whether the legislation is achieving its objectives. For the Treasury Select Committee to be doing the task would take all its time. We propose sub-contracting it to the natural professional.

<P>
As we said at the beginning our amendments would provide proper transparency. It seems extraordinary for the clause to include subsection (3), which provides that a review is not to be concerned with the merits of the authority's general policy or principles. We have proposed deleting that provision. A proper review should look broadly at everything. Is the authority achieving the objectives and carrying out the duties for which it was set up? Is it efficient in its use of money? Are the merits of its general policies appropriate for the circumstances, or do they need changing?

<P>
Clause 10 establishes an inadequate and potentially enfeebled review mechanism. The Government will obviously not wish to accept our raft of amendments, but let  them introduce their own, if they like, to achieve the same objectives. The amendments would ensure that the review process was professional and transparent, and that there was proper accountability in the understood fashion.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I wish to support the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester and for Arundel and South Downs. It is extremely import that the Bill should include a statutory structure for regular review. The Government should not be frightened of this--they should welcome it.

<P>
The financial services industry has seen many significant problems in the past 15 years, and I would be amazed if it did not see more over the next 15 years. Such problems would, however, be less likely if the new structure had an independent audit and, to that extent, had to look over its shoulder. That is not a criticism of the authority, merely a reinforcement of it. I strongly believe that virtually nobody, or no body, should ever be free to external scrutiny. Effective external scrutiny, accountability and answerability are beneficial to all those who are given power. The greater the power, the greater the need for them.

<P>
The suggestions underlying our amendments are responsibly made. It is not insignificant that the Comptroller and Auditor General himself, in the note to which my hon. Friend the Member of Chichester referred, suggested that the body that he heads is extremely well placed to carry out that kind of review. I am sure that the Minister would not disagree with that. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds and the Securities Institute have all expressed support for such a review to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. 

<P>
Conservative Members also want to see a structure of that sort. We are not in government, but if we were, we should be no more frightened of such external reporting than this Government--perhaps I am being unfair in suggesting that the Government are frightened by it. Good and responsible review coming fairly rapidly after the creation of an enormous authority, such as the FSA, can only be beneficial. If difficulties are to arise--future Maxwell-type problems, pensions mis-selling or pensions mis-buying, to which I have already drawn attention--there is a better chance of them being nipped in the bud if the authority is under review.

<P>
This is a responsible group of amendments, to which I feel sure we will return at a later stage--I should be very surprised if the matter were not also pursued carefully in the other place when the Bill gets there. I commend the amendments to the Committee and look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to them.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche) :</B> The clause allows the Treasury to commission reviews on whether the FSA is using its resources to carry out its functions sufficiently economically, efficiently and effectively.

<P>
The Government attach much importance to this issue. As the Committee knows, our proposed arrangements were welcomed by the Joint Committee in its first report. It agreed that it was important that the FSA's activities should be subject to independent audit, and we welcome its approval. I understand the points made by the hon. Member for Chichester and his right hon. and hon. Friends. However, I hope to persuade them that the amendments would not improve the Bill and that they should withdraw them.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall deal first with the time limit proposed in amendment No. 70. I hope that I understand the thoughts of the hon. Member for Chichester, although perhaps I should say that I understand the reasoning that lies behind the amendment. We carefully considered whether to put in place a requirement for reports to be made at specific intervals. However, we concluded that the more sensible course was to leave the matter open in the Bill. How often reviews take place and how often we commission them will depend on the circumstances. We should not forget that the non-executive directors will be doing a report on the subject annually. Against that background, and in the light of any representations that we receive, we shall decide whether to commission a review. However, we do not want to be forced to commission one where it is not necessary.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister talked about the timing and the time limits. Does she accept in principle that there will be reports and that the Treasury will commission some? Is the Treasury contemplating commissioning one within three years, for example?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. I understand the probing nature of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's intervention. We are talking about an organisation that we will establish by statute. The power is in the Bill, but what happens will depend on the circumstances, which might, for example, dictate the need for more than one review in a single year. I would not want, at this stage, to handcuff our ability to commission a review, given that there are different and changing circumstances. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire said that there have been many changes in financial regulation. It is, therefore, difficult to predict when and in what circumstances we might commission a review. That is why we considered the matter. At the end of the day, however, we thought that it was important to leave the appropriate amount of flexibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister said that the Government should not be hampered in holding a review, even if that meant that there was more than one review in any one year. However, there is no suggestion, in the spirit and the wording of any of the amendments, that the number of reviews will be limited. Our aim is that there should be a review, but there is no provision in the Bill for one, and there might never be one. All that we have is the Minister's promise.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Our position is clear: we will not hold a review for the sake of it. We will commission one when the circumstances make it appropriate to do so. 

<P>
Amendment No. 99 would require the Treasury to commission a review whenever the average level of fees rose by more than the increase in the retail prices index over the relevant period. I have some sympathy for the hon. Member for Chichester as regards that important point. An increase in the average real level of fees might be one of the triggers for a review, but it should not serve as an automatic trigger. Fees may rise above inflation, or fall relative to inflation, in a particular year for a variety of reasons. For example, if there is an influx of new entrants into the banking sector, fees may rise for reasons that are perfectly clear. I understand the point, and we shall consider it, but I do not see the need for such a provision in the Bill.

<P>
We and the Joint Committee considered carefully whether the National Audit Office should be involved. However, we concluded that it did not make sense to require the NAO, and only the NAO, to carry out the reviews. The FSA is not the type of body over which the NAO has jurisdiction. It is funded by levies from industry, there is no public expenditure involved and there is no automatic locus for the NAO. It would therefore be inappropriate to extend the NAO's remit to the FSA. However, it is open to us to appoint the NAO to carry out a particular review. I, like other members of the Committee, have a great deal of respect for its work, so we shall consider that option carefully when we commission a review.

<P>
However, we shall also consider whether other persons--for example, private sector bodies with particularly relevant expertise--are better placed to carry out the review. I pray in aid one example to support such an approach. In 1996, the value-for-money review of the Securities and Investment Board was carried out by an eminent private sector consultancy. We do not want to limit our options, and I was pleased that that view was shared by the Joint Committee.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 would make the review--which amendment No. 67 would require the NAO to carry out--cover the discharge of the FSA's functions. It is worth pointing out, however, that, under section 6(2) of the National Audit Act 1983, the NAO cannot question the merits of the policy objectives of any body, in respect of which a value-for-money audit is carried out. That places one impediment in the way of the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am well aware of that provision, but it is not an impediment to the FAO carrying out a far-reaching review. It can commission someone else to do the job. The Minister looks puzzled, as if to suggest that that would be impossible. She has given a highly legalistic response to the eminently sensible suggestion of putting the review in the hands of a body that is independent, is seen to be independent and is capable of dealing with the industry's wide-ranging concerns.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I disagree. If the NAO commissioned the work, the work would be for the NAO. Under the terms of the 1983 Act, the NAO cannot question the merits of the policy objectives of any body in respect of which a value-for-money audit is carried out. That might be a legalistic interpretation of the Act, but it is the correct one. The hon. Gentleman must admit that it is an impediment to his proposal.

<P>
Even if we put that point to one side, the amendment would still be unnecessary. Several provisions in the Bill already give adequate safeguards. The Bill will require the FSA to report on the extent to which the regulatory objectives have been met in the annual report that it produces for the Treasury. However, I will not try your patience, Mr. Atkinson, by rehearsing the discussions that we have already had on that issue. Under clauses 8 and 9, the FSA will also be under a duty to have regard to any representations made to it by the consumer and practitioner panels.

<P>
Amendment No. 105 would require a copy of the report of the review to be placed before the two Houses of Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. As hon. Members know and as the hon. Member for Chichester remarked, financial services are a reserved matter, so the Bill is reserved legislation. Papers or reports provided for by reserved legislation are laid before Parliament as a matter of policy.

<P>
I hope that I have swayed the hon. Member for Chichester into not pressing the amendments to a vote. If not, I invite my hon. Friends to oppose them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We are grateful for the Financial Secretary's response which, however, does not satisfy us. I had hoped that she would say that we raised some serious points on which she would reflect.

<P>
I was rather surprised that the Financial Secretary said that the Treasury would not have a review just for the sake of it. That approach is entirely wrong. The Government are giving a single body that is structured like a private sector company the largest accumulated set of powers ever given to a financial sector body in this country's history. They are giving control of that body to one man, who combines the powers of chairman and chief executive. They are doing that in an area that has caused persistent difficulty and has had a serious effect on this country's citizens several times in the past 15 years.

<P>
Saying that a thoroughly independent body conducting a review is somehow stupid requires a better justification than simply saying that a review will not be conducted just for the sake of it or that the body's ability to have more than one review a year should not be hampered.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester rightly pointed out a review conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General after 18 months or two or even three years, would impede nothing. Indeed, a powerful and important body would benefit from the scrutiny of what is likely to be a valuable review, as would Parliament, which is being asked to give enormous powers and which would gain from a responsible party's report.

<P>
Such a report would greatly improve the FSA's accountability to Parliament and to Ministers. I invite the Financial Secretary to reconsider her position and give an assurance that the Government will give the matter serious thought.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister implied that the Government regard reviews as a reserve power--should the Treasury feel that there was a specific reason for having one--or a focused power, analogous to the Securities and Investment Board competitiveness review.

<P>
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, the review process is at the centre of proper, transparent accountability. It must be conducted regularly by an accepted, proper party if it is to meet that end. I thought that the Joint Committee intended that tot be the purpose of reviews, not that they should be a Treasury management tool. We feel strongly that that is the case and I support my right hon. and learned Friend's polite request that the Government rethink the matter.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On the specific matter of whether the NAO would be debarred as the FSA is a private sector company the Minister's point about territories in which comment is not allowed on general policy objectives in respect of Government bodies does not apply, as the FSA is an entirely non-Government body. Any remaining technical problem could be dealt with in one way or another. The reviews are crucial but they must be undertaken by the same body, an appropriate national organisation, and not by different bodies that may approach the matter from an entirely different perspective.

<P>
Members of Parliament have no basis on which to assess what such an important body--it is almost a rival legislature--in the financial services industry is getting up to. We will have no way of knowing whether justice is being meted out unless a professional review is carried out by an independent party. Since regulations were introduced there have been huge mistakes, injustice has been perpetrated and there have been inefficiencies in reforming regulations because there is no organised system of regular review and accountability.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to add my threepenn'orth to the debate. The amendments are important and would improve the Bill, rather than wreck or restrain it. Their aim, like that of so many of our amendments, is to enhance and reassure. Unfortunately, we have been largely unsuccessful in persuading the Government to accept them.

<P>
I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 99, 103 and 104. Howard Davies boasted every time we questioned him in the Joint Committee and on other occasions that he had underspent his budget this year by about £10 million. He so often uses that argument as a way of countering the assertion that there should be a constraint on the fines, and on the business of whether fines should be rebated back to reduce fees for subscribing members.

<P>
There is great anxiety in the financial services industry about the enormous cost of setting up the FSA's infrastructure, which will continue for many years. It is thus eminently sensible to introduce the proposed check and balance. It would not mean that the FSA would be constrained not to raise its fees above the level of RPI, although some of us may have some sympathy for such a proposal. Rather, it would be the trigger for a review if the fees went beyond that level. I am glad to know that the Minister has some sympathy with our proposal but that is no good unless the Government think about it and come back with some fresh proposals. It would not harm them much to do so.

<P>
The Minister gave one reason why fees may rise that I did not understand: an influx of new banks into the system. I should have thought that on the basis of economies of scale, fees would go down if more members came in on a pro rata basis, not on the basis of total fee take. The Minister's explanation did not allay our anxieties.

<P>
We need to be assured that the money that the FSA brings in from the industry is used to regulate the industry properly and proportionately and is not used as a soft option to bump up the bureaucracy that is the FSA and to increase its tentacles just for the sake of it. We simply want to make sure that, if there was any fear that that was about to happen because the level of fees was going up, it would trigger a review.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 103 and 104 concern the reviewing process and who is the reviewer. Again, this was a key recommendation from the Joint Committee. Paragraph 121 of the report states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Proper accountability is essential. We believe that this scrutiny can best be achieved by asking a Parliamentary Committee to review the FSA's annual report and to take regular evidence from a broad section of consumers and practitioners."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the clause stands, we may have no reviewing process whatever. As the Minister must admit, "may" is entirely avoidable. A review may never happen. It is left to the whim of the Minister, or the promise that it would happen if there were something to look into. That is no assurance. We need firmer language than that: an assurance in black and white that there would be an independent review of all the activities, including the levels of fee charged, if things appeared to be getting out of hand. We need that to reassure the whole financial services community.
<P>
I may have missed hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester make this point when he moved the amendment, but if the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook the review there would be an automatic channel into the Public Accounts Committee. There is a powerful body within Parliament to which the FSA could be held to account in a much more public and high-profile way. The PAC has successfully exposed, for want of a better word, problems and potential problems in a whole range of other organisations. That is why we have suggested the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
I appreciate the Minister's point that there are all sorts of other public sector bodies with the relevant skills. She mentioned a consultancy company reviewing value for money and I should like some more examples. The Government use consultancy companies virtually every day of the week. We need to be assured that the reviewer is someone who has respect and gravitas and who is seen to be wholly independent and with an independent remit. We do not want a one-off review carried out by one firm this year and by another in a few years' time, if at all.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman's attention must have been wandering. The consultancy company that I mentioned was used in 1996, when the Government of which he was a supporter were in power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The point is not whether the previous Government employed independent consultants or this Government employ as many or, on a pro rata basis, more independent consultants to carry out the reviews. They are different independent consultants and have different agendas. They do not have the recognition and the gravitas of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is my point. I do not denigrate the independent consultancy industry in any way. 
<P>
The whole point is how this is perceived by the financial services industry. If the Government do not take the amendments on board, the financial services industry cannot be assured that, if things are not going according to plan, there will be a review. It cannot be assured that if fees appear to be getting jacked up, the fees will be reviewed and the matter will be looked at. Indeed, the whole financial services industry cannot be assured that the review, if it ever takes place, is not just a token exercise.
<P>
If the review found that the FSA was not performing its duties and functions as the Committee would wish, that finding should have the force of parliament accountability. That is the purpose of the amendments. They are enhancing and improving amendments and I see no reason why the Government cannot accept them, or at least reconsider the problem and improve their own wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I agree with the last words of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton).
<P>
The amendments are necessary because insufficient countervailing forces are built into the Bill. Competitiveness will not act as a policeman, or a limiting constraint, on the FSA's regulation of the industry, because it is not an objective, only a principle. Other forms of scrutinising the FSA--consumer and practitioner panels--exist but, as discussed earlier, they are demonstrably weak and unsatisfactory. The Bill effectively creates another legislature, but without adequate checks and limits to its power. There is a basis need for a thoroughgoing review and I am disappointed that the Government are not prepared to accept it.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 would provide for a thoroughgoing review. The Minister said that she was opposed to any time limit for a first review, but I do not understand what the Government are afraid of. The Minister could say that she agreed with the principle but wanted to postpone a review for four or even five years. That response would alleviate much of the industry's concern. I do not understand the substance of the Government's objections.
<P>
The Minister says that it would all depend on the circumstances, but that sounds like suggesting a review only when there is a problem or a crisis. If circumstances throw up a problem in the industry, the Minister says that a review might be appropriate--surely the worst way to decide whether there should be a review. We do not want to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. We want to have in place a system that would help to prevent problems whenever possible. The review system in the clause is so enabling that the Government may decide not to have any reviews. That is why I found it so curious when the Minister said that she did not want to be limited to one review in any one year. There is nothing in the spirit of the amendments that suggests any limits on the number of reviews--far from it.
<P>
The Minister also said that she did not want a review for the sake of it, yet that is precisely what the industry wants. The industry wants a review in order to articulate its substantial concerns about the introduction of legislation such as the Bill, but it is not being given the assurance of even one opportunity at any time to make its points to a reviewer. The Minister's objections to amendment No. 70 are, as I said, curious.
<P>
The Minister objected to a cap--or, rather, a review trigger process--on fees. She argued that new entrants could incur costs. That is a valid point and a genuine concern. However, it is an easy problem to take account of. If we worked out and added in the average cost of managing that part of the industry, we would arrive at a slightly larger sum than the crude RPI figure. We would be happy to take on board any such simple figure if the Minister suggested one. I was heartened that that was the hon. Lady's principle objection to some kind of trigger for a review of the fees. She did not argue against the idea on any point of principle--or, at least very little. She said merely that it might be difficult to manage.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A mechanism must be built into the Bill to bring downward pressure on fees. The notion of control and regulation is well understood in almost every aspect of public sector--and of most aspects of private sector--cost control, but there is nothing of that in the Bill as drafted. Our amendment suggests building it into the reviews. I am again disappointed that the Minister does not feel able to agree to reconsider how such a provision could be put into the Bill.
<P>
On amendment No. 104, the Minister gave a somewhat curious set of reasons for not involving the NAO. She said that the conduct of reviews should not be confined to the NAO, and that the amendment would allow that. We do not want that either. We fully agree that a mechanism can and should be found, where necessary, to enable others to conduct reviews. However we do think that the core task of scrutinising the FSA's work, and the value-for-money aspect of its work, should be put under the wing of the NAO, for two reasons: it has the experience, and it is answerable to the PAC. There will thus be a much higher level of parliamentary scrutiny than if matters are left as they are.
<P>
The Minister said that the 1983 Act, which set up the NAO, would be an impediment. She is right, but it is a trivail point--something that the Government could rectify easily if they wished to involve the NAO in a way that enabled them to widen the scope of their reviews. It is not a fundamental objection of principle. In fact, I thought it a bit ridiculous to suggest that this was a reason for rejecting the NAO's involvement in any aspect of the FSA's work, especially when so many bodies that are to be regulated have come forward, as have the chairman of the PAC and the Comptroller and Auditor General, who have said independently that they think that this would be a proper, sensible approach. The Government are flying in the face of both offers of advice.
<P>
I understand that there is no need for the Government to take on board the amendments as drafted. We do not have a large team of draftsmen to ensure that we get amendments exactly right. The Minister pointed out some technical flaws in them. We hope, even at this late stage, that the Minister will show a sense of responsiveness to the amendments on reviews. It would help enormously if she gave clear answers to a few straightforward questions. Does she think that reviews are essential? Does she think that at least one thoroughgoing review of the Bill should be undertaken?
<P>
Does she think that business and industry confidence would be boosted by a clear commitment from the Government to such a fundamental review? Does she think that parliamentary accountability would be strengthened by involving the NAO? Does she accept that the enabling powers for review, which have been placed in the hands of the Treasury under clause 10, will sap the industry's confidence that it will secure a review?
<P>
I was disappointed with the Minister's largely dismissive response to those important points. However, I hope that she will say that the Government will reconsider the core points that I have just enumerated in the form of questions, and will return to the Committee.

Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Right to obtain documents and information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 5, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(2A) Subsection (1) does not apply to any document which a person could not be compelled to give or produce in civil proceedings before the court or which has been supplied to the Authority by or on behalf of that person subject to a condition that such document and its contents shall not be disclosed by the Authority to any other person.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to provide straightforward and established protection to those whom the person conducting the review calls to give evidence. Such protection is available in legislation on parallel civil proceedings. First, no one should be compelled to give or produce evidence if he or she could not be so compelled in civil proceedings. Secondly, if someone gives documents to the authority on the condition that it should not thereafter disclose them to others, that condition should be honoured. Broadly the same point is made in amendment No. 92 to clause 14.
<P>
The amendment would make no material difference to the powers of the person conducting the review. As I said, it will provide the normal legal protection that is available in other, parallel situations in the nation's life.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I support the amendment. It will assist the reviewer. It is obviously desirable that the reviewer should have available to him all the documents provided to the authority. Some of those documents may have been provided with an element of restriction. For example, legal professional privilege could have been claimed for the documents, but their owner was happy for the authority to see them, provided that it was for that purpose only and that it was made clear that they would not be shown to others.
<P>
The amendment would make it possible to ensure that the rules that apply to ordinary civil proceedings could apply to the sort of review that is contemplated by the Government. The adding of those words will not prevent someone who has privilege for their documents from waiving that privilege in a limited form, or from waiving it completely. However, in the context of that sort of review, which is not wholly unlike some legal proceedings, the protection of the citizen will be kept parallel to the protection that would be enjoyed if the matter were being heard in court.
<P>
The reasons for legal professional privilege are perfectly simple. Public policy entitles the citizen to a substantial degree of privilege for documents--the privilege not to reveal documents, even in a court case, or privilege for documents that have been revealed in a court case. Public policy states quite simply that the citizen should be able to consult a lawyer in confidence; otherwise it would be difficult for the lawyer to give advice that was not damaging to the client. The client's explanation to his lawyer, which might be incomplete, could involve giving evidence, which if it were in the public domain, might be taken as proof of guilt or of wrongdoing.
<P>
Likewise, the lawyer's advice might be that his client had transgressed, or could be thought to have transgressed. If a document giving such advice were put in the public domain, it would make it much more difficult for the lawyer to argue his case, even though his client was not guilty. However, even if the client was responsible and had somehow erred, such an admission could damage him when trying to beat off unfair or exaggerated criticisms from another direction.
<P>
Placing the procedures for that sort of review in parallel with court procedures will give the citizen confidence. It is also more likely that documents will be made available, both at an early stage and in relation to a particular review, which seems to me to be almost entirely beneficial. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, and what those advising her think about that suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Opposition Members have raised an interesting and important point. I understand the spirit and reasoning behind it, but I hope that I can reassure them about it.
<P>
There is no intention that a review under clause 10, or an inquiry under clause 13, will cut across people's rights or override the general law of privilege.  Clause 14(4) makes it clear that a person cannot be compelled to disclose to the inquiry a document to which privilege attaches. We will discuss that in more detail when we reach that subsection and amendment No. 92.
<P>
I return to clause 11. It is hard to envisage circumstances in which a person who conducts a review of the FSA's economy and efficiency would want to see legally privileged documents that had been voluntarily disclosed to the FSA. It is even harder to envisage circumstances in which such documents could be reasonably required under subsection (1)(a). How would privileged documents--legal advice obtained by an authorised person about possible legal action and disclosed voluntarily to the FSA--be relevant to review how efficiently the FSA discharged its functions? We do not believe that the general law would permit the FSA to volunteer a privileged document that had been handed to it in a situation in which privilege had not been waived. There is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on general policy. For the benefit of the Committee and those who closely follow our proceedings, I repeat that we do not want to undermine privilege in that way.
<P>
The question is whether more clarification is needed in the Bill. I am happy to consider that further alongside a more general question relating to privileged documents, which was asked by the British Bankers Association and others. That question is about whether there should be an explicit provision to ensure that a privileged document does not cease to be privileged because it is volunteered to the FSA. It was suggested that the lack of such a provision meant that there was a disincentive for voluntary disclosure of privileged documents to the authority.
<P>
We all recognise the desirability of free and frank disclosure between the regulator and the regulated. As matters stand, it is not clear that the general law fails to provide sufficient protection for privilege. For example, it is not clear that the FSA could be compelled to disclose privileged documents that had been voluntarily disclosed to it without obtaining the consent of those in whom privilege vests. On that basis, I am reluctant to make explicit provision in the Bill, as it would cast doubt over the statute in general. 
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am slightly deaf. At the beginning of what the Financial Secretary so helpfully said, she referred to something in the Bill beyond clause 11 that bore relation to the subject. What did she refer to?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I referred to a subsection of clause 14, which we will discuss under amendment No. 92.
<P>
Any number of public authorities may sometimes be shown or given privileged documents on a voluntary basis. It would be unfortunate if we cast new doubt in a wide range of other contexts by seeking to be absolutely sure in this one. That said, I appreciate the important points raised by hon. Members. As I said, we are in discussion with the British Bankers Association and others about them. I am happy to offer my undertaking that we shall return with our conclusions from the discussions on Report. I therefore hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister's undertaking. As we debate the rest of the Bill, it will be particularly interesting to see whether an explicit overall provision comes to the fore.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. It is a matter of concern to the Law Society, as I think all members of the Committee will be aware. I am encouraged by what the Minister said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Cases in which the Treasury may arrange independent inquiries</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 5, line 35, leave our "serious".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 75, in page 6, line 1, leave out 'serious'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 74 relates to problems with the collective investment scheme that could have posed a grave risk to the financial system, while amendment No. 75 concerns problems with listed securities that could have caused significant damage to holders of such securities. If a regulatory failure led to grave risks in collective investment schemes and to significant damage for holders of listed securities, it matters not whether that failure was serious. At the risk of being pompous, the use of the word "serious" in both cases is completely otiose to whether there should be an inquiry into the matter.
<P>
If a regulatory mistake was responsible for matters that turned out to be extremely serious, it should be examined. Such a situation needs the type of focused inquiry to which the Minister referred. It is ridiculous to say about the result of the authority's action, "Well, it was not serious. It nearly led to a frightful disaster, but we are not interested in looking at that. Forget it." If a failure in the system caused serious and significant damage, it should jolly well be looked at and inquired into.

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> It is wise to remove the word "serious" from the clause, because we do not want too many belts and braces littered throughout the Bill. I am not being cynical, but its structure is to give power to the Treasury on every possible occasion. The Treasury is reluctant to release that power. Under clause 12(2), inquiries may be arranged
<P>

<P>
various matters have gone wrong because of a serious failure in the system.
<P>
If a grave risk was posed to the whole financial structure because of a failure in the system, that is a more-than-adequate reason for the Treasury to hold an inquiry. Indeed, we would expect it to do so in such circumstances. Removal of the word "serious" would be helpful. Its retention would take away the ability of the Treasury to prevent such failures from occurring.
