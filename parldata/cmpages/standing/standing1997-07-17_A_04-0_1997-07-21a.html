<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. First, may we remove our jackets if it becomes hot in here--I say that on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who shows every sign of overheating?
<P>
Secondly, and more substantially, when we met on Friday we failed to discuss some important clauses. We did not conclude our deliberations on the large increases in hydrocarbon duties, and the Minister did not answer our points. The inflationary impact of the duty increases, and the burden they place on industry and the public, are very serious. We did not discuss tobacco duty, vehicle excise duty, the new electronic transmission system for vehicle excise duty information, or the limit on mortgage interest relief payments. The Committee has not scrutinised these matters because of the tight time scale on which we must operate.
<P>
When we debate new clauses at the end of proceedings, will you be tolerant with hon. Members who wish to debate those subjects? Indirect tax increases, which took immediate effect on Budget day, and are already having an inflationary effect, must be debated when we discuss new clauses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am tempted to rule that gentlement who have their jackets on may remove them, and that those who have taken them off should put them back on, but it is a warm day so gentlemen may remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Dawn Primarolo): Further to that point of order, Mr. Chairman. It is regrettable that Opposition Members took so long to discuss early parts of the excise duty clauses, as, in so doing, the denied themselves the opportunity to scrutinise subsequent clauses. Anybody who reads the excellent debates on English wine in Hansard may acknowledge that if we had spent a little less time on those interesting points we may have reached the clauses about which the right hon. Gentleman is complaining.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Timetabling is a matter for the Business Committee; the timetable has already been agreed by the Committee. The selection of amendments on Report is a matter for Madam Speaker and the Business Committee, but, as the hon. Lady rightly points out, the progress that hon. Members make under the timetable motion is entirely their responsibility.
<P>
Furthermore, I admonished one hon. Member for reading during the last sitting, and I will not tolerate any more such incidents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> On a fresh point of order, Mr. Chairman. The weekend press has reported that the Government are to impose an additional tax, a graduate tax on students to pay for their tuition. The Bill makes no provision for the tax. The subject may be discussed in the House later this week, but this Committee is well served by two former presidents of the National Union of Students and one former Minister for higher education. It is unfortunate that this new imposition--the 18th in a series of Labour tax rises--cannot be discussed in this Committee. We must use maximum ingenuity to see whether we can introduce it in a new clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can dispose of that point of order immediately. It is not possible to introduce that subject in a new clause to the Bill, as it does not arise from the Bill; nor is there anything in the long title to suggest the possibility of drafting amendments that could refer to a graduate tax. This is a matter for future occasions in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Further to the point of order made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). You, Mr. McWilliam, are responsible for the conduct of debate in the Committee. At the end of the Committee there will be resolutions to say that the Bill has been properly scrutinised. Many clauses, which affect people's lives, were missed out on the first sitting, and many more on the second and third sittings, including those concerning tobacco duty and the abolition of mortgage interest relief at source. Do you have any powers to make representations to the House to the effect that vast chunks of this important Bill have not been debated, and that the timetable motion should be amended so that we can debate those clauses?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member and should know that spurious points of order do not go down well with me. First, I have no power to go back on previous amendments; secondly, if I, or any of my predecessors, had ever had to certify that any Bill had been properly scrutinised in Committee--and I can think of no such occasion, after nearly 20 years in the House--they would not have been allowed to do so because hon. Members do not mislead the House.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates for Financial Year 1997</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): Opposition Members have managed completely to ignore clause 18, which deals with the reduction in corporation tax, one of the key elements in the changes that the Government want to introduce--no doubt the hon. Member for Daventry's mother will have a view on that. I suspect, however, that those who read the Official Report will find that we have spent much time being lectured on geography and relationships, and that Opposition Members have perhaps not spent as much time as they should have in debating the detail of this important part of Labour's programme.
<P>
Before and during the last general election we made clear our determination to ensure better-quality investment by companies to encourage long-term growth in the country. A number of my hon. Friends who are new to the House and who come from constituencies where Labour had not previously enjoyed overwhelming support, now find themselves with massive majorities because of the wide recognition of the new Labour Government's concern for industry. This can be seen clearly in clause 18, which reduces the main rate and the small companies rate of corporation tax from 1 April 1997. Both rates are reduced by 2 per cent.: the main rate from 33 per cent. to 31 per cent.; and the small companies rate from 23 per cent. to 21 per cent.
<P>
When the Paymaster General spoke recently about the pressures faced by small companies, I was conscious of the delight that many such companies experience when they find that they have reached a position where they can pay corporation tax. I say this with some feeling as before being elected I was chief executive of a company that had the responsibility of establishing small to medium-sized enterprises. Our aim was to ensure that they quickly reached a position where they could pay corporation tax. 
<P>
The Government have reduced corporation tax rates at the first opportunity. Uniquely, we are the first Government to have backdated a tax cut to before we took office.
<P>
From discussions with my constituents and others, I am aware that the cut is greatly welcomed. It is the first cut in the main rate of corporation tax since 1991. Those of us from less-developed parts of the UK welcome this reduction as it helps us to attract inward investment.
<P>
In my constituency, one of the poorest in Scotland, we are anxious to attract such investment. While the hon. Member for Daventry can pray in aid his mother's interest in the Bill, my husband--a senior executive of a multinational company that is involved in an inward investment project--reminds me daily of the importance of corporation tax rates in encouraging inward investment.
<P>
I visited Ireland last year to look at its regional development structure. I was much impressed by the arguments that were made about corporation tax levels. The Government's action on corporation tax, which seems to be attracting no interest among Opposition Members, enhances the UK's position as a major industrialised nation with the lowest main corporation tax rate--the lowest we have ever had.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Did the Economic Secretary and her colleagues support previous corporation tax cuts that enabled our corporation tax to become the lowest in the developed world?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The previous Government's policies, which were tied to short-term boom and bust, did not create the climate for economic growth that Britain is crying out for. If the business community had been convinced by the performance of Opposition Members, they--not us--would now be on the Government Benches. The business community's verdict is that the previous Conservative Government did not act in its best interests. It now has a new Labour Government who are committed to growth that everyone in Britain--not just the select few--can enjoy.
<P>
Cutting the small companies rate means that smaller companies can benefit still further from the most generous combination of a low rate and a high cut-off limit in the European Union.
<P>
Members who are new to the House and who believe that our responsibilities, as Ministers or otherwise, mean that we should be full-time Members, are conscious of the emphasis on the structure and possibilities of growth of small companies as significant generators of employment. Many small companies, particularly those with which I was involved at the high-tech end of the market, have great potential for securing the UK's economic growth.
<P>
Around 500,000 companies will gain &#163;1,600 million in 1998-99 and &#163;2,200 million in 1999-2000 from the measures. The rate cut will encourage company investment by boosting after-tax returns from investment.
<P>
The clause aims to introduce rate reductions which are widely welcomed throughout the UK and are perceived as a threat by other countries that would seek to organise their economies in the same way as the new Labour Government.
<P>
I therefore commend the clause to the Committee. It will be viewed as a major move towards ensuring the growth and long-term stability of the UK well into the next century.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies (Grantham and Stamford):</B> I was interested to hear the Minister refer to Scotland as a ``less-developed part of the United Kingdom''. I do not think I would have got away with saying that; nor do I think I would have wanted to say it.
<P>
I know the hon. Lady's constituency reasonably well and I do not think that her analysis is justified, whether from an industrial perspective, on the basis of the prosperity today in Glasgow and Edinburgh, on the new industries in silicon glen, on the industrial sophistication of Scotland generally, or, indeed, on Scotland's cultural or intellectual tradition. It is worth remembering that Scotland had four universities when England had only two. The greatest influences on my intellectual life, Adam Smith and David Hume, were Scots and J. S. Mill was a Scot, even though he spent most of his time in this part of the country. I was astonished to hear the Minister--whom I am sure is a patriotic Scot--refer to her part of the kingdom so disparagingly.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am amused by the hon. Gentleman's lack of knowledge of Scotland. Perhaps he does not recognise Airdrie and Shotts, which is between Glasgow and Edinburgh. In some parts of my constituency, unemployment is above 50 per cent. and the all-causes mortality rate is the highest in western Europe, which in simple terms means that you die before you are 40. One of the things of which Labour Members are most proud is that the most famous person to come from my constituency--from the little village of Laigh Brannock, which has only three houses--was James Keir Hardie.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is perfectly obvious that as I am 56 I could not possibly have died before I was 40. I hope that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) will not persist in discussion of Adam Smith. As at one time I had legal responsibility for his final resting place, I might have to declare an interest if his reference was in order. As it is not, I hope that he will not persist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I should have thought that wherever in the world public expenditure is discussed, it is right to mention the revered name of Adam Smith.
<P>
I will dwell on Scotland for one sentence only. If Scotland has had a major handicap in recent generations, it has been its excessively bloated public sector, which reflects its unfortunate socialist orientation over the last generation or so. Wasteful and ineffective public authorities are a great burden and do not help Scottish prosperity.
<P>
The main reason for rising to speak is my astonishment at the Economic Secretary's audacity in telling the Committee that the proposed reductions in corporation tax have not been sufficiently appreciated by Opposition Members, and her making great play of all that is being done to relieve the tax burden on industry.
<P>
The hon. Lady is looking at this matter purely on a gross, rather than a net, basis. That seems to me--I do not know whether it is in parliamentary order to use the term--to be just a little disingenuous, to put it mildly.
<P>
I refer the hon. Lady to page 40 of her Red Book and ask her to do some simple arithmetic. Under items 3 and 4, industry in 1998-99 is indeed being prospectively relieved of &#163;1.6 billion of corporation tax. I will do her a favour by adding something that she did not mention--item 7, double capital allowances for small and medium-sized enterprises. That means &#163;230 million in the same financial year. There is, therefore, an apparent initial reduction in the tax burden of industry of &#163;1.83 billion.
<P>
That does not sound like a large sum in terms of the gross domestic product--it roughly equates to a 1p increase in income tax--but the hon. Lady forgot to mention item 10, which shows the yield from the windfall tax is expected to be &#163;2.6 billion. I calculate that the proposals in items 12 to 16 would extract approximately &#163;500 million from industry, making a combined total of &#163;3.2 billion. The Government are therefore giving &#163;1.8 billion, but taking &#163;3.2 billion.
<P>
The calculation cannot stop there. We all know that abolition of the dividend tax credit will mean that the rate of return on an occupational pension fund will be less than actuaries had assumed in calculating the solvency of schemes. An uncertain number of final salary occupational pension schemes--I have raised this important issue on the Floor of the House, but have not received any answers from Ministers and no answer is given in the Red Book--will be significantly underfunded. Companies whose actuaries inform them that their schemes are underfunded will be obliged to make up that funding from current profits.
<P>
That considerable levy runs into hundreds of millions of pounds--I fear that it may run into billions, thus reducing the taxable profits of industry. That is extremely worrying, but even more worrying is the Economic Secretary seeming to think that she can get away with not mentioning it to the Committee. She believes that she can make a speech on what a wonderful job the Government have done in reducing the tax burden on industry, when the reality is the exact reverse because the proposed levies in the Bill are twice as high as the reductions in corporation tax.
<P>
That technique is used by salesmen of snake oil, who put a proposition to the public that is fundamentally bogus. The Minister is uncharacteristically quiet now, but she was only too happy to intervene when I was dealing with her native country. She recognises that she has no defence because the Budget increases tax burdens on industry--the levies by the state and by political action on industry.
<P>
Industry's post-tax profits will be correspondingly lower, so its propensity to invest and its ability to create employment and to maintain technological competitiveness will be reduced. The general public must grasp that fact because the issues are being swept under the carpet. The Red Book does not mention the increased pension contributions that firms will be compelled to make and that will be a major part of the additional revenue that the Government think they will receive from abolition of the dividend tax credit. The additional levies that are mentioned in the Red Book were excluded from the Economic Secretary's speech. I believe that she has seriously underestimated the intelligence of the public and of British business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting and compelling speech. Does he agree that one uncovenanted impact of the proposed changes of which we have not heard is that they may destabilise the Revenue in the first and second years as pension fund trustees may advise companies that they will have to top up their funds? That top-up will be found by withdrawing revenue from profit and loss accounts, thereby reducing the corporation tax yield.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I could not agree more. My hon. Friend raises an extremely serious matter. It is fundamentally irresponsible to produce a Budget that will have certain inevitable consequences for material cash flows--which will materially change the outcomes stated in that Budget--without mentioning those consequences.
<P>
The Economic Secretary told us this morning that she and her husband have had distinguished private sector business careers, and I am delighted to hear that she is so capitalist, at least in her own practice. However, if she produced a prospectus in the private sector for the financial markets in which she made certain projections on revenues that might be expected from proposed actions, but entirely left out a very important consequence of one of those actions of which she was well aware--in the hope that those reading the prospectus would not notice--she would not have a business career in the private sector and would be lucky to be at liberty. And that is the nature of the document that I am holding.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not actually debating the document that the hon. Gentleman is clutching. We are debating clause 18, which is remarkably narrow. I have been quite tolerant so far, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will come back to the clause. An odd mention of it would be nice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Committee must be grateful--and I express my gratitude through you, Mr. McWilliam--that the House authorities make available on the Table every day a copy of the Red Book. I had always assumed that--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All documents relating to the Committee should be on the table in front of us, but the only question that I have proposed is whether clause 18 should stand part of the Bill. Clause 18 deals purely with the level of corporation tax. It does not deal with windfall tax or anything else in the Red Book. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will deal now with the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr. McWilliam, I take it that you are not ruling that one is not expected to refer to the Red Book as each clause comes along?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me be clear. I am not ruling that hon. Members are not entitled to refer to the Red Book. I am saying that the debate is not about the entire contents of the Red Book; it is about corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Well, Mr. McWilliam, I hope that you will think it legitimate of me to say that it is entirely deceptive to tell the Committee that the Budget is going to cut corporation tax and that the tax burden on corporations will fall, when other parts of the Budget will ensure that the total tax burden on business increases. The Red Book brought by the Government to the Committee--which I thought was for our elucidation, to make the Government's plans more transparent and to make it easier for us to understand the economic impact of the clauses we are debating--leaves out of its account a very important negative impact on total corporate cash flows.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been extremely tolerant of the hon. Gentleman. I must tell him that we are dealing with corporation tax; until we reach Report stage, we have finished with the windfall tax and other such taxes. The hon. Gentleman may return to those subjects on Report, but he may not continue now to advance arguments about any tax while advancing arguments about corporation tax. He may argue only about corporation tax.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Well, Mr. McWilliam, I am personally delighted--as I am sure are all my hon. Friends--that corporation tax is being reduced. We only regret that more is being taken than is being given. It would be entirely wrong of us not to comment on that because I believe that our debates are followed by taxpayers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend has done his sums. Over the next four years, &#163;1,295 billion will be withdrawn in advance corporation tax credits while corporation tax will increase by &#163;4.3 billion. Considerably more is being taken away than is being given.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend has made a slightly different calculation from mine, stretching over four years rather than one financial year, but however the figures are examined, we must reach the same conclusion. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has an estimate for the net levy on British industry which will be required--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, I did not hear you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My remark was not directed at the hon. Gentleman, but at those hon. Members who are having a conversation rather than listening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr. McWilliam, you were intervening to protect me. I was so overwhelmed I could hardly believe your words. I am sincerely grateful.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's uncharacteristic silence during the past 20 minutes of my intervention speaks volumes. However much she may deceive her supporters on the Government Benches, she will not be deceiving anyone else in the country about the clause's effect on business.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must withdraw the word ``deceiving''. An alternative word is ``misleading''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I, of course, withdraw the word ``deceiving'' and replace it with the word ``misleading''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to catch your eye, Mr. McWilliam. My point follows on from that made by the Economic Secretary. She made great play of the fact that the corporation tax rates for both larger and smaller companies are being reduced by 2 per cent. in clause 18. Although I wholeheartedly welcome that, it must be put in context. The corporation tax rate for large companies was, I think, 54 per cent. in 1979 when we took over from the Labour Government for our 18 years in power. It is now being reduced by only 2 per cent. The corporation tax rate for small companies at the same time was 35 per cent.; that is also being reduced by only 2 per cent. The reductions in corporation tax by the Government are tiny. Nevertheless, they are welcome.
<P>
In my speech on the Floor of the House when we debated the Budget resolutions, I made it clear that the reductions will confirm the continuing trend of this country as a very low-tax domicile for companies. That will ensure that several of our large and successful international corporations will continue to retain their corporate headquarters here. More importantly, they will continue to retain their research and development functions in this country. It is all too easy in our fast-changing world for large corporations to demerge, to alter their domicile and to remove their funds to other parts of the world where they get a more favourable trading status.
<P>
The reduction in corporation tax came as a great surprise to me. I anticipated that the Government would do the opposite, but I welcome the change. Unfortunately, it is not being considered within the context of other measures in the Budget. As I made clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford in my intervention, the reduction in corporation tax as set out in table 4.4 on page 99 of the Red Book will involve--with associated tax changes in the Budget--an approximate increase in corporation tax of &#163;4.4 billion over three years. That is an increase of 15 per cent.--hardly consistent with the clause's perceived theme of a reduction in corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> There is some bizarre arithmetic going on here. One of the reasons why the Exchequer can anticipate an increase in revenues from corporation tax is because, as companies become stronger and more profitable, revenues to the state from corporation tax increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Perhaps the hon. Lady would allow me to develop my theme. If she re-examines table 2.2 on page 40, she will notice that several changes in the Budget lead one to suppose, if one does one's arithmetic, that the overall tax-take of corporation tax will be substantially higher than the amount envisaged in table 4.4 on page 99. I suspect that the reason why those two figures do not add up is because there will be a considerable amount of tax haemorrhage. Some of that may be caused by companies that try to domicile their headquaters elsewhere because of perceived further changes that the Government may make in future Budgets.
<P>
Taking with one hand and giving with another is a great theme of the Budget. When one adds up the figures for the withdrawal of advance corporation tax credits over the next four years, a staggering total of &#163;1,295 billion is to be taken out of this country's companies in that time. Anyone who thinks that that amount of tax withdrawal will not substantially affect those companies' profitability, their ability to reinvest and their research and development function, is deluded. One effect of the previous Government's reduction of corporation tax--the further reduction in clause 18 is to be welcomed--was that we were able to encourage into this country 40 per cent. of all European inward investment. That encouraged jobs in parts of the country--including the Economic Secretary's constituency and depressed parts of Wales. The deal where we were able to encourage Lucky Gold--thanks to measures that the previous Government put in place with the reducation of corporation tax--to revitalise those south Wales valleys that were left depressed by the closure of coal mines, was to be welcomed. It is a shame that the Government are giving something in clause 18--via a reducation in corporation tax--but taking away far more in ACT credit withdrawal.
<P>
I urge the Government carefully to consider in future Budgets how they should encourage a better business climate. I am keen for this country, even under the Government's stewardship, to become the world's enterprise centre. I want our unemployment rate reduced. I am sad to see the Red Book projection that unemployment will remain at 2 million for the foreseeable future. That is a shocking indictment and I hope that the Government will do better than that prediction in the short term. They need to keep reducing corporation tax and to keep providing firms with a business climate in which they can invest and carry out research and development. In that connection, I am sorry to hear rumours that research establishments that use more than 50 per cent. of their turnover in non-profit-making research could have that hurdle increased and may lose some of their corporation tax credits on their research and development work. That would be a sad day for some of our research establishments, and I hope that that rumour is not true.
<P>
I conclude by saying that I hope that the Government will encourage more firms to invest in this country; that they will give the right signals to businesses from the rest of the world to come and invest here. Plenty of businesses elsewhere still want to come here. I was in south-east Asia the other day where some firms are starting up high-tech businesses. I visited a firm making semi-conductors. It is a worrying trend for our country that a part of the world with much lower wages than ours is beginning to adopt our high technical standards. Unless we can continue to use our fiscal regime to encourage those firms to come to this country there will be a further haemorrhaging of capital and jobs--they will move away from this country, and I do not want that to happen. I hope that the Economic Secretary will think carefully about future budgets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I was fascinated by a remark that the Economic Secretary made at the start of our debate--she confirmed that a desire for improved quality of investment in this country lay behind the clause. In his Budget speech, the Chancellor made it clear that changes to corporation tax and to ACT tax credits were part of a structural reform of corporation tax that was designed to encourage investment by removing what the Government see as the bias in the tax system in favour of distribution, especially distribution through dividend payments.
<P>
To give the Government's view a crude formulation, the feeling that dividend payments are bad and that investments are good lies behind the Government's desire to reduce corporation tax and, through that, to remove the bias against distribution. That is one of the Budget's underlying thrusts. The Government think that reforming the corporation tax system so that companies are discouraged from paying dividends and encouraged to pursue research and development will be good for the British economy in the long run.
<P>
If I have understood the Government's thrust correctly--and I take silence on the Front Bench to indicate assent--I commend to them an extremely interesting piece of research from the City university business school, by Ameziane Lasper and Richard Taffler. They showed that the conventional wisdom to which the Government seem to have subscribed--that dividend payments are bad and that, in some senses, they act as a substitute for research and development--is simply not true. Such investments have been designed to determine the extent to which companies sacrifice growth opportunities through research and development by paying out excessive dividends.
<P>
The research involved examining the books of more than 2,000 UK-quoted companies, and the authors found that there is no evidence to support the thesis that underlies the clause and other changes to corporate taxes. Research and development and dividend payments are much more influenced by the sectors that the companies are in. The majority of companies that invest heavily in research and development are in sectors such as the pharmaceutical, health care, support services, vehicle engineering and the electronic and electrical equipment industries. The authors point out, by contrast, that not one company in the financial sector invests heavily in research and development. They conclude that far from there being a need for changes in the tax system--the clause, for example, aims to help long-term investment in British industry--the main determinant of research and development expenditure is industry specific.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Someone is bleeping. Will people either switch their bleepers to silent or take the batteries out? I am not sure whether the noise came from a member of the Committee or from someone in the Strangers' Gallery, but if the problem continues I shall have to take action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The research goes further. Some Labour Members may be tempted to say that research and development expenditure is industry specific and that it is related to the level of dividend payments within and between certain sectors. However, the research shows that that is not the case; it shows that there is no direct relationship between dividend payment ratios and investment in research and development, and that companies which invest heavily in research and development maintained a relatively heavy level of investment, even during periods of recession. The research suggests that the Government are wrong if they are hoping that the clause will lead to structurally improved performance through greater investment. They are also heading in the wrong direction because the research shows that companies which invest heavily in research and development are also likely to be good at paying dividends to their shareholders.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The corporation tax reductions, welcome though they are in general, will simply not achieve what the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary said they would achieve in terms of improving the long-term performance of British industry and, therefore, jobs, prosperity, future investment and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was listening to my hon. Friend with great care. The encouragement of research and development is most important for corporations. Does he believe that there is a case for the Government retaining ACT credit for those companies which carry out increased research and development?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing, not ACT credit, but rates of corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting and ingenious suggestion. The overall balance of corporate taxation, and whether and how that encourages long-term investment, will be of central importance to the success or otherwise of the Finance Bill and, more importantly, of British industry. That must be the criteria against which we measure the clause--will the reduction in corporation tax, of itself, do anything to increase investment? The Association of Consulting Actuaries has come up with a negative verdict on that. It said that the balance of the corporation and other tax changes in the Budget will be extremely damaging to long-term investment. Even those of us who are disposed to welcome the reduction in corporation tax find that a depressing conclusion. The Government have claimed that the cut in corporation tax will allow companies to boost investment and retain profits, and thus to fund higher pension contributions.
<P>
Even if the reduction in corporation tax in the clause were applied entirely to meeting increased taxes on pension funds, that would not, in aggregate, cover the increased costs required. Even within the terms of the Budget, the reduction in corporation tax does not compensate for other measures that take away from companies money that would otherwise be used to increase investment. It is clear that final salary pension funds will increasingly require additional contributions from the underlying business and that the cut in corporation tax will simply not be enough to cover those increased contributions, so it will not achieve its central objective of encouraging companies to invest more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Will the hon. Gentleman tell me whether he is opposed to the cut?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman does so, may I say that I envy his sight, but he should not be reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have quoted the Association of Consulting Actuaries and I took notes of some of its comments. I believe that that is in order, Mr. McWilliam, in developing my argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for Halton asked whether I am in favour of the cut in corporation tax. The Opposition are in favour of the cut and I am merely responding to what the Economic Secretary specifically said in her opening comments and pointing out that the cut, in conjunction with other measures in the Bill, will not achieve what the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary claim for it. The cut in corporation tax will take less money away from the corporate sector but other changes in the Budget take so much more away that companies will not be left with more money to invest for the long term--which, I understand, is the underlying purpose of the Budget. The reduction will not even cover the extra pension contributions that companies will have to make, especially those companies that rely on, and wish to continue with, final salary schemes, which tend to be more expensive. The net effect of the clause combined with other measures in the Bill will be to reduce investment and possibly encourage companies to take a more short-term outlook than they did before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Given that these measures are predicated on the fact there there is insufficient research and development, and the Government conjecture that it is because too many dividends are being paid out, is it not odd that the Government do not concentrate on introducing a system of tax credits against research and development expenditure as exists in other countries, particularly in France? Under that system, if R and D expenditure is increased above the average for the previous two years, companies can qualify for a 150 per cent. tax credit on their R and D, which will come straight out of their corporation tax expenditure. That seems to be a far more effective way of encouraging research and development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely interesting suggestion and one that I am sure the Government have carefully considered. My hon. Friend will be aware that, during the 1980s, the thrust of successive Conservative Budgets was to simplify the corporation tax regime. Perhaps the Government have taken the sensible view that the simplification introduced by my noble Friend Lord Lawson should be preserved. Perhaps they have realised that the great success of the economy over the past 18 years has been due, at least in part, to the attractions of lower corporation tax rates introduced by the previous Government and to the greater simplicity of the corporation tax system. Nevertheless, if the Government propose a major structural change to the corporation tax system in the context of trying to encourage long-term investment, it would be worth examining the systems used in other countries that directly encourage companies to put money into R and D. Perhaps we could encourage the Government to initiate a review, as that would be entirely consistent with their attitude in so many other areas of policy.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that reducing corporation tax by 2 per cent. will allow companies to make their own decisions about research and development?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It would indeed allow companies to do that if the overall effect of the Budget were to give them greater control over their own resources or even leave them with more of their own resources. But, as I have already said, the effect of the Budget will be to take more money from companies than is given back in corporation tax relief. Whether companies want to devote that money to R and D, dividend payments, expansion overseas or to anything else, despite the clause--the narrow effects of which we welcome--the net effect will be to give companies less control over their own future, so it is likely to be bad for the long-term health of the economy.
<P>
I want to mention small businesses, which are also dealt with in the clause because small business corporation tax rate is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax. The other measures in the Budget for small businesses more than make up for the cut in their corporation tax. The increased pension contributions for small firms, in particular, will force them either to change their system or to not allow new employees to join the company pension scheme, especially if it were a final salary scheme.
<P>
It is not clear that the Government have properly balanced for small businesses the advantage of the corporation tax cut when measured against the other provisions in the Budget. The small company sector, in particular, will find that its decisions are distorted under the clause. For example, the reduction in the rate will create a distortion of competition for unincorporated businesses. That is obviously a natural form for many small businesses, and the fact that the small business rate of corporation tax will now be below the income tax rate will give rise to an unfortunate distortion. Many small businesses, especially those that cannot afford extra--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing with corporation tax, not small business tax-- and certainly not the distortion in relation to income tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am dealing with subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The small companies' rate...shall be deeemed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am reading the Bill. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is reading. Clause 18 refers to corporation tax and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The small companies' rate for that year...shall be deemed always to have been, 21 per cent. (and not 23 per cent.)...All such adjustments shall be made''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not deal with a distortion in connection with income tax. Certainly, we can argue about distortion in relation to normal rates or corporation tax and small companies' rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that my hon. Friend is saying that it is open to business people to so configure their business to suit themselves in terms of its organisation and management and its tax regime. If the business is relatively small with a modest turnover, a choice can be made between incorporation or not. Is my hon. Friend saying that the change that puts the small companies' corporation tax rate out of line with the basic rate of income tax is likely to bias that decision in favour of incorporation even if that were not the choice of the business people?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That will be of specific importance to many small companies that will be unincorporated and paying not the new lower rate of tax but normal income tax rates. The clause will encourage those firms not to remain unincorporated. It will distort their decision making in a most unhealthy way, because tax planning will become a much more important part of their business than it would have otherwise. I am genuinely not sure whether the Government intended that to happen. It may be an unintended consequence of the clause that small companies will be encouraged to become incorporated, which would be unsuitable for many of them. It would involve them in greater expense and more difficult tax planning. The clause will send a signal to them to act in a way that would damage their business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Is not it rather perverse to provide a tax inducement to businesses to incorporate when they might not otherwise have done so? In so far as a man or woman is trading on his or her own account as a principal, he or she bears a greater proportion of the total risks of that business. A lesser proportion is therefore carried by suppliers, lenders and other stakeholders. One would think that in a rational system--we obviously do not have a rational Government--one might reward a business man or business woman for trading personally as a principal and taking on that additional risk with a more favourable tax regime. It is extremely perverse to penalise people who are prepared to bear a greater burden of business risks and to give a lower rate of tax to those who will bear a lesser burden of business risk as a result of incorporation; in addition, the rest of society has to bear the burden--albeit a lesser one--of paying for the cut through the tax-raising measures of the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes and excellent point and I suspect that he has highlighted an unintended consequence.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell us how he views the issue of admitted liability, for example, and its impact on the way in which small businesses organise their affairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that we would be happy to discuss a wide range of subjects.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not follow the hon. Lady down that path.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If instructed not to do so, of course I shall not, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is it in order for Government Members of the Committee to incite Opposition Bank Benchers to filibuster the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it is out of order, then they were out of order every time they did it to me over the past 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would my hon. Friend agree that a further consequence of subsection (2) and the distortion it creates between corporations and sole individuals and partnerships is that it will encourage entry into corporations which, for very small businesses, will mean extra legal and accountancy costs? There is an even more important consequence; whereas it is easy to form a corporation, it is much more expensive and difficult to wind up a corporation and go back to sole trader status.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I again caution the hon. Member for Cotswold that while that was an interesting argument, it is not relevant to the discussion about the rate of corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall conclude by asking the hon. Lady to deal in her winding-up speech with whether the Government intended that the clause should encourage small businesses to become incorporated when it might not be suitable for them to do so. If the Government did not intend that, do they intend to take action to give small companies advice about when it would and would not be sensible to incorporate and what they think the overall effect of the clause will be on the small business sector?
<P>
The problem with the welcome cut in corporation tax for small and large businesses is that it will not achieve what it is meant to achieve; it is there as a sop to make up for other tax-raising parts of the Budget. The Economic Secretary herself made the point that she was surprised that Opposition Members had not concentrated much on the provision in the debates so far. However, while several Opposition Members seem anxious to discuss the clause, no Labour Members seem to wish to speak in support of a part of the Budget that it allegedly most welcome. It is--[Interruption.] If they are willing to do so, I am sure that Opposition Members would want to hear them respond to our argument that while the measure is welcome, it is not a significant advantage to the British corporate sector because of the many other measures in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Further to the point made by the hon. Gentleman and in view of the fact that an official record is being taken of our proceedings, it would be advisable to record the fact that my hon. Friends have been seeking to intervene in the debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Lady is right; I spotted some Labour Members rising, but an Opposition Member was coming in at the time and I was not certain whether I could see them.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> I requested the opportunity to speak earlier as I wanted to contribute to the debate on the clause, especially after the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford seemed to suggest that business did not welcome the clause or the Budget. The day after the Chancellor made his Budget statement, I was pleased to receive a phone call in my constituency office from a distinguished local business person in Redditch. He is the managing director of a local manufacturing firm and a leading light in the Redditch manufacturers association. The only blot on his curriculum vitae, as far as I am concerned, is that he once stood for public office as a Conservative party candidate. Nevertheless, I was pleased when he said that the Budget was very good and that he had felt moved to contact us to tell us so.
<P>
Furthermore, as a director of the Redditch and Bromsgrove business link, I have had many contacts with small businesses in the area. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary rightly said, job creation in small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial, which is why many small businesses in Redditch have welcomed the cut in small business corporation tax rates. Whatever Conservative Members say, it is self evident that, all other things being equal, a cut in the rate of corporation tax for both small and larger businesses will encourage investment. It will enable businesses to do those things that they want to do for themselves and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) said, to take responsibility for their decisions. That is why businesses in Redditch welcome the clause.
<P>
Conservative Members claim that business will not welcome the Budget although, when pushed, they accept that businesses probably will welcome the clause--there is some ambivalence on the Opposition Benches about that. Businesses recognise, however, that one of the reasons why, in the past few years, they found it so hard to secure long-term investment was the economic instability that was created by the Conservative Government. That instability prevented the investment that the Government believe the Budget will promote. We have said that there is a need for high quality long-term investment. Small businesses in Redditch recognise that the Bill will facilitate that, and they welcome the clause.
<P>
It is clearly recognised that the Government are willing to move away from the previous Government's boom-and-bust economics and, through the reduction in corporation tax, to provide small and large businesses with the opportunity to spend their profits as they see fit. It is also recognised that the Government will provide long-term stability which, as many business people said to me before and after the election, is another crucial factor for investment. At last we have a Government who are willing to take decisions for the long term that will enable businesses in my constituency to prosper, which is why they particularly welcome the clause.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, the clause is good not only for business but, in the long term, for Government revenues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Lady talks at length about boom and bust, which the Government seem to want to avoid. Does she agree that the net result of the changes in advance corporation tax--we shall discuss that later, so I shall not elaborate now--is the lowest dividend yield ratio for our top companies since 1987 or 1974 when there were the biggest stock market busts for many years? How does that tally with her desire to get away from boom and bust?
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> In encouraging me to discuss a clause other than that which is the subject of this debate, the hon. Gentleman is making my point, which is that the Government have decided to move away from a distortion in the tax system which discourages long-term investment. That will help to promote the long-term, high-quality investment that is needed.
<P>
Under this measure, not only business but, in the long term, the Revenue will benefit because successful long-term investment--successful investment in human capital as is proposed by the Government under the new deal--will ensure that businesses grow and, therefore, are able to pay, even under this lower rate of corporation tax, into the Government's coffers so that that money can be spent on vital public services. The Budget--and especially clause 18 of the Bill--is good for business, the Revenue, jobs and the future of our economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I support clause 18. We welcome the cut in corporation tax; it is good for business. I was interested that the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) said that she had spoken to a business man in her constituency who had given a thumbs-up to the Budget. I wonder whether she has spoken to her local authority, her chief superintendent of police or people in the social services, because the cuts in public expenditure that are being introduced under the Budget severely affect them, and I would be surprised to learn that they welcome it.

<P>

<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that, in fact, my local education authority has told me that it welcomes the opportunities produced by the extra spending announced by my hon. Friend the Chancellor.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady have gone way outside the scope of the clause. I would be obliged if they would return to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Under your strictures, Mr. McWilliam, I shall do so.
<P>
My first concern about the cut in corporation tax is that it does not go far enough. To promote investment, the Government have introduced three or four changes to corporation tax under the Budget. First, they have introduced this cut in the rate of tax. Secondly, they have changed the incentives with respect to--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it is nice for hon. Members to see their hon. Friends having returned from a nice weekend at home--lucky them--but could they leave their greetings until lunch time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> As I was saying, Mr. McWilliam, in this Budget for investment, as it has been called, the Government have introduced three proposals on corporation tax which will support investment: the cut in corporation tax for large and small companies under clause 18; the change in advance corporation tax, which will change the incentive for companies to retain their profits to assist their cashflow on investment; and the overall net tax increase, which the corporation tax package represents, which will reduce long-term interest rates as part of the deficit reduction package and so support investment.
<P>
That is the positive side of the Government's corporation tax package. The negative side is that there is a net &#163;3 billion increase in the corporate tax sector. So the effects of the overall package must be weighed in the balance. The benefit to investment of clause 18 must be compared with the net impact of the &#163;3 billion tax increase.
<P>
It is highly debatable whether a &#163;3 billion tax increase every year can be offset by other cuts in corporation tax, the changes to incentives, or a long-term reduction in interest rates as a result of the overall tax increase. That is highly unlikely and, therefore, it is highly contentious to argue that this is a pro-investment Budget.
<P>
That argument could have held water if the cut had been larger, with a net &#163;3 billion yield, the Government could have taken another 3 per cent. or more off corporation tax. They chose not to do that, so by their own actions, they have not really promoted investment.
<P>
I suspected that the Government might choose another option: an increase in capital allowances for all businesses. The Labour party argued vehemently in previous Parliaments for increased capital allowances for all companies. That would have sat very nicely with the Budget because it would have meant a wholesale reform of the corporate tax structure that was both pro-investment and would change the incentives between dividends and retained profits, thus promoting investment through increased capital allowances. However, the Government chose not to do that, but instead to have a net yield.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That does not sit squarely with the Labour party's previous arguments. I remember the late John Smith and the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) arguing vehemently against the cuts in corporation tax introduced by the Conservative Government, saying that the money would be far better spent in increasing corporate tax allowances. Indeed, we used to hear long speeches from the right hon. Gentleman, now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, saying that cutting the rate of corporation tax was not the most effective way to increase investment. He would say that manufacturing investment was declining and give long lists of figures showing the United Kingdom at the bottom of the investment league. That was Labour's diagnosis; the prescription was to increase capital allowances. I am sorry to say that, at the first opportunity, they have failed to deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Have not we doubled the capital allowance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Indeed, that is the case, but, it is a time-limited increase in capital allowances and it is restricted to small companies. The net cost to the Exchequer will be a mere &#163;230 million in 1998-99 and only &#163;170 million in the following year. That will not offset the huge yield gained by the Treasury from the corporate sector through the other corporation tax measures.
<P>
I take no theological position on the argument between rates and allowances, but the Labour party used to argue strongly in favour of allowances. If anything, I tend towards the view of the previous Conservative Government that making cuts in corporation tax rates is the right way forward. That would enable companies to choose between investing and paying dividends, between paying wages and making profts. It would also ensure a better quality of investment. One of the problems with allowances is that companies will invest simply to use up their allowances, yet those investments may not be correct for a particular company at a particular time in the business cycle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On the subject of capital allowances and reductions in corporation tax, does the hon. Gentleman agree that almost the worst and most distorting change will be the time-limited capital allowance? That will merely encourage companies to make undesirable investments. The long-term effect of such allowances has always been to reduce the overall quality of investment decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but the conservative party is in no position to criticise, given the lamentable, Lamontesque Budget decision to introduce a time-limited capital allowance. Mr. Lamont, the then Chancellor, was reacting to Opposition pressure for capital allowances and making a populist point. That decision was lamentable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the time-limited capital allowance was increased by Mr. Lamont to deal with the recession? The empirical evidence arising from that experiment shows that it was not effective. That is why it will not be effective now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It was wrong when Mr. Lamont did it; it is wrong now. I believe that the Government should take a much wider view of corporation tax--indeed, of the whole business sector. It is my party's view that if sufficient resources are available to cut business tax, the most effective cut would be in the uniform business rate. That tax severely hits small and large businesses alike and it is difficult for them to adjust their behaviour in relation to it.
<P>
I should like to comment on the point raised by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)--the distortion that the clause will introduce between incorporated and unincorporated businesses--and to suggest a solution to the Government. If they were to give the Committee a timetable by which they intend to achieve their manifesto commitment of reducing the rate of income tax to 10p, unincorporated businesses would have a chance to plan and would not have to shift between the unincorporated and incorporated sectors without such knowledge. It would be wonderful if the Minister could put on record the timetable by which the Government will achieve that manifesto pledge.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman began by welcoming clause 18 but has spent the rest of his time criticising it and making alternative suggestions that do not form part of what we are supposed to be debating. Will he reaffirm his position on our proposal to reduce corporation tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I have no problem reaffirming my support for the clause, but it would be shortsighted and narrow-minded to consider the clause by itself--it is part of a Budget package. My point is that as an entirety, the Budget package for the corporate sector has got it wrong.
<P>
If the Government had really wanted to promote investment, they could have chosen either to cut the rate of corporation tax by several more percentage points, or to use the net &#163;3 billion yield to introduce capital allowances. They had that choice, and if they had taken one of those options, they would genuinely have been able to claim that this was a Budget for investment; because they failed to do that, they cannot take the credit and claim that the clause is the wonderful boon to investment that Labour members of the Committee have tried to make it out to be.
<P>
I would like clarification of the Government's philosophy towards corporation tax. Is it the Government's intention during the next few years always to favour cuts in the rate of corporation tax, or will they decide that allowances are the way forward? Judging by this Budget, it seems that they are not clear about that. It would help the corporate sector to have a clear statement of the Government's philosophy on corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Opposition members of the Committee do not oppose the clause, so instead they have had to introduce a range of irrelevant considerations to this morning's debate. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned snake oil; by the end of his remarks, I thought that he was selling it rather than being offered it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) gave us a tour of south-east Asia and talked about the need for inward investment. Of course, no one can disagree with that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford mentioned the importance of research and development; again, no one can disagree. He introduced the point about the distortive effect of the small business tax rate. I suspect that the incentive to incorporate will not be affected by the differential tax rate between incorporated and unincorporated small businesses.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Redditch mentioned small businesses in her constituency that have welcomed the Budget, and I would like to stack up against the negative comments that we have heard this morning the remarks of some leaders of United Kingdom industry. The chairman of ICI, Sir Ronald Hampel, welcomed the Budget and its

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting as wide of the mark of the clause as some other members of the Committee have strayed. We are dealing with corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam. The point that I was trying to make was that a number of leaders of industry have said that this measure, among others, will have a beneficial effect on the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman to return to the subject, Mr. McWilliam. He quoted ICI, which is perhaps an employer in his constituency. Will he give details of how the chairman of ICI thinks the company will benefit? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can give examples of how corporation tax savings, which we are discussing, will not outweigh the likely extra pension fund contributions from a pension fund that is only 94 per cent. funded, as one of the weaker ones of leading British companies? Will he elaborate on the chairman's comments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston</B><I> rose--</I><P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are talking about corporation tax, not pension funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Rather than respond to the hon. Gentleman, I shall obey your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, so I shall not enter into that discussion.
<P>
The measure will have a beneficial effect. Page 29 of the Red Book shows that 50,000 companies will benefit from the reduction in main corporation tax and that 400,000 smaller companies will benefit from the reduction from 23 to 21 per cent. from 1 April this year. As I said earlier, Opposition Members cannot oppose this beneficial measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Will the hon. Gentleman explain what has happened in the past few months that now allows him to consider that the measure will benefit those companies, when a cut in corporation tax has always been fiercely opposed in the past?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> One would think that I am a Minister, judging from the sort of interventions that I am provoking. I have not developed my argument sufficiently yet to respond directly to the hon. Gentleman. I was about to refer to the relative rates of corporation tax as a result of the proposed changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he has not yet developed his argument, but he said that certain companies would benefit. I am at a loss to understand the point of his argument. It requires elucidation, because I do not understand what has happened that suddenly will allow those companies to benefit when apparently they would not have benefited in the past, as shown by his party's decision to vote against every previous proposed change in corporation tax. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can explain that, otherwise it is difficult for us to follow the logic of his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I was prevented, by your ruling Mr. McWilliam, from going through a catalogue of remarks by leaders of industry who say that the measure will benefit them. Given that I cannot go any further on that line--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me assist the hon. Gentleman. He can pull out any catalogue he likes on leaders of industry who say that a change in corporation tax will either benefit them or disbenefit them, but he cannot go through a list of leaders of industry who say that other taxes that we have already dealt with or other allowances that we have yet to deal with will either benefit or disbenefit them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Let me try this one, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Anthony Bamford, the chairman of the JCB construction equipment company, said that the Budget was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``good for JCB and for most people in manufacturing because it will release more funds for investment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He seemed to be alluding directly to the reduction in corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will both hon. Members please resume their seats? They are both new, so I shall give them the benefit of the doubt. I advise the Committee that it is polite to give way and hon. Members may or may not give way as they wish, but it is the hon. Member who caught my eye and who has the Floor who makes the decision. If the hon. Member decides to give way, he or she sits down, but if not, he or she says no and that is that.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman gave way to me the other day, so I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I confess that I am still at a loss to understand even with the assistance of those words about JCB. That does not touch on the explanation that we are searching for with some difficulty: why the hon. Gentleman believes now that the measure would be of benefit when in previous years the Labour party voted time and time again against a cut in corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> As you rightly said, Mr. McWilliam, I am a new Member, so I do not want to go over old ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the measure is part of a stability package for long-term investment and that is why it is important at this time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend. Along with other measures, which I hope that we will eventually discuss in the Committee, the measure is part of a package designed to produce long-term stability. There are other measures that are well beyond the Committee's remit, such as the changes in the way in which the Bank of England operates.
<P>
I have tried about five times to develop this point, so I hope that I get it out this time. The result of this change is that the rate of corporation tax is lower now in this country than in the United States, Japan, Canada and large EU member states. The UK now has the lowest corporation tax rate for smaller companies in the whole of the European Union.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), whose contributions are always interesting, has been engaged for many years in tax planning and he knows well about tax arbitrage. I suggest that the effect of the differential--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is as entitled to be heard as any other member of the Committee and there are too many conversations going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The effect of the differential rate in this country will be that transactions will be structured in such a way as to take advantage of the lower rate. The result might well be a move, perhaps slight, of investment towards the UK. As I said at the outset, Opposition Members cannot oppose this tax. I suggest that we get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> It is interesting that Opposition Members have been talking away this morning and yet they are supporting the cut in corporation tax. From what they have said, I am surprised that they did not welcome the Budget and this clause. Share prices are soaring and numerous statements, some of which have been alluded to today, show that industry has in general welcomed the Budget. I have heard it said that it is a good start.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that it has consistently been the case that industry has welcomed cuts in corporation tax, a practice that was begun as a genuine policy under Conservative Governments, but which has been borrowed as any old dash by Labour Governments? What has led to the conversion by the Labour party, which now believes that it is right to promote and prosecute cuts in corporation tax whereas in the past it did not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I re-emphasise that, unlike the mess of the past 18 years, we are looking at a balanced Budget for stability and long-term investment--that is what it is all about; it is part of the package.
<P>
I do not want to engage in one-upmanship with my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith), but my constituency takes in the business district of Widnes. I talk to business men and women. Local small businesses have generally welcomed the Budget to the extent that only last week a person joined the party because he thinks that it is getting things right. The party has changed its focus totally and is the best in this country for business. That is not unusual--several business people have joined the party over the past six months--and people are coming over to our side in droves. Not just the party, but people in industry and business, small businesses in particular, are saying that our party is the best for them.
<P>
Research and development was mentioned. Extra funds are being provided for that and it is often the companies that sacrifice short-term profits to invest in research and development that do the best. On the non-defence side, research and development fell over the 18 years of Tory governtement--it is important to understand that. In this Budget, we are embarking on an improvement of research and development and bringing about even more competitive industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman say how many businesses and industries to which he has spoken--apparently they have welcomed the cuts in corporation tax--welcomed Labour's opposition to cuts in corporate taxation in the past?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I come back to the point they they now welcome our policy and the thread of the long-term investment and stability package. It is not worth going over old ground.
<P>
The main point is the reduction. A rate cut means that the United Kingdom has the lowest corporate tax rate of any major industrialised country. The UK also has the lowest small companies rate of corporation tax in the European Union for companies with a profit of up to &#163;300,000. Lower tax rates and enhanced capital allowances provide the right environment for investment. The UK remains a highly attractive location for inward investment. Those are facts--the Budget and the clause are about providing long-term investment and stability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that those criteria were in place before the general election--under the last Government--and have been increasingly pertinent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> The answer is no, which is why I again repeat that business is now supporting Labour and its Budget, which has been widely welcomed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman dismisses my comment rather easily but does he agree that before the Budget the UK already had the lowest rate of corporation tax in the EU and among the developed nations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> It is even lower now. The Budget is a stability and long-term investment package--that is what the Conservatives in government did not have and why industry was in such trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The hon. Gentleman talks about stability. Does that mean that if the Government proposed an increase in corporation tax within the lifetime of this Parliament he would oppose it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Our package, unlike that of the Conservatives, will succeed. The support out in the country for the package is clear. Business has stated why it supports the package and why it will be good for industry in the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Perhaps I should reassure the Committee that I am not winding up for the Opposition--my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells will do that in a moment.
<P>
I want to raise a specific point. I have often thought that participation in such debates contains an element of an adult education exercise. I hasten to say that I include myself in that statement. While preparing for this and subsequent debates, it became clear to me--at least I think that it did, if anything about the tax system ever does--that there is a special corporation tax treatment for unit trusts. I should make clear that these remarks are not intended to sow dissension between the various interests of unit trusts and investment trusts on the one hand or direct investors on the other.
<P>
When one has a package, one attempts to produce an overall balance. One reason why we are displeased with the degree of haste with which the series of radical changes before us is being undertaken is that it does not give us time to preserve that balance, and I shall advert to that on later clauses. My question for the Economic Secretary is simply this: if the unit trust rate is 20 per cent., will she confirm that she has no proposals to lower it, as she is doing with the main corporation tax rate? Incidentally, the unit trust rate is not very different from the smaller companies' rate as it is. Will the hon. Lady also confirm that the changes to the treatment of income that is received directly--for example, bond interest-- will reduce the disparity between investment trusts, which pay 33 per cent. at the moment, and unit trusts, which pay 20 per cent? I am not canvassing a final solution, but raising a point for elucidation. If matters were regarded as in balance before, they are now out of balance. Or is it the hon. Lady's contention that they are now being restored to balance?
<P>
That is the kind of small point that we should investigate as part of our deliberations. Beyond that, there are many other issues that I should like to raise: for example, the relationship with the imputation system and whether it is still appropriate; the balance between smaller and larger companies; and the impact of the rating system, which we should like to introduce into our debates. I shall, however, leave those wider considerations to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> I do not intend to go over many of the arguments that the Government have raised. I have listened carefully to Opposition members arguments. When they confine themselves to the clause 18 stand part debate, they acknoweldge that this is a positive proposal, and I have heard no dispute about that.
<P>
When we consider the reduction, it is important to remember that the economy has had a chequered history over the past 18 years. GDP growth has been slower than that of any of our major competitors. Productivity has been lower than that in any other G7 economy and the ratio of investment of GDP has been lower. Inflation has been more volatile than that of any G7 country. Investment growth--this is interesting--has undershot expectations over the past two years. We are now reducing corporation tax to start to redress those fundamental weaknesses in the economy and to put future growth and investment on a sound footing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Erewash. It is interesteing that a conversion to supply-side economics seems to be apparent if we focus our discussion narrowly on this clause. Labour Members now seem to realise the importance of keeping the rate of tax under control. They perhaps realise that if you have moderate or low rates of tax, they provide greater incentives for companies to make profits, engage in more projects, employ more people and invest. Low rates of corporation tax also render many marginal projects viable when you take the post-tax return on them. Throughout the past 18 years, however, whenever the previous Government introduced similar clauses to reduce corporation tax, the Labour party opposed them. It is interesting, if you consider that the hon. Lady talked about--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Three ``yous'' is nearly a flock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. It is interesting that the hon. Lady talks about productivity in this country. Over the past 18 years we have largely caught up in rates of productivity--we have a higher and faster rate of increase than any other major country in the European Union--because the Conservative Government engaged in wholesale supply-side economics. That gave companies and businesses an incentive to cut costs, to make profits and to be efficient. That was our achievement.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am gratified to learn that Labour Members have realised that lower rates of tax achieve greater business efficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I have received no answer to my earlier question about what led to the Labour party's conversion to supporting cuts in the rate of corporation tax when it hitherto always opposed them. What does my hon. Friend believe led the Labour party suddenly to see the light?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend would be surprised to learn--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Whip should not heckle either; there should be silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Witney will not be surprised to learn that I have no idea why the Labour party has suddenly become converted to supply-side economics.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> I wonder why the debate is so exercised by retrospection and sour grapes. I had thought that the reason we were here this morning was to scrutinise the Bill for the benefit of the long-term future of the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is important to understand the philosophy behind the Government's measures because--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My concern is simple. The clause is important and we support cuts in corporation tax. We have always supported them. I want to understand not only the basis of the Government's philosophy and the moment of their philosophical conversion--welcome though that is--but whether they truly believe in Labour party policy or will jettison it at the first opportunity. Opportunism is important in Labour party policy--[Hon. Members: ``Miaow.''] We seem to have some felines in the Committee. I am trying to establish whether, after studying the Conservative record over the past 18 years, it is a genuine conversion or an opportunistic attempt to mislead members of the public while the Government rob them left, right and centre on every other front.
<P>
I remain in difficulty about that because Labour Members have failed to respond to my question about when the conversion took place. I invited--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be interventions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a speech, I will be happy to call him later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Witney for his intervention. It is important to understand the reason for Labour's conversion. Throughout the country, businesses and invididuals will want to know about the philosophy behind the Government's corporation tax policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend is making a serious point about the supply-side structural reforms of the previous Government, which significantly reduced unemployment. It is also exemplified in France, whose Government are today considering increasing the rates of corporation tax, yet unemployment is still rising. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Labour party has grasped only part of the picture? If it had grasped the full picture, the overall rate of corporation tax would be reduced, not increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was about to come to that point. However, I should like first to focus on the philosophy aspect of the Government's economic and taxation policy. It is important that businesses understand the reasoning behind clause 18. There is a certain cynicism in the country about the Labour party's conversion to supply-side economics--
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will enlighten me, as I am slightly confused. I spent a long time in this Committee last week. As I understand it, the contention of Conservative Members is that there has not been enough time for a proper debate. Do you agree with the clause, because if so, is that not an inherent contradiction in that you are wasting the time of the Government and of those who are observing our proceedings in debating a clause you agree with, having tried to sell the country the argument that there is not enough time to debate the entire Finance Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not delaying the Committee. I hope that my occasional interventions are not too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have some important points to raise on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has just taken an intervention, so if the hon. Member for Witney is trying to intervene on the intervention, I must tell him that that is not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have a number of points to raise on the clause. Although Conservative Members are in favour of cuts in corporation tax, I want to explore the reasoning behind this one. Without understanding the reasons for it, business cannot be certain that this cut will be maintained.
<P>
A number of Labour Members have referred to stability and said that the essence of the Budget is stability. If business is to find credible the Government's claims that they want to bring about further stability in British economic policy, it must understand the reasoning behind the cut in corporation tax. Is there a fundamental change in the Labour party's attitude to that tax?

<P>

<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it has been made abundantly clear this morning that the reason for the proposed cut in corporation tax--and the reason why it is different from previous cuts--is that it forms part of a strategy for long-term and quality investment which was lacking previously? This Government are pledged to ensure stable long-term growth as opposed to the boom and bust economics that have prevailed. Therefore, it is part of an overall package. Does the hon. Gentleman recognise the very important contribution that the Government's new deal will play in supply-side economics? Does he agree that that will be welcomed by business?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I recognise that there is an inherent contradiction in the Budget, especially in this clause. Labour Members say that this is the lowest corporation tax rate in western Europe and the developed world. The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) claimed that tax arbitrage means that it will be worth while for companies in Europe to relocate to Britain because of the lower corporation tax. Yet the Government will impose on the same companies that they are trying to lure to Britain the huge additional costs proposed in the rest of the Budget. How can the Government claim that the Budget gives more money to companies to spend and invest as they please in research and development, while at the same time imposing enormous costs in extra pension contributions and extra taxes in the rest of the Budget? It does not make sense, which is why the credibility of the Government's conversion to supply-side economics does not stack up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Perhaps I might help him by pinpointing where along the road to Damascus that conversion took place. Does he agree that this is a sop? It is a velvet glove which disguises the grabbing fist that will be seen not only in the points that we hope we will cover today, but in the provisions of the social chapter, which will cost industry dear. Our Budget debates have not touched on that because it is not directly relevant, but its consequences will go well beyond the savings in corporation tax with which companies are now being lured, but which they will soon see through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend summarises the issue well. It is a veil over a Budget that increases the costs on business. The 2 per cent. cut in corporation tax is a sop, but behind it are damaging measures for business in this country, which, in the long run--and, indeed, in the medium run--will cause severe harm to the economy.
<P>
I should like to ask two technical questions, to which I hope the Minister will respond. The first concerns clause 18(2), which reduces the small companies rate from 23 per cent. to 21 per cent. In the past, there has always been a formal link between the small companies rate of corporation tax and the basic rate of income tax. I believe that removing that link will have severe repercussions for the Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
Have the Government examined tax legislation to ensure that removing that formal link will not create other repercussions that the Government have not considered? To date, the Bill has been a rushed affair--there has been almost no consultation with professional bodies outside the House, which is resulting in the Bill having many unintended consequences. I want to be sure that the removal of the link between the small companies corporation tax rate and the basic income tax rate, which has been in all the previous Finance Bills that I remember, will have no consequences.
<P>
My second question is linked to the first. Are the Government sure that they have not created a huge range of loopholes? We have already heard about the incentive to incorporate resulting from this provision. What other tax avoidance and tax planning opportunities have they given to the professional bodies by breaking that formal link? The link was always there to avoid such loopholes.
<P>
Page 46 of the Red Book contains a footnote about the revenue from corporation tax receipts. Paragraph 2A.7 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a fall in corporation tax resulting from companies increasing their contributions to pension funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would appreciate it if the Minister would quantify that, thus taking it from the footnote and on to the record.
<P>
Finally, I want to return to the issue of stability, to which Labour Members referred to on countless occasions. They claim that the cut in corporation tax in clause 18, from 31 per cent. to 31 per cent. and from 23 per cent. to 21 per cent., is part and parcel of a new stability that the Government are introducing. Will the Minister confirm that there are no plans to increase the rate of corporation tax--either the small companies rate or the normal corporation tax rate--over the lifetime of this Parliament?
<P>
What companies and business need when they are planning for the long term is to know that tax rates are not going to rise. If the corporation tax rate continued to fall, that would be a bonus, but if it were to rise, that would mean companies being locked into projects that were no longer viable because of higher post-tax returns. Will the Government give a commitment that there will be no rises in corporation tax over the lifetime of this Parliament?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> May I speak first?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Yes, if the right hon. Gentleman wants to do so.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for allowing me to speak first. It is probably for the convenience of the Committee that she winds up the debate. I want to make a couple of points and emphasise some of the concerns that have been raised by my hon. Friends.
<P>
First, I want to correct what I am sure the hon. Lady will agree is a mistake. She said that I and other Opposition Members had not mentioned the cut in corporation tax earlier in the proceedings. In fact, I referred to it on the Floor of the House. One always welcomes any tax reduction that is put forward by a Labour Government--they are so rare as to be genuine causes for celebration. What I did then, however--and what I intend to do now--was to put it in the context of this massive tax-raising Budget.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate on clause 18, not least because we have tempted out into the political arena a number of new Members from whom we have not heard much up until now. It is striking that all of them are new to the House in this Parliament. They exemplify an extraordinary discontinuity between new Labour and old Labour. Suddenly we hear all this talk about the private sector--how important it is and the need to relax the tax burden on it--but we all remember old Labour. Indeed, in similar economic debates only a few months before the last election there was a very different emphasis in the speeches that we heard from members of this Committee who served on previous Finance Bill Committees. So far, however, they have not contributed to the debate on this clause.
<P>
Of course one welcomes any reduction in taxation on the corporate sector, but that is not what the Budget, or this clause, will achieve. Although clause 18 will cut the rate of corporation tax, the burden will not be relieved for some time. That is made clear in the notes on clauses, which are fairly candid in that regard. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The full cost of the cut in the rates will not arise until 1999-2000 because companies do not pay corporation tax until a full nine months after the end of their accounting periods.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Thus, a company trading today with a typical year end of 31 March next year will not be paying its corporation tax until nine months after that, whereas all the other taxes are being imposed from the date of the Budget.
<P>
Table 2.2 in the Red Book makes that clear. It shows that the reduction in corporation tax starts to have effect in the next financial year--again, nothing whatever for companies in the current year--while the advance corporation tax restriction takes effect from Budget day. There is a &#163;2.2 billion hit to such dividend in the hands of pension funds in the current financial year, which rises to a staggering &#163;5 billion a year in two years' time. One can add to that all the other increases in corporate taxation in the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a very good point about the cut not taking effect until nine months after the end of the financial year of most companies. When one combines that with the fact that the advance corporation tax rate has not been reduced, as far as companies' cashflow is concerned, they will still have to pay advance corporation tax of 25 per cent. of the net dividend as soon as they pay a dividend, although the benefit of the tax cut will not take effect until nine months after the end of their financial year. Thus companies will not feel any effect from the cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend, who understands corporate taxation, makes a good point. One of the bizarre features of the Finance Bill is that it begins the effective dismemberment of the imputation system while still requiring companies to make advance corporation tax payments. I shall return to that issue a little later.
<P>
I mentioned the ACT tax credit restriction, which is an immediate burden on the corporate sector, even though the benefits from the cut in corporation tax will be postponed.
<P>
We demonstrated last Friday how the windfall tax will have an effect on investment. I must not stray into that debate again, but that tax is a huge additional burden on many British companies at the same time that they may be benefiting from a reduction in corporation tax.
<P>
There are also indirect tax changes, in particular the hydrocarbon duty increases. From 2 July, there is a 4p a litre increase in duty on petrol and on diesel. Businesses are the overwhelming users of diesel so that increase goes straight on to the cost of haulage and the price of goods. That burden, which is an additional &#163;730 million in this financial year, will hit the individuals whom we represent and the corporate sector.
<P>
It is clear that the reduction in corporation tax is a figleaf to cover a huge and growing increase in the tax burden on the corporate sector. All the talk about being business friendly and helping the private sector is misleading and shows that although new Labour has the face of being friendly to the private sector, this is yet another Labour Budget which increases taxation for everyone, particularly the corporate sector. That is why the Government were criticised in some quarters.
<P>
We are told by the Chancellor that we are threatened with an overheating economy and a consumer boom, but rather than directly and honestly tackling consumers by increasing taxes on them, the Chancellor acted in a roundabout way and the biggest, most immediate burden falls on the corporate sector. That was a deliberate tactic and nothing in the clause can alter that.
<P>
The Labour party did not invent reductions in corporation tax. In 1979, when we came into office, we inherited a corporation tax rate of 52 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold made one of his rare mistakes by saying that he thought that the rate was 54 per cent. but he is entirely forgiven for thinking that because we all remember the crippling burden of taxation on the private sector at that time. The only companies that did well in those days were the state utility monopolies, which did not pay any tax because they did not make any profits. They were collectively absorbing &#163;50 million a week subsidy from the taxpayer for most of their activities.
<P>
Under successive Conservative Administrations, we turned that round so that the same companies, in the private sector, were eventually contributing to the Exchequer &#163;60 million a week in taxation. My hon. Friend for Cotswold was entirely right to draw attention to the dramatic shift in taxation that we engineered, which meant that even though we brought down the main rate of corporation tax to 33 per cent., the tax was still netting a great deal more from companies because they were cash producers instead of cash absorbers.
<P>
I remind the Committee also that in those days national insurance contributions were levied at 13.5 per cent. on the employer. We all remember the infamous national insurance surcharge that took the rate up to that level. That was a direct tax on companies and jobs, and represented a huge amount of money. We reduced the rate to 10 per cent. The previous 0.2 per cent. reduction, from 1 April this year, cost half a billion pounds, which is illustrative of the colossal burden that the employers' contribution of 13.5 per cent. was costing British industry up to 1979. In all ways, and at every opportunity, we reduced corporation tax, bringing the main and the small rate down to these historically low rates.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that when the corporation tax rate was at a staggering 52 per cent., which the previous Conservative Government inherited, the first-year capital allowances on plant and machinery were 75 per cent. A combination of those two measures meant that many manufacturing companies were making a loss for tax purposes but a profit for accounting purposes. The corporation tax take from the manufacturing sector was very small, and by reducing the rates of corporation tax, as we did over our years in office, together with reducing the capital allowances, the corporation tax take increased. That demonstrated a supply-side effect of reducing corporation tax. It is gratifying to see that a Labour Government have now accepted the supply-side effects of cuts in corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend spoke knowledgeably about supply-side reforms, some of which have been adopted, at least by word, by the Government. It is true that corporation tax in those days combined a high rate with a distorting system. It was our achievement to bring it down and widen the base, making the system non-distorting.
<P>
Of course we welcome any further reduction in corporation tax. It carries on a trend that we instituted. However, we did not load huge additional burdens on the corporate sector, while pretending that we were helping businesses. One of the previous Government's last proposals was a rates relief for small businesses whereby the first &#163;1,000 of the rateable value of their premises would be ignored and discounted for rate valuation purposes. That would have brought direct and immediate help to that small business sector about which we heard so much earlier in the debate.
<P>
Although a reduction in corporation tax is welcome, it remains the case that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses are not incorporated, so the clause is of no help to them. The Labour party is falling into the trap of talking to big businesses at the expense of listening to what the small business man or woman wants. It is a trap easily fallen into: Parliament is in the south-east, where the headquarters of many large companies and multinationals are also based. They have teams of people who talk to civil servants and Ministers and make known their demands. So a cut in corporation tax gets a cheer in the City of London and among some industrial headquarters in the south-east. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of thousands of small unincorporated businesses elsewhere in the country which are completely overlooked when it comes to a corporation tax cut.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The right hon. Gentleman may have a south-east perspective on life, but he should take into account the wide spread of Members of Parliament represented in Committee who see as their main responsibility their contact with their constituents, many of whom are small business people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not take a south-east perspective; I take a south-west perspective. The businesses in the south-west, about which I can talk knowledgeably--and at some length, Mr. McWilliam, but not on this occasion--are overwhelmingly small businesses which are not incorporated. They know quite well that employment is being generated in the small business sector, particularly the service sector, not by large corporations whose headquarters are in London.
<P>
Let us take a company at random. British Petroleum is a fine British company, which is doing very well. It has halved its work force over the past five years. Under the guidance of Lord Simon, who is now a member of the Government, British Petroleum has sacked half its work force, both globally and in the United Kingdom. So such companies have nothing to teach us about employment. It is the small businesses, unincorporated businesses, partnerships, sole traders, small manufacturing and service companies in our constituencies that are generating the jobs on which the economy depends, but the clause will give them little to look forward to.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman provide us with the figures supporting his assertion that the vast majority of small businesses are not incorporated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I need notice of that. If the hon. Gentleman seeks an accurate figure, he need only table a written question to the appropriate Minister. He will receive an answer in three days or more--I say ``or more'' because many of the written questions that I have recently submitted received only holding replies. If the hon. Gentleman persists, however, he will find out the exact figures, but I can tell him that most businesses in this country are unincorporated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the distorting effects of reducing the rate of small businesses and separating it from the basic rate of income tax will be that they will now be tempted to pay out more in directors' fees and partnership profits that they would otherwise have done? That could have a damaging effect on the long-term viability of those businesses because they will have fewer retained profits to reinvest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That could be the unintended consequence of the Bill. My hon. Friend makes a good point, which I was about to develop, about upsetting the balance between the incorporated and unincorporated sectors. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) also spoke about the problem. He too noticed that the clause fractures the link between the two sorts of businesses and the way in which they are taxed. It could encourage businesses to incorporate, which could be a mistake. Businesses would gain the advantages of limited liability--the Economic Secretary spoke about the importance of that--but it is only fair to warn them that incorporation also brings expense, audit requirements and other problems. It is also difficult to reverse, so business people would be ill advised to respond to the signal in the clause and change their status.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not mean intentionally to mislead the Committee, but I merely inquired about the Opposition's view of limited liability. If the right hon. Gentleman recalls, it was through your good offices, Mr. McWilliam, that it was suggested that I was luring him down a route that he should not have been taking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We had better all not go down that route--mindful of your strictures, Mr. McWilliam, about keeping in order.
<P>
The serious point that is germane to the clause is that the provision cuts this form of direct taxation on incorporated businesses but does nothing for the majority of companies without that status. It thus sends a curious message to the small business sector and could have damaging unintended consequences.
<P>
In her opening remarks, the Economic Secretary spoke about the need to encourage inward investment. I was sad when I thought that I heard her describe her own country as an underdeveloped region. That is certainly not my view of Scotland which, encouraged by successive Conservative Governments, has benefited enormously from inward investment in recent years. It has been almost a model economy in attracting businesses from overseas by keeping down non-wage costs, regulations and tax levels.
<P>
That makes it even more important for the Government to clarify their intentions about foreign income dividends. I am aware that we shall be debating that later on. However, it is a disgrace that the Government signalled a rethink without telling the Committee exactly what is happening. We know that they are in a muddle about it. They published a Bill with a clause that would have a damaging effect on businesses either located here already or considering whether to locate here. We hear that the Treasury was contacted by a number of large multinational companies threatening to leave the United Kingdom if the Bill was not amended.
<P>
I hope that, in her reply to the debate, which has been about corporation tax and has, therefore, touched on comparative taxation in this country and overseas, the Minister will clarify where we stand in relation to the taxation of foreign companies in this country and of British companies with large foreign earnings.
<P>
Lastly, I want to press the Government a little about the future of the corporation tax system. Opposition Members have observed several times that we have a partial imputation system, which is gradually being eroded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Deconstructed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, deconstructed, as my hon. Friend aptly describes it. We may be dismantling the system by abolishing dividend tax credits and by means of the additional changes that have been signalled for 1999, but it is not clear what sort of system we are getting. It is true that advance corporation tax remains in place and that companies are, therefore, still required to pay a proportion of their corporation tax at the same time as they pay their dividend. That, I am sure, is to stop the Treasury experiencing an erosion of cash flow. That does not, however, require the imputation system of corporation tax to continue and could be guaranteed simply by requiring a percentage of corporation tax to be paid on account. The partial imputation system was designed to achieve something else: to stop double taxation in respect of shareholders. The Budget ends that measure in relation to pension funds. A reduction and further abolitions are signalled for and will, indeed, be enacted in 1999.
<P>
It is not clear whether we are stumbling towards a further modification of the imputation system--going back to a classical system--or going back further to the system of profits tax which previously existed and which some of us can dimly remember. Given that the Government have made so much of the need for stability, clarification, openness and consultation and of the need to be business friendly, the least that they can do is explain exactly what their plans are in this important area of corporate taxation.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have spent two and a half hours on clause 18; I am glad of that because, as I said earlier, it forms an important part of Labour's proposals for bringing stability and growth to the economy.
<P>
I am, however, surprised by Conservative Members' tactics. We have been all round the houses on several occasions, without necessarily making much progress. In fact, hon. Members have talked in circles. A couple of Opposition Members began at the beginning and found themselves going back again. Had I been on the opposite side of the debate, I would have been anxious to ensure that the Bill was properly scrutinised and to get on to the detail of some of the later clauses, not least those on tax avoidance, which is an important issue. Quite frankly, when I heard the remarks of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford at the beginning of our debate, my response--I suspect that this is not parliamentary language--was ``Come off it.'' The hon. Gentleman made a case for allowing tax avoidance to continue; his remarks did not relate to the levels of corporation tax. I shall refer in due course to the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
First, however, I want to draw attention to the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), for Halton (Mr. Twigg) and for Redditch, who mentioned the broad welcome that business has given the Chancellor's Budget. I found it interesting that whereas my hon. Friends were prepared to name names when talking about those who supported the Budget, all we got from the Opposition was ephemera. I want to draw attention to a specific comment from the Institute of Directors, which is not usually regarded as the Labour party--or even the new Labour party--at prayer. It welcomed the clause, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These reductions give permanent incentives to set up or support businesses and therefore to create jobs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should have thought that that summed up the purpose behind the clause.
<P>
Several members of the Committee, not least the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, have made contributions. I think that the word ``disingenuous'' has been used--in an attempt to attack me--but I would turn that back on the hon. Gentleman. At least he had the grace to make his remarks with arched eyebrows. I am glad to see that he has obviously had an enjoyable weekend in the sunshine.
<P>
Frankly, a number of the hon. Gentleman's arguments were for tax avoidance. He also referred to the windfall tax--your good graces, Mr. McWilliam, protected him to some extent--and some of his points were bizarre. That is the only way in which we can comment legitimately on them. I got the impression that he was trying to suggest, although it was not clear, that companies would go into a state of chaos as a consequence of the windfall tax. The tax will affect only a tiny number of companies whereas the cut in company tax rates will affect about 500,000 companies. The hon. Gentleman is stretching credulity rather far if he is making a direct read-across from one unto the other.
<P>
Furthermore, a number of his hon. Friends have questioned the Government's attitude to corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that I was looking at the aggregate burden on the corporate sector of the taxation imposed by the Budget. The windfall tax hits successful corporations. It is perfectly reasonable to include that in any calculation of the tax burden on the corporate sector. I am sure that the hon. Lady agrees that windfall tax is a corporate tax--it falls on corporations.
<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Good try! It was obvious during the hon. Gentleman's initial speech that he was rounding up the figures in the Red Book. I was delighted to see that he raised his eyebrows when he spoke, because he could not take some of those points seriously. Nevertheless, we recognise the tactics of the Opposition--they have been practised in the House for some time. I am sufficiently new to the House not to have been involved with them when we were the Opposition, but I acknowledge that they are used.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to double capital allowances and to leasing. We shall come to those matters later, although the mischievous thought had occurred to me that perhaps he would prefer that we did not reach those clauses or those dealing with tax avoidance, because that is the logical extension of the position that he took. If it--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There seems to be a community heckle going on.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam--as long as it does not degenerate into community singing, we can probably live with it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the Government, and myself in particular, were seeking to deceive. He was gracious enough, at your suggestion, Mr. McWilliam, to change that word to ``mislead''. Prior to and throughout the general election campaign, we made it clear that we wanted a corporation tax structure that would allow a climate of investment and growth. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cotswold had to admit that he was completely wrong--he did not expect a Labour Government to reduce corporation tax. A number of hon. Members have asked why we have done it. We have reduced corporation tax because we are able to use the revenues from the abolition of ACT to benefit the corporate sector directly.
<P>
When the previous Government reduced ACT they did not use the revenue to benefit corporate life in Britain, but filled a hole in the public sector borrowing requirement that was of their own making--they were inefficient and ineffective in running the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown</B><I> rose--</I><P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.

It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
