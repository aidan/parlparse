							<a name="080221106000278"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> What a delight it is to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Bercow, particularly given that you look so refreshed
after a couple of days&#146; rest from the Committee&#146;s
deliberations. It is also a delight to see the hon. Member for Bristol,
West in his place, because we have missed him.</div>
					<a name="080221106000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to ensure that
young people are not discriminated against at work simply because they
wish to fulfil their duty to participate. Clause 32 makes it clear that
employers must not discriminate against 16 or 17-year-olds for
exercising their right to be permitted by their employer to attend
education or training and that it would be deemed as unfair dismissal
if someone were dismissed solely on those grounds. As the Committee is
aware, young people will be required to participate only until they are
18, so there will be many cases where a young person will not have been
continuously employed for a year while they are still subject to the
duty to participate.</div>
					<a name="080221106000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally,
there is no right to claim unfair dismissal without a year&#146;s
continuous service, but amendment No. 136 means that claims for unfair
dismissal under new section 101B, which clause 32 creates to deal with
this issue, should be exempt from the usual requirement to have
undertaken a year&#146;s continuous employment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div>Amendment No. 135 is a further, consequential amendment to the
Employment Rights Act 1996, which clarifies the fact that it would be
unfair to select someone for redundancy for the same reasons. I
therefore propose that the amendment be
accepted.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) Prior to
entering into a parenting contract the local education authority shall
ensure that parents&#146; needs are assessed by the appropriate local

services.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="080221106000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome
back to the Chair, Mr. Bercow. You seem to be doing overtime
at the moment, but you are very welcome. There is something rather
incongruous about clauses 34 and 35 and about the use of parenting
contracts and parenting orders to enforce the duty that the Bill
imposes on 16 and 17-year-olds. That goes back to our earlier debate
about what age constitutes maturity and the beginning of adulthood, and
that is particularly pertinent to these provisions.</div>
					<a name="080221106000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sixteen-year-olds
are regarded in law as old enough to marry and have children, so they
could become parents themselves, only to find that their own parents
are subject to a parenting contract about them. It is unrealistic to
expect parents to rein in, or change the behaviour of, 16 or
17-year-olds who have decided to opt out of education and training.
There might have been parenting problems while the children were
growing up, and those problems might have contributed to the fact that
the young person is no longer participating in education or training.
It is naive and unrealistic to think that applying a parenting contract
or order at this stage would help to tackle the issue, because it would
be too late.</div>
					<a name="080221106000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221106000280"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con):
I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Bercow. I hope that I can assist my hon. Friend by reminding him that
when he and I, in harness together, put it to the Minister in a
Committee on a different Bill that parenting contracts should have
greater statutory force at an earlier age, the Government resisted our
overtures, so the current proposals are indeed
incongruous.</div>
					<a name="080221106000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000281"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I am grateful
to him for intervening. As he says, it will be too late to introduce
parenting contracts, which would need to have been put in place when
the children really were children.</div>
					<a name="080221106000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year,
13,278 parenting contracts were made as a result of poor school
attendance, which is 89 per local authority, using the
Minister&#146;s assessment of quantum. Some 2,535 contracts were made
as a result of exclusions from school, which is just 17 per local
authority. I suspect that the number of parenting contracts that will
be issued as a result of the clause and as a consequence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 571</div>of 16- and 17-year-olds not participating in education or training will
be small. It will certainly be smaller than the 89 and 17 per local
authority issued in respect of children of compulsory school
age.</div>
					<a name="080221106000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 33 adds a new subsection to clause 34, requiring local authorities
to ensure that the particular needs of the parents are assessed by the
adult services department before a parenting contract is proposed or
entered into. The amendment was inspired by the Princess Royal Trust
for Carers, which is concerned that young people who are carers,
responsible for sick parents or siblings, may find themselves in breach
of the duties to participate in education or training because of the
burden of their own
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="080221106000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
trust believes that before local authorities begin the enforcement
process and approach the parents of those carers, they should assess
the needs of the parents themselves, who may be ill or incapacitated.
Community services may have proved inadequate, thus necessitating care
by their children. In those cases, the local authority or primary care
trust may have failed to fulfil its statutory duty to provide care for
the parents. As the trust states in its briefing, the fact that there
are so many young
carers</div>
					<a name="080221106000040"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;points to the
fact that the current provision of community care support often does
not meet the needs of families, requiring children to step into caring
roles that can be incredibly demanding, including night-time care,
intimate care, help with medication and taking responsibility for the
safety of someone who is at risk of self-harm or substance
overdose.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will agree with our concern over the problems
faced by young carers, and I am sure that it is a simple oversight that
has resulted in the Bill failing to include such provision. If the
Government do not accept the amendment, down the line we will see
officious local authorities proceeding with parenting contracts,
apologetically explaining that their hands are tied by the legislation.
I trust that we will receive a sympathetic response from the Minister,
and, at the very least, a promise of a Government amendment along
similar lines on
Report.</div>
					<a name="080221106000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221106000282"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): It is nice to be back in
Committee, and I thank the Minister for his warm welcome. I am
representing my party while my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil is
engaged on business
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="080221106000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I broadly
support what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said.
One of the most moving meetings that I have had in the period of almost
three years in which I have been a Member of Parliament was with a
group of young carers, organised by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers
in Bristol. The children present ranged in age from the quite young,
who would not be affected by the Bill, to the late teens, who would be.
Some of them had had incredible responsibilities placed on their young
shoulders, as in many cases, they looked after a parent with multiple
sclerosis or a terminal disease, or a sibling&#151;a responsibility
to which the hon. Gentleman did not
refer.</div>
					<a name="080221106000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often
teenagers have onerous home responsibilities that are not recognised or
taken into account during the period of compulsory school attendance to
the age of 16. As a result, more time and consideration may be required
if, for instance, they have not done their homework, they turn up late
for school, or they need to make phone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div>calls during the day. There is plenty of evidence showing that the
existing system of compulsory education does not take into account the
special requirements of that group of young
people.</div>
					<a name="080221106000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
those young people reach the age of 16 or 17 and have to take part in
compulsory education to meet the requirements of the legislation, they
may not be able to fulfil their domestic responsibilities to assist in
the care of their parents or siblings. It would then be unreasonable
for the state to impose a duty and a contract on the parent to allow
their child to be away from home when they are dependent upon their
child for part of their home care. The debate about whether it is fair
that the parent should be dependent upon that child is for another
time, but the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton gave a
good common-sense example to show that it could be detrimental to the
rights of the parent if their child were obliged to attend college or
go to the workplace when that they are dependent on the child for
domestic
assistance.</div>
					<a name="080221106000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221106000283"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Gordon Marsden</b> (Blackpool, South) (Lab): I have
considerable sympathy with the concern that the hon. Gentleman has
articulated, but I would be interested to know what evidence he has
that local authorities that have to deal with attendance issues in the
pre-16 period are unsympathetic to the circumstances in which young
carers find
themselves.</div>
					<a name="080221106000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000284"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I know from the questions that the hon.
Gentleman asked when we both served on the Education and Skills
Committee that he takes a close interest in these matters. My evidence
came directly from the young people I met, who thought that their
schools were not sympathetic to the requirements placed on them by
their home duties. We have received written evidence from the Princess
Royal Trust that the absence of a child who is a carer from school is
often categorised as truancy, and we have had debates in Committee and
elsewhere about what is authorised and what is unauthorised absence.
There is already a problem with the way in which those children are
categorised by the local authority, and we do not want that problem to
be replicated later in the system. The amendment responds to concerns
that the measure would put an onerous duty on the parent to ensure that
their child attends college. That could be going too far, so I wish to
support the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="080221106000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000285"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I shall begin by saying a few
things about the principle of parent contracts and orders, then move on
to address the amendment. It is worth pointing out to the Committee
that we already have parenting contracts and orders for over-16s with
regard to behaviour. It is only the duties limited to school attendance
that apply to compulsory school age. As we discussed when we debated
whether it is appropriate to impose a duty post-16, the principle is
established that the period between the ages of 16 and 19 is a
transitional period between childhood and adolescence, and it is
appropriate in certain circumstances to look at parents&#146;
responsibilities for people of that
age.</div>
					<a name="080221106000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080221106000286"></a>
							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): The amendment raises the
issue of circumstances in which there are two parents in the equation.
There is the first generation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 573</div>parent: the parent of the teenager. If the teenager concerned is a
16-year-old girl who is herself a mother, she, too, is a parent and has
parenting responsibilities. If that girl does not remain in the family
home and is living in hostel accommodation or a council flat, under the
terms of the Bill, is that a sufficient and reasonable excuse for her
not to be engaged in education or training? Where does the
responsibility lie for the continuing education and training of the
teenage girl? Does it lie with her
parents?</div>
					<a name="080221106000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000287"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I think that I have the drift and, more
importantly, I think that the Minister does,
too.</div>
					<a name="080221106000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000288"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Yes, I think so, and I am
grateful to the hon. Lady for giving me an opportunity to seek to
clarify that issue. In such circumstances, it is important that the
mother of the young child, as opposed to the parent of the young
mother, should receive appropriate support. There should be no
enforcement against her unless that support is in place and a programme
is available such as care to learn, which assists young parents with
child care when they want to access college courses. All of those
factors would need properly to be taken into consideration by the local
authority in fulfilling its duty to enable young people to fulfil their
duties.</div>
					<a name="080221106000251"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="080221106000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
extremely unlikely that an authority would think it appropriate to use
a contract or an order for the parent of a young mother. The test set
out in subsection (2)(b) is
that</div>
					<a name="080221106000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the authority
considers that entering into the parenting contract would be desirable
in the interests of the young person&#146;s fulfilment of that
duty.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
test is whether it would be useful in assisting the young person, and
the Committee must take that into account in its discussions on
parenting contracts. There may be cases in which parents obstruct young
people in the fulfilment of their duty. For example, they might insist
that the young person remains at home looking after younger siblings or
they might indulge in some form of antisocial activity late into the
night that keeps the young person awake. It would be appropriate to
reach an agreement with such parents&#151;and that is what a
parenting contract is&#151;to set out quite clearly that they have a
responsibility to ensure that their children get a reasonable
night&#146;s sleep so that they can participate in their college or
training
course.</div>
					<a name="080221106000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally,
I agree with the sentiment and intention behind the amendment in
respect of carers. It is critical that the local authority assess the
support needs of young carers. A cross-Government review of the
national carers strategy is under way, and provides an opportunity to
reassess the support available to young carers. Young carers have been
consulted and stakeholder bodies with knowledge of the issues are fully
engaged. We look forward to receiving the detailed recommendations
later this year. In the interim, to help secure early progress, we
announced in the children&#146;s plan our intention to build on our
existing plans for family pathfinders. Up to six pathfinders will be
extended to test the provision of more effective support for families
with young carers. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>The aim is to achieve better provision by ensuring that support is
organised so that children in the family do not fall into inappropriate
or burdensome caring roles in the first place. Pathfinders will provide
invaluable learning on these issues, which will be shared across all
areas, and &#163;3 million is available over the next three years to
support that goal. We are also funding the Children&#146;s Society
and the Princess Royal Trust, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton mentioned, to deliver a programme of training for
services that support young carers and their families. That training is
due to roll out across the first set of regions early this
year.</div>
					<a name="080221106000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect local authorities to assess the needs of the parent before
entering into a parenting contract. Guidance for local authorities on
parenting contracts for non-attendance of children under 16 says that
they should consult other agencies involved, identify issues and carry
out an assessment using the common assessment framework. However, it
would not be appropriate to make that a statutory requirement. It will
be for local authorities to judge what is appropriate in each case,
having regard to guidance and to any assessment that they have carried
out regarding the parent and the young person. They may be well
acquainted with the family&#146;s circumstances, for example,
as a result of the involvement of other local authority services, so
such an assessment might not always be necessary. Requiring local
authorities to carry out an additional assessment when they have
recently completed an assessment of the family would be an additional
and unnecessary burden. It is better to retain flexibility by keeping
the provisions as they are at the
moment.</div>

						</b> Does the Minister think that communications between
the statutory bodies that deal with such problems are adequate, given

						</b> I think that they can always be improved, and we
are gradually doing so. We have made really good progress on
safeguarding young people, which will be improved further by the data
sharing that we so much enjoyed discussing on Tuesday. That will allow
agencies dealing with young people to see which other agencies have had
access to them. If they are part of the same local authority, there is
even greater potential for people to be aware of what is going on in a
particular family, through case conferences and so on. I agree with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention, and I stress that I expect local
authorities to conduct assessments, but I urge him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> I am not persuaded by the Minister&#146;s
response. He seems to be relying on the assertion, to repeat his
phrase, that &#147;We would expect parents&#146; needs to be
assessed&#148; and that there is a statutory requirement to consult
other agencies. However, there is not a statutory requirement to assess
the needs of these particular parents. I am afraid that I do not have
the same trust as he does in the communication abilities of the people
who should take that responsibility.</div>
					<a name="080221106000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even now,
after the Every Child Matters agenda has been implemented across local
authorities, at vast expense and with a reorganisation of their
departments, we still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>have the problem of people not communicating, highlighted in recent news
stories. A baby was tortured to death, and despite scores of incidents
of involvement of health professionals, no action was taken by a local
authority children&#146;s services department. I do not believe that
the Minister is right to rely on what happens in local authorities. He
says that they may well be acquainted with a family&#146;s
circumstances, but they may well not. It is important that there is a
statutory requirement on local authorities, before they start issuing
parenting contracts, to assess the needs of parents, who may well have
medical needs that are not being addressed by social
services.</div>
					<a name="080221106000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to clause 34(2), which states that a local authority
in England</div>
					<a name="080221106000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may enter
into a parenting contract with a parent of the young
person&#151;</div>
					<a name="080221106000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) if
the parent is resident in England,
and</div>
					<a name="080221106000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the authority
considers that entering into the parenting contract would be desirable
in the interests of the young person&#146;s fulfilment of that
duty.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
interprets that as applying if a parent is keeping their child up at
night or doing something negative to prevent a 16-year-old from
participating in education or training, but that is not the only
possible interpretation. In fact, the most common interpretation is
that there is a positive duty on the parent to do something to help the
young person into education or training. In the circumstances that my
hon. Friend the Member for Upminster gave&#151;a young mother living
in separate accommodation&#151;it would be naive to expect that
parent to have influence over the young person and persuade them into
education or
training.</div>
					<a name="080221106000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
convinced, and I do not think that the Minister has convinced other

create any obligations in respect of whose breach any liability arises

					<a name="080221106000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tried to give one or two examples earlier. We introduced the contract,
like the orders, mostly as a mechanism to deal with parents who are
obstructing young people fulfilling their duty through their behaviour
or by asking them to do things that are unreasonable when they have
another duty to perform. But, as I said, there may also be
circumstances in which it would be helpful for the local authority to
clarify the support that they will give to the parent, as the support
the parent should give to the
child.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000299"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I feel like a middleman in an important dialogue,
but I will now address the point that the Minister made about
subsection (3)(b), which states that a parenting contract should
contain</div>
					<a name="080221106000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a statement by
the local education authority that it agrees to provide support to the
parent&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080221106000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">He is right to
cite the subsection, but the contract can include a statement of
support for the parent only if the local authority is aware of the
needs of the parent. I therefore see no harm in simply adding to the
clause the
phrase:</div>
					<a name="080221106000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Prior
to entering into a parenting contract the local education authority
shall ensure that parents&#146; needs are assessed by the appropriate
local authority adult
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a requirement would not add burdensome assessment. If there are no
needs and if both parents are healthy, it will be a two-minute job,
which is less than the 10 minutes that the Minister is requiring every
employer to spend on assessing new employees who start work with them.
It would not be burdensome, nor would it detract from the clause; in
fact, it would enhance it. Therefore, I would like to press the
amendment to a

legislative language. Clearly, if the provision gives rise to a
permissive power rather than a requirement, it already is the case that

						</b> We have discussed at some length
the reasons for not excluding various, often vulnerable, groups from
different provisions, so I shall try to be brief. First, we do not want
to specify any individual groups in the Bill. Everyone will be catered
for, but it is not appropriate to introduce caveats in primary
legislation for a range of specific groups. Secondly, the intention of
the regulations is not to exclude any specific groups of parents. The
relevant part of the Bill draws on existing legislation for parenting
contracts and parenting orders, and the limitations of the regulations
in this instance are in reference to where people live, rather than the
exclusion of any groups.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div>
					<a name="080221106000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for the regulation-making powers is to ensure that the system is
flexible enough to respond when a young person who fails to fulfil the
duty is resident in one local education authority, but their parent is
resident in another. The powers are also needed to set down further
details of what should be done in such cases.</div>
					<a name="080221106000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To issue a parenting order, a
local authority will have to apply to the courts and provide
information on the background of the young person. That information
should include details of the relationship between the young person and
their parent, which would help to inform the local authority and the
court whether an order against that parent would be appropriate. A
parenting order can be made only where the court is satisfied that that
would be in the interest of getting the young person to participate.
Clearly, the court would have to be satisfied that an order against an
estranged parent was in the interest of getting the young person to
participate.</div>
					<a name="080221106000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
make the regulations, judgments may be made about whether estranged
parents should be included, but it would be appropriate to consult on
matters relating to the regulations at the appropriate time, rather

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, and
I just emphasise one point. The amendment would not exclude the group
that we are talking about from the general duty to participate, but it
does address the issue of whether a parenting order would have any
credibility when applied to a parent who has no contact with their own
children.</div>
					<a name="080221106000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, I take on board the Minister&#146;s persuasive points about the
court having to take into account the relationship between the parent
and the child before issuing a parenting order. I was also encouraged
by his comment that when he and the Department come to make the
regulations, judgments may be made about whether to include the
circumstances alluded to in the amendment. On the basis of those
helpful comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Williams:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for
Yeovil assured me that, given the glacial pace at which the Committee
had cantered&#151;or, rather, not cantered&#151;through previous
clauses, there was absolutely no chance that we would reach this stage
before 10 o&#146;clock, when he is scheduled to join us. For the past
few minutes, I have therefore been somewhat panic-stricken and I have
been reading through the amendments that my hon. Friend drafted and
tabled. I will have to make my best
attempt&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Well, it
demonstrates palpable honesty in front of fellow Committee members. I
will try my best to interpret what my hon. Friend would have said had
he been here or had we been able to travel forward 20 minutes in time
to when he was
here.</div>
					<a name="080221106000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
suggest that if the local authority is to offer support to the young
person to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations under the Bill
to attend compulsory education or training, some assessment should be
made of whether that support is appropriate. During our evidence
sessions a few weeks ago, we heard some interesting evidence from
various bodies, particularly the Prince&#146;s Trust and Fairbridge,
which suggested that some of the people at whom the Bill is aimed in
the broadest sense&#151;those not in education, employment or
training&#151;lead quite dysfunctional lives. They might have an
addiction to drugs or alcohol or might have been in and out of the
criminal justice system. The support offered to them by the local
authority might not, therefore, necessarily address the fundamental
needs that they have in their daily lives, and that might be one of the
underlying reasons why they are unable to fulfil the obligation in the
Bill to attend college.</div>
					<a name="080221106000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, if someone has an
addiction to heroin, or some other part of their life is dysfunctional,
attending college or workplace training will not be at the forefront of
their minds, and their attendance might not be welcomed by the
institution or employer anyway. The compulsion introduced by the Bill
will clearly not have the desired effect of ensuring that that group of
people have a measurable level of educational attainments by the time
that they are 18.</div>
					<a name="080221106000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be clear from our earlier discussions and the questions that we
asked during our evidence sessions that my hon. Friend and I would
prefer these young people with dysfunctional lives to be given more
access to the support services that would make a tangible differences
to their circumstances, such as more drug rehabilitation and treatment
and more investment in mental health, if such problems are the reason
why they cannot fulfil their duty to participate. The purpose of the
amendments is to put in place a requirement to assess whether young
people&#146;s health needs&#151;I see drug addiction as a health
problem&#151;or mental health needs have been properly dealt with
before further duties are placed on them. Our aim is to ensure that the
relevant support is there so that the local authority can take an
holistic approach. I have done the best that I can in the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="080221106000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000328"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is a pleasure to move to chapter 5, which is
headed &#147;Attendance Notices&#148;. I wonder whether the hon.
Member for Bristol, West would like to issue an attendance notice on
the hon. Member for Yeovil so that he can speak to his own
amendments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>
					<a name="080221106000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments return us to
discussions that we had at some length earlier in the Committee process
about the support that should be offered to young people found to be
not participating. Its intention is one that I share, as I have already
set out: no young person should enter the enforcement system if they
have unmet support needs.</div>
					<a name="080221106000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 67 would mean
that, before a local authority could give an initial notice, in
addition to what the clause already requires, they would need to assess
the person&#146;s ability to benefit from the support offered. I
believe that the intention of this amendment is already reflected in
subsections (5)(a) and (b) and (6)(b). For the benefit of the
Committee, I will briefly run through those provisions. Subsection
(5)(a) states that the local authority</div>
					<a name="080221106000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must take all reasonable steps
to secure that relevant support is
offered&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080221106000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed that at considerable length, including what it means in
respect of particular groups of young people. Subsection (5)(b) states
that the local authority</div>
					<a name="080221106000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may not give the notice unless
satisfied that the person has been afforded an opportunity to take
advantage of the support offered.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, in my view, requires precisely the
sort of assessment the amendment would insert into the clause. A local
authority could not be satisfied that the young person has had the
opportunity to benefit from the support offered if it considered that
the young person in question did not have the ability to benefit from
the support offered.</div>
					<a name="080221106000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (6) then states
that the local authority can begin enforcement action only if the young
person is failing to fulfil the duty without reasonable excuse. I have,
at the request of the absent hon. Member for Yeovil, written to the
Committee about my thinking on &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. I am
sure that he will have a reasonable excuse for the hon. Member for
Bristol, West. I hope that he will understand that as we are five years
away from implementing the provisions of the Bill, I wish to use that
time to consult fully with organisations such as those from which we
heard during our evidence sessions and which the hon. Member for
Bristol, West, speaking with alacrity on his feet, mentioned. My
thinking will undoubtedly develop as a result of that
consultation.</div>
					<a name="080221106000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant
support referred to in subsection (5)(a) would be provided by
Connexions, which is based on its personal advisers developing a
sufficient understanding of a young person&#146;s needs in order to
assess what support might be most appropriate to meet those needs.
Subsections (5) and (6) would mean that a local authority will not
begin enforcement unless they have provided the right
support.</div>
					<a name="080221106000253"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="080221106000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 68 returns us to the question of a waiver certificate, which we
debated at length in relation to clause 1, many moons ago. I believe
there was an eclipse of the moon last night and it almost feels as
though we were discussing clause 1 at the time of the previous eclipse.
As I made clear to the Committee then, we do not support issuing any
type of waiver to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>specific groups of young people to exempt them from the duty. The hon.
Member for Yeovil withdrew his amendment that first introduced the
concept of a waiver certificate in relation to clause 1, and I hope
that this colleague the hon. Member for Bristol, West will do the same
here. I know that he does not mean to suggest that young people should
be denied the opportunities offered by participation in education and
training.</div>
					<a name="080221106000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, amendment No. 69 would require local authorities to
conduct an assessment of a young person&#146;s ability to comply with
an attendance notice before any such notice is issued. I do not believe
that that would add anything to the caveats relating to attendance
notices in clauses 41 and 42. The provisions in the Bill will ensure
that before issuing an attendance notice, a local authority must
satisfy itself that the named provision meets the young person&#146;s
needs. It will also have the knowledge of the matters that an
attendance panel would take into account in considering any appeal by a
young person against an attendance notice. The attendance panel
provides an important independent check on the local authority&#146;s
actions, which I am sure that we will discuss fairly shortly. I look
forward to that and hope, in the light of my reassurances, that the
hon. Member for Bristol, West will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="080221106000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
attendance notice follows the issue of a written notice by a local
authority, as provided for in clause 39. Although the written notice
must give at least 15 days&#146; notice of the issuance of an
attendance notice, under clause 40, the local authority has a six-month
window during which it can get around to issuing an attendance notice.
If those provisions become law in 2013 or 2015 and are not overtaken by
other eye-catching Government initiatives, it would be interesting to
see how many such notices are actually issued. A six-month window, out
of what will be in reality less than two years of a 16 or
17-year-old&#146;s life, will eat into the time during which those
provisions can be used.</div>

							<a name="080221106000333"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Such is the enthusiasm of the of the Front-Bench
team fielded by the Opposition that we can barely resist the temptation
to rise in support of the amendments that we have crafted. I am
delighted to accept my hon. Friend&#146;s invitation to add to the
few words that he offered in support of the amendment.</div>
					<a name="080221106000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have heard, clause 40
enables local education authorities to issue attendance notices
specifying the type of provision to be undertaken, a description of the
course and details of where and when a young person should attend.
According to the Local Government Association, there are four steps to
that enforcement process. It
says:</div>
					<a name="080221106000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first step will be for the learning provider to try to identify and
address the issues by providing additional support or identify
alternative learning programmes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly:</div>
					<a name="080221106000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the young person drops out of learning, the local authority will have a
responsibility to contact them and work with them over a period to
identify appropriate alternative learning
options.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly:</div>
					<a name="080221106000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the young person still does not
engage&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="080221106000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">having
been through that process with the local
authority&#151;</div>
					<a name="080221106000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they
will be given a formal last chance to engage
voluntarily&#148;,</div>
					<a name="080221106000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
situation if they do not do so will be made clear. The LGA
continues:</div>
					<a name="080221106000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The local authority
will decide when the time is appropriate for this and will then have
the power, to issue an Attendance Notice, specifying precisely the
provision that the young person must attend, and where and when they
must do so. Appeals will be referred to an independent adjudication
panel, which the local authority will set up. The panel will review the
steps that the local authority has taken to ensure that there had been
sufficient opportunity and support to engage voluntarily. The panel
would have powers to confirm or dismiss the Attendance Notice and to
recommend the local authority to take action to meet the needs of the
young person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
according to the
LGA:</div>
					<a name="080221106000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
young person did not meet the terms of their attendance notice, the
local authority could issue them with a Fixed Penalty
Notice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We debated that issue
during our extensive discussions about compulsion. The provision before
us essentially means that action against the young person will be
stepped up if those early attempts to engage them by means of adjusting
what is available to them, properly informing them and providing
support and encouragement, fail.</div>
					<a name="080221106000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth stage, according to
the LGA, includes further measures:</div>
					<a name="080221106000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Appeals would again go
to the same panel, which would confirm or dismiss the notice. If the
FPN is unpaid the local authority would bring the case before a Youth
Court, where the penalty on conviction would be a
fine.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>
					<a name="080221106000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That measure is regarded as the last
resort, as the Minister said repeatedly when we discussed the issue
before. The LGA states that if a fine is unpaid, the youth court has
options beyond
custody,</div>
					<a name="080221106000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
taking money from wages or imposing an unpaid work
requirement.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has assured us that no one will go to prison, but the process,
although well defined and an accelerating one, ends with someone having
a conviction&#151;being a criminal in the sense that I have
described.</div>
					<a name="080221106000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 40
does not require local authorities to have taken all reasonable steps
to secure voluntary participation in education and training before an
attendance notice is issued. Our amendment would clarify the position
and ensure that young people were guided to the most appropriate
education and training before any formal sanctions were used. That is
the essential point. There should be a well understood, transparent and
logical process, which accelerates the action that the local authority
might take. However, there should also be an absolute requirement to
avoid a formal process until such time as all other options have been
exhausted.</div>
					<a name="080221106000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that the Minister shares that view, because he expressed it earlier in
our deliberations. It is critical that we encourage young people to
commit to participation of their own will, because if they do so, there
is a much greater chance of their succeeding&#151;of seeing their
training through and developing the skills that they need to become
increasingly employable. The amendment would ensure that the formal
process did not kick in until everything that could be&#151;and, in
my judgment, must be&#151;done to encourage voluntary participation
had been
done.</div>

							<a name="080221106000334"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Of course we want as many young people as possible
to engage voluntarily in learning, without having to use sanctions.
That is the aim of local authorities too, as John Freeman from the
Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services told us. He is
the director of children&#146;s services in Dudley and in evidence to
the Committee he said
that</div>
					<a name="080221106000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we see enforcement
as the last option and, indeed, an indication that we have failed
somewhere. A disengaged young person is not just an indication that
they have failed, but that we have
failed.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Education and
Skills Public Bill Committee, </i>22 Jan 2008; c. 72,
Q174]</div>
					<a name="080221106000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why we have
emphasised the need to put the provision in place. Every young person,
wherever they are in the country and whatever level they are working
at, will be able to find a suitable learning option. We are focusing on
ensuring that there is the right support, from careers education and
guidance in schools, to the Connexions service and talented youth
support, for young people both to engage with, and stay in, learning
and to achieve. We will also ensure that there is extra help for those
with special educational needs.</div>
					<a name="080221106000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment to clause 40 is
not necessary. It might be helpful if I quickly mention the 10 stages
that we have introduced, as opposed to the four stages that the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings has identified, so that hon.
Members are clear about the extent to which there is a last resort in
the courts. The first stage is support from the learning provider. If a
young person encounters problems or shows signs of disengaging from
learning, the first step is for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>learning provider to try to identify and address the issue by providing
additional support or identifying an alternative learning programme.
The second stage is notification to Connexions. If the young person
drops out altogether, the learning provider will have a duty to inform
the local authority or its Connexions service provider, which will then
contact the young person to try to identify what the problems are. Over
time, the guidance service will work with the young person to offer
advice and broker support to help them to re-engage with learning. That
is the third stage: the support from Connexions, which will identify an
appropriate learning option and provide support to take that
up.</div>
					<a name="080221106000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">A last
chance&#151;the fourth stage&#151;is provided if the young person
still does not engage once a suitable programme has been identified and
appropriate support
provided&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I am delighted to
see that the hon. Member for Yeovil has arrived. I only wish that we
could all be party to the discussions that he will probably have with
the hon. Member for Bristol, West. He can be assured that an attendance
notice is on its way stating that he has missed the fourth
stage&#151;the last chance&#151;that I was talking about. If the
young person has been offered a suitable programme and additional
support has been provided, and they have no outstanding barriers to
participation or reasonable excuses for not participating, they should
be given a formal last chance to engage voluntarily.</div>
					<a name="080221106000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fifth stage is 15
days&#146; notice. There is a point at which the local authority
takes a clear decision to begin enforcement. A young person cannot
enter the enforcement system automatically or accidentally. The local
authority must consciously make that decision and then give the young
person 15 days&#146; notice in writing that they will be issued with
an attendance notice&#151;the initial steps that are set out in
clause 39. Stage six is the issuing of an attendance notice. At stage
seven, the young person can appeal against the attendance notice, and
stage eight is the serving of a fixed penalty notice, which again is
appealable. There would then be a fine in the youth court and, finally,
fine enforcement. There are plenty of stages all the way down the
track.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>Until youth court proceedings have started,
the process can be halted at any stage by the young person if they
voluntarily choose to take up the support that they have been offered.
The process may take some time, but it certainly will not take years
for it to be completed. The vast majority of the process involves
providing support. Once we get to the formal enforcement stage matters
are pursued through the magistrates courts, which is a fairly familiar
process that I think we are all aware can be relatively swift.
Obviously, those in extremis who end up in court will be subject to
court processes, which can take a bit longer. However, we hope that, as
in cases where the participation age has been raised, we will not get
to the stage of court enforcement.</div>

Hayes:
						</b> Some aspects of the process that
the Minister described are subject to time limits, but other parts are
not. Would not it be useful to set a timetable for the various steps
that he has described&#151;my four stages or his 10, whichever is
more appropriate? The process could begin, but not end until after a
person has aged beyond the constraints implicit in the Bill&#151;they
could reach 18 or 19&#151;and that would be entirely
inappropriate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000338"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Clearly, if the person reaches the age beyond
which the law no longer applies, the process would cease because it
would become pointless. As for setting timetables, it is right that we
should specify 15 days&#146; notice. The reason for doing so is to
ensure that we do everything we can to get that young person to
participate, so the sooner we can get on with the process the better.
It is not particularly helpful to specify individual time scales in
legislation, as we are some years away from the date on which these
measures come into effect. A time scale that seems reasonable now might
not be reasonable in a few years&#146; time. I agree that we must do
all we can to get as many young people as possible to participate
voluntarily, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is unnecessary.
It was a sharp contrast to see two lead spokesmen rise to speak to the
amendment, given the reluctance of any hon. Member to speak to the
earlier amendments proposed by the Liberal Democrats. I hope that both
the hon. Gentlemen will be happy to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="080221106000339"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister has made it clear
that the enforcement process leading to a fixed penalty is a last
resort, and he helpfully fleshed out the process for the
Committee&#146;s benefit. However, it would be helpful to have some
sense of the timetable, at least in guidance, for the benefit of local
authorities. Flexibility is required, because each case is different.
The measures deal with complex issues and individuals&#151;those
individuals have different needs and different circumstances
apply&#151; but some kind of timetable or time framework would be a
useful addition. The Minister might want to reflect on that and return
to it later.</div>
					<a name="080221106000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister handled the amendment in a conciliatory and professional way,
despite his cutting asides to the Liberal Democrats, which I thought
harsh. I had begun to think that the hon. Members for Yeovil and for
Bristol, West were one and the same person as we have never seen them
together until today, but that has been disproved. On that basis, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="080221106000342"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in
clause 40, page 21, leave out lines 41 to
45.</div>
					<a name="080221106000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
noticed the look of doubt on your face, Mr. Bercow, as to
whether my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil or I would move the
amendment. I was grateful for the arrival of the cavalry from Yeovil,
but my hon. Friend has said that as I have had time to think about the
amendment, I might as well move it. I was also grateful for the
peroration from the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, as
it has given me adequate time to think about what the amendment would
do in removing subsection (5) from clause 40. The measure is too
prescriptive an interpretation of the needs of the young person.
Subsection (5)(a) will direct which institution the young person may be
required to attend for their compulsory education or training, but the
Bill does not go on to say that practical common-sense considerations
should be taken into account when it comes to selecting an institution.
A young person&#146;s education destination might be selected against
their will.</div>
					<a name="080221106000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
parts of the country, geography may be a relevant factor when an
attendance notice requires a young person to attend a further education
college. My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed
(Mr. Beith) has said a couple of times in the Chamber that
the nearest college to the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed is 50 miles away.
It would therefore be nonsensical for an attendance notice imposed by
Northumberland county council, for example, to require a person from
Berwick to attend a college rather than a school. The Bill does not
allow such common-sense considerations to be taken into
account.</div>
					<a name="080221106000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may
also be reasons why an institution would not want to accept a person
who is imposed on them. As we know, some young people choose not to
stay on beyond 16 because they have had a bad experience of school, and
perhaps the school has had a bad experience of them. For example, they
may have been subject to disciplinary procedures at school; they may
have been suspended or even expelled. The Bill does not take into
account whether a school or college would wish to have a young person
imposed upon them for compulsory attendance as a result of an
attendance notice.</div>
					<a name="080221106000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5)(b) goes even
further by removing all element of choice whatever from the young
person who is subject to a notice. The measure therefore not only
determines which educational institution a person should be required to
attend, but what course they should be required to study. Subsequent
subsections do not make any reference to whether a course is
appropriate for the individual or the career that they are expected to
follow in future, or whether courses take heed of previous educational
achievements or non-achievements at age 16. For instance, in theory, it
would be quite ridiculous to impose a duty on someone to study A-level
economics if they had only secured grade F at GCSE maths, yet there is
no provision in the measure to account for the previous attainments of
a young person when specifying the exact name and description of the
course that they are to take.</div>
					<a name="080221106000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
implications of the measure for young people and the institutions that
they will be required to attend are stark, and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response. As my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil has
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div>intervened, I take it that I have made all the points that he would have
made, and perhaps some that he might not have
made.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000343"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an
interesting case. The process must illustrate maximum sensitivity both
to the person and to the institutions that, by proxy, are involved in
the process. Specifying an institution and course, as the hon.
Gentleman described, might create tensions between institutions and
local authorities and even, as he implied, reach a point at which
institutions feel that they have had imposed on them some of the most
difficult and challenging young people.</div>
					<a name="080221106000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Institutions
should deal with challenging young people, but it would be better if
there was a degree of collaboration or willing co-operation. The hon.
Gentleman made an interesting point that there will come a stage, if we
are not careful, when institutions that have had increasingly difficult
young people imposed upon them see the local authority as the enemy. I
do not know whether he intended his amendment to be a probing one, but
the Minister needs to be clear about the relationship between the local
authority, institutions and individuals. It is critical to ensure that
there is maximum sensitivity in that relationship if the measure is to
work.</div>
					<a name="080221106000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000344"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The intention behind an attendance notice is to
set out clearly for the young person and everyone involved in helping
them to participate exactly what is required from them. The amendment
may reflect confusion about the purpose of including in the attendance
notice details of the type of provision that should be undertaken, a
description of the course, and details of where and when the young
person should attend. I appreciate that, to some extent, the hon.
Member for Bristol, West is catching up, and that to rush ahead and
read clause 45(2) might be more than could reasonably be asked of him,
given the role that he is fulfilling for his party at the
moment. Clause 45(2)
says:</div>
					<a name="080221106000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is a
defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) to
show that he or she is, and since the giving of the attendance notice
has been, fulfilling the duty imposed by section
2.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">They do not have to
do what it says on the notice, as long as they are fulfilling their
legal obligation to
participate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000345"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I acknowledge that I am playing catch-up, but
why does clause 40(5), which is the subject of the amendment, say
that</div>
					<a name="080221106000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the attendance
notice must
specify&#148;,</div>
					<a name="080221106000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather than

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000346"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It must specify an appropriate course, location
and time, so that it is clear to everyone that there is a suitable form
of provision for the young person, but if the young person finds other
provision in which they wish to partake, they should be able to do
so.</div>
					<a name="080221106000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for
including the details is not to force the young person to participate
in a particular way, or to limit their options. If they received an
attendance notice they could still choose to fulfil their duty via any
one of the range of available options. In setting out the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>appropriate details, we are aiming to make it easier for the young
person to comply with the duty by making it absolutely clear what is
expected of them. They are still free to participate in any other
way.</div>
					<a name="080221106000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the points
that have been made about schools having young people imposed on them,
it is worth moving forward to clause 41(6)(a) and (b), which says that
the local authority must consult and be satisfied with arrangements
that have been made for education and training to be provided with the
appropriate institutions. In respect of it being suitable education for
the young person, clause 41(5)
says:</div>
					<a name="080221106000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
education or training must be suitable for the
person.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000347"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> To clarify one matter, clause 39 requires the
notice of failure to comply to be given in writing, but clause 40 does
not appear to say that that is the case. Is that because the Minister
envisages that it may be necessary in certain circumstances to give an
oral notice, or it is implied in some way that it should be in
writing?</div>
					<a name="080221106000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080221106000348"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The notice certainly has to be given in writing,
and it must be extremely clear to everyone concerned what is required,
and that the provision is in place so that it is, if necessary,
enforceable. The details are set out in the attendance notice, which is
a clear document that can be returned to if the young person wanted to
dispute whether the provision offered was appropriate. Clause 41
provides further details about the description of education and
training that must be made, and it makes it clear that it must be
suitable for the young person. If a young person wishes to appeal to an
attendance panel, the attendance notice gives a clear, written
description of what has been
offered.</div>

trying to give me some comfort by drawing my attention to clause 41(6),
which says that the educational institution should be consulted before,
in effect, a person is imposed on it. However, consulting on something
does not necessarily mean that the response will be respected. How will
a school be able to respond if it is invited by the local authority to
take on a 17-year-old who has previously been expelled from that
institution?</div>

training must be suitable for the
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080221106000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a scenario
where the institution does not want to provide education or training,
there would be questions about suitability, because the person will not
be properly engaged in the course if it is being delivered reluctantly.
We should allow for those issues to be decided according to
local circumstances. The provision offers considerable
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="080221106000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the amendment would make it
unclear what is expected of a young person and an important protection

					<a name="080221106000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
adds to the existing subsection (5) requirements and insists that that
assessment of suitability must have regard to the person&#146;s age,
ability and aptitude and, critically, their needs in terms of
personalised support and learning opportunities. That takes us back to
matters raised in a number of debates in the past few weeks and in the
oral evidence hearings before we started this part of
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="080221106000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the Minister, who undertook earlier in proceedings to write
a letter setting out the Government&#146;s thinking on the vulnerable
groups of young people on whom the Bill will have an impact. We had in
mind some of those youngsters when we tabled the amendment. I do not
know whether anyone has referred this morning to his letter to me of 13
February, which I think has been copied to other members of the
Committee. It helpfully sets down the Government&#146;s initial
thoughts on how enforcement will work in respect of those young people
who could not easily be in formal education or
training.</div>
					<a name="080221106000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter
is oriented toward who might be given an exemption from the strictures
of the attendance panel. It is also directly relevant to the
personalised support we want to have in place, if this part of the Bill
to work fairly for the groups whose needs we are trying to meet. On the
second page of the letter, the Minister sets out a long list of the
groups of young people whom he
accepts&#151;</div>
