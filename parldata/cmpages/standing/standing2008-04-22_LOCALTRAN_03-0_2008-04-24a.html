Leech:
						</b> I am the first to welcome you back to the Chair
this morning, Mr.
Taylor.</div>
					<a name="08042490000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 144, which was tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewes, is pretty self-explanatory, so I do not intend to spend too long
speaking to it. The Bill allows authorities to replace their plan as
when they see fit and does not force them to replace plans every five
years. The amendment would confer a duty on local transport authorities
to review their local transport plans every five years and to show that
that had been done. That would ensure that a local transport authority
could not simply leave an unsatisfactory local transport plan
languishing on the table. The amendment is probing to find out
Government thinking on ensuring that local authorities take seriously
the need to ensure that their local transport plans are up to date and
remain relevant to the needs of the local
community.</div>
					<a name="08042490000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042490000227"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): As the Liberal Democrat
spokesman said, amendment No. 144 would mean that plans were reviewed
every five years. I have some sympathy for the amendment, for the
reasons that the hon. Gentleman advanced. The amendment would mean that
authorities had
to</div>
					<a name="08042490000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;review their
plan...once every five
years&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08042490000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">but I would have
liked the hon. Gentleman to go a little further, because it does not
suggest any action or require the authority to do anything. Although I
am sympathetic to the proposal, it suffers from two defects: it calls
only for a review and does not define the timetable for the plan
thereafter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>
					<a name="08042490000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities are required to replace their transport plans every five
years. Subsection (3) will change that so that authorities can replace
their plans whenever they see fit. I am in favour of giving local
transport authorities greater flexibility in timetabling the
replacement of their transport plans, but amendment No. 37 is motivated
by my two concerns about the wording of the clause, and I hope that the
Minister will address
them.</div>
					<a name="08042490000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
primary fear relates to the fact that &#147;as they think fit&#148;
is a phrase of uncertainty because there will be no fixed timetable.
Although we require and encourage the flexibility that not having a
fixed timetable allows, if there is no fixed timetable, or if matters
are left to when an authority sees fit, it is possible to envisage
situations in which local passengers would not know from one week to
the next how services would run. That would undermine the hope of
persuading people to use public transport and increasing public
transport
patronage.</div>
					<a name="08042490000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
are local operators of local services to plan ahead if the
council&#146;s transport plan can be changed at any moment? No one is
suggesting that that will happen, and I do not necessarily mean that it
will happen from one moment to the next. None the less, an element of
uncertainty arises from the words &#147;as they think
fit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042490000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 37 would ensure that local authorities retained the flexibility and
autonomy that they needed in deciding when to replace their plans, but
it would require them to give &#147;one year&#146;s notice&#148;
of such replacement, thereby eliminating potential
uncertainty.</div>
					<a name="08042490000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000228"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
on uncertainty, but surely an authority being required to give 12
months&#146; notice would be as uncertain as a review of a transport
plan.</div>
					<a name="08042490000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000229"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Indeed, but at least there
would be a finite period from the moment the notice was given until the
date of the plan, which would be helpful. I think my amendment No. 37
would enhance the Bill, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>
					<a name="08042490000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000230"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> Perhaps it would help if I set out what we are
trying to achieve in the first place with the changes in clause 9. The
Transport Act 2000 requires all English local transport authorities to
keep their local transport plans up to date and replace them every five
years. It also places authorities under a general duty to keep their
plans under review. Under the Bill, we are changing the system to allow
local transport authorities to replace their local transport plans as
they see fit. It does not alter the duty to keep the plans under
review.</div>
					<a name="08042490000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to do
that because we want local transport authorities to have plans that are
more responsive to the particular needs of each area. The Bill, for
example, enables authorities to replace different parts of their plans
at different frequencies. In larger areas in particular, a local
transport plan might include both a long-term strategy and a phased
plan for implementing its proposals. An authority might want to update
the implementation part of the plan more frequently than it needed to
revisit its overall strategy. Another example might an authority
wanting to revise its parking strategy after 18 months, but not needing
to do the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>same for buses or road safety. Again, the Bill will give the authorities
the flexibility to change parts of their local transport plan without
having to go through all the bureaucracy of replacing it all at the
same time.</div>
					<a name="08042490000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment moved by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington&#151;I
take his point about it being probing&#151;would require local
transport plans to be reviewed every five years, but not necessarily
replaced. As I said, local transport authorities are already under a
duty to keep their plans under review. That is set out in section
109(1) of the 2000 Act and we are not proposing any change to that
duty. We feel, therefore, that the amendment would not add anything to
that duty. It is superfluous. It could also be counter-productive,
because keeping a plan under review should be a continuous business,
while the amendment suggests a specific process done only every so
often, and at least every five
years.</div>
					<a name="08042490000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities&#146; existing plans are due to run until 2010-11, and by
summer 2009 we intend to have issued them with guidance on producing
future transport plans. We will put a draft of that guidance out to
consultation around the end of this year. Among other things, the
guidance is likely to cover the process of reviewing and replacing
local transport plans, and how and with what frequency, taking local
circumstances into account, authorities should be looking to do
that.</div>
					<a name="08042490000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman might be concerned that a local authority may change its plan
very rarely&#151;perhaps that is the point of his
amendment&#151;but the response we have had from local authorities
shows that they think that the local transport plans are useful
documents, so I do not think that there is a serious risk that they
will just put them on the shelf for five years, or for ever, and never
look at them again.</div>
					<a name="08042490000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be interested in looking at the
guidance when it comes out. I can assure him that we shall set out what
we think is an appropriate way to continue that process of monitoring
the local transport plans positively so that they reflect local
circumstances and differing needs at different times.</div>
					<a name="08042490000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
37 would introduce a new duty on local transport authorities to give a
year&#146;s notice of their intention to replace their plans, as the
hon. Member for Wimbledon said. Preparing and replacing a local
transport plan cannot be done overnight, not least because local
transport plans are, for example, subject to EU regulations on
environmental assessments. Clause 9 already places duties to consult on
authorities, which could not be met by plans being produced
overnight.</div>
					<a name="08042490000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
it offers hon. Members some reassurance to know that the new duty to
replace plans as authorities see fit will not lead to constant changing
of plans with little notice being given, if that is the worry in
relation to the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08042490000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities
will need to take the process of reviewing, changing and having proper
consultations on their plans very seriously. However, requiring a
year&#146;s notice would run the risk of erecting a bureaucratic
obstacle to the replacement of plans. In many cases, authorities may
need a year, or more, to develop, consult on and approve their plans,
but not necessarily. One example, which is particularly appropriate at
this point, is a newly elected  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>administration wishing to change parts of its local plan as soon as
possible. If some groundwork had been done as part of routine work
carried out under the previous administration, it might not take a
further year to complete the work. However, as it is not clear whether
the amendment would apply to the replacement of part of a plan, it
could be an obstacle to such
updating.</div>
					<a name="08042490000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, an
authority might develop a local transport plan consisting of a
longer-term strategy and a shorter-term implementation plan. The
authority might want to replace just the implementation part of the
plan, which might be achievable in less than a year, even allowing for
consulting properly on the changes.</div>
					<a name="08042490000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">A local
transport authority might be able to comply with the requirement to
give at least a year&#146;s notice, but, for reasons outside its
control, it might need to replace its plans at a date later than the
one it originally gave in the notice. It is not clear what legal effect
the amendment would have in those particular circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08042490000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, local transport
authorities are already under a duty to consult on their local
transport plans. The amendments propose extra administrative duties,
which we do not feel would secure more co-operation between local
transport authorities and other bodies. In some circumstances, they
would constrain the flexibility that we are aiming to
introduce.</div>
					<a name="08042490000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have given some reassurance to Opposition Members and that they will
not press the
amendments.</div>

					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;and representatives of town and parish
councils in the
county&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08042490000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the increased flexibility for planning and implementing local transport
plans is welcome, the requirement for local transport authorities or
county councils simply to consult district councils in their area does
not go far enough. If we are serious about local decision making and if
local transport plans are to be as responsive to the needs of local
communities as possible and as responsive to people in rural areas as
they are to those in urban and metropolitan areas, it is essential that
local transport plans are built from the bottom up. Therefore, town and
parish councils, as the most local form of government, have an
important role to play in feeding in the voices of the smallest rural
communities.</div>
					<a name="08042490000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is particularly important, given that the Bill amends the 2000
Act to remove the need for a local transport authority to produce a bus
strategy. Although the concept of an integrated transport plan is
welcome, the bus strategy is very important in rural areas, where buses
are often the only viable form of public transport. In rural areas,
local services and facilities are often few, limited and geographically
disparate. Lack of access to transport, particularly public transport,
leaves many people facing difficult circumstances and, often, social
exclusion. Lack of transport can have a multitude of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>negative effects, including reducing employment and educational
opportunities and access to health care and social and leisure
activities. That is particularly the case for the 11 per cent. of rural
households without a car. The young and the elderly feature highly in
that category.</div>
					<a name="08042490000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
transport is needed by people living in rural areas just as it is by
those living in urban areas, but the lower population density of rural
areas and the greater distances between villages and towns mean that
public transport services tend to be less frequent and, as a result,
less convenient. That means that more people must rely on cars for
their day-to-day transport, which has significant implications for
congestion levels and the environment, both of which are of growing
concern to the public and lie at the heart of the Government&#146;s
current legislative
programme.</div>
					<a name="08042490000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Car
ownership and use is high in rural areas: 52 per cent. of rural
households have two or more cars, and three quarters of all journeys in
rural areas are made by car. On average, rural residents travel more
than 40 per cent. further than urban residents each week, because
facilities and services are farther away. As services are lost&#151;a
current topic is post offices&#151;people must travel
further.</div>
					<a name="08042490000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042490000233"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that any district council or county council would be duty-bound
to involve parish councils
anyway?</div>
					<a name="08042490000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000234"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> I agree that that should happen, but the amendment
would ensure that, as part of the process, town and parish councils
were statutory
consultees.</div>
					<a name="08042490000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to create sustainable public transport networks, with the aim of
providing greater access to services and facilities for people living
in rural communities and, in the long term, reducing reliance on the
car, transport schemes and local transport plans must be created with
reference to the social and economic needs of local communities. It is
essential that, when creating local transport plans, local authorities
undertake accessibility planning. There is a need for more flexibility
in the types of transport provided and for more demand-responsive
services, such as minibus routes for a number of individuals in remote
areas.</div>
					<a name="08042490000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The appropriate
planning of transport schemes and strategies in rural areas has the
potential to rejuvenate communities and provide an essential lifeline
for villages that do not have ready access to key services and
facilities, thereby ensuring their sustainability. The Bill must take
account of the needs of rural communities and those who live and work
in the countryside, which is why it is vital to ensure proper
consultation with that smallest form of
government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000235"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said,
his amendment would put in place a specific statutory requirement for
local transport authorities to consider the views of town and parish
councils when developing and implementing their transport policies. I
have said that consultation is already an integral part of the
development of the local transport plan process. Local transport
authorities already consult many interested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>and affected groups when developing local transport plans, including key
delivery partners, such as town and parish councils. Moreover, the
clause requires local transport authorities to consult on local
transport plans. The only consultees specified by name are certain
other local authorities, and the Secretary of State. However, it is
also specified that local transport authorities must consult any
&#147;such other persons as&#148; they consider
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08042490000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, we intend to develop guidance for local authorities in
preparation for the next round of local transport plans. I am sure that
other hon. Members share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views, and in
areas where it is appropriate to consult parish and town councils, we
want that to happen.</div>
					<a name="08042490000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000236"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> Does the Minister accept that there may be
circumstances in which a transport authority might not want to consult
a parish or town council because it thought that the council might be a
nuisance or because it was run by a different political party and was
not the sort of organisation that it wanted to consult? Surely, if the
consultation is put on a statutory footing, we would avoid the
possibility of a local authority choosing to ignore the views of
elected members of the
community.</div>

						</b> As ever, however, there is a danger in some of
those circumstances of putting a long list in the Bill, when the
appropriate place for such advice is the guidance itself. If we put
that in the Bill, there is always a danger that it will become out of
date or place one group above another. We do not believe that putting a
whole list of consultees in the Bill is the right approach because it
is important to have some flexibility in how we approach consultation,
which is why we believe that it is better to put it in
guidance.</div>

						</b> The guidance will emphasise the importance of
consulting appropriate bodies. We may give examples of what might be
considered appropriate bodies, but I emphasise that we tend, rightly,
to put guidance out for consultation. I would not want to write the
guidance in the Committee, but we will certainly draw attention to the
sort of bodies that might be considered
appropriate.</div>

							<a name="08042490000240"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> I thank the Minister for giving way again. She
talks about the need for flexibility, but I would argue the opposite:
we ought to be quite inflexible when considering whether to consult
parish or town councils. We should say, &#147;Yes, we will do so
under all
circumstances.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08042490000241"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> That is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view. My view is that we might wish to consult other
bodies. As I have said, parish councils might well be appropriate
consultees. When we consider some of the Bill&#146;s later clauses,
particularly those relating to improvements to community transport, we
will see that there are lots of ways in which parish and town councils
might have an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>appropriate role. However, I do not want to get into the business of
putting every consultee on the face of the Bill, because there is
always a danger of missing out a group or giving one group precedence
over another. We do not want to put it on the face of the Bill, but I
assure the hon. Gentleman that we will certainly consider referring to
parish and town councils in the
guidance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000243"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> A local transport plan might refer to
establishing a quality partnership that goes nowhere near a particular
parish council, because the parish council might be in a completely
different area from the one proposed for the quality partnership. In
those circumstances, I suspect that the guidance would say that the
relevant bodies within an area should be consulted, but overall, I
expect the drawing up of local transport plans generally to involve
consultation with a number of bodies, and I am sure that we will
suggest in the guidance that parish and town councils may be
appropriate bodies.</div>
					<a name="08042490000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also emphasise that when we issue guidance, we try to consult on it
beforehand. When the hon. Gentleman sees it, he might like to
contribute to it anything that is missing, but I assure him that we
will consider it seriously. I understand his point, but I do not feel
that it is right to put long lists on the face of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000262"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> The amendments would mean that operators of bus and
rail services and passengers should be consulted before local
authorities and ITAs make local transport plans. I suspect, given what
happened to the previous amendment, that I am probably not going to get
very far with this.</div>
					<a name="08042490000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000 Act
and the Bill do not confer a duty to have regard to other things but it
makes sense that they should have regard to promoting integrated
transport and how the bus and rail network should work together. Route
utilisation strategies are central to the forward planning activity of
the railway industry. They set out current capacity passenger and
freight demand, operation performance and cost projections to address
the future requirements of rail users, funders and key stakeholders.
The rail utilisation strategies then perform the development and
delivery of timetables, infrastructure, maintenance and renewals of the
network. If local transport authorities are to be safe, integrated,
economic, environmentally sustainable and efficient they must take into
account the area&#146;s current and future rail capacity.</div>
					<a name="08042490000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government will almost
certainly argue that it is more appropriate for local authorities to
decide which organisations they consult, given what has already been
said this morning. By and large that is true, but how many local
authority areas do not contain an operating railway station, for
instance? It cannot be many, if any.
</div>
					<a name="08042490000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will
probably say that the Government will put in guidance the kind of
bodies it would be appropriate for local authorities to consult and the
kind of plans and strategies that should be considered. She will almost
certainly say that it is preferable to have such bodies in guidance
rather than in the Bill because it would be a long list and would
become increasingly out of date over time. There may be some sense in
that. However, if anything, the railways are set to become more
important and as it is much harder to move a railway station than a bus
stop there is a need to encourage more integrated working. There needs
to be a stronger relationship in the legislation between what we do
with rail and what we do with
road.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000263"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The
amendments mirror in their intent, and go slightly further than, my
amendments Nos. 38 and 39, which were not selected. They also mirror
the arguments we had on Tuesday afternoon regarding amendment No. 36.
They specify rail infrastructure managers who, under the definition we
discussed on Tuesday, include operators. There is some merit in putting
them in the Bill because the rail network, as I have previously
explained, transcends local authority borders and is managed or
operated in most cases by local transport authorities, but at the
beginning and the end of train journeys users will be reliant on
transport 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>services which are put in place by the local authority. Therefore, as we
discussed previously, there is some merit in giving such local
transport authorities a responsibility to
consult.</div>
					<a name="08042490000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments go further than amendment No. 36, and there is wide,
all-encompassing phraseology in the Bill regarding such persons as the
local authorities consider fit. That would seem to cover operators of
bus services, operators of rail services and organisations representing
local users of transport. It would be highly unusual if it did not.
However, as I said on Tuesday and on previous occasions, unless we have
real reassurance, I am, in principle, in favour of a concept that
details the responsibilities that are specific to local authorities and
those that transcend what local authorities might do. I am particular
about having those responsibilities set out in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08042490000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Minister gave great reassurance regarding the last amendment, on
Tuesday I was not minded to accept her reassurance regarding amendment
No. 36. As those two amendments almost mirror in intent amendment No.
136, unless the Minister is able to give us more reassurance than she
did on Tuesday, I am minded to support amendments Nos. 142 and 143, if
the Liberal Democrat spokesman wants to test the will of the
Committee.</div>

					<a name="08042490000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">This debate is an absolute
illustration of the fact that, once we start down the line of trying to
put into primary legislation everything about who should be consulted,
every member of the Committee could think of somebody else whom they
felt it appropriate to consult. The debate illustrates the danger of
trying to go down that track.</div>
					<a name="08042490000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the bodies that the hon.
Gentleman mentioned in his amendment would be bodies that we would be
putting in the guidance; that is without doubt. However, I must say
that I do not feel that it is appropriate to put lists of such bodies
in the Bill, although I can assure him that they are absolutely the
type of bodies that we shall refer to in the guidance and we would
expect local authorities to consult them. I hope that gives the

Hammond:
						</b> I rise not to question the motives behind the
clause, but to probe the Minister on a couple of points arising from
it. The provision is absolutely right and appropriate. Section 112 of
the 2000 Act rightly places a duty on local authorities to have regard
to the transport needs of persons who are elderly or who have mobility
problems. The clause develops that from a duty of development to one of
implementation, and it tidies up the obvious problem of the reference
to elderly people or those with mobility difficulties by expanding the
duty to include all disabled people as defined under the Disability
Discrimination Act
1995.</div>
					<a name="08042490000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the duty of implementation, one of the reasons why the 1995
Act has been so successful is that local authorities have been given
time to comply with it. Although a lot of people would have liked the
implementation period to be shorter, it has allowed local authorities
and other bodies to put meeting the requirements of the 1995 Act into
their normal replacement cycle and therefore absorb some of the extra
costs that have clearly been incurred. Will the Minister say whether
the same intention is reflected in the Bill, so that that there will be
a period of implementation rather than a set date, and that the period
will be similar to that specified under the Disability Discrimination
Act?</div>
					<a name="08042490000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042490000281"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): Clause 11 imposes a
duty to have regard to the needs of disabled persons, but the 1995 Act
is already on the statute book and its provisions must be adhered to,
so what would be the actual effect of not having the clause in the
Bill? To use the favourite word of the hon. Member for Manchester,
Blackley, is it not
otiose?</div>
					<a name="08042490000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000282"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Let me explain a little background to the
clause, which will also help to answer the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. The provision will amend an existing duty
under the 2000 Act to reinforce the message to local authorities that
they must consider the needs of all disabled persons not only when
planning, but when delivering local transport in their areas. The
clause was added to the Bill in the other place by a Government
amendment in response to calls from Lord Low of Dalston to see what
more we could do to disability-proof the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>
					<a name="08042490000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000 Act already places a
duty on local transport authorities when they are developing their
local transport policies, whereby they must have regard to the needs of
persons who are elderly or who have mobility problems. However, the
wording of that duty should now be brought more into line with the
latest disability discrimination
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08042490000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
11 will clarify two points. First, it will make clear that local
transport authorities must consider the needs of all disabled people.
The needs of some people&#151;for example, those with hearing
impairments&#151;might not be covered by the 2000 Act duty. There
might be a case for expanding the provision of audible facilities on
pedestrian crossings or audible travel information. Indeed, some
disability groups have raised concerns that the current duty is too
focused on physical mobility problems at the expense of other forms of
disability, such as hearing or visual
impairments.</div>
					<a name="08042490000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the clause will make it clear that the needs of disabled people must be
considered not only when drawing up local transport plans, but when
putting those plans into practice. For example, the needs of disabled
persons should be considered not only when writing local transport
plans, but when designing a new bus station or negotiating the terms of
a voluntary partnership agreement with bus operators. A local transport
plan might also be the right place to review parking provision for
disabled motorists.</div>

right hon. Member for East Yorkshire, the 1995 Act places a general
duty on public authorities in relation to disabled persons, but there
is some inconsistency in the provisions of that Act and the Transport
Act 2000. We believe that the clause will bring greater consistency and
provide greater clarity. I am sure that the Committee agrees that
everyone will benefit from legislation that is as clear as possible.
The clause also provides a useful opportunity to reinforce the message
that local authorities have no excuse for not taking account of the
needs of all disabled people when planning and delivering local
transport.</div>
					<a name="08042490000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
hon. Member for Wimbledon, if local authorities see a particular
problem in meeting the provisions of clause 11, we will listen to
representations. However, we believe that there should not be a
problem. As the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire said, it is
something that they should be doing anyway, so there should not be a
long delay before implementation.</div>

that is considered reasonable in the circumstances. For example, when
considering setting up a new bus station, if the current one has
particular problems, implementation will obviously be subject to a
variety of time limits. However, the requirement should not be
over-burdensome. We believe that it is something that local authorities
should be doing, but we wanted to use this opportunity to reinforce the
message.</div>

							<b class="B">Ian
Stewart</b> (Eccles) (Lab): My right hon. Friend is
articulating the justification for the clause. In the city of Salford
in my constituency, we have an active disabled drivers association. The
council has sensibly co-opted a delegate from the association,
Mr. Jim Wheelton, on to the planning committee, and he
attends all visits. There is good practice in Salford, but the clause
will bring consistency across the country. That must be to the benefit
of all our disabled constituents.</div>

							<a name="08042490000286"></a>Ms

constituency is leading the way in best practice, and I congratulate it
on taking the needs of disabled people fully into
account.</div>
					<a name="08042490000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
clause 11 is to be welcomed. We expect the commencement order to state
a specific date for its provisions to come into force, but when setting
that date, we will consider local authority views on implementation.
The Government included the clause as a result of representations made
in the other place, and it has been warmly welcomed by representatives
of older and disabled people, including Help the Aged, the Guide Dogs
for the Blind Association and the chair of the Royal National Institute
of Blind People. I hope that the Committee will accept
it.</div>

question for clarification? Will the right hon. Lady confirm that the
duty to look after the needs of disabled people will be complied with
as an overall policy, and that the clause will not mean that every seat
on every vehicle must be disability compliant? I am thinking
particularly of local authorities based in tourist areas, which may
often have a tourist feature as part of their transport system. We have
all seen the trains that run up and down the seafront of many seaside
towns, and I believe that Scarborough uses a 1920s steam bus as part of
its transport provision. The bus has steep stairs to the upper platform
which no disabled person could possibly negotiate. Will she confirm
that the overall provision must be disability compliant, but that
historic vehicles or tourist vehicles will not be forced off the
road?</div>

							<a name="08042490000288"></a>Ms

other parts of the DDA, where operators in such circumstances are
expected to make reasonable adjustments. That is the bit of the DDA
that would cover that kind of operator. The duty in the clause is to
have regard to the needs of disabled people. The specific point raised
by the hon. Gentleman is covered in other parts of the DDA which refer
to &#147;reasonable adjustments&#148; that need to be made in such
circumstances.</div>

why.</div>
					<a name="08042490000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Clerk for helping me to draw up amendment No.
6&#151;it is immediately incomprehensible to anyone who reads
it&#151;which, in effect, would reassert the status quo in involving
metropolitan district councils in drawing up transport plans. Amendment
No. 7 would put a duty on the ITA to consult local authorities&#151;a
similar point was discussed by the hon. Member for Manchester,
Withington&#151;and amendment No. 8 would give a power of veto if a
majority of the local authorities in an ITA area do not agree with the
policies that have been developed after consultation by the
ITA.</div>
					<a name="08042490000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
explain further we have to go back to the core of the Bill, which puts
right some of the failings of the deregulation of bus services
introduced by the Conservative Government&#151;I assume that we will
come to that topic this afternoon&#151;and brings back, after the
abolition of metropolitan councils in the mid-1980s, an authority that
will have both highways and transport powers so that integrated
transport policies can be
developed.</div>
					<a name="08042490000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is unusual about the Government&#146;s proposals, which I will probe
in these amendments and later ones, is that they allow the powers of
highways authorities to be transferred to the integrated transport
authority with the purpose of promoting better transport policies. That
is fine, but there is a real difference between the
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08042490000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
highways authorities in the six metropolitan areas are directly
elected, so someone who has a concern about traffic management
arrangements in their area&#151;there are many concerns in most
metropolitan areas about shopping, waiting and car parking&#151;can
go to their local councillor. They can say that something is wrong and
they want it changed, or that they do or do not want double yellow
lines or a bus lane and so on, and their local councillor can then go
to the council and pursue the matter. Transferring powers to an
integrated transport authority composed of indirectly elected
councillors and perhaps seconded people will remove immediate local
democratic input.</div>
					<a name="08042490000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to ask why that is proposed. If that right
is to be taken away, should we not have some safeguards to ensure that
directly elected people have a right of veto? In the case of
Manchester, six local authorities would be required to say that a
scheme was mad, so it would not be a trivial
matter.</div>

although I note that later amendments deal with the word
&#147;economic&#148;. No, in fact, the situation the amendment
would cover might not be exceptional at all. If the integrated
transport authority proposed a scheme to put bus lanes in four of the
authorities in Merseyside, for instance, and those authorities objected
to it, they would have a veto. That is not an exceptional situation; it
goes much wider than that.</div>
					<a name="08042490000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment gives directly
elected people the power to tell indirectly elected and appointed
people, &#147;You might well have got this wrong.&#148; There have
been so many changes to local government in the past 25 years that we
have got a long way from what I believe is the right
principle&#151;that people who are elected have the right to tax, but
others have the right to throw them out. In this case, we are talking
about people in a new, powerful integrated transport authority who
cannot be thrown out directly.</div>

and I will not press them after I have listened to the profound
arguments made by my hon. Friend the Minister. I am very interested in

Hammond:
						</b> The clause gave me considerable
concern when I read it, and had the hon. Member for Manchester,
Blackley not been faster in getting to the Clerk, I would certainly
have tabled probing amendments&#151;and perhaps not just probing
ones. The hon. Gentleman argued powerfully&#151;some of us will have
experienced this either as councillors before we had the honour of
joining the House or as Members of Parliament&#151;that sometimes
regional transport authorities either completely override or do not
listen to constituents&#146; concerns. As directly elected Members,
we have almost no power to influence or persuade them. I have direct
experience of that previously as a councillor and now as a Member of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08042490000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes on clause 12 indicate that the intent is to remove
the duty to produce plans jointly and place that responsibility solely
on the integrated transport authority. As the hon. Gentleman said, his
amendments would maintain the status quo, which strikes me as not such
a bad thing, unless the Minister can provide some reassurance. I am
sure that she will tell us that the amendments are unnecessary because
the integrated transport authority will inevitably act in consultation,
but in my direct experience that is not always the case. A local
authority might not be able to push its points, concerns and local
transport wishes forcefully enough if it is not a statutory consultee.
The regional authority would be bound to listen to the concerns of
local people, communities and local elected members, if they were
statutory consultees. Amendment No. 6 would provide for that obligation
instead of leaving it to ministerial discretion, guidance or secondary
legislation. Although in many cases it would be preferable to leave the
list of consultees to guidance, in relation to clause 12, owing to the
juxtaposition of the unelected regional body and the elected local
bodies, I am in favour of putting it in the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>
					<a name="08042490000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, amendment No. 7 becomes
valuable only if, as a result of consultation, it can effect the
desired outcome. In many cases, the outcome that is hoped for might be
achieved through the consultation process, but what happens if it is
not? Local communities&#146; needs and wishes and the expressed views
of local, directly and democratically elected representatives can
easily be overridden by the regional transport authority.</div>
					<a name="08042490000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
8 attempts to correct that error, although perhaps it is worded less
fully than I would have preferred. I would have preferred it to say,
&#147;or any part of that plan&#148; rather than just
&#147;plan&#148;, because that would have allowed people to support
the plan overall, but to disagree with parts of it. Notwithstanding
that deficit, amendment No. 8 has considerable merit. I recognise that,
in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mind, these are probing amendments, but
I think that the Minister really needs to reassure us on how the wishes
and views of the local, directly and democratically-elected members
expressed on behalf of constituents will not be completely overridden
by regional transport authorities, as is the experience of some of us
at the
moment.</div>

							<a name="08042490000295"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The clause goes to the heart
of some of the changes in the Bill. We have received many
representations: I, and I am sure all members of the Committee, have
met representatives from some of the PTAs who say that they have
encountered huge problems when trying to take an integrated approach to
implementing or drawing up local transport plans. It may be that one
authority decides simply not to co-operate with work to put together a
good bus strategy across the whole area, and that causes enormous
problems in efforts to improve and integrate public transport in an
area. For example, in my local area in South Yorkshire, the current
system means that transport plans are probably put together by people
on the passenger transport executive; the plans are then sent back to
the metropolitan councils&#151;Doncaster in my case&#151;who will
then agree that the transport plans should go forward and who have a
duty to implement them. So, once a transport plan is agreed, there is a
duty to implement
it.</div>
					<a name="08042490000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the points made to us is that that process is sometimes frustrated
and people end up with a watered-down plan across an area.
Representations about that point have been made when I have met people
in local areas. People from all political parties have raised that
issue&#151;it is not something said just by people of one political
persuasion; it is something many people have said to me. If we
are to have a truly integrated transport approach, it is important to
set up within these areas new integrated transport
authorities, which would have the power to implement the agreed
policies over the range of the area for which they are
responsible.</div>
					<a name="08042490000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12
establishes the key role that integrated transport
authorities&#151;the successors to PTAs&#151;must play in their
areas. That means the duties to develop transport policies and to
produce, review and update a local transport plan will in future lie
with the integrated transport authority in an integrated transport
area. The duty to carry out statutory functions so as to implement
those policies will continue to apply to individual local authorities
in an IT area as well as to the IT authorities themselves. Again, that
replicates the existing situation  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>in which, as I have said, individual metropolitan district councils,
such as Doncaster in South Yorkshire, have a duty to carry out their
transport functions&#151;for example, in relation to parking or
management of the road network. Outside the integrated transport areas,
responsibility for the local transport plan will remain with individual
local authorities, such as county
councils.</div>
					<a name="08042490000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
change we are proposing to make in our major cities will enable there
to be decision making that is more decisive in identifying transport
needs and implementing solutions. By giving the duty to produce local
transport plans to the integrated transport authority, we will
encourage stronger and more strategic transport
planning.</div>

							<a name="08042490000296"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042490000297"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I was coming to that point,
to give some reassurance to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester,
Blackley and other Committee members. First, it is important to
remember that councils will be statutory consultees. Secondly, every
council will be represented on the authority. The opportunities are
available. When we issue guidance&#151;we shall come to clauses on
governance later&#151;we will expect local authorities and the
integrated transport authorities to consult widely with the constituent
councils in their area.</div>
					<a name="08042490000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a vast number of councils in
an area do not agree with the approach being taken, we do not expect it
to be forced on them; however, we must recognise that there might be
situations in which, for example, one council refuses to endorse the
implementation of a bus lane strategy throughout the area. As I said,
many people who serve on passenger transport authorities say that it
can be incredibly frustrating to try to put together good, integrated
transport policies and not be able to. That is a difficult situation.
It is a problem that often stands in the way of delivering good public
transport, and we believe that the approach that we are adopting will
assist the process and enable better delivery of transport in our major
cities.</div>
					<a name="08042490000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safeguards&#151;for instance, ensuring that consultees are statutory
and that every PTA has a representative from each council&#151;will
effectively prevent a small minority of councils from imposing their
will on a majority. We want a level of agreement, but we must take into
account that there are difficulties at the moment that we cannot ignore
if we want to enable integrated transport authorities to deliver good
public transport in their area and good integrated transport
strategies.</div>
					<a name="08042490000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 7 would create a duty for integrated transport authorities to
consult metropolitan district councils about their proposals, but as I
said, clause 9 already imposes a requirement for the ITA to consult
individual authorities when preparing or reviewing its local transport
plan. That is already provided
for.</div>
					<a name="08042490000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 8
would enable a majority of metropolitan district councils opposed to a
local transport plan to prevent it from having effect, but as I said,
the current membership of passenger transport authorities is drawn from
metropolitan district 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>councils. They are designed to be representative of their areas and
ensure that the views of individual authorities are properly
represented when a local transport plan is being drawn up, and that
will continue after the creation of integrated transport authorities. A
majority, at the very least, of the members of each ITA must be elected
representatives of the authorities in that area.</div>
					<a name="08042490000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must get the balance right
between acknowledging the problems faced in some areas by PTEs and
assisting them in implementing proper ITAs, and at the same time giving
the reassurance that I hope I have given by explaining the process that
will be gone through and the fact that councils will be statutory
consultees. There will be representatives from every council on the
ITA. In later guidance, to which right hon. and hon. Members might like
to contribute, we will set out some of the ways in which we believe it
is possible to reach maximum agreement in order for ITAs to proceed
effectively.</div>
					<a name="08042490000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that my comments reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester,

Stringer:
						</b> I support much of what my
right hon. Friend said about the rebalancing that is going on in the
Bill to make it easier to have good transport policies in metropolitan
areas. All of us who have been involved in transport in metropolitan
areas for a long time can recognise the case that she makes.
Occasionally there is cussedness, plain awkwardness or political
differences between authorities that prevent perfectly good transport
schemes from going ahead. I understand that argument, but the purpose
of the amendments was to say, &#147;If you are rebalancing, where do
the electorate come in, because you are rebalancing to a sort of
semi-quango in which the electorate cannot be directly
involved?&#148; In doing that, we need to put in safeguards, whether
those safeguards involve the councils saying, &#147;No, the ITA has
got it wrong,&#148; or&#151;we shall come to the relevant
amendments later&#151;the electorate being able to throw the rascals
out, as they do to us from time to
time.</div>
					<a name="08042490000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those safeguards
are not present, so I thought that these were moderate amendments that
pointed at that. Although what the Minister says is reasonable, those
of us who have worked in two-tier areas for a time know that
councillors can be bloody-minded and they can do things because they do
not like the other lot&#151;sometimes of the same political party. I
shall give an example. When Greater Manchester county council was being
abolished, I was involved in the creation of what is now the museum of
science and industry in Manchester. I went to do the deal with the then
leader of the county council to put the aerospace museum into the
slightly bigger, county-run museum of science and industry. Bernard
Clarke, who was the leader then, said, &#147;You know the reason the
doors of these two museums, which we can integrate if you and I get
together, are facing in opposite directions is that the two council
leaders when they were set up hated each other and would not
co-operate.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>
					<a name="08042490000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That can happen just as easily
in relation to transport, so while we are rebalancing in favour of
making it easier to have an integrated transport policy, we must
recognise that an ITA could have bloody-minded people on it who are not
directly accountable and who could do the equivalent thing in the area
of transport to what happened with those two museums. Because we are
all human beings, the ITA will not always be able to get its policies
right. I live on the boundary of Manchester, Salford and Bury, and at
the moment an appalling road-widening scheme is going on for bus lanes.
Bury, which is the highways authority, has got it completely wrong, in
my opinion and, I would guess, in the opinion of many people who look
at it. The amendments are meant to deal with matters that the ITA gets
wrong, and to put in some checks and
balances.</div>
					<a name="08042490000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
to that, my right hon. Friend the Minister says, is not the electorate.
It is that all the councils that are part of the metropolitan area will
send people along, so they cannot really get it that wrong. I have to
say that that has not been my experience. If we do the arithmetic, we
will find that it depends on the basis of the membership of the ITA. An
ITA could be unreasonably repressive to one authority and put forward
schemes that may well be part of a bigger integrated transport scheme
but are unreasonable to the people who live in the area. It
is unlikely, but, in the case of Manchester, 10
hung councils could all send representatives of a particular
political party. That would be completely unrepresentative of the
districts.</div>
					<a name="08042490000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
withdraw the amendment, but I think that we will come back later in the
Bill not just to this point but to some others that deal with the same
core issue. We may come back to it on Report, because while I agree
with the balance of the Bill, which furthers better transport, I do not
think that we have this
right.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman made a powerful and cogent case
for the Committee accepting the amendments. I am a little puzzled about
why he is now saying that he will withdraw
them.</div>

						</b> The simple answer is that I am withdrawing the
amendments because I think that we would win, given how this place
works. I would not be in this Committee if we were going to defeat the
Government on every amendment. This is the basis of a discussion that
we may return to on
Report.</div>
					<a name="08042490000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that hon. Members have listened carefully to the debate. I
hope that the Government have listened as well. It would not be
sensible for a Labour Member of Parliament to defeat the Government
here and now. I am putting the case, and I hope that my right hon.
Friend the Minister will listen to the discussion on this amendment and
others. I do not want to embarrass
anyone.</div>

						</b> I am a little puzzled by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s mindset. I do not regard myself as being here to
defeat the Government, either. I am here to scrutinise a Bill that is
the Government&#146;s will and to seek to improve it. Surely, if he
is here to do the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>thing, there is nothing wrong with seeking to persuade the Government
through the voting process to accept the
amendments.</div>

						</b> I have great respect for the right hon.
Gentleman, but on this occasion I think that he is being slightly
disingenuous. It is part of his core business to defeat the Government,
but it is not part of mine. I hope that my right hon. Friend the
Minister has listened carefully to this fertile debate. I am sure that
we can make some progress not only in rebalancing the policies in
favour of transport but in ensuring that we do not repress the
democratic process. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
