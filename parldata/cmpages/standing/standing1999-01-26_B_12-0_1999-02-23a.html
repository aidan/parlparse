<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): On a point of 
order, Mr. Gale. An important statement is to be made in 
the House this afternoon. Madam Speaker may allow that 
statement to run until 4.30 pm, but she may allow it to 
run beyond that time. In that event, Mr. Gale, no doubt 
the Government Whip will wish to catch your eye at one 
minute to one to suggest that the Committee resumes at 
the conclusion of the statement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order, but is a 
matter to be discussed through the usual channels. I am 
sure that those involved have taken on board the hon. 
Gentleman's comments.
<P>
I shall put the Question on new clause 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): On a point of 
order, Mr. Gale. Will the Minister speak to new 
clause 5?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was discussed last week, along with 
Government amendment No. 67.
<H4><center>New clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fees</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) The Audit Commission shall prescribe a scale or scales of 
fees in respect of inspections carried out under section 10.
<P>
(2) An authority inspected under section 10 shall, subject to 
subsection (3), pay to the Commission the fee applicable to the 
inspection in accordance with the appropriate scale.
<P>
(3) If it appears to the Commission that the work involved in 
a particular inspection was substantially more or less than that 
envisaged by the appropriate scale, the Commission may charge 
a fee which is larger or smaller than that referred to in 
subsection (2).
<P>
(4) Before prescribing a scale of fees under this section the 
Commission shall consult 
<P>
(a) the Secretary of State, and
<P>
(b) persons appearing to the Commission to represent best 
value authorities.'. [Ms Armstrong.]<P>

"section 54(2)"	 there shall be inserted "or (2A)"	.'. [Ms Armstrong.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
In earlier debates we considered the impact of best 
value on police authorities and police forces. I wish to 
reiterate that police authorities, rather than police forces, 
will be subject to the duty of best value. That will not 
affect in any way the operational independence of chief 
officers enforcing the law.
<P>
Of course, police authorities and police forces need to 
pursue greater efficiency and effectiveness. It is right that 
police authorities should be under the duty of best value, 
in line with their function under the Police Act 1996 to 
maintain an efficient and effective force. However, the 
unique tripartite structure of policing means that chief 
officers will have a key role in delivering best value 
across the board, not least in relation to operational 
matters.
<P>
New clause 6 is designed to achieve two broad aims. 
The first aim is to reflect the role of chief officers in best 
value in relation to the production of the policing plan. In 
practice, the first draft of the plan is prepared by the chief 
constable for submission to the police authority. There is 
an existing obligation to include in the plan a statement 
of the authority's priorities, objectives and performance 
targets. The new clause further requires the plan to outline 
proposed action for achieving the duty of best value.
<P>
That will require the chief constable, when preparing 
the policing plan, to actively consider how policing can 
best be carried out to deliver outcomes that represent best 
value. That requirement will achieve a close fit between 
the policing plan which lays out the strategic proposals 
of the police authorities and the local performance plan. 
The latter plan will include specific performance targets 
which give effect to the authority's overall strategy and 
the chief constable's broader responsibilities to provide 
efficient and effective policing for his area.
<P>
The new clause also requires the chief constable to have 
regard to best value when carrying out the full range of 
his functions.
<P>
Of course, we recognise the need to achieve an 
integrated approach between police authorities and police 
forces under best value. Committee Members will be 
aware that three best value pilots are examining how best 
value will apply to police. Cleveland, Greater Manchester 
and South Wales police are doing valuable work in testing 
the best value framework. They are, for example, already 
considering issues such as how policy making and 
planning processes can be more closely integrated and 
how far they can achieve a similarly integrated approach 
to providing value for money. We shall ensure wide 
circulation of the lessons that they learn.
<P>
The second aim is to ensure that Her Majesty's 
inspectorate of constabulary has a clear locus to work 
jointly with the Audit Commission to inspect police 
authorities for the purpose of best value. At the 
moment, its ability to carry out inspections is confined 
to police forces only, and it has no power to inspect 
police authorities. Hon. Members will be aware that 
police authorities are to be best value authorities, but 
police forces are not.
<P>
The Government take the view that it is important for 
HMIC's professional expertise on operational matters to 
be brought alongside that of the Audit Commission on 
efficiency and effectiveness, to ensure that police 
authorities will be inspected in a way that is consistent 
with HMIC's planned approach with respect to police 
forces under best value. In practice, police authorities and 
forces will work closely together in providing best value, 
and the approach to inspections will have to reflect that.
<P>
Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary has a 
proactive record in its work with the Audit Commission. 
The development of joint protocols on their respective 
roles in the audit and inspection processes is already well 
advanced. Contrary to what I said earlier I apologise for 
my error they expect to agree a memorandum of 
understanding shortly. New clause 6 will greatly facilitate 
the working relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have several questions about the new 
clause. Perhaps the Minister will comment on them before 
we debate the matter further.
<P>
What representations has the Minister received from the 
Association of Police Authorities and the Association of 
Chief Police Officers about their satisfaction with the 
proposed new arrangement? Does she not think that it is 
slightly unorthodox that HMIC, which is composed 
principally of retired chief constables and senior police 
officers, should inspect the authorities for which those 
officers might have worked previously? Does the Minister 
understand the concerns that have perhaps been 
communicated to her about that?
<P>
What is the likely nature of the memorandum of 
understanding between HMIC and the Audit 
Commission? Again, it seems that we are working a little 
blind, and dealing with unorthodox constitutional 
innovations whereby legislation makes certain provision, 
but operation is determined by agreements that are made 
entirely on the Government's executive authority, without 
parliamentary scrutiny. Given the controversy about the new clause, would not it be better for the Government to withdraw it, with a view to presenting it again on Report? 
At that time, the memorandum of understanding might 
have been published, so we should at least not be 
discussing the matter in complete darkness.



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Discussions have been going on. 
The hon. Gentleman needs to understand the present 
relationship between police authorities, police constables 
and the force. At the moment, HMIC does not inspect 
police authorities, but their representatives meet. The 
inspectorate inspects the police force on the basis of 
the policing plan that is approved by the police 
authority. The same procedure will roll forward into 
best value. That will replicate existing procedure. 
Therefore, HMIC, not a best value inspectorate, will 
work alongside the Audit Commission.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the nature of the 
memorandum of understanding. A working paper on the 
framework was developed in December last year between 
the Commission and the HMIC. I tried unsuccessfully to 
distribute it to members of the Committee last night, but 
it is now available.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister continues, 
perhaps I should inform the Committee that civil servants 
arrived this morning with an armful of letters for hon. 
Members which were delivered to the Board last night but 
inadvertently returned to the Department. I ruled that they 
should not be made available first thing this morning 
because they were especially relevant to new clause 5, 
which was not open for discussion. As hon. Members will 
not have an opportunity to study new clause 5 in depth 
this morning, I felt that the letters should not be made 
available during the sitting. They are on the Table and 
may be collected by hon. Members at the end of the 
sitting.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale, I appreciate 
that this is perhaps of only tendentious interest to the 
Chair, but the Minister has sought to circulate to the 
Committee information that is germane to the debate 
the Minister has opened her envelope. I realise that what 
happened is not her fault, but the Committee is in a 
slightly difficult position. Would it be possible to reserve 
discussion on this clause until a later stage, and return to 
it after we have had an opportunity to examine the papers?



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was informed this morning that the 
documents were relevant to new clause 5, which was not 
open for debate as it had already been debated with 
Government amendment No. 67. On that basis, rather than 
circulate documents that hon. Members would open and 
read during discussion of other matters, it made more 
sense to allow them to be circulated later. If I am being 
told that the documents are relevant to what we are 
discussing now rather than to new clause 5, I shall have 
to reconsider. Will the Minster clarify the position?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They are relevant to new clause 5 but 
they are also relevant to new clause 6. They provide 
background information, which I said that I wished to 
circulate on as many issues as possible. Even though they 
are not essential to the debate on new clause 6, they 
provide useful background information. The document's 
status is that of an agreement a working paper between 
the Audit Commission and the inspectorate. If hon. 
Members wish to look at it now, I am happy for them to 
do so, although the principle is that we do not expect 
anyone to come to the final formal agreement until they 
see the colour of the Bill. By simply agreeing an 
amendment through a new clause this morning we cannot 
tell everyone outside that they may now proceed. Of 
course, before completing the final memorandum, they 
will want to examine the Bill after its passage through 
both Houses of Parliament. This is usual practice. I 
suspect that members of this Committee are getting 
slightly more information than previous Committees on 
these matters at a similar stage. I am more than happy for 
the documents to be available now, but I also do not think 
it absolutely essential for everyone to have read them fully 
before considering the nature of the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that the 
Department endeavoured to circulate the documents last 
night, so no reflection should fall on the Department for 
the fact that hon. Members did not receive them then. The 
documents apparently were inadvertently returned to the 
Department through the system instead of being placed 
on the Board for hon. Members.
<P>
However, as the Minister has chosen to refer to 
documents that were not circulated in time for the 
discussion of the Clause, I do think it proper that hon. 
Members should be given the opportunity to study them 
before further consideration of the clause. I will therefore 
suspend the sitting until 10.55 am, to allow the documents 
to be circulated and read. The Committee will then resume 
precisely where we left off, with discussion of new 
clause 6.
<P>
<H5>10.44 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>10.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we are 
debating new clause 6, not the documents that have been 
circulated, which contain background information and so 
should not be debated in substance.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall say a little more about new 
clause 6. I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex 
(Mr. Jenkin) will reflect on the comments that he made 
about Her Majesty's chief inspectors. I thought that his 
view was somewhat outdated because, since 1994, lay 
representatives have been sitting on the inspectorate, 
which will continue to act in an impartial way in dealing 
both with police authorities and chief constables in its 
inspection of forces. It is important that we let chief 
inspectors know that we have confidence in the work that 
they do and the manner in which they do it. If we do not, 
Parliament should change the nature of their work. It is 
clear that, since 1994, the police inspectorate has not been 
as the hon. Gentleman described it. I hope that he 
recognises that it plays an important role.
<P>
On the representations from the Association of Police 
Authorities and ACPO, it is interesting that ACPO 
initially opposed the first half of the new clause because 
it felt that it did not go far enough. It wanted best value 
duty to apply to chief constables instead of, or as well as, 
to the police authority. The Home Secretary wrote to 
ACPO to say that it is right that the statutory duty should 
apply to the police authority, in line with its duty to 
maintain an efficient and effective force, but he also 
recognised the need to reflect the role of chief constables 
in delivering best value, which the amendment to
section 8(2) of the Police Act 1996 does. ACPO is content 
with that and the APA also supports it.
<P>
The APA opposed the inspection of police authorities 
for reasons that I understand, although, in fact, the 
inspection will be very much in line with the role that 
HMIC already plays in relation to police authorities. 
However, if police authorities have responsibilities to 
maintain an efficient and effective force, given to them 
by previous legislation, there must be a means of ensuring 
that they are doing just that, and that is what the 
inspectorate will be concerned about.
<P>
The APA was consulted at official level in January 
about the new role for HMIC, although it was well aware 
of the plans through its regular meetings with the Home 
Office and the Home Secretary. In its response, the APA 
opposed giving HMIC the power to inspect police 
authorities, arguing that it would represent a significant 
shift in the constitutional position of HMIC from 
reporting to the Home Secretary on efficiency and 
effectiveness of police forces. However, Home Office 
Ministers have been consulted on the stance of the APA 
and remain adamant that the power for HMIC to inspect 
police authorities is both appropriate and necessary. The 
Home Secretary wrote to the APA chair, councillor
Dr. Ruth Henig, to explain his decision last week, but has 
not yet received a response. Home Office Ministers have 
considered and debated the issue carefully I know from 
personal experience among themselves, with me and 
with the APA, and they remain convinced on the matter.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If police authorities have a responsibility for the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the police force, it would 
be bizarre to exclude them from best value. Once they 
are involved in best value, inspection becomes part of the 
process. We want to ensure that any inspection is 
appropriate to the constitutional position between the 
Home Secretary, the Government, police authorities and 
chief constables hence there must be an appropriate 
relationship between the Audit Commission and HMIC to 
secure the right balance. That is why we invite the 
Committee to accept new clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and the Deepings):</B> 
The Minister says that arguments for the new clause are 
persuasive, but I find them very unpersuasive. The 
governance of the police is different from that of local 
authorities, as acknowledged by the Minister and in the 
document that was hurriedly produced and distributed this 
morning. Police governance is tripartite and each part of 
the police service, though overlapping, is discrete and 
distinct. The roles of the Home Secretary, the police authority and the chief constable are clearly defined and well established in practice, but the new clause cuts across 
that well-established tradition.
<P>
I say that for some of the reasons that the Minister 
mentioned. As she rightly said, the requirement in law lies 
with the Home Secretary. In accordance with section 36 
of the Police Act 1996, he has to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"exercise his powers under the provisions of this Act in such a 
manner and to such an extent as appears to him to be best calculated 
to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the police" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the very words that were used by the Minister. However, 
under the new clause, the line of accountability does not 
pass up to the Home Secretary but, by definition, runs in 
parallel as it does for all best value authorities on a 
different line of accountability to the Secretary of State. 
We need to know whether ultimately it will be the Home 
Secretary, with his legal powers to guarantee effectiveness 
and efficiency, who will be responsible for ensuring best 
value, or the Secretary of State. The Bill seems to 
contradict itself in that respect.
<P>
The second major problem was also acknowledged by 
the Minister. I know that you have forbidden us from 
engaging or at least encouraged us not to engage 
directly with the document, Mr. Gale 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman was right the 
first time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> But it is an essential background document 
to the issues. You, in your infinite wisdom, Mr. Gale, 
defined it so by adjourning the Committee briefly to allow 
us to read it. It mentions best value as representing a 
formidable challenge to parts of public services that have 
been relatively sheltered from benchmarking. Yet, we 
know that the Audit Commission has carried out extensive 
benchmarking of police authorities.
<P>
What specific examples of best value criteria that are 
not already dealt with adequately by the Audit 
Commission can we expect as a result of the new 
arrangements? Specific comparisons can already be made 
from authority to authority; they have been carried out 
very efficiently and described in some detail in a 
comprehensible document from the Audit Commission. 
What additional targets and criteria are likely to emerge? 
The Minister must have a view on that. It must have been 
discussed in the consultations between the Audit 
Commission and HMIC.
<P>
That brings me to the problem of the relationship 
between those two bodies. There has been the working 
paper resulting from initial discussion between the two 
bodies, but, essentially, HMIC will have the power to 
inspect police authorities about best value duties in 
addition to the Audit Commission's power of inspection 
under clause 10. The Bill reinforces the Audit 
Commission's role in the process, yet we have that 
doubling up. I do not deny that there will be some 
co-operation, but it seems extraordinary that, in different 
parts of the same legislation we are giving different bodies 
powers of inspection that will be at least superfluous and 
possibly contradictory, even allowing for the possible 
good practice and spirit of co-operation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is not the danger that, where roles of 
different regulatory authorities overlap, when there is an 
issue of public concern a topical example would be 
racism in the police force, which cannot be conducive to 
best value in policing they will compete with each 
other? If the Audit Commission has certain views on how 
to deal with the problem, I can imagine that HMIC will 
be even keener. That may be a bad example, but examples 
are what we need because it is difficult to see how the 
authorities will not try to outdo each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. 
The background document tells us that we need to clarify 
how the audit and inspection of best value will work with 
related imperatives such as proficiency plans and crime 
and disorder strategies. The problem is not just that the 
Home Secretary already has a statutory responsibility to 
ensure efficiency and effectiveness. Requirements are 
already enshrined in law for police authorities to conduct 
proper consultation with local people and to deliver a plan 
for proper policing in a given area.
<P>
Since those statutory requirements already exist, one 
cannot help thinking that police authorities have been 
shoehorned into the Bill. They do not fit very neatly 
because they are very different from local authorities. 
Whereas local authorities may not always have 
established that sort of good practice in respect of local 
consultation drawing up plans that are discussed with 
people in the locality and then amended accordingly and 
properly audited police authorities have had to do so by 
law. Police authorities have been shoehorned into the Bill 
in a way that challenges the very nature of the governance 
of the police.
<P>
The tripartite system is well respected and jealously 
guarded by all elements. The Bill is a real threat to it. A 
further threat that has become clear during our discussions 
is the setting of national targets and objectives, which is 
reinforced in the important background paper. We are told 
that local policing plans
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will be a mix of national objectives and PIs as at present, 
supplemented by ones that reflect local circumstances and priorities 
and which have been informed by effective consultation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Constabulary independence has been an important part 
of the evolution of policing in this country. That is not 
true of all countries, as I said earlier in Committee, so 
the Bill poses the danger of nationalisation of the police, 
because all police forces wil be obliged to meet national 
politically defined targets. The document talks about 
whether the police force has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"conducted any `zero-based' reviews of areas of policing activity?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an example of a national requirement which 
might be appropriate in some cases, although less 
appropriate in others. The Bill will undoubtedly dilute the 
discretion of chief constables and local police authorities. 
The Association of Police Authorities, understandably, 
strongly opposes this worrying part of the Bill, which is 
a slap in the face for police authorities. That is why they 
have expressed their fears in such strong terms. Police 
authorities are, rightly, answerable to the local 
community, and believe that they should be the principal 
managers of those affairs.
<P>
More importantly, the proposal is a threat to the 
independence of chief constables in the operational affairs 
of their force. That threat is a long-held dream of some 
on the political left, who deeply resent the fact that police 
have constabulary independence and that chief constables 
have discretion in operational matters. They do not 
believe that chief constables can be trusted to make 
appropriate and responsible judgments in their respective 
areas.
<P>
The new clause is dramatic, and significant, but 
confused. The lines of accountability to the Home 
Secretary and the Secretary of State, the problem of 
nationalisation of the police and the setting of national 
targets even when they are inappropriate and unwise, 
create confusion in respect of the role of HMIC, which 
considers policing operations and the Audit Commission, 
which already has a well-established series of 
performance indicators. I hope that the hon. Lady will tell 
the Committee what additional indicators she expects to 
be introduced and how the blurring of the lines of 
accountability will be dealt with. Will such matters be the 
Secretary of State's responsibility as in the rest of the Bill, 
or the Home Secretary's? Will she tell us, too, whether 
the proposal will have any impact on the existing statutory 
arrangements for consultation and the drawing up of local 
police plans? Will the new requirements for consultation 
in the rest of the Bill apply to police authorities or will 
existing consultation arrangements be satisfactory? Those 
questions require answers.
<P>
In summary, this is a worrying aspect of the Bill for 
police forces and police authorities and for all who value 
and support good policing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> I think that we share 
some of the fears that have been expressed by the official 
Opposition. I also think that we agree with some of what 
the Minister said in favour of the new clause. The problem 
is that so far the Minister has failed to convince us that 
best value and police authorities mix.
<P>
Earlier, the Minister claimed that the proposal has 
nothing to do with police operations, and perhaps she will 
confirm that statement. My problem is that if police 
authorities cannot influence priorities for their forces, 
what is the point of best value in the first place?
<P>
The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings 
spoke about the independence of constabularies, and I am 
sure that all Committee members respect that. However, 
such independence requires an independent and 
representative police authority, which will ensure that 
police forces and independent constabularies reflect the 
areas and services that they police. If targets and best 
value requirements are set in police authorities, that will 
have operational implications for constabularies.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Fears have been expressed about applying national 
standards to police authorities, which are diverse and 
disparate and represent diverse and disparate parts of the 
United Kingdom. Consultations about setting priorities 
will make it clear that there are differences in different 
parts of the country.
<P>
We often talk about the difference between urban and 
rural environments, but, in the context of policing, the 
differences are more complex they can be based on 
demography and geography. Different approaches, which 
are built on local knowledge and history, are required in 
different parts of the country. Local constabularies and 
their police authorities have been entrusted with knowing 
how best to police with consent in those areas. We are 
concerned about rules and targets that are laid down from 
the centre because they could impact on that arrangement. 
Will the Minister give an assurance that there will be no 
impact at the local level, where local variations have 
already been established?
<P>
I have flagged up a few concerns, about which I hope 
the Minister will give more details. We seek assurances 
about where police authority responsibilities end and 
where operational policing responsibilities begin, and 
about the fact that, with regard to best value, one will not 
affect the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I feel a strong sense of confusion 
descending on us. The proposed regime will be too heavy 
and cumbersome, and police forces will have to spend far 
too many resources working out to whom they are 
supposed to be answerable.
<P>
I begin by making a confession: I have only the haziest 
idea about what police authorities do, and I cannot name 
single member of my policy authority not even its 
chairman. The only time that it attempted to get in touch 
with me was when disciplinary problems arose as a result 
of alleged harassment in Harrogate police station. Quite 
frankly, in the normal course of events, my police 
authority has disappeared to the far side of the galaxy 
which, for all I know, may be a good thing. Are not we 
expending an enormous effort on some unremarkable 
institutions? The Bill's proposed system could be 
improved on and made lighter.
<P>
One of the principles of good government is that the 
lines of accountability should be clear: there should be a 
simple chain of command, and one should know to whom 
one answers. The Bill will create a tremendous mixture 
of bodies to answer to it will involve an omelette of 
different ingredients.
<P>
I accept that a genuine problem is involved. All parts 
of local government and related services involve a major 
operational element and a bureaucratic element, but we 
may have gone down the wrong path by making 
comparisons with the Office for Standards in Education. 
That comparison is not especially helpful because the 
educational establishment is vastly greater than the police 
establishment. North Yorkshire has 360-odd primary 
schools and many secondary schools, which require an 
enormous physical infrastructure and have major 
administrative requirements. In the educational sector, one 
can as long as one is sensible distinguish between 
operational and bureaucratic elements. If one decided to 
close a string of rural schools, that would have an impact 
on the operational side of education. A distinction can be 
sustained, by and large without too much difficulty.
<P>
Judging by the Minister's comments, I am not 
convinced that that distinction can be made in relation to 
the police service. For example, a few months ago, HMIC 
completed an inspection of the North Yorkshire 
constabulary. It found that there were too many people at 
the top of the pay structures, that certain economies had 
to be made and that greater efficiency in some respects 
was called for, and on top of that the Home Secretary 
decides that a 2 per cent. efficiency saving would be 
slapped on each year.
<P>
There had to be a response to that, and it came entirely 
from the chief constable. This plan was worked out not 
by the police authority but by the chief constable, and the 
police authority said, "Yes, that's fine by us, chaps."	 But 
it meant moving down from seven operational districts to 
three in north Yorkshire. Is that an operational, or a 
structural, matter? Is it related to the way in which the 
police operates, or is it something to do with police 
management. Where does best value fit into that type of 
process? Should it have been initiated by the police 
authority rather than by the chief constable? That is where 
my confusion lies. What is it that police authorities do 
that is so susceptible to being inspected that does not have 
an immediate impact upon police operational structures?

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was simply trying to explain the 
procedures that the right hon. Gentleman, through his 
Administration, set up. The chief constable writes the 
policing plan, which is then approved or not approved 
by the authority, which then has responsibility to ensure 
that the chief constable implements it. It is the authority's 
responsibility to ensure that resources and so on are so 
organised that the chief constable can then, through his 
force, implement the policing plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Therefore, what is inspected? If it is the 
policing plan, that is the operational way in which the 
police operate, so the inspection is an operational matter. 
Assuming that the Minister's explanation is correct, it is 
ludicrous to argue that the inspection is somehow about 
bureaucratic structures and not about operations. The hon. 
Lady said that the inspection was precisely about the 
operation. I simply do not see why the distinction exists 
in practical terms. The attempt to make it exist will create 
great confusion for everyone. Before we know where we 
are, we shall be back trying to find a much simpler way. 
I ask the Minister to think again about whether, what I 
am sure is well intentioned is, in practice, appropriate to 
the sort of services that we are discussing, and to consider, 
in the light of the real responsibilities of police authorities 
and chief constables, whether a simpler formulation 
would not work much better.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate 
about what happens now and about whether we should 
take forward the tripartite arrangement. The right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) is really 
arguing that the role of police authorities is redundant. 
His hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The 
Deepings (Mr. Hayes) argues precisely the opposite. 
Conservative Members, who were responsible for 
enshrining current procedures, need to make up their 
minds about whether what they did was the right thing. 
The Government, without a new police Act, are 
examining whether both those arms and their relationship 
to the Home Secretary can hold the public's confidence 
that local people's aims and objectives will be pursued 
effectively and efficiently in the way that statute already 
demands of police authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman rises to intervene. 
He has contradicted himself several times. Perhaps he 
should wait to read his speech. Clearly he had problems 
this morning, and I know that he missed my opening 
remarks on new clause 6. He was so busy collecting the 
material for his speech that he did not hear what I said, 
which was that ACPO's criticism was that the new clause 
did not go far enough and that the association wanted a 
firm duty to be placed on chief constables. Instead of 
opposing the new clause I suppose that it could be called 
opposition ACPO said that it did not go far enough, that 
it was not drafted exactly in the terms that the hon. 
Gentleman relayed to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I am going to have my say.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman had a go at us about 
performance indicators, as did the hon. Member for 
Torbay (Mr. Sanders) Performance indicators for the 
police are not new: national performance indicators 
were included in a measure introduced by the 
Conservative Administration, and are currently under 
examination by the Audit Commission. The Commission 
and the inspectorate agree that there is too much overlap 
and confusion and that co-operative working must be 
more effective. Inspections must be conducted more 
coherently and, through current performance indicators, 
must relate efficiently and effectively to the Audit 
Commission's work.
<P>
HMIC will change the form and function of 
inspections. It will no longer make regular, lengthy visits 
to police forces, except in certain well-defined 
problematic circumstances. We have heard, for example, 
about problems specific to north Yorkshire.
<P>
Overall, the inspectorate will have a much lighter 
touch, and the new arrangement will require analysis of 
what is happening as well as a more arm's-length 
relationship. The Audit Commission and HMIC came 
together by learning the lessons of their current regimes. 
Their shared concerns took them to a level at which they 
could examine the working paper. Those discussions have 
been going on for a long time, and began even before the 
Bill was published. They arose from a recognition of the 
need for greater coherence and closer co-operation.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex has difficulty with 
the notion that two separate organisations can work 
together effectively. He seems to think that such 
organisations can only work through competition that he 
described as being of the worst nature. Such competition 
does not seek to get benefits from those organisations and 
achieve value-added, but makes one want to have a go at 
the other. The Government, HMIC and the Audit 
Commission do not regard the matter in that way.
<P>
I understand the hon gentleman's concerns. However, 
the Government have gone a long way to reassure 
Committee Members, who must use a little of the 
common sense glimpsed in the comments of the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon. However, I do not agree 
with the right hon. Gentleman that the constitutional 
settlement represented by the Tripartite relationship 
should be broken. A more accountable and public face 
achieved by the Association of Police Authorities and the 
running and management of the force will meet the 
objectives worked out by police authorities through their 
consultations with the public. That clear relationship 
should be maintained.
<P>
The Home Secretary is accountable for police 
authorities. References in the Bill to the Secretary of 
State, in relation to the police, refer to the Home 
Secretary. That is the common practice in Bills of this 
kind, and I reassure hon. Members that it applies in
this instance.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, I agree that policing requirements in Durham 
will be very different from those in Cornwall, despite the 
strong rural elements in both counties. Different priorities 
will naturally exist, but those must relate to local people's 
priorities. We know, from work that has been done, that 
despite the differences between Cornwall and Durham, 
people in those counties want burglary and violent crime, 
for example, to be tackled. Key performance indicators 
are developed from what is seen to be nationally relevant, 
but the thrust of best value is that that process should be 
owned locally. Local performance indicators should be 
set, and what happens should involve local ownership and 
local flavour. However, there should also be ways for folk 
in one area to know whether they are getting the same 
sort of deal as those in a neighbouring county. If that does 
not happen, they should be able to ask why. We want 
to institute a regime that will enable people to ask such 
questions. If consultation is held in a vacuum, people who 
are not immersed in the issues as a member of the police 
authority would be are not provided with the tools to 
enable them to ask key questions. What is proposed is 
partly intended to ensue that they can do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> My county is Devon, but I know what 
the Ministers means. Local variation is important. An 
obvious example is that marine crime would be far more 
important to the Devon and Cornwall constabulary than 
to that of the west midlands. However, it is clear from the 
Minister's answer that best value will affect operational 
matters. If it is to work with respect to consultation, and 
people are to be able to have their say on what happens 
locally and an input on policing matters, there will be 
clear implications for operational matters.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not want to be disingenuous about 
this matter. The chief constable of my area is concerned 
about how local people respond to the priorities that are 
set, and what is being achieved. In that sense, chief 
constables are affected by what happens locally, and so 
they should be. If they were so out of touch in their 
operational management as not to be aware of and 
respond to the public's concerns, they would not be doing 
a very good job. Of course, best value will affect that, and 
a jolly good thing too. However, that does not mean that 
best value will provide a means to argue how many people 
should be on duty in a certain village at a certain time. 
As in other cases, it will be a matter of discussing 
priorities, and assessing whether results show that 
responsibilities have been organised to achieve the 
identified ends.
<P>
What I have outlined should, to some extent, already 
be happening. We believe as do the police authorities 
currently undergoing the three pilot projects and, very 
strongly, the Home Secretary that more coherence is 
needed, and that we need more determinedly to pursue the 
disciplines of efficiency and effectiveness, which, despite 
being set out in the Police Act 1996, have not, in some 
places, been brought to bear as they should have been. 
When that has not happened it is partly because there has 
not been enough effective working between the APA, 
police authorities and chief constables. We need to bring 
them more closely together while respecting the different 
roles of police authorities, chief constables and the 
Home Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is not the Minister afraid of a gap opening 
up between efficiency as defined by the regulatory 
authorities, and efficiency as defined by most citizens 
living in a particular area? The Minister's constituency is 
largely similar to mine. I am sure that her constituents 
will judge on the basis of the presence of policemen on 
the street and in the villages, but the criteria applied to 
efficiency in benchmaking may not relate to that at all.
<P>
The police authority might see itself as wonderfully 
efficient but our constituents in the villages might 
disagree because they do not see any policemen on the 
streets to deal with their inconveniences and bothers. We 
need to ensure that the criteria do not remain solely part 
of an esoteric intellectual debate, but relate to people's 
real lives.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I agree absolutely with the main thrust 
of the point made by the right hon. Member for Skipton 
and Ripon, but I also know that my constituents want less 
car crime in rural areas where vehicles can be picked up 
in Weardale and transported across to Cumbria for 
export and that they want some measure of achievement 
in that respect. The local liaison committees in my 
constituency are now talking much more about a crime 
audit and they keep a record, published monthly in the 
local paper, of how many crimes have been committed in 
each village. That is as important to them as seeing a 
policeman on the streets. People want to see policemen 
for reassurance but they also want a measure of crime 
running out of control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the Minister envisage that 
co-operation between police forces should itself be subject 
to audit and inspection? My constituency faces the 
problem of criminals coming down from neighbouring 
metropolitan areas to the north and up from the south 
along the motorway networks, knocking off cars and 
disappearing back to their heartlands. They cannot be 
caught in north Yorkshire because they are out of it within 
half an hour. An important part of crime prevention and 
detection is the ability of forces to co-operate. What 
mechanisms will enhance such co-operation? Too often 
even the computers used by different forces are 
incompatible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies, I 
want to make it clear that we are moving wide of the new 
clause. I have been lenient but we must not move too 
wide of it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will not be tempted down that road 
in any case because of the contradictions in the official 
Opposition's arguments. The hon. Member for South 
Holland and the Deepings argued that we are going to 
nationalise the police force.
<P>
We must achieve a proper balance between the Audit 
Commission's work with police authorities, which is 
relatively new, and the work of HMIC. Some work is 
being done jointly. Our debate has demonstrated that lines 
between the responsibilities of the police authority and of 
chief constables are not and cannot be so clearly drawn 
that movement across them is impossible. That makes 
effective co-operation to achieve best value for public 
essential, as is achieving coherence between the different 
regulatory and inspection regimes. Our debate and 
Opposition Members' contribution to it have made the 
case for the new clause and I hope that we can agree to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I listen carefully to the Minister, who 
takes great trouble to explain at length what she 
understands the Bill to mean, but her account of the new 
clause is particularly wordy and unclear. With the best of 
intentions, she wants the Audit Commission and HMIC 
to co-operate in sweetness, harmony and light to improve 
the policing service, but, when people inspect the police 
authorities and the police service under the auspices of 
best value, what will actually happen will be rather 
different from what she expects. If, to use her words, she 
has reassured chief constables that the proposal will 
follow existing procedures and merely puts legislative 
clothing on what more or less already happens, I can 
understand chief constables hoping for the best and 
hoping that things will not change dramatically, but the 
Minister hinted that the Audit Commission would be 
substituted in large measure for HMIC.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady shakes her head, but she 
made it clear that HMIC would be doing less, inspecting 
purely policing matters and that the Audit Commission 
would take over issues such as value for money policing.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford (Mole Valley):</B> One has visions of 
some poor police inspector trying to explain to the lay 
men and women on the Minister's liaison team why, 
despite having a police authority, a police commissioner, 
HMIC, the auditor and the Audit Commission and teams 
of people to ensure that he was meeting his standards, 
there had been an increase in car crime. Despite working 
with the authority next door and meeting the 
benchmarking targets to the satisfaction of various panels 
and clubs, that police inspector would have to say, "Sorry, 
but car crime in the area has shifted the wrong way." Does 
my hon. Friend agree with me and my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Skipton and Ripon that that will be 
difficult to explain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. 
Missing from his account is that the Bill hinges on the 
Secretary of State's ability to set performance standards. 
The Bill as drafted and the new clause gives the Home 
Secretary or the Secretary of State the power to set 
additional performance standards, but the Minister has yet 
to say what those will be. If performance standards are 
included in the existing list of performance indicators, 
what will be the effect on operational policing if certain 
standards are mandatory, legally enforceable and more 
important than other performance standards?
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and 
Ripon is right: what might seem efficient to the Audit 
Commission and to the Secretary of State in his lofty 
office in St. James's could seem extremely lumpy in a 
policing plan for a rural area such as my constituency in 
Essex. [Interruption.] The Minister shows her ignorance 
by suggesting that North Essex is not rural it is very 
rural indeed. We are pleased with our new rural policing 
plan, which has been put in place entirely by the chief 
constable and his deputy; it will be a big improvement. It 
does not look efficient on paper because it segments 
certain police from the urban centres where much of the 
crime is committed, but rural policing needs protection, 
and we have no clue about what national performance 
standards the Secretary of State might set. If the hon. Lady 
can give us an example, I will give way to her 
immediately.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I made it absolutely clear when we 
debated the relevant clause that national performance 
indicators currently exist. The Audit Commission is now 
consulting on the next set of performance indicators, as 
usual. It does so every year. Police authorities and chief 
constables are having their say on that, as are others. That 
process will continue. There will be full consultation on 
any performance indicator before it is introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady signally failed to give a 
single example of the sort of things that we are looking 
for. Having tripped up in an earlier debate 
[Interruption.] These performance standards could finish 
up as a straitjacket on what chief constables can achieve 
operationally. They are additional to the present standards.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They were brought in by the previous 
Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> These performance standards are to do 
with accountancy and efficiency rather than pure policing, 
which standards relate to at present. My right hon. Friend 
the member for Skipton and Ripon and my hon.
Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings 
are absolutely right: the blurring between operational 
matters and the supervision of police authorities is pretty 
thorough.
<P>
The Minister still has given no indication of the costs 
of this extra supervision on police authorities. If I sit down 
now perhaps she will answer those two points about costs 
and the blurring of the operational and supervisory role of 
the police authorities. The hon. Lady is not going to 
answer. That is the end of that then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I had not intended to come back into the 
debate, but I must as the hon. Lady discourteously would 
not give way having criticised me personally in her 
speech.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Oh dear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I do not want to be unnecessarily harsh. I 
know that her grasp of these matters is slight and she 
is learning as she goes along. Frankly, having hurriedly 
distributed a paper during the course of proceedings, it ill 
befits the Minister to accuse anyone of poor preparation.
<P>
I should like to affirm two points which have not been 
answered. First, what additional benefit in terms of 
standards or targets will the legislation offer? The 
Minister rightly said that the Audit Commission routinely 
consults on the evolving criteria that it uses, the targets 
that it sets and the measurements that it currently studies 
and publishes. What additional standards will be 
introduced? She should answer that, just by way of 
example. She must have a clue about those additions. 
Surely, following her discussions, she has thought about 
areas that are not currently dealt with adequately which 
should be added.
<P>
If the Minister has no clue about that, what is the point 
of the legislation. If the existing arrangements that she 
describes and lauds she said that the Audit Commission 
does this marvellously and consults regularly and evolves 
its standards why have the change? Secondly, correction 
is required for the sake of the record about the attitude 
of the Association of Police Authorities on the clauses. 
It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"More contentious is the proposal to give Her Majesty's 
Inspectorate of Constabulary power to inspect police authorities in 
relation to their best value duties. This will be in addition to the 
Audit Commission's power of inspection under clause 10 of the 
Bill."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said in my remarks, which were not contradictory 
as she will see if she reads the record, clause 10 says 
one thing and this new clause says something that it is 
additional. It is not a contradiction but a parallel 
arrangement that is pointed out by the APA which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The APA is strongly opposing this amendment."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not woolly or vague; it is strongly against it. 
[Interruption.] Well, the first time that I said that, the 
Minister said that I had misinterpreted its remarks.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> No, because you would not give way to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, the Chair is not giving 
way to anyone. Secondly, I should like to return to the 
matter under debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I do not want to be petty, but there are 
quid pro quos.
<P>
The Association of Policy Authorities has been 
absolutely clear about its view on this. It also said this is 
important because it has been challenged in the Minister's 
remarks that the current responsibilities of chief 
constables, police authorities and the Home Secretary are 
clearly defined, well understood and comprehensible, and 
do not require the widescale amendment that the Bill, at 
least, implies. We do not know what will result because, 
in a contradictory fashion, the Minister has said, in her 
efforts to persuade chief constables, that there will not be 
much change but, in hyping up the Bill, she said that best 
value will lead to an enormous improvement in such 
matters, and, presumably, by implication, policing will 
improve, to the benefit of all citizens. So we do not know 
whether it will make much difference or not.
<P>
My questions remain unanswered. We have no details 
about what additional benefits this part of the Bill will 
deliver. Certainly, we have no unequivocal assurances 
about the impact that it will have on the well established 
and, in the words of the APA, "well defined"	 lines of 
accountability and responsibility that currently exist under 
the tripartite arrangement in respect of the governance of 
police forces. In that respect, the clause is sadly lacking, 
and the Minister's explanation of it is even poorer.

Throughout the debate, I have consistently stated that 
transparency is a key governing principle of best value. 
New clause 8 is designed to promote such transparency 
and to ensure that it will be possible to make proper 
comparisons between different best value authorities, 
particularly with regard to their financial performance.
<P>
New clause 8 will extend the application of section 2(1) 
of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 to 
cover all best value authorities. At the moment, it applies 
only to some of them, and bodies such as waste disposal 
authorities, the Greater London authority and its 
functional bodies are not subject to the requirements of 
that provision.
<P>
Section 2(1) of the 1980 Act identifies those bodies that 
will be subject to any recommended code of practice that 
the Secretary of State may issue relating to the publication 
of information. The 1980 Act is also used to allow the 
Secretary of State to make regulations in respect of any 
information described in the code, in order to ensure that 
it is published by the relevant bodies.
<P>
We intend the power to be used primarily to govern the 
manner in which best value authorities publish financial 
and accounting information; it will be complemented by 
new clause 9, which we have now tabled and will discuss 
shortly, and which governs the keeping, preparation and 
certification of accounts.
<P>
The Opposition were quick off the mark and tabled new 
clause 1 before the Government tabled new clause 8. We 
accept that it raises a number of important issues relating 
to the transparency of the best value process, so 
considered it carefully. We are grateful to Opposition 
Members for allowing us the time not only to examine 
the new clause but to address the issue generally. We all 
believe that the best value framework should deliver clear 
lines of accountability and transparency, so we understand 
the context of their new clause.
<P>
Unfortunately, the new clause would impose 
considerable unnecessary duplication because it would 
require authorities to publish performance plans, reviews, 
decision criteria for the allocation of expenditure for 
service delivery, and guidance.
<P>
Best value authorities are already required to publish 
local performance plans annually. The plans will, of 
necessity, incorporate the outcomes of authorities' 
performance reviews and objectives. They will also 
require a summary of consideration of the standard and 
manner of the exercise of functions, which, inevitably, 
will include consideration of relative priorities.
<P>
We see no obvious attraction in authorities 
re-publishing guidance already published by the Secretary 
of State. We understand hon. Members' wish to ensure that local people are able to consider their authority's performance in a wider context, but the Bill provides for 
that by requiring in the performance plan an assessment 
of the extent to which standards and targets are being met. 
It goes further in that it requires authorities to compare 
performance over more than a year, and against that 
achieved elsewhere.
<P>
Our approach in new clause 6 to local performance 
plans also bring together in one document the key 
information that local people need to assess performance. 
We are able, in guidance, to ensure that the document is 
available in easily accessible form. By contrast, the 
approach suggested in new clause 1 would risk burying 
people in an avalanche of information without giving 
them the means to assimilate or understand it. I recall the 
remark of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon 
in an earlier debate that burying people in an avalanche 
of bureaucracy would probably not be in the best local 
public interest.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the Minister for his 
explanation, and for taking note of some of our concerns 
regarding the publishing of information. The hon. 
Gentleman talked of clarity. However, new clause 8 is 
to put it mildly opaque. What, additionally, will be 
published on account of new clause 8, and by whom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to get 
further into my response, he will find that I can give him 
more information that may assuage his fears.
<P>
Turning to the requirement to publish all 
representations and respond to all requests for information 
within 10 working days, and bearing in mind what I said 
about the public interest, we believe that such a 
requirement would be unduly and unfairly bureaucratic.
<P>
Hon. Members may wish to be reminded that proper 
consideration of the messages coming from consultation 
will be needed anyway, if authorities are to satisfy the 
ordered scrutiny of the local performance plan. We 
consider that more sensible than the mechanistic approach 
proposed in the amendment. It would be more 
constructive, as part of a rolling review programme, to 
summarise the basis on which plans are determined and 
targets set, as this will inevitably include consideration of 
the aspirations of local people. We made those points 
during discussion of new clause 5.
<P>
We also fail to see how a fixed requirement to respond 
to requests for information within a certain time would 
necessarily improve transparency for the public. That 
would ignore the fact that a satisfactory response to some 
requests might take considerably longer than 10 working 
days to produce. It might also encourage some authorities 
merely to acknowledge requests, or to give partial answers 
to meet artificial deadlines. We want to leave such 
prescription and detail behind.
<P>
I am sure that the right hon. Member for Skipton and 
Ripon and his hon. Friends will admit that Government 
could learn from such an approach. Perhaps future 
modernisation, involving parliamentary Committees, 
could take a similar path.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It would of course be open to the 
Secretary of State to set a national performance standard 
for the availability of information in public libraries, or 
for the time within which requests for information should 
be dealt with. Presumably, it is considered good practice 
for local authorities to make public information easily 
available to the local population and to respond within a 
certain time to requests for information. Therefore, why 
should we not include that in the Bill, instead of leaving 
the Secretary of State to set a standard?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, 
but to stipulate a period of 10 working days would be 
unnecessarily bureaucratic and, he would probably accept, 
would almost certainly lead to some of the problems that 
I have described, such as simple acknowledgements being 
used to fulfil a legal duty. That would not be sensible.
<P>
The question raised by the hon. Member for Mole 
Valley (Sir P. Beresford), concerns the publication of 
information on financial performance, the code of practice 
and professional bodies. He will know that a working 
party, including the Chartered Institute of Public Finance 
and Accountability and the Local Government 
Association, has been established with respect to proper 
accountancy practices within the code. We consider that 
the correct way in which to proceed. When the group 
finalises its recommendations, we shall be able to 
assimilate them to ensure that the public interest is 
protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are gratified that, in their new clause 
8, the Government have accepted some of our advice it 
was reflected in our new clause 1. From the Minister's 
account of new clause 8 we are not confident, that the 
public will get from it what they would have got from new 
clause 1. Will the Minister explain the salient differences 
between them, apart from new clause 1(2)?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> In reply to my previous point the 
Under-Secretary cited the CIPFA working party, but as I 
read the clause that we are to consider next, that will be 
redundant anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The working part that includes the LGA 
and CIPFA has been established to identify best 
accounting practice on which a code could be based. 
When the working party gives its views, we shall be able 
to judge whether the code satisfies the objectives outlined.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read 
a Second time.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Mole Valley noted, new 
clause 9 is closely linked to new clause 8, which we 
have just agreed. Throughout our Committee debates, I 
have sought to stress that one of the governing 
principles of the best value framework is that it should 
provide transparency. The new clause is designed to 
help achieve that. Together with new clause 8, it seeks 
to put the accounting arrangements under best value on 
a clear statutory footing.
<P>
The new clause affords the Secretary of State powers 
to issue regulations governing the manner in which best 
value authorities prepare, keep and certify accounts. It 
also allows for regulations to be made about the manner 
in which accounts are deposited and otherwise made 
available for public inspection I should stress again that 
this type of requirement is not a new one. Section 27 of 
the Audit Commission Act 1998 affords similar powers 
to the Secretary of State. We are therefore building upon 
an established precedent, by extracting from the 1998 Act 
elements that are consistent with our overarching 
objective to obtain a transparent framework with regard 
to financial accounting, and that are consistent with other 
features in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> There may be a simpler approach. 
Why did the Minister choose this large and complicated 
new clause rather than amend section 27 of the 1998 Act?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we 
take advice from a panoply of lawyers and the 
parliamentary counsel and I am assured that this is the 
most effective means of ensuring that the transparency of 
accounting practices that are part of the 1998 Act also 
relate to best value.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me why. He 
and indeed the hon. Member for North Essex argues that 
it was not good enough to have provisions in other 
legislation but that they should be built into the Bill.
<P>
I understand the Opposition's argument that we could 
have amended the 1998 Act, but I have been given two 
reasons why we should not do that. The first is that 
section 27 refers to health bodies, which are not best 
value authorities. The second is that that section 
provides for individual rights of objection and 
inspection, which do not sit easily with the careful 
process of inspection set out in clauses 10 to 12. The 
first point about health bodies provides a potent reason 
for not amending the 1998 Act, which would have been 
more complicated than drafting the new clause.
<P>
The clause also provides that, in exercising his powers, 
the Secretary of State will be required to consult the Audit 
Commission, representatives of best value authorities and 
appropriate accounting bodies. That will allow us to take 
proper account of the work mentioned by my hon. 
Friend the Under-Secretary done by the LGA and 
CIPFA within the accounts working group.
<P>
I am satisfied that the combined effect of this clause, 
together with new clause 8, will be to provide for an 
accounting framework that has a firm statutory basis. It 
will also greatly facilitate the provision of consistent and 
timely information about the financial performance of best 
value authorities. That can only create added momentum 
for efficiency improvements and ensure that local people 
have the information they need to judge how their 
authority is performing.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Opposition have a general 
understanding of why the Minister wishes to move in the 
direction specified by new clause 9. She is following a 
long-running trend: the previous Administration examined 
putting responsibility in the right place and ensuring that 
local authority accounts are published. New clause 8 
refers to similar publication.
<P>
The Government have a CIPFA panel working on the 
matter specified in new clause 9. The new clause, 
however, has been tabled before the working party has 
come back, which must engender benevolent thoughts 
among members of the working party.
<P>
I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation for 
not amending section 27 of the 1998 Act, especially as 
the Government have amended an existing Act in new 
clause 8. It would have been simpler and more sensible 
for local government officers to refer to one key point 
in legislation, especially as the difference between 
section 27 of the 1998 Act and new clause 9 seems to 
be minimal. I understand the Minister's explanation that 
bodies covered by the 1998 Act are not covered by the 
Bill. However, new clause 8 provides an offset for the 
same sort of situation.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify why a blunderbuss clause is 
to be added to the Bill. Why cannot the 1998 Act simply 
be amended? Will she explain how new clause 9 differs 
from section 27 of the 1998 Act? The only difference 
seems to involve a group of bodies that are not best 
value authorities.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I thought that I explained that. 
However, I will go through my explanation again.
<P>
Parliamentary counsel advised against amending the 
1998 Act.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Why? What was said?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have already given the reasons for 
that advice. Government Members of the Committee are 
not lawyers thank the Lord but seek to ensure that the 
Bill will be used effectively.
<P>
The Bill relates to local authorities, whereas section 27 of 
the 1998 Act relates to other public bodies, including health 
bodies. Section 27 sets up an inspection and rights of 
objection framework that differs from that of the best value 
regime. My judgment, which is backed by parliamentary's 
counsel's judgment, is that two rights of objection and 
inspection would be confusing and inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> That is all right for the police, though.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Our debate on the police demonstrated 
the rationale for a clearer inspection regime and for public 
rights of objection. We can discuss whether we were right 
to make such a judgment: however, I hope that the 
Committee will accept it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I object to the Minister rejecting 
our right to ask about parliamentary counsel's advice. 
Generally, one does not simply accept the opinion of a 
medical practitioner or dare I say it a dentist: one 
expects to understand why such an opinion is given. One 
expects answers to one's questions: if answers are not 
given, the professionals and, more particularly, the 
patients are put in difficulty. It is my feeling that the 
Committee is experiencing such difficulty.
<P>
The more the Minister explains the new clause, the 
more apparent it becomes that there will be a double lean 
on local authorities. They will have new clause 9 and 
section 27 of the 1998 Act. It is a double blow or a double 
whammy if that phrase is allowed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Members of the Committee will probably have received 
representations about the Bill from the Commission for 
Racial Equality. Its proposed amendments to the Bill 
related principally to clause 17. We had principled 
objections to the shape of clause 17 which the 
Government did not accept. Clause 17 could happily have 
been replaced by new clause 2 or a clause of that nature 
to satisfy the representations from the CRE.
<P>
The CRE says in its briefing that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"public bodies have a particular responsibility to pursue effective 
racial equality policies and practice. Section 71 of the Race 
Relations Act gives local authorities a specific duty in this regard."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree with all that. It sees a problem in the present 
practice: local authorities may have the ability to check 
the bona fides of a sub-contractor and to ensure that it is 
pursuing racial equality policies in accordance with the 
law, but the law does not require authorities to take action 
in that respect. By saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All best value authorities must ensure that all parties entrusted 
with the public sector contract comply with all existing legislation 
regarding equal opportunities and discrimination",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the new clause would satisfy that concern. That is what 
any good contractor would do and we want local 
authorities to have the power to do that.
<P>
I should also like to place on record our total support 
for the CRE's view that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"best value cannot be achieved unless services are delivered by 
organisations (internal or external) which are able to demonstrate 
the application of good equality principles and practices in the 
recruitment and management of their workforce and a commitment 
to creating a workforce which reflects the diversity of the 
community to be served."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister does not accept the new clause, I hope that 
she will give us assurances that local authorities have the 
power to discriminate between bad employers and good 
employers in this respect.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am delighted to welcome the hon. 
Gentleman to his sudden conversion to the cause of the 
CRE.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is not sudden.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We debated the principle of this at 
some length last week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady has just demonstrated that 
she has certain ill-conceived prejudices about 
Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Far from it. I can understand that 
Conservative Members want to ensure that equal 
opportunities legislation is observed across the board. I 
hope that the Committee can be unanimous and give its 
full support. Where it is the law of the land, everyone 
should comply with it just as everyone should observe the 
law generally. This week in particular we have seen the 
consequences of people, whatever their role in life, not 
upholding the principles and practice of the Race 
Relations Act 1976.
<P>
The purpose of the Bill is to place a duty on local 
authorities to achieve best value, not to introduce a new 
duty that would require them to police contractors' compliance with equal opportunities legislation. That would be the effect of the new clause and, despite my 
joking earlier, I share the sentiments expressed by the hon. 
Member for North Essex. However, it is important that 
we think about how to ensure that race relations measures 
work effectively.
<P>
As I tried to explain during our debate on clause 17, the 
Bill will introduce new procurement methods. We want to 
be sure that best value authorities can work with the best 
of the private sector. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, 
unfortunately, some employers do not share his 
sentiments. that is why we have a Race Relations Act. 
However, clause 17 will enable us to update the local 
government procurement framework so that authorities 
can make a thorough and reasoned assessment of a 
contractor's capabilities. That will include compliance 
with existing legislation, including equal opportunities 
measures, when it is relevant to the service that is to be 
provided. The Committee has already debated the matter 
in detail.
<P>
Opposition Members will agree that well-managed 
private companies will have no difficulty in complying 
with equal opportunities legislation on race, gender or 
disability. I know of many private companies that have 
exemplary equal opportunities policies which they carry 
out effectively, considering the practical outcome as well 
as implementing the letter of the policy. Local authorities 
should contract with companies that provide good quality 
services. Local authorities do not have a protective or 
enforcement role in relation to the employees of the 
companies with which they contract. Employees have 
rights under national law which we want to enhance by 
means of other measures currently going through 
Parliament and under European Community law, which 
employees themselves have the opportunity to enforce. 
Appropriate and effective legislative remedies already 
exist to protect employees.
<P>
The Government believe that public sector procurement 
should focus primarily on securing value for money on 
behalf of the taxpayer. Of course, like the Government, 
local authorities should do what they can to promote equal 
opportunities. As I said in a previous sitting, companies 
that understand the importance of valuing their work force 
frequently get best value for money and provide the most 
efficient and effective public services. It is because we 
want to enhance that ethos that we are introducing best 
value proposals. The Bill, and existing law, will ensure 
that employers know that equal opportunities legislation 
is relevant to delivering best value and thus that they will 
pay attention to it when they enter contracts.
<P>
In the procurement process, local government should 
consider how employers value their work force, but not 
necessarily by means of what was traditionally called 
contract compliance, about which the hon. Member for 
North Essex said some uncomplimentary things in a 
previous debate.
<P>
New clause 2 does not belong in the Bill, even though 
we share the sentiments of its supporters. Other measures 
would have the same outcome, and I therefore hope that 
hon. Members will seek leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the Minister will clarify a 
crucial matter which I know that she takes very seriously. 
The Commission for Racial Equality is under the 
impression that local authorities are not required to take 
any action when they discover that one of their 
contractors prospective or existing is failing to comply 
with the appropriate action. Is that the Minister's 
understanding of the law as it is currently and as it will 
be when the Bill is enacted or can a contractor be 
excluded if it fails to comply with such crucial legislation?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The two matters are slightly different. 
A local authority cannot take legal action on behalf of 
employees. Those employees have rights, which we want 
to secure more effectively. We also want to ensure that a 
company complies with all existing legislation relating to 
employees. That is the current position, which will 
continue to apply when the Bill is enacted and which will 
be strengthened by other legislation that is before the 
House. That is the right way forward, We should ensure 
that UK law and EC law are met and that all companies 
fulfil their responsibilities to employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understand what the Minister says, but I 
was not asking whether local authorities could take out 
private prosecutions against contractors or prospective 
contractors. After an investigation, would a local authority 
be able to refuse a contract to a company that was visibly 
not complying with equality legislation? That is the real 
question. My understanding of the brief from the CRE is 
that it could not.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This is an interesting matter, which we 
discussed last week. The hon. Gentleman took me down 
another path on that occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, I did not.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am pleased that the hon. 
Gentleman's position has now changed. If authorities 
believe that a company is not complying with other 
legislation either UK or EC they can exclude it from 
a contract. That is what clause 17 is all about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> I am grateful for that assurance, but the 
new clause involved different issues from those relating 
to clause 17, which will allow the Secretary of State to set 
aside any number of matters that are of non-commercial 
importance to a contract. The beauty of the new clause is 
its simplicity it would do away with all the unnecessary 
powers that are contained in clause 17. However, judging 
by the frown on your face, Mr. Gale and now a smile 
we must not have that debate again.
<P>
The new clause is a much more satisfactory way to deal 
with the issues that were raised in relation to clause 17. 
However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause reflects our increasing concern about 
the powers accruing successively to the Secretary of State 
throughout the Bill. Indeed, they are a feature of a Bill 
that ostensibly, is a decentralising measure, but which 
actually provides for a great deal of centralisation.
<P>
Part of the framework giving rise to our new clause is 
the increasing amount of secondary legislation that the 
Government are using, with the overall effect of 
diminishing the power of Parliament. Madam Speaker has 
placed on record her concern about the tendency for 
statements to be made outside the House. All those 
matters form the background that promoted my hon. 
Friends and me to table new clause 3.
<P>
The new clause was designed as a corrective 
amendment, and I will illustrate why we consider it 
important. I tried to think of an example of where making 
a statement in the House would be an important 
contribution to the democratic process. It became clear 
when, for example, we thought what would happen in the 
case of a failing council. We have spent much time 
debating what steps the Secretary of State would take, and 
the Bill deals with areas in which the Secretary of State 
might intervene.
<P>
If the Secretary of State were to intervene in such a 
case, the people who elected the council democratically 
would have a right to know what was happening and why. 
Hence the requirement in the new clause that a statement 
should specify the power that the Secretary of State has 
exercised, and the reason why he has done so. I firmly 
believe that the public who have elected people who prove 
to be incompetent, or who are failing in their duty, have a 
right to a statement that clarifies the reason for the action.
<P>
The third important requirement is for the Secretary of 
State to specify the outcome that he intends to achieve. In 
a debate on clause 13, which deals with the powers of the 
Secretary of State and which new clause 3 addresses we 
discovered how intractable matters could become. For 
example, if the Secretary of State stepped in on account 
of a failing council, if there were no clear objectives, it 
might become difficult for him to judge the moment at 
which to withdraw. Hence our view of the importance of 
setting objectives. The people who have democratically 
elected members of a failing council have a right to know 
what objectives the Secretary of State has in his use of 
the powers.
<P>
The Minister kindly consented to come back on Report 
to the whole matter of the Government's intervention over 
a failing authority and the way in which that would be 
independently audited. Perhaps she will at the same time 
reconsider accepting new clause 3, which would clarify 
the considerable use of the Secretary of State's powers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden
(Mrs. Spelman) makes an interesting suggestion. We 
understand her and her colleagues' concern and their 
reasons for tabling new clause 3. However, we regard 
it as a significant over-reaction that ignores the 
safeguards that are attached to the Secretary of State's 
powers.
<P>
In that respect, the Bill already provides considerable 
security, which we have already discussed at length. I 
remind the Committee of some of the safeguards that are 
in place. The Bill specifies four instances in which the 
Secretary of State's order-making powers are subject to 
affirmative resolution from both Houses of Parliament. 
Clause 2 specifies powers to extend or disapprove the 
application of best value; clause 14 specifies powers to 
amend or exclude the application of existing legislation 
or to confer new powers. Such powers are subject to an 
extensive consultation process, as set out in clause 15. 
The remaining specified powers are contracting-out 
powers under clause 16 and powers for the exclusion of 
non-commercial considerations under clause 17.
<P>
The Bill contains numerous checks and balances. The 
Secretary of State is required to have regard to the Audit 
Commission's recommendations, when specifying 
performance indicators under clause 4. He is also required 
to consult the Audit Commission and representatives of 
best value authorities before using his residual regulatory 
powers on audit fees under clause 8. In the vast majority 
of cases, he will be required to allow best value 
representations which he must take into account before 
exercising intervention powers under clause 13.
<P>
So there is a broad range of safeguards, recognising 
that, in some cases, it may be appropriate for the Secretary 
of State's actions to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, 
especially if those actions mean that legislation is 
amended. The safeguards also take account of the fact 
that, in many cases, the Secretary of State's actions should 
be influenced primarily by the views of other key players, 
including best value authorities. So we are introducing a 
robust, rigorous system of scrutiny.
<P>
I turn to the comments of the hon. Member for 
Meriden. Opposition Members are rightly concerned 
about what has been identified as a drift away from the 
parliamentary process. I wish to ask the hon. Lady to 
withdraw new clause 3. However, I will discuss her 
anxieties with my Department, following which I may be 
able to allay her fears.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I will add to the points made by 
my hon. Friend the Member or Meriden. Her words were 
clear; however, I will put the matter that she raised in a 
simpler form.
<P>
When the Minister considers the matter, will he put 
himself in the position of a Back Bencher whose local 
authority is hit hard by the Bill? In an earlier debate, my 
right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon 
spoke about the use of nuclear weapons. Our Back 
Bencher is sitting on the Back Benches, wishing for an 
explanation from the Secretary of State, but is unable to 
ask for such an explanation in public.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden believes that 
the Secretary of State should give a statement and the 
reasons for such a statement. She also believes that the 
Secretary of State should explain what progress he 
expects. The Secretary of State may well be on the Back 
Benches after the next election and, in that case, he will 
want an opportunity to question the Conservative 
Secretary of State who may have decided that his local 
authority is so incompetent that he has had to step in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I do not need to teach the hon. Gentleman 
how to use the parliamentary process. He is already adept 
at that and understands how Members of Parliament raise 
most matters. I was trying to demonstrate that a range of 
safeguards will protect the democratic process. However, 
I accept that some hon. Members will have special 
concerns, especially in relation to matters affecting their 
areas. In such cases, they may wish for other measures in 
addition to the practices that they currently use to get their 
views across.
<P>
As I said to the hon. Member for Meriden, we are 
sympathetic to such a wish. The new clause, however, is 
inappropriate because its wide-ranging nature would 
apply to the entire process of change affecting hundreds 
of best value authorities. The new clause is too wide 
ranging and, with my assurance to look at the problem 
and return to it again, I hope that the hon. Lady will 
withdraw it.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> First, I thank the Under-Secretary for his 
generous response to the new clause, which shows that 
the Government are concerned about the problem, but I 
understand that he cannot accept it. I shall deal with two 
of the issues that he raised. Yes, many powers in the Bill 
are subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses; 
and, yes, it would be possible for a new clause to exclude 
the exercise of powers under affirmative resolutions but 
that could be dealt with easily.
<P>
I found the Under-Secretary's other arguments less 
convincing. For example, the argument that the advice of 
the Audit Commission provides a suitable check and 
balance on the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers 
is unconvincing because the Secretary of State appoints 
its chief executive and because, operationally, the Audit 
Commission is, in extremis, answerable to the Secretary 
of State. We cannot rely on other emanations of 
Government, which is what the Audit Commission is, to 
provide a constitutional check on the Secretary of State.
<P>
If the Bill works, we hope that the considerable powers 
adopted by the Secretary of State under the Bill will never 
have to be used or, at least, used only rarely. Yet 
considerable powers will be exercised by the Secretary of 
State in issuing guidance, framing performance 
indicators and standards, and so forth and a central 
record should be kept of their use to enable Parliament 
adequately to track how the Secretary of State influences 
local authorities under the Bill. That could be done 
simply: questions could be tabled regularly about the use 
of best value and capping legislation and once a week a 
column could be published in Hansard listing the 
requisite information.
<P>
The Minister is now swooning under the burden of 
this suggestion 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> So are the hon. Gentleman's 
colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would be the first to accept that some of 
my colleagues became rather too happy in their 
ministerial offices when they were in government. 
However, it is our job as the official Opposition and 
indeed the job of the Minister's hon. Friends who are 
Back Benchers to hold Ministers to account. I am 
proposing only a modest measure that would require a 
civil servant regularly to compile a list to enable 
Parliament to know what is going on without having to 
go through a long detective process.
<P>
We all know how happy the Government are to leak 
information when it is convenient to them and to keep it 
to themselves when it is not. That is a feature not of this 
Government alone but of all Governments and indeed of 
politics. This modest new clause would provide the sort 
of accountability that Ministers are often reluctant to 
provide. I hope that we can take the Under-Secretary at 
his word and that some provision will be forthcoming on 
Report to ensure an improvement to this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. First, 
I congratulate him on enabling many organisations to find 
a new route to gaining answers to their queries. Most 
Members of Parliament would be extremely grateful for 
that advice.
<P>
May I go back to the hon. Gentleman's point about 
the Audit Commission's appointment by the Secretary of 
State? The parliamentary appointments procedures for 
non-departmental bodies are such that it would be 
inconceivable that a person appointed by the Secretary of 
State to such an independent body would be subject to the 
kind of pressures that he has suggested may apply to those 
in charge of the Audit Commission.
<P>
Since this Government came into office and the 
procedures have largely changed we have had numerous 
examples of people appointed by the Government who 
have stood the test and have stood out against policy or 
guidance from the Government. The most notable have 
been some of the regulators. I understand where the hon. 
Gentleman is coming from he is looking for safeguards 
in the overall context of the Bill.
<P>
I told the hon. Member for Meriden that we recognise 
that there are ways in which Governments, when they 
introduce Bills, can try to help the democratic 
parliamentary process. We will do that, but I do not say 
that we will come forward with the advice that the new 
clause seeks as I do not think that we can. We cannot 
accept it because it is far too wide -ranging and would be 
cumbersome. As I have said, we can come back to the 
hon. Lady and see if we can allay some of her fears.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I would just 
caution him on two counts. First, that the Government 
were elected on the cry of open government and it should 
come naturally to the Labour party to accept a clause of 
this nature I note that the Minister is being 
open-minded.
<P>
Secondly, he is going down a dangerous road if he 
starts citing the independence of people who are 
appointed by Government to do independent jobs. One 
does not have to look very far to see how 
independent-minded people have been moved out of 
positions by the Government because they are 
inconvenient. The rail regulator is an example as is the 
pressure on Lord de Ramsey. All sorts of examples come 
to mind. [Interruption.] It is fortunate that I did not hear 
what the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) said. 
No one will ever know.
<P>
As a constitutional principle, accountability cannot be 
delivered by checks and balances appointed by Ministers. 
However transparent the appointments system, those 
people will forever be looking over their shoulders and 
wondering whether to speak out. That is the point that the 
Minister must bear in mind when he considers what to 
bring forward on Report. We will hold him to account on 
this question as it is a matter of great importance.

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> While the civil service team changes 
over may I tell hon. Members clause 23 and schedule 1 are 
closely interrelated. Under those circumstances, and if the 
debate continues past one o'clock I would not wish to 
bind the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) who 
takes the chair this afternoon I believe that there should 
be a substantive debate on clause 23 or schedule 1, but not 
on both. It is up to hon. Members to decide which they wish 
to debate at greater length.
<H4><center>Clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limitation of council tax and precepts</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Christine Butler (Castle Point):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 195, in page 14, line 16, at end insert
`but shall cease to apply on 1st April 2005'.
<P>
It is a probing amendment.By April 2005 we expect the 
modernisation process for local Government to be 
complete and working well. We see no need for the 
continuation of the relevant reserve powers.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard (Taunton):</B> Will the hon. Lady give 
way?
<P>
<B>Mrs Butler:</B> I am just moving the amendment, but 
there will be debate. Given the time, I would prefer to 
finish my remarks.
<P>
We should welcome a justification by my hon. Friend 
the Minister of any intention to oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In some respects we were surprised by 
the amendment, because it flies in the face of what the 
Government are doing with respect to local government. 
Under the Bill, the supervision of local government by 
central Government is becoming ever more intensive. The 
Bill could be characterised as the Audit Commission 
model of local government supervision, by which 
accountants use financial information and counting things 
to determine how well local authorities are doing. The 
extension of capping powers under the Bill is the flip side 
of the coin. It will place constraints on the amounts that 
local authorities can raise.
<P>
On the other hand I am not the least surprised that two 
Back-Bench Labour Members should finally have stirred 
and sounded an uncertain note of rebellion. During the 
1980s and 1990s their party prided itself on being the 
party of local government and on championing its 
independence and democratic accountability. Much has 
appeared on order papers and in the record about the 
undemocratic nature of capping and how it removed local 
responsibility. For Labour Members, the extension of 
capping under the Bill must be very hard to swallow.
<P>
In many respects the stance of the hon. Members who 
have tabled the amendment reflects our renewed 
ambitions for local government that in the end it would 
be desirable to do away with controls on local government 
spending as they appear in the Bill. As my right hon. 
Friend the Leader of the Opposition has said on many 
occasions, he sees the restoration of the power and 
independence of local government as an important part 
of the platform of the renewed Conservative party. He 
emphasises the determination of the new Conservative 
party to ensure that never again should central 
Government consider themselves more important than 
local government. Local decisions are an equally 
important part of our constitutional and political process.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I hate to embarrass the hon. 
Gentleman, but perhaps he is unaware that his party's 
local government spokesman, the hon. Member for 
Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), is down the Corridor in 
the Committee of the Greater London Authority Bill 
wanting to introduce capping to the GLA. Which of them 
speaks for the Conservative party on capping?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I believe that my hon. Friend is looking 
for some consistency in Government policy, but whether 
any exists is another matter. [Interruption.] Well, if 
capping is introduced for all other local authorities, will 
the Greater London authority be capped? I have not 
followed the detail of the GLA Bill so I shall not attempt 
to explain my hon. Friend's remarks, but, if the hon. Lady 
is so well informed and as she supports capping will 
she explain why there is no capping in the Bill? Will she 
also explain what is consistent about applying capping 
to all authorities except the GLA? I look forward to her 
explanation, but whether it will be in order is perhaps 
another matter.
<P>
The amendment seeks a longstop to the capping powers 
that the Government are taking to themselves in the Bill, 
and we await with interest the Government's argument 
against it. The Minister can take comfort from the 
amendment being only a probing measure, but that did 
not surprise us, either We have long given up looking for 
flashes of genuine conviction from Labour Members hen 
it comes to applying their own opinions and seeking 
accountability from the Government.
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test):</B> I wish to 
disabuse Opposition Members of some of the claimed 
attributes of the amendment that they have 
unconvincingly grasped to their breasts. It is always 
interesting to see people skipping in the sunlight freshly 
born again, having decided to go off in exactly the 
opposite direction from that which they have taken 
consistently for 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Speak for yourself.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I am afraid that it will take time for 
the public to forget what the previous Government did to 
local government or to be convinced about the bona fides 
of people who suddenly claim to be local government's 
defenders, having previously carpet-bombed it over a 
long period.
<P>
Far from striking a note of alarm about the direction 
that the Government are taking, the amendment is, in my 
view, a helpful suggestion for ensuring that the trajectory 
being pursued by the Government proceeds properly and 
satisfactorily. I say that because a reading of the White 
Paper on local government shows that a large number of 
its recommendations attempt to ensure that accountability 
comes home to local government, that local government 
is enabled to do its job properly for local people, that there 
is proper transparency in the relationship of communities 
with local government, that local government elections 
are so organised as to ensure that a regular view about 
whether they are succeeding or failing is conveyed to 
local authorities, about whether local government is doing 
a good job 
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman, like me, 
noticed something of an omission in the White Paper in 
terms of electoral processes? Does he agree he would 
expect me to say this that thee one thing that would give 
power back to the local electorate is a change in the 
voting system?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> The hon. Lady may have a valid point. 
My personal views on the matter are well known.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. lady may have a valid 
point, but it is not relevant to the debate so we should not 
pursue it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I was about to say, Mr. Gale, that I 
did not intend to pursue the issue because it is not what 
we are discussing.
<P>
What is important is that the White Paper presents a 
package of measures to modernise local government and 
to suggest that there is a partnership between central 
Government and local government whereby the latter has 
a series of new opportunities and autonomies with which 
to find a way of delivering popular, accountable, effective, 
efficient and community-oriented local government to 
the people.
<P>
That is a package in itself. I was delighted when the 
Government announced that they intend to publish a draft 
Bill setting out other substantial elements of the package 
envisaged in the White Paper 
<P>
