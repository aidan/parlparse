							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): The clause is
targeted at so-called &#147;booster&#148; schemes designed to
increase the amount of tax attributable to a foreign subsidiary and so
increase the amount of double taxation relief that can be obtained. The
Opposition have some sympathy with the objectives of the clause and
certainly will not oppose it. However, I have some questions on how the
clause operates and on the longer-term prospects for the reform of
double taxation
relief.</div>
					<a name="070522101000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Which
of paragraphs 2 to 6 of schedule 28AB to the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988 did the Government have in mind when amending section
804ZA, as proposed in the clause? Will the Chief Secretary outline
which scheme is targeted, bearing in mind that the change in law was
triggered by the disclosure regime? Will he also explain why this
problem was not picked up at an earlier stage, as boosting by using UK
as well as overseas tax has been known about since 2005? Why does
clauses 34(4) refer to foreign tax paid</div>
					<a name="070522101000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on or after 6th December
2006&#148;?</div>
					<a name="070522101000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean
that when a UK company pays a dividend to an overseas company out of
profits on which tax was paid before 6 December 2006&#151;tax paid in
2005, for example, or the first two quarterly instalments of
2006&#151;these rules do not apply, even if the overseas company pays
the dividends onward after that
date?</div>
					<a name="070522101000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
longer-term prospects, the Committee should note that the clause and
the provisions it will amend may soon be redundant along with the
controlled foreign company rules to be amended by clause 47. Paragraph
3.39 of the Red Book states that the Government are shortly to publish
a consultation document on the future of the rules on the taxation of
foreign dividends. We welcome the Government&#146;s indication that
they are considering a general reform of the taxation of foreign
profits, as there is a pressing case for reform and simplification of
the law in that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>area. The rules on the taxation of foreign profits that we are
considering&#151;double taxation relief and the controlled foreign
companies regime&#151;are ferociously complicated, and one of the
most difficult areas of our tax law, which has been subjected to
frequent amendment over the last few years and involves significant
levels of uncertainty. It can take several years for the foreign tax
position to be
finalised.</div>
					<a name="070522101000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
a number of technical flaws in the legislation. For example, it
struggles to deal with situations where overseas companies pay tax as
part of a consolidated group. There are also question marks as to
whether the DTR rules are fully compatible with EU law. Chris Sanger of
Ernst and Young
said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
current system is cumbersome and acts as a deterrent to businesses
seeking to invest in the
UK.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute for
Fiscal Studies, too, has questioned the effectiveness of the DTR
rules:</div>
					<a name="070522101000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Overall,
the trade off between the costs and benefits of the credit system
compared with the exemption system is unclear, and the theoretical case
for retaining the credit system does not appear to be
compelling.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Some
illumination on that trade-off can be found in the Red Book. Table A3.1
discloses that the Government pay out about &#163;10 billion in
double taxation relief. The revenue collected through the taxation of
foreign profits, while not de minimis, is certainly low enough to
prompt the question of whether that revenue is worth the competitive
disadvantage of requiring increasingly mobile multinationals to jump
through all the relevant, highly complex hoops to ensure that they meet
the requirements of the UK&#146;s double taxation regime&#151;a
regime made just that bit more complex by the measures in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="070522101000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
might usefully consider whether the present rules get the trade-off
between revenue collected and competitiveness right. There are some
attractive arguments for simplifying that part of the tax system to
incentivise the repatriation of foreign profits. That could make the UK
tax system more competitive and boost investment in the UK. It could
also make the UK more attractive as a destination for corporate
headquarters and holding companies, which could strengthen foreign
direct
investment.</div>
					<a name="070522101000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recent
studies by the International Monetary Fund have shown that there is
considerable potential benefit in cases where companies are encouraged
to repatriate their foreign profits. Changes in US law to facilitate
bringing foreign profits back onshore have also proved successful. When
looking at those matters, we should bear in mind the decision by
companies such as Yahoo, Google and Amazon to locate their headquarters
in Ireland rather than in the UK. Taking those factors on board, the
Opposition have been looking at the merits of moving to a participation
exemption for foreign profits, along the lines of those used in a
number of countries in mainland
Europe.</div>
					<a name="070522101000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in
mind, I have a series of questions for the Chief Secretary about the
process of reforming DTR that the Government envisage undertaking.
First, when will the consultation document promised in the Red Book be
published? The Red Book refers to it being published &#147;later in
the Spring.&#148; I am of course aware that climate change is doing
some odd things to our seasons, but one would have thought that
&#147;later in the Spring&#148; would mean by now, or by the end of
the month at the latest. Do the Government expect to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>publish the document before the end of the Committee&#146;s
deliberations, as it would be useful in assessing the merits of this
clause and clause
47.</div>
					<a name="070522101000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second series
of questions concerns the options for reform and the long-term
replacement of the DTR rules. Will the Government assess the potential
that a sensible reform might in the longer term have to increase tax
revenues as a result of the UK becoming a more attractive place for
investment and for corporate headquarters? Have they carried out
studies on the impact of the introduction of participation exemptions
in countries such as Spain and Australia? Did they consider a
participation exemption when they introduced the major legislative
change in 2000 that governs the taxation of foreign profits? Why did
the Government reject that at the time, and given that they are now
apparently considering such an exemption, do they believe that it was a
mistake to reject that option in
2000?</div>
					<a name="070522101000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, in
embarking on the reform process, what constraints are placed on the
Government by the EU? I understand that the Primarolo group
criticised aspects of the Dutch participation exemption. Do the
Government expect the Paymaster General&#146;s work in Brussels to
constrain their choices in reforming the UK&#146;s system of taxation
of foreign profits? Lastly, it would be useful for the Committee if the
Chief Secretary expanded on the statement in paragraph 3.39 of the Red
Book that the Government&#146;s consultation document on the
issue</div>
					<a name="070522101000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will also
consider the implications of any such reform for other aspects of the
UK tax regime, such as interest
relief.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the
Government planning to abolish relief for interest on borrowing used to
invest in foreign shareholdings, or only to restrict it? Is that move
inevitable if a participation exemption is introduced? If so, what sort
of impact assessment have the Government carried out on the effect of
such a move?</div>
					<a name="070522101000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
should also bear in mind the fact that the effect of abolishing relief
on interest on borrowing to finance overseas investments would raise
considerably more than the revenue that would be lost as a result of
introducing a participation exemption. Does the Chief Secretary regard
the upcoming reform process as a revenue-raising exercise? I would
counsel a cautious approach. While moving to an exemption system would
offer attractions in terms of simplicity, some of which I have
outlined, we do not want to replace the highly complex DTR and CFC
rules with another highly complex set of rules for determining when
relief will be given on
interest.</div>
					<a name="070522101000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close by
referring to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which carried out an
interesting study on the
issue:</div>
					<a name="070522101000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are various ways in which the UK government could seek to recoup any
significant amount of revenue lost by replacing the credit system with
an exemption system. One suggestion would be to restrict the extent to
which interest payments on debt that is used to finance overseas
investments could be deducted against profits in the computation of UK
corporation tax liabilities, along the lines of interest allocation
rules used in the US. Unfortunately, since it is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to determine which particular borrowing funds which
particular expenditures, restrictions of this kind run the risk of
becoming both complex and arbitrary. It would be difficult to be
confident that the combination of an exemption system with interest
allocation rules would result in a system that would be significantly
simpler than the current credit system. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>also very hard to estimate the net revenue consequences and precisely
who the winners and losers would
be&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070522101000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
well-structured programme of reform and simplification in that area of
taxation could have a significant positive impact on the
competitiveness of UK plc. In reaching the conclusion on the best
option for reform, I hope that the Government will have full regard for
the headaches that the current complexity of the DTR and CFC rules
cause business, and their negative impact on our competitiveness in the
increasingly globalised world
economy.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070522101000442"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): First, may I
reiterate a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet
about the date of publication of the consultation document on the
taxation of foreign profits? I know that there is considerable interest
in that document, particularly in the City, and it would be helpful to
know when it will be published.</div>
					<a name="070522101000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, may I press the
Chief Secretary on whether the clause is merely a clarification of the
current law or a change? The reason I ask that question is that when
flicking through the explanatory notes I found that such is the
insistence that the provision is a clarification and no more that it is
difficult not to be suspicious. We are told that the clause confirms
that foreign tax</div>
					<a name="070522101000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;includes UK tax for which double
taxation relief is
claimed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes go on to state that subsection (2) removes
&#147;any doubt&#148; about that particular matter; subsection (3)
&#147;removes any doubt&#148;; subsection (5) is a
&#147;clarification&#148;; subsection (6) &#147;makes it
clear&#148; that a particular point is the case; and finally, the
background note states:</div>
					<a name="070522101000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The amendments put it
beyond doubt that &#145;foreign tax&#146; in this context includes
UK tax.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such is the
Treasury&#146;s insistence on that point in the explanatory notes
that one cannot help but being a little suspicious.</div>
					<a name="070522101000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is particularly important
that the measure is a clarification and no more, in part because the
commencement is backdated to 6 December 2006&#151;the date of the
pre-Budget report. I assume that an announcement of such measures was
made at the same time. Given that it is in a sense backdated, it
clearly should be a clarification and no more. Will the Chief Secretary
confirm that the current law really does intend that UK tax should be
treated as foreign tax for those purposes, that the Government are not
simply trying to change the law to address a genuine loophole that had
not been addressed, and that that is not a new
point?</div>

						As
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet rightly said, the clause will
introduce changes to section 804ZA of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988. That section is anti-avoidance legislation, introduced in the
Finance Act 2005 and aimed at schemes and arrangements designed to
increase double taxation relief. Picking up the point made by the hon.
Member for South-West 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>Hertfordshire, I confirm that the aim of the measure is to put beyond
doubt the issue of what should be regarded as foreign tax for the
purposes of the legislation, rather than to introduce a
change.</div>
					<a name="070522101000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
confident that the measure in the 2005 Act covered the point, but
disclosures made to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs have cast
some doubt on that&#151;there is clearly doubt in the minds of some
people&#151;so the aim of the clause is to put the matter beyond
doubt and to remove any uncertainty. HMRC has received disclosures of
schemes that purport to avoid the effects of the 2005 legislation on
the basis that the tax in respect of which DTR is claimed is UK tax
rather than foreign tax. That is the point that the clause will
clarify. We have always taken the view that such tax should be regarded
as foreign tax and should therefore be included. The clause puts it
beyond doubt that, in this context, the term &#147;foreign
tax&#148; includes UK tax. It clarifies the fact that any reference
to foreign tax in the DTR anti-avoidance legislation includes UK tax,
ensuring that the anti-avoidance legislation works as originally
intended.</div>

						The
hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked me which paragraphs of section
804ZA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are affected by the
clause. It will cover section 804ZA as a whole; the booster scheme in
question is countered by paragraph 4 of schedule 28AB to the 1988 Act.
That may be the particular reference that she was asking about. Quite a
number of avoidance schemes have been closed down following the
introduction of the 2005 legislation, resulting in considerable tax
savings to the Exchequer, so those measures were effective. However, we
need the clause to put the original intention of the legislation beyond
doubt. It is worth underlining the point that we will continue to
challenge robustly any schemes that emerge where, in our view, the 2005
legislation has effect.</div>
					<a name="070522101000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady has made the
point, and the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire also referred
to it, that we will be setting out our options for change for the
taxation of foreign profits in the near future, and the consultation
document will be published shortly. Any changes that may be made will,
quite rightly, require extensive consultation and discussion. There
will be a lot of interest in the matter and it is important that we get
the details right. The change introduced by the clause is needed to put
beyond doubt the application of the 2005 targeted anti-avoidance rules.
The longer-term reform is a separate exercise and the measure before us
cannot wait until the outcome of that
review.</div>
					<a name="070522101000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have noted
the points that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet made about the
long-term reform of taxation of foreign profits. She asked a number of
questions about that consultation, but all I can say at this stage is
that she must await publication of the consultation document for the
launch of that debate. I am sure that there will be many who advance
points of view along the lines of those she set out and others will no
doubt have other perspectives to contribute to that debate. I can
reassure the Committee that it will not be long before that document
appears. Finally, picking up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>the point correctly made by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire, we published draft legislation along with the pre-Budget
report, which is why the changes will take effect from that date. No
adverse comments have been received in response, so I commend the
clause to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="070522101000447"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I am
grateful for your guidance on the breadth of the clause, which is just
as well, given that my remarks are broad.</div>
					<a name="070522101000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause marks the start of
a long process of reform of the capital allowances system that the
Chancellor highlighted in the Budget speech in March. Those reforms are
designed to help offset the costs of the reduction&#151;the 2p
cut&#151;in corporation tax, which we debated earlier. The clause
sets the ball rolling on two particular groups of allowances&#151;for
agricultural buildings and for industrial buildings&#151;by
withdrawing balancing adjustments in connection with the disposal of
qualifying industrial and agricultural buildings, unless that
adjustment has taken place within a qualifying enterprise zone or
pursuant to the relevant pre-commencement
contract.</div>
					<a name="070522101000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is worth highlighting the fact that buildings allowances have been in
place since the end of the second world war, when they were introduced
to encourage post-war reconstruction and to give businesses an
incentive to invest in buildings by enabling, as the law still states,
the cost of investment in those buildings to be written off over 25
years, at a rate of 4 per cent. per annum. Those are quite valuable
reliefs, and the HMRC website says that the value of claims for both
allowances in 2004 was just over &#163;3 billion. Therefore, the
Chancellor is embarking on quite a significant reform, at significant
cost to taxpayers.</div>
					<a name="070522101000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, the clause withdraws balancing adjustments that arise
when the proceeds from the sale of an industrial or agricultural
building differ from its tax written-down value. Where the proceeds
exceed the tax written-down value, there is a recovery of the
allowances claimed to date. Where the proceeds are less than the tax
written-down

							<b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman mentioned
the second world war. Does he agree that the economy has changed
slightly since that time, as commercial buildings are at least as
important to the economy these days, if not more so, than agricultural
and industrial buildings, and it is about time that we modernised our
economy? Is not that proposal part of such a
measure?</div>

							<a name="070522101000451"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> No one can escape the fact that the economy has
changed somewhat since the end of the second world war. As I drive
around the country, I see new industrial buildings springing up to
house distribution centres and meet the needs of the growing retail
sector. The leisure sector is becoming increasingly important as a
source of employment in the economy, and I will come on to the way in
which those changes affect that sector in particular. I agree in part
that modernisation is needed to allow for the changing economy, but
that does not mean that industrial buildings are redundant. They are
still an important part of the productive and service sectors of the
economy.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>
					<a name="070522101000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Notwithstanding
that, the Chancellor announced a reduction in the rate of the
industrial buildings allowance, so that it will be zero by 2011-12 and
there will be no allowance for businesses to claim on industrial or
agricultural buildings. As you might anticipate, Mr. Gale,
that has caused concerns among various industry groups, which fall
under four headings. The first is the lack of proper consultation on
the change. It is a significant change because the value of the
allowances is just over &#163;3
billion.</div>
					<a name="070522101000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I spoke to a
senior tax adviser before the Budget and asked whether he thought that
it would make any significant reforms to capital allowances. He
replied, &#147;No, it would not be possible, because the Government
would have to consult first.&#148; The reality is that the Government
have not consulted on the scale and depth of the changes. It is worth
looking at the remarks of the British Property
Federation:</div>
					<a name="070522101000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed changes are inconsistent with previous government policy
statements. In December 2004, the government issued a consultation
document on capital allowances and the conclusions from the
consultation were announced in the December 2005 Pre Budget Report. The
conclusions were that there were no current plans to take forward
proposed reforms on a partial schedular system or the taxation of
capital assets, but continue to consider the scope for the modemisation
of capital
allowances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The summary
of the responses in paragraph 14 said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There was general
support for a commercial buildings allowance, incorporating the current
Industrial, Hotel and Agricultural Buildings
Allowances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
15 said of the consultation:</div>
					<a name="070522101000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Respondents indicated
their dissatisfaction with the current IBA regime pointing towards the
compliance costs involved and the shortcomings of a system which did
not recognise the actual cost incurred when determining the level of
allowances
available.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears
from the consultation on which the Government embarked that there was
widespread support for the continuation of IBAs and agricultural
business allowances, which were seen as an important part of setting
the costs of capital investment in
property.</div>
					<a name="070522101000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
second concern about the reforms goes back to the Chancellor&#146;s
announcement about the broader reforms of capital allowances and the
fact that there should be a move to align more closely the writing-down
allowances with the economic rate of depreciation on capital assets.
Changes in subsequent years will reduce the writing-down allowance on
plans from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. per annum to reflect the change
in the accounting charge that most businesses incur in relation to the
depreciation of
assets.</div>
					<a name="070522101000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing something slightly different. Under FRS 15, most businesses
make a depreciation charge against property. That is a change from the
previous accounting regime, SAP 12, under which it was common practice
not to charge depreciation. The overall package aligns accounting rates
and the tax rates for plant and machinery, but there is a divergence
from that policy in respect of property: the Government are abolishing
the writing-down allowances, but businesses charge depreciation on
property in their
accounts.</div>
					<a name="070522101000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
worry that has been expressed most widely concerns the retrospective
nature of the measure. Investment decisions taken
24 years ago when people expected to be able to claim industrial
buildings 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>
						allowance and ABAs are now called into doubt. Such
decisions about investment were made on the assumption that they would
receive capital allowances, yet capital allowances will be withdrawn
over the next three or four years. That causes great concern to people
whose investment plans were predicated on the basis that capital
allowances would be available on their property. The fourth point
concerns the impact on the profitability of a number of UK business
sectors.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): My hon. Friend might

							<a name="070522101000453"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> My hon. Friend has just beaten me by a few
paragraphs to the impact that such a measure will have on the farming
community. He has highlighted the fourth worry, which is how the
changes will have an impact on different sectors of the economy, of
which agriculture is one. Another is the leisure sector, to which the
hon. Member for Wirral, West referred. The small companies sector, too,
will be particularly affected, as I shall explain
later.</div>
					<a name="070522101000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
reflecting on some of the more general comments that have been made
about the changes. The <i class="I">Tax Journal</i> states:</div>
					<a name="070522101000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The removal of IBAs
will affect not merely owners of traditional industrial buildings but
many utilities and transport
companies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">It refers to
the hotel sector and says that it is capital intensive. It argues that
the economic case for the change would undoubtedly be more convincing
if some measure of depreciation were allowed for buildings
themselves.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070522101000396"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="070522101000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">John Whiting
of PricewaterhouseCoopers, a well known commentator on tax matters, has
said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
there have been calls for years to rationalise the allowances on
buildings, to deny any allowance seems perverse&#151;property does
depreciate. The transition is far too short: financing arrangements
just set up on the basis of 25 years of hotel, industrial or
agricultural allowances will now receive as little as 10 per cent. of
the expected
allowances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, <i class="I">Property Taxation</i> said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Property is generally
the second highest area of business expenditure besides salaries and so
all UK businesses will feel the brunt of these changes. Many will no
doubt choose, in due course, to pass on to their customers the ultimate
costs incurred through loss or reduction of allowances as proposed in
the
Budget.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clearly,
there is widespread concern from business and tax commentators about
the impact that removal of the allowances will have on the economy as a
whole. However, let me address some of the specific sectors that will
have an issue with the change. The tourism industry is the UK&#146;s
seventh largest industry, generating &#163;17 billion per annum in
export earnings and employing more than 2 million people. Bob Cotton,
chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, has said that
the association</div>
					<a name="070522101000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believes that the
Chancellor&#146;s decision will discourage investment at a time when
there is more pressure than ever to
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>build new quality hotels and restaurants, to add extra rooms and to
upgrade facilities
generally.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">He added
that the association has</div>
					<a name="070522101000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one member who, with a &#163;3
million extension to his hotel, would have been allowed to claim tax
relief over the next three years alone on nearly &#163;1.2m of the
costs. Under the new proposals, his tax relief will be reduced by as
much as &#163;600,000 or possibly even
more.&#148;</div>

Chancellor back in 1997 when he made his tax grab on pension funds. He
said that it was fine, because the sector was buoyant, but we know what
happened&#151;the pension sector declined as a consequence of the tax
grab. So the argument does not constitute a particularly robust support
for the Government&#146;s proposed changes. I know that you would not

poultry and pig houses&#151;have limited useful economic lives and
are depreciating assets. Notwithstanding that, they will not benefit
from the

							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): Does the hon.
Gentleman share my concern that there might be a disproportionately
negative effect on smaller farmers, who are exactly the farmers who
might look to diversify into other industries and who might also be hit
by the increases in the corporation tax rate for small
businesses?</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000457"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Indeed. The hon. Lady makes an important point
about the interaction of the reforms with other Finance Bill proposals
that we have already debated. I shall address that later, because it is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>important to understand the impact that will be felt by different sized
businesses that are subject to different tax
regimes.</div>
					<a name="070522101000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NFU said
that</div>
					<a name="070522101000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is unjust
simply to withdraw relief completely on expenditure already incurred.
It is clear that the phasing out of ABAs will result in a significant
loss of relief over what would have been the remaining tax lives of
qualifying assets.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
accountant in the south-east told the NFU that his firm&#146;s larger
clients currently have unrelieved balances totalling &#163;12.5
million. That is a significant amount of tax relief that farmers felt
would be due to them in the future that they will now no longer
receive. If they seek to sell one of their agricultural assets when
clause 35 comes into effect, they will not even receive the balance of
the adjustment on that sale.</div>
					<a name="070522101000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there are concerns
in the farming sector. In Oxfordshire, one accountant produced examples
of a range of clients who currently have ABA balances ranging from
&#163;814,000 to &#163;4.2 million. Those are significant sums for
individuals working in the agricultural sector.</div>
					<a name="070522101000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now to the argument of
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. The Government have argued
that the reform of capital balances, the abolition of balance
adjustments and the phased withdrawals of IBAs and ABAs will fund the
corporation tax cut that they announced at the time of the Budget; the
2p reduction in the headline rate. One can accept the loose argument
that the reductions in one area will be funded by increases in tax in
another, and that there will be winners and losers. There is a logic to
that. However, as the hon. Lady points out, a problem arises for small
companies; they will lose the historic tax balances that they would
have received relief on and, in addition, will have to pay a higher
corporation tax rate themselves. Therefore, there is a double whammy
there. They will not be able to receive the benefit of tax relief on
investment already incurred and they will have to pay the higher
corporation tax rate as the Chancellor proposed in the
Budget.</div>
					<a name="070522101000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Gale, if you
owned industrial property&#151;and I do not know whether you
do&#151;you would see the loss of IBAs and ABAs but would not receive
compensatory reduction in your tax rate as a consequence. The only
people who seem to be potentially net in balance will be those
companies paying the main rate of corporation tax. The small company
sector will want from the Chief Secretary some acknowledgment of the
impact that that will have on the sector when taken in conjunction with
other changes to the tax system.</div>
					<a name="070522101000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 15 to 23 are
designed to achieve a degree of grandfathering for expenditure already
incurred, or contracted to be incurred prior to the Budget. That means
that, where there is a disposal, they will still be eligible for a
balancing adjustment. That reflects the concern over the retrospective
nature of the changes. It is worth remembering that there is a
precedent for grandfathering in this area. When the industrial
buildings allowances were increased from 2 per cent. to 4 per cent.,
only new investment qualified for the 4 per cent. rate. Therefore, when
Governments have made changes on IBAs and ABAs in the past, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>they have thought about the issue and taken it into account. They
differentiated between past and future investment.</div>
					<a name="070522101000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Amendment No. 24, and I
think in Amendment No. 183 tabled by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne, we ask the Treasury to lay before Parliament a report setting
out the impact of the abolition of balancing charges, in particular in
the abolition of IBAs and ABAs more generally. As Committee members on
both sides will acknowledge, there are legitimate concerns about the
impact that the abolition of IBAs and ABAs will have on those sectors
that are heavily dependent on capital investment for their business. It
is important that that analysis is made available by the Treasury and
that it is able to work through that process more speedily. These
issues would have emerged more properly through a process of
consultation. Although the Government have often been congratulated on
carrying out proper consultation in other areas&#151;I will
congratulate them myself later for that&#151;it is a pity that we
have a major change here that has really been introduced without proper
consultation.</div>
					<a name="070522101000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, these amendments would provide protection for past
investment and would also provide the Government with some time to
think about the impact of the changes on property-intensive businesses
such as tourism, leisure and agriculture. They would also give the
Government the opportunity to think carefully about the impact of the
changes on different types of business, whether they are small
companies or larger businesses. I think that it is perhaps small
companies that will have a great deal to lose from the abolition of
these allowances, as they do not have the compensatory reduction in the
corporation tax rate.</div>
					<a name="070522101000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have embarked
on a major reform without carefully thinking through the consequences
for different groups. By accepting amendment No. 24, the Government
would create some room for manoeuvre and give them the opportunity to
think again about the clause and how it might affect different
businesses.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="070522101000458"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Chair
this morning, Mr. Gale.</div>
					<a name="070522101000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have heard in the
remarks made by the hon. Member for Fareham, the clause is the first
part of proposals announced in the Budget to abolish the IBAs and ABAs
as part of the wider package of reform of the capital allowance system.
If one examines the timetable, the clause eliminates balancing
adjustments but allows the existing writing-down allowance to continue.
Then, in subsequent years&#151;presumably we can expect legislation
in next year&#146;s Finance Bill&#151;we will see the rate of
allowance cut down from 75 per cent. ultimately to zero.</div>
					<a name="070522101000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">This package of reform has
been portrayed as a balanced package and ultimately it may well be a
balanced package. However, the difficulty for many businesses is
working out how all these changes that they have heard about will
interact with one another, and determining at what point they may
benefit and at what point there may be significant difficulties or
disbenefits for them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>
					<a name="070522101000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We see a
headline reduction in the rate of corporation tax, which will not
benefit small businesses; instead, they will see an increase. Although
such businesses may benefit from an annual investment allowance next
year, in the meantime, they must work out what the impact will be. They
are left with this huge package of change, which, as we have heard,
there has not been much consultation about, and the wash of all these
different decisions will affect different businesses in different ways.
I have received representations from businesses that feel that they
will be negatively affected, but I am sure that there are many other
businesses that simply will not have any idea about how all these
measures will interact with one another.</div>
					<a name="070522101000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, these changes will
have an impact on future decisions, but they will also have an effect
on areas where decisions have already been taken and investment has
already been made. There will be significant changes to things that
businesses have already set down in their budgets.</div>
					<a name="070522101000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already heard about
the concern over the lack of consultation. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales recognised that this was a balanced
package, but it said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Such a major change to
the capital allowances rules should have been exposed beforehand for
detailed consultation. We appreciate that reform of the capital
allowances rules was mooted as part of the wider package of corporation
tax reforms but no firm proposals were discussed and we think that most
respondents thought it was a bad
idea.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered
Institute of Taxation
said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome the extent of prior notice of future changes, although
consultation would have been
preferable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings us to an issue that has been raised by the Liberal Democrats on
previous occasions. In some aspects of this Bill, we see that there has
been detailed consultation that has resulted in widely welcomed
proposals that are largely uncontroversial; in other areas of the Bill,
we see that changes are being put forward unannounced and there is no
opportunity for some kind of consultation before we have to debate
those changes, either on the Floor of the House or in Committee. It is
another example of how a limited, formal consultation procedure would
assist our ability to go through the Bill and give it detailed
scrutiny.</div>

						My
concern is whether the Government have fully thought through the
changes&#146; impact not only on businesses but on Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Has a regulatory impact
assessment been undertaken? Presumably, it must have formed the basis
for the Red Book predictions of how much revenue the changes would
generate for the Exchequer. There may be a regulatory impact
assessment, but I have not seen one, so I should appreciate the
Minister&#146;s comments on whether one exists. Have the Government
considered the differential impact of the changes on various
sectors?</div>
					<a name="070522101000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendments Nos. 24 and 183, we are trying to tease out what sizes of
business and which sectors will be most disadvantaged by the changes.
We have heard that tourism, agriculture and industrial building are
among them. Has a regulatory impact assessment been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>undertaken, and will it be made available for Parliament to see on what
basis the decisions were
made?</div>
					<a name="070522101000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered
Institute of Taxation has raised concerns about whether businesses will
end up re-categorising integral fixtures and plants. Before, it did not
matter how such things were categorised, but now it will make a
difference. The CIT said in its
representation:</div>
					<a name="070522101000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Until
now, the split of costs between buildings, plant and fixtures did not
affect the sum of the long-term allowances given. However, the change,
because it is to apply to existing buildings, might result in many
companies that own industrial or agricultural buildings deciding to
review open tax returns with a view to re-categorising integral
fixtures or plants previously included as part of the building costs,
as fixtures and fittings. If this were to occur, it would result in
additional administration for those businesses and for HMRC. There is
also the possibility of error or mistake in claims being made for
earlier
years.&#148;</div>

					<a name="070522101000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give some examples of the businesses that have contacted my colleagues
and me, to demonstrate how they feel they will be adversely affected.
The hon. Member for Fareham commented on examples from the tourism
industry of how decisions to invest will be affected by the changes
proposed in the clause, but I shall give an example relating to my
earlier
intervention.</div>
					<a name="070522101000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">A farm
in my constituency has diversified into cheese production. It is a
small farm struggling to get by. It was one of the first farms to
benefit from a European objective 1 grant application, which resulted
in the extension of the dairy. The farm already benefits from the
agricultural buildings allowance, but has recently made a decision to
make a significant investment in a dairy for cheese production, which
has an IBA residue of more than
&#163;300,000.</div>
					<a name="070522101000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
decision was made in good faith. It has resulted in the creation of
jobs, is supporting the agricultural industry and is helping to develop
one of the most underperforming economies in the country, but money
that the farm could have reinvested will now be paid to the taxman.
Unfortunately, the farm is a small enough business that it will not
benefit from the higher rate of corporation tax&#151;its corporation
tax will increase. The farmers will be all-out losers.</div>
					<a name="070522101000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cornwall is one county among
many that consists largely of smaller businesses. It has a lot of
industrial buildings and small-scale businesses, whether agricultural
or industrial. Its people will mostly lose out. I am interested to know
whether any assessment has been made of the differential impact in
terms of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>geography on places where there might be large numbers of smaller
businesses.</div>
					<a name="070522101000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
other end of the country, my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and
Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) has written to me about
Lerwick&#146;s port authority, the deputy chief executive of which
wrote to him to raise huge concerns about the changes to the industrial
buildings allowance. She
said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
2006, Lerwick Port Authority has IBA&#146;s of &#163;680,000
resulting in a corporation tax saving of &#163;204,000 (30 per
cent.). The abolition of this is very detrimental&#151;even on
current projects the additional corporation tax due over 25 years is
immense. More worryingly, the capital investment programme we have for
developing the port will be
affected&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070522101000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, too,
chimes with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. We are concerned
about the impact on investment decisions that have already been made,
and how the change will affect future investment decisions in the
tourism industry and other sectors all over the country.</div>
					<a name="070522101000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many companies either fear
that they will lose out or have not yet been able to get a handle on
how this package of reform will ultimately affect them. Some are part
of the way through the change process; others do not know what will
happen at the end of it. I hope that the Minister will respond to my
questions by reassuring those companies that the Treasury fully
understands the cross-cutting effects of the range of
changes.</div>

							<b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): The clause concerns the
short-term phased removal of agricultural and industrial buildings tax
incentives, which were designed to encourage the building of such
buildings. It amends parts 3 and 4 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001.
I would welcome the simplification of capital tax allowances if that
were the sole purpose of the measure. Certainly, an alignment of all
sorts of allowances throughout the economy and business taxation to
coincide with a simple, straight-line depreciation method would be an
understandable manoeuvre; it would be a simplification.</div>
					<a name="070522101000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that we all accept that
it is clear that the economy has changed since the second world war, it
would be understandable if we were to review the incentivising of the
building of agricultural and industrial buildings. However, it seems
that the Government have, to a degree, misled investors. It is a bit
like offering somebody a chair and then, as they position themselves to
sit down, pulling it away. The agricultural sector, hoteliers and the
industrial sector&#151;manufacturing companies&#151;have been
working on the basis that the allowances would continue for 25 years,
and have made decisions intended to last for that period. All of a
sudden, the Government have changed direction and said,
&#147;Actually, we are removing those allowances,&#148; but have
not compensated them in some other way. Indeed, as the hon. Lady
pointed out, not only are the allowances being removed, but the changes
disproportionately affect smaller businesses. They face the corporation
tax increase over the next two or three years and they are also having
their allowances taken away. A pincer movement is being made on smaller
businesses, smaller agricultural businesses, hoteliers and, in
particular, manufacturers.</div>

Afriyie:
						</b> My hon. Friend pre-empts me wonderfully, as he
made exactly the point that I was coming to&#151;that the Government
are clearly in some difficulty because of their tax-and-spend attitude.
They gave a reduction in corporation tax to large businesses, but they
are now having to scrabble around to pull back the tax take from
smaller businesses and businesses that felt there was a certainty in
their investment framework. I am not comfortable with that
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="070522101000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
observation, to which the Chief Secretary may wish to respond, is that
if the proposal was not designed as a tax-raising measure&#151;a
retrospective tax-raising measure to a large degree&#151;why not
allow 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>the balances to be paid up front? Why not give businesses an option? If
there are 10 years to run at 4 per cent., for example, on an
agricultural or industrial building, the business can claim a 40 per
cent. allowance. Why not just say, &#147;It is your choice. You can
either have 20 per cent. now or let it run.&#148; If this is not
purely a tax-raising measure, largely on smaller businesses, why not
give them the option to take a larger amount or to have more of the
allowances reclaimable? In that way, businesses which, without a shadow
of a doubt, will be struggling, will have an option to do something
different in the short or longer term. They may decide that they would
rather continue taking the allowances for the next 10 years, but they
may decide to take a lower amount of tax rebate now.</div>
					<a name="070522101000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears that the Government
have duped farmers, hoteliers and manufacturers, and then pulled away
from the behaviour they were encouraging. I do not disagree with the
argument that the investment environment probably needs to change; it
is a fair point that we may not require more agricultural buildings,
but if that is the case, why not announce that two or three years from
now the allowances will disappear completely and enable those who are
already claiming them to continue to do so until the end of the
period?</div>
					<a name="070522101000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
key questions for the Chief Secretary. First, why was there no
consultation on this scheme when there was plenty on tax-avoidance
schemes? Secondly, on tax allowances for the music industry, there are
new, first-year capital allowances for new investment over a
single-year period. What certainty is there that the Chancellor will
not withdraw those allowances? If the Government are prepared to
withdraw what I argue is a stabilising allowance for investment in the
agricultural and industrial building sectors, what confidence can
businesses have that the new allowances, which as yet are not clearly
defined, will remain? Or are they going to offer single-year allowances
and then withdraw those to rake in even more money for the Exchequer,
in order to fill that black hole of several billion pounds that has
been created over recent
years?</div>

						</b> I had assumed that we had finished the section of
the Bill on anti-avoidance, and I would like to hear the Chief
Secretary&#146;s justification for the surprise with which this move
has been greeted by those sectors that it affects. My hon. Friend the
Member for Fareham alluded to two of them&#151;the British
Hospitality Association and the NFU. Given that the capital allowances
referred to in clause 35 influence long-term investment decisions, it
would not have been difficult for the Chancellor to consult&#151;the
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor was
pressing&#151;and to give fair warning of these changes. After all,
the Chancellor has had 11 Budgets in which to do so.</div>

tempted to think that clause 35 has less to do with beginning to
correct an anachronism within the capital allowance regime than it has
to do with propping up the Government&#146;s balance sheet to the
tune of &#163;3.042 billion in forgone revenue. The Government have
justified the clause as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>the first step in the process of withdrawing the industrial buildings
allowance and agriculture buildings allowance in order to prevent some
businesses from obtaining an unfair or arbitrary tax advantage.
However, the Chartered Institute of Taxation had to perform gymnastics
to determine if any advantage might be possible. Try as it might, it
could not find one that could be considered as unfair. Perhaps the
Chief Secretary could give us some examples of the unfair or arbitrary
situations that are intended to be caught by the
clause.</div>
					<a name="070522101000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the wider
issues raised by the Government&#146;s interference with the capital
allowances regime, there seems to be a number of flawed assumptions at
play here, the worst of which is the fiction that industrial and
agricultural buildings do not depreciate and should not therefore
qualify for a writing-down allowance. Budget note 7 referred to the
industrial buildings allowance and agricultural buildings allowance as
&#147;outdated and unjustified distortions.&#148; As alternatives,
the Red Book has &#147;longstanding and unjustified&#148;, as well
as &#147;distortive&#148;, which I cannot help thinking is
something of a distortion in itself. Nevertheless, that is fairly
scathing language to describe what are admittedly well established and
even venerable capital allowances. Whatever their provenance, the IBA
and ABA reflect the fact that industrial and agricultural buildings
depreciate. I say that that is a fact, but if I am wrong, I hope that
the Chief Secretary will correct me for the
record.</div>
					<a name="070522101000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I represent a
constituency that is largely rural, in which many people will be hard
hit by the withdrawal of these allowances. If I were to suggest to a
farmer in my constituency that his working buildings did not
depreciate, as he thought they had for so many years on the basis of
good empirical evidence of seeing them rusting or collapsing in front
of him, I suspect that he would not be impressed by my argument. If I
were to say that his buildings were appreciating in the manner of
houses in Connaught square or the eco-homes in Gallions Park, he would
laugh at me.</div>
					<a name="070522101000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Agricultural buildings are
worked hard and they have a useful life, after which they are replaced.
That is the reason for the straight-line basis of the write-down over
25 years. Farmers are not going to be able to sell, say, an 18-year-old
cowshed at a profit, on the basis of the appreciation of either the
structure itself, or in the vast majority of cases, the land on which
it stands. Those buildings depreciate from the day that they go up to
the day that they are pulled down or
replaced.</div>

saying not only that the Government were wrong about the IBA and the
ABA but that they have cut off any route for taking into account
appreciation in writing down these
assets?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000472"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> The Government have done that by removing that
opportunity that my hon. Friend referred to in his speech. The image he
used was of pulling the rug from under them. The clause is explained
away in terms of removing an unjustified distortion, but the distortion
accounts for a difference between a certain kind of working building
and other commercial property. I want to explore that distinction a
little further.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>
					<a name="070522101000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Red Book claims in
paragraph 2.38 that the IBA, and presumably by extension the ABA, is
poorly focused and a historical anomaly. This lack of focus seems to
derive from the Government&#146;s inability to engage with the
difference between commercial property, which might in the ordinary
course of events be expected to appreciate, and agricultural property
for which the opposite is usually true.</div>
					<a name="070522101000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can imagine the thinking in
the Treasury when this idea cropped up. Sitting in the impressive new
office building at 1 Horse Guards road it would have been easy to
envisage the steady and inevitable appreciation of commercial property
and to question why any special allowance for depreciation should be
made for agricultural or industrial property. Likewise if this
Committee had been sitting over the road in Portcullis House, we would
have another example of a building that ought not to depreciate
throughout its designed lifespan of in excess of 125 years. But
commercial real estate in central London is worlds away from the
cowsheds and pigpens in Essex and worlds away from the businesses that
rely on the capital allowances hit by clause 35.</div>
					<a name="070522101000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have rolled
these things together on the spurious grounds that they all involve, as
the Red Book would have it, &#147;land and buildings&#148;. That is
not robust reasoning. Rather than trying to tighten the focus to
correct any potential inequity, the Government have simply charged in.
I would say that they have gone like a bull at the gate but I do not
think that anything as rural as that occurred to Ministers when they
looked at this issue. If the distinction between the buildings that are
likely to depreciate and those that are not needs to be tightened up,
so be it. I would not disagree with that, but it should be tightened up
after proper consultation and reporting has taken place.</div>
					<a name="070522101000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two further brief
comments to make. The first concerns the constant injunction that we
should look at all of the Chancellor&#146;s measures in the round or
as part of a balanced package. What that really means is the process by
which a tax-cutting budget is revealed as a tax-conning budget, but we
should not stray too far from what we are talking about.</div>
					<a name="070522101000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the concerns of my
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham that small businesses and
unincorporated businesses will not benefit from the 2 per cent. cut in
the headline rate of corporation tax that sits in the balance against
the withdrawal of IBA and ABA. What concerns me more than that is that
the detailed shape of the whole package on capital allowance has
yet to appear.</div>
					<a name="070522101000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chancellor is withdrawing
balancing adjustments and the recalculation of writing-down allowances
now, but is also dithering over bits and pieces of the package that
will appear in future Finance Bills. I suppose that once the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry is installed in No. 11, the case for
industrial buildings allowance might conceivably be looked at again,
but I doubt very much that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs will be able to effect a positive outcome for the
farmers.</div>

here. That is the removal of capital allowances and, to use my hon.
Friend&#146;s analogy again, pulling the rug from those businesses
that have made certain assumptions about their cash flows in respect of
commercial or agricultural buildings. It would be preferable to defer
the beginning of this process until after the detailed study called for
in amendment No. 24 has been
undertaken.</div>
					<a name="070522101000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point concerns one piece of the future package: the rate of writing
down allowances for certain fixtures that are integral to a building.
That raises the spectre of a raft of artificial manipulations in
respect of what constitutes an integral fixture for accounting
purposes. Paul Howard, a senior tax consultant with Chiltern plc, has
said:</div>
					<a name="070522101000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
could always claim capital allowances on fixtures, but I suspect they
will ring fence the definitions to restrict what you can claim as
integral...This could make buildings and capital allowances more
complicated than they already
are.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070522101000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
the prospective changes open the door to error, complexity and
artificial manipulations. Rather than shutting the stable door after
the horse has bolted, or indeed after the stable door has been
reclassified as a plant, will the Chief Secretary give some indication
of the Treasury&#146;s thinking on this issue and the scheme set out
in Budget note 2? Better still, will he agree to amendment No. 24, so
he can set out his thoughts and listen to others at greater
length?</div>

Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): The bigger
the tax grab, the less innocuous its title. If one were sat in the
Treasury wanting subtly to plug a black hole with a large amount of
money, one would choose something that sounded quite verbose and not
very exact and would probably make it an acronym. In fact, that has
been done with ABA and IBA. One would also try to disguise what was
actually going on. In respect of the ABA&#151;the agricultural
buildings allowance&#151;one would say, &#147;Agricultural
buildings allowance? The farming sector&#146;s only 1 per cent. of
GDP, so this must be about a small section of the economy.&#148;
However, the measure involves industry as well, in respect of
industrial estates and property, and so forth, which is a significant,
but not massive, part of our economy. The definition of industrial
property covers not just farming, but all industry. We have received
submissions from various sectors, including hotels, transport,
distribution and tourism. It is effectively a tax grab from everyone,
and a huge one at that. I had to re-read briefs several times to
confirm that the figure of &#163;3 billion was correct. That is an
enormous sum.</div>

the Member for Ludlow, whose constituency is rural in parts,
unfortunately cannot be with us today. However, he was passed some
information from a chartered accountant who specialises in the farming
sector in Herefordshire. Mr. James Hutchinson of the
Hutchinson partnership wrote to him and estimated that based on his
client base, changes to the agricultural buildings allowance would lead
to an effective tax increase of 8.5 per cent. for farmers. I
specifically want to understand what the Chief Secretary&#146;s
assessment is of that and what advice he has received on
it.</div>
					<a name="070522101000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">My constituency
has one or two farms, but it is not largely a farming area. However,
having visited those farms I realise that far from farmers being
rich&#151;the impression one might occasionally get from television
programmes&#151;they are instead suffering. It is ironic&#151;I
hope that I shall not be ruled out of order if I present the broader
picture of what is happening in farming&#151;that Europe and the
Government are giving with one hand, by way of the common agricultural
policy, while increasing taxation with the other. That seems completely
inconsistent.</div>

terms of these amendments and the substance of the legislation. The
letter mentions the retrospective effect of the legislation and
considers its likely impact on the client base of Mr.
Hutchinson&#146;s firm. I admit that that is only one example, but
given that the Government have not done a systematic impact assessment,
because they have not gone through a proper consultation, we are
reliant on anecdotal examples. However, the firm does specialise in
agriculture. Over the next four years, the firm&#146;s client base
will be left with &#163;6.4 million of unused allowances that they

Gauke:
						</b> I add my voice to those who have expressed concern
about the lack of consultation. A number of hon. Members raised that
point and questioned why something that has been described as the
biggest reform of business taxes since the mid-1980s has been
undertaken with little or no consultation. I venture to suggest that
the answer is that the Government have been slow to realise that the
corporation tax rate was becoming increasingly uncompetitive. Other
jurisdictions have been reducing their rates and the Government have
been under pressure&#151;not least from the Opposition. In an attempt
to respond, they have hurriedly sought to reduce corporation tax and to
pay for the reduction by reducing allowances.</div>
					<a name="070522101000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure that I would
disagree with that as a general policy direction. As the Chief
Secretary said, the corporation tax rate is, in itself, an important
point, as well as the overall burden of taxation. However, that
suggests that the Treasury perhaps took its eye off the ball on
corporation tax and business taxes as a whole. Hence, we have this
rather hurried proposal, with all the disadvantages that hon. Members
set out.</div>
					<a name="070522101000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
return to two points that I raised on Second Reading. The first relates
to the impact on major infrastructure projects, including the Olympics.
The reason why I raised that was because of the evidence that the
Select Committee on the Treasury received from, among others, John
Whiting of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to whom my hon. Friend the Member
for Fareham referred. In John Whiting&#146;s oral evidence to the
Select Committee, he identified those who will lose as a consequence of
the proposals set out in the Budget. That will
include:</div>
					<a name="070522101000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;somebody in
long-term property infrastructure including some very prominent
projects that are around at the moment where commitments have been made

not.&#148;</div>

capital allowances have a largely temporary timing effect. Those will
be more than outweighed by the dominant effect of the cut in the main

					<a name="070522101000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not an accountant, but I
would also question the claim that the changes to capital allowances
have a largely temporary timing effect. They are clearly substantial
raisers of revenue and if they are substantial raisers of revenue,
presumably somebody is paying that revenue, or at least not claiming
allowances of some description.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>Perhaps I can illuminate my hon. Friend on
his point about temporary timing differences, and I say that as an
accountant. If the Government varied the rate of capital allowances,
that would accelerate or decelerate the rate at which that expenditure
is recognised for tax purposes. Where an allowance is abolished and not
replaced, there is a permanent loss of tax relief. So the changes in
the subsequent clause accelerate capital allowances. The changes that
we have debated in this clause&#151;in subsequent years, we are
talking about the abolition of IBAs&#151;will lead to the permanent
elimination of that tax relief.</div>

concerned. I am obviously conscious that the Chief Secretary follows
these matters closely from a constituency point of view. If he is able
to shed any light on them and on the concerns raised by John Whiting
and others, I would be
grateful.</div>

point that I raised on Second Reading, which the Financial Secretary
did not pick up on his closing remarks, related to the impact on
certain private finance initiative projects. I raise this matter rather
tentatively because I have only heard it discussed anecdotally, but
there is a concern that some of the PFI projects that the Government
have entered into in recent years contain clauses whereby changes to
allowances that would be detrimental to the PFI provider might trigger
additional payments from the Exchequer to that PFI provider. In other
words, there might be a revenue cost as a consequence of the changes to
the
allowances.</div>

the problem, but I should be grateful if the Chief Secretary clarified

Opposition Members, although not from those of the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne. I shall refer to that in a moment. In addition,
enhancements to both the large company and small and medium-sized

<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>hon. Member for Windsor, the package will be fiscally neutral for small
businesses in all the score card years, because the benefits of the
additional allowances will be set alongside the increase in the small
company rate of corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="070522101000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35 paves
the way for gradual withdrawal of industrial and agricultural buildings
allowances over four years. The hon. Member for Fareham is right to
point out that the allowances were first introduced more than 60 years
ago. They replaced the old mills and factories allowance, which dated
back to the early years of the 20th century. Sixty years ago, it made a
lot of sense to assist in the post-war reconstruction of British
industry, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West pointed out
in his intervention, the allowances no longer reflect the reality of
the modern economy.</div>

					<a name="070522101000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
good economic case for continuing to provide a selective subsidy for
some kinds of business property but not others. It may come as a bit of
a surprise to some listening to this debate, in the light of the
slightly overblown rhetoric of Opposition Members, to hear that 13 per
cent. of the stock of business property is eligible for industrial or
agricultural buildings allowances&#151;80 per cent. is not eligible.
There really is no justification for having subsidies for this small
proportion of business properties and no allowances at all for the
rest. It is perfectly true that a case has been made for a general
system of allowances for all commercial properties so that the other 87
per cent. would be eligible too, but given the performance in recent
years of the commercial property sector, it would be hard to argue that
a more generous tax arrangement for them would be the right thing to
do.</div>

						</b> The Chief Secretary says that there is no
justification for the allowances for small industry sectors, but he
makes a point about the commercial sector. The per footage rental for
commercial retail space is buoyant and has been for many years. There
is an expectation that it will stay buoyant. However, the small margins
on agricultural businesses, the tiny margins in the hospitality sector
and the huge pressures in the manufacturing sector surely show that
there is a justification to provide the assistance to invest where
investment is needed in those sectors that are most hard pressed by
competition and very small
margins.</div>

Friend the Chancellor set out in the Budget. That is a much
better-targeted form of support than this rather random and arbitrary
arrangement that goes back 60 years. I can give a little
example. A crèche attached to a factory is eligible for an
industrial buildings allowance but a crèche attached to an
office is not. There is no rationale for such anomalies, and it is high
time that we put them right.</div>

							<a name="070522101000497"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I need to make a little more progress. I want to
clarify a point that was made repeatedly in some of the slightly
overblown comments from Opposition Members about the amount of money
that is at stake.</div>
					<a name="070522101000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rochford
and Southend, East referred to a &#163;3 billion tax increase. The
hon. Member for Braintree made a similar point. The hon. Member for
Fareham referred to the &#163;3 billion figure, but I think he
understood that the figure is the value of the claims. The cost to the
Exchequer is &#163;600 million, so we are talking about an order of
magnitude smaller than Conservative Members appeared to believe. That
may account for the slightly overblown character of some of their
points.</div>
					<a name="070522101000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The amount
at stake is &#163;600 million, and &#163;540 million of that is in
industrial buildings allowances, which incidentally is equal to about 4
per cent. of total allowances available to business. It helps to put
this into perspective. The remaining &#163;60 million is in
agricultural building allowances: 95 per cent. of the benefit of these
allowances goes to large businesses and 50 per cent. of the
total amount of industrial buildings allowance&#151;the &#163;540
million&#151;goes to the 100 largest companies. Those companies will
gain substantially from the reduction in the main rate of corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="070522101000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick up
another point. Both the large business package and the small business
package in the Budget are fiscally neutral in each of the years set out
in the Red Book. Without these measures, those packages would not be
fiscally neutral. I shall be interested to see how Opposition Members
will vote. If they vote in favour of the amendments, they will be
forgoing substantial sums&#151;hundreds of millions of pounds of
income for the Exchequer&#151;to add to the &#163;400 million that
they decided to forgo when they voted against schedule 4 last
week.</div>
					<a name="070522101000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick up
some of the other points that have been made. A good deal has been said
about consultation. The rate of writing-down allowance remains
unchanged for this year. It will be gradually reduced between 2008 and
2011. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said,
it is not customary to consult on changes in rates of taxation or on
the reduction or removal of tax reliefs. That is not the practice of
this Government, nor was it the practice of previous Governments.
However, we will consult 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>later this year on the design of new measures such as the annual
investment allowance, on which the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne commented, and the new credits for environmental technologies.
We will certainly welcome contributions to those
consultations.</div>
					<a name="070522101000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than withdrawing the
allowances overnight, we have given businesses a year&#146;s notice
of their eventual withdrawal. From April next year, the writing-down
allowance will be reduced by one percentage point per year until 2011.
That will give businesses ample time to plan and adjust. The clause is
designed in particular to prevent forestalling and other behaviours
that would otherwise have allowed some businesses to accelerate
allowances unfairly at the expense of others. It is not right to
describe this as a retrospective change. Corporation tax is an annually
set tax. We have pre-announced the withdrawal, and will withdraw the
allowances in a phased
manner.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000498"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I understand the Chief Secretary&#146;s point,
and he is absolutely right on corporation tax. However, when it comes
to making capital investment and building decisions, one bases those on
the amortisation or depreciation that one can get on a building over a
certain period, because cash flows cascade off that. Making an annual
decision on corporation tax is a different matter from having the
taxation that is suggested in this clause.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000499"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> There are a couple of points to be made in response
to that. First, the value of a building plus the land on which it sits
has commonly, in recent years, appreciated rather than
depreciated.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000501"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Let me finish the point.</div>
					<a name="070522101000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is right in
respect of agricultural buildings, but the picture is different because
the tax system recognises depreciation in other ways. It is common to
all commercial buildings that deductions against corporation tax are
available for the costs of repair and insurance, and the depreciation
of business premises is recognised at the point of sale in the capital
gains tax system. The system properly takes account of that
point.</div>
					<a name="070522101000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On hotels, it
is interesting that the industrial buildings allowance regime was
extended to qualify hotels in 1978&#151;it is a much more recent
feature of the regime than most&#151;to assist with the growth of UK
tourism. I suggest that the rationale for giving extra help to hotels
at that time does not apply today. There is not a good economic case
for preserving that selective subsidy. In general, the sector is
enjoying high levels of profitability and it will also derive
significant benefit from the 2 per cent. cut in the headline rate of
corporation tax from 2008. In the case of smaller hoteliers, the annual
investment allowance will act as a big incentive for investment as
well.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000502"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> The tourism market has changed beyond recognition
since 1978. The long weekend city break holiday, which generates huge
amounts of money, particularly in urban areas where it did not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>previously exist, is now subject to competition from places such as
Prague and Dublin, where people did not go, even for short breaks, in
1978. There is a constant demand to increase quality and availability
in all those areas. Surely the demand to keep the quality of the
service high and to improve constantly makes the argument that the
world has changed and therefore we do not need to do it completely
wrong.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000503"></a>
								Mr.
Timms:
						</b> No, not at all. People do not benefit from an
industrial buildings allowance if they are upgrading a facility in the
way that the hon. Gentleman talks about, and that is exactly the kind
of investment that will benefit from the annual investments allowance.
The new arrangements that we are introducing are much more effective
for encouraging the kind of investment that he wants to see rather than
the anomalous and outdated system that we are replacing.</div>
					<a name="070522101000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the Olympic games, I can
give the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire the reassurance that
the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games has been exempt
from corporation tax since its incorporation in October 2004, and so
will not be
affected.</div>

							<a name="070522101000505"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I am not sure who will be hit. The only sector that
I can think of that might be affected would be the hotel sector. We
have just had an exchange about that, and it will benefit overall from
the cut in the main rate of corporation tax or the annual investment
allowance.</div>
					<a name="070522101000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main
effect of amendments Nos. 15 to 23 would be to undo the main
anti-forestalling purpose of the clause. That would give a big
incentive to businesses without taxable profits against which to set
allowances, having valuable, older industrial or agricultural
buildings, to enter into sale and lease-back arrangements so that a
taxpaying purchaser could access relief on a high market value over the
remainder of the 25-year term. There would be a number of opportunities
for forestalling if the amendments were agreed and if this clause were
not agreed. The potential Exchequer cost of that is very large
indeed&#151;probably around &#163;250 million in the first year. A
number of other opportunities of that kind would open up.</div>
					<a name="070522101000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also point out that
there must be an error in the drafting, because as drafted the
amendments would create new or increased balancing charges and would be
a significant deterrent to businesses from selling qualifying
buildings. I hope that for that reason as well, Opposition Members will
not press the amendments to a vote.</div>
					<a name="070522101000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 24 and 183
propose delays pending reports. We have set out in some detail the
rationale for reform and the fiscal impact in this year&#146;s Budget
report. It is our intention to publish a regulatory impact assessment
on the withdrawal of the industrial and agricultural buildings
allowances, and on the package more widely, over the next year, in time
for the implementation of the reforms. Those who are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>calling for a report may perhaps be reassured by that. That information
will be published before the withdrawal takes place and will also
address the regional impact, although I do not think that it will be
large.</div>

the regulatory impact assessment will not say the complete opposite of
what I have said. The RIA will be published before the legislation puts
the changes into effect. I refer him to clause 35, which is simply
about balancing charges, and does not put into effect the wider changes
to the allowances.</div>
					<a name="070522101000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real impact of this pair
of amendments would be to introduce a delay. I do not imagine that
Opposition Members want a delay in reducing the main rate of
corporation tax. The clause is designed to stop forestalling, and any
delay would re-create opportunities for that, and would give some
businesses an opportunity to gain an unfair advantage over others. The
right way of withdrawing these outdated allowances is in a fair and
orderly way. I commend the clause, without the amendments, to the

the amendments.</div>
					<a name="070522101000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my perspective, the Minister&#146;s response betrayed a failure to
appreciate the interaction of a complex series of reforms on
enterprises of different sizes. He was wrong to argue that the package
of tax reductions for large businesses is ring-fenced from the
refocusing, as we must now call it, of tax increases for small
businesses. The two allowances&#151;IBAs and ABAs&#151;can be
claimed by enterprises of different sizes and different forms of
ownership. ABAs can be claimed by people who pay income tax or by small
and large companies. It is therefore difficult to try to disaggregate
them as the Minister sought to do in his
remarks.</div>

							<a name="070522101000511"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way,
especially as I failed to give way to him, for which I apologise. The
point that I emphasised was that for large businesses, and separately
for small businesses, the packages are fiscally neutral in each of the
years set out in the scorecard in the Red Book. It is not as a whole a
business package, but it works separately for large and for small
businesses.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000512"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Given that the abolition of ABAs and IBAs has been
justified in the context of the reduction of corporation tax for large
businesses, there is a knock-on effect on small businesses and that is
where the problem arises. I take on board the Minister&#146;s
comments about consultation and the fact that a regulatory impact
assessment will be published before the next Finance Bill. Apparently,
we all know the answer to that, so there is no point in professional
bodies wasting their time responding to the consultation document
because it is almost written as we sit here today.</div>
					<a name="070522101000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are complex issues and
there should be a clearer way of thinking through the impact on
different sectors and different types of enterprise. The Chief
Secretary said on several occasions, &#147;Don&#146;t worry about
the abolition of ABAs and IBAs because there will be an annual
investment allowance for small businesses&#148;. However, in the
past, small businesses evaluated projects on the basis of the available
ABAs or IBAs, and their cash flow was based on that. Those businesses
assumed that tax relief would come on-stream, but they will no longer
receive it, which will make it more difficult for them to continue to
invest. It is difficult to rationalise the matter by saying,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, there will be a new allowance for
investment in the future,&#148; because we are talking about the
withdrawal of investment relief to which businesses expected to
continue to be entitled. They have made financial projections on that
basis, and taken that tax relief into account when determining whether
the investment will go forward. That is an important
issue.</div>
					<a name="070522101000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne talked about the matter in the context
of rural diversification, and many businesses have based those very
difficult decisions on the assumption that the allowances would be in
place, so they will now wonder how well they will stack up in the
future.</div>

Gauke:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>With regard to insurance companies and gross
roll-up business, the ABI submission to the Committee noted that the
provisions are the outcome of detailed consultation with the industry.
In responding to this debate, does the Economic Secretary share the
view that consultation is an important part of the process? If so, are
there any particular areas in which that has been the case? The ABI
states that the Government have continued to consult on certain points
of detail. Will the Economic Secretary outline the key areas that are
still to be determined with the ABI and other industry
representatives?</div>

							<a name="070522101000549"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> In a moment, we are going to debate a series of
detailed amendments to schedule 7, which have been&#151;and still
are&#151;the subject of consultation. With your permission,
Mr. Gale, I will respond to the point about the consultation
when we discuss the detail of that schedule.</div>
					<a name="070522101000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broader point that the
hon. Gentleman makes is absolutely right. When I participated in
debates on the previous Finance Bill a year ago, we stressed the
importance of consultation in the area of life assurance and insurance
company business, especially given the difficult set of events in
autumn 2005. It was generally acknowledged that while some necessary
decisions had been made to deal with central tax avoidance, in
retrospect, the consultation could have been more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>effective. As a result of the work that started at that point, we have
undertaken extensive consultation in that area.</div>
					<a name="070522101000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last May, Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs published a consultative document on various
technical aspects of the special corporation tax rules that apply to
insurance. People who have studied the consultation documents and the
legislation will understand that that is a very complex area of tax
law. In the 12 months since then, working groups made up of industry
representatives, professional advisers, and HMRC officials have
discussed at length various options for changing the life assurance
company tax framework. The working group set out to identify and
discuss areas of the regime that could be simplified, clarified or
improved. They embraced policy options and detailed technical solutions
and then the detailed consultation on the draft legislation. Therefore,
the measures that we are debating both here and under schedule 7 and
later schedules and clauses reflect the detailed consultation that has
been conducted in a constructive spirit.</div>
					<a name="070522101000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a tax point of view, it
was our intention that the outcome of the consultation on the changes
would be broadly neutral. Although that is not true for every measure
across the piece, this is not a tax-cutting or tax-raising exercise.
Consultation work is continuing to which I shall refer later. As the
hon. Gentleman said, the ABI has provided considerable time and
resources, as have many other industry
practitioners.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000552"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The Economic Secretary is right that the measure is
a simplification as those who remember last year&#146;s debate will
accept. Schedule 7 rolls up five different types of business into one
category. Will he explain why permanent health insurance still has its
own separate taxation scheme?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000553"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to
simplification. I wish to preview the schedule a little. We shall be
discussing the amendments in a moment but, as he said, schedule 7
contains a series of measures to simplify complex legislation
substantially. It is based on technical consultation that started last
May. Under current law, five similar, separate consultations are needed
to calculate the profits or losses arising through the insurance
company from its pensions business, its overseas life insurance
business, its life reinsurance business, its individual savings
accounts business and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>its child trust fund business. A result of having five separate
computations is that, when a computation results in a loss in one
category, it cannot be set against profits in other
categories.</div>
					<a name="070522101000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
introducing schedule 7, the clause will merge those five categories of
life insurance business into a single new class of business called
gross roll-up business. Instead of five separate computations, only one
will be required. That means that losses can be offset from one old
category and set automatically against profits in
another.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000554"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000556"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Will Economic Secretary clarify his remark about
the carry forward of losses? My understanding is that, for old losses,
there is an apportionment particularly when those old losses relate to
pensions business. Can he confirm
that?</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000557"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I was saying that, instead of five separate
computations going forward, only one will be required. Under the new
regime, losses arising from one old category will be set automatically
against profits of another. I shall answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
detailed question in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="070522101000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
time to consider the issues properly. Although the consultation has
been very successful and the simplification is welcome, there is one
qualification. There is a large bank of unused pension business losses
throughout the life assurance industry, so allowing relief for all
existing pension business losses against future profits arising from
other categories of business would have an Exchequer
cost.</div>
					<a name="070522101000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Exchequer
set out to make the package neutral. Although that has caused some
disappointment in the insurance company, the relief for existing
pension business profits will be restricted to the pension business
proportion for future and gross roll-up business profits. That is the
consequence of our trying to make the change revenue neutral, but we
shall review the position to see if our estimates of cost stand up in
the light of more recent
figures.</div>
					<a name="070522101000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some areas
are still under consultation. The amendments to the schedule deal with
several detailed points that have arisen from that consultation. We are
still considering apportionment of income, transfers of business,
contingent loans and funding arrangements, and the structural assets,
which are all matters that we need to look at further. I hope that
Committee members will see that this is a substantial simplification
and that, although we could not deliver everything that the industry
wanted, we have gone a considerable way to meeting its
concerns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000558"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The Economic Secretary has not answered the
question I asked in my first intervention about why PHI falls outside
gross roll-up
business.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000559"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> It is true that, at the outset of the consultation,
we were attracted in principle by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>additional simplification of six into one by merging the computation for
permanent health insurance as well as the other categories that I
mentioned. However, PHI is assessed on a different basis from the other
five categories, which would make the merger process much more complex.
Also, detailed work done during the consultation process established
that six into one would have had a much greater Exchequer cost than we
had previously believed. In our judgment, the combination of
introducing greater complexity plus the Exchequer cost outweighed any
additional simplification from six being merged into
one.</div>
					<a name="070522101000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
option of adding PHI to the newly merged gross roll-up category is not
ruled out. We may be able to consider that in future Finance Bills, but
the combination of additional complexity in meeting the test of my hon.
Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West plus Exchequer cost and
our desire for neutrality meant that, following the consultations, we
were not able to make the change. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

								Ed
Balls:
						</b> Amendment No. 129 is a good example of the openness
and trust between the industry and the Government that has been built
up during the course of this major consultation on life insurance
company taxation. As drafted in the Finance Bill, new section 444ABD of
the Taxes Act 1998 gave what commentators described as an over-generous
treatment of certain losses, which could lead to double counting. We
are removing the part about losses, but that is not the end of the
story. HMRC and the industry are continuing to discuss the tax
treatment of transfers of business for reasons that I shall explain in
due course and that we will discuss when we come to the stand part
debate on the clause, if we have not already had it. I may have
referred to some of those matters when I made my introductory remarks.
If a revised or more focused rule about losses is needed, it can be
done in the regulations. Amendments Nos. 121 and 122 amend schedule 7
and are purely consequential on amendment No. 129.</div>

							<a name="070522101000572"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> As I indicated on clause 37, this is a
simplification that has proceeded with the support of the insurance
sector, and the engagement of its advisers. As the Economic Secretary
rightly pointed out, this new spirit of openness and consultation comes
from the consequences of the announcement made in autumn 2005, which
caused considerable unhappiness and uncertainty in the life insurance
sector. This is the second year running that we have discussed changes
to the insurance sector. There were significant reforms in 2003, 2004,
2005, 2006 and 2007. It would be helpful if Economic Secretary could
indicate whether we are going to have to go back round the hurdles on
the matter in 2008, or whether he feels that this is a settled set of
reforms that are unlikely to see major changes.</div>
					<a name="070522101000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a detailed question
about schedule 7. As I understand it, the losses of the gross roll-up
business cannot be carried back for 12 months, whereas losses of
ordinary businesses and enterprises can be. Why are life assurance
businesses being treated differently in this context from other types
of business? Can the Economic Secretary illuminate the Committee a
little more on the issue of transfers, to which he alluded in the first
group of amendments? My assumption is that transfers within a life
insurance company should not give rise to a tax loss or gain. He gave
the impression that that aspect of these rules has not been pinned down
yet. It would he helpful to have greater clarity on that
matter.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000573"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> On the former point, prior to 2006, there had been
previous Finance Bills in which there were changes to life insurance
and taxation. However, they had all been incremental and not
first-principled. It was discovered in the autumn of 2005 that the
operation of the life assurance taxation regime was so complex that
neither Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs nor the industry
itself fully understood how the rules worked and how they interacted
with a rapidly changing insurance world. An HMRC decision, announced in
debates at that time, gave the impression of a small cost, which turned
out to be a potentially substantial cost until the change was
modified.</div>
					<a name="070522101000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In order to
avoid such problems in future, greater dialogue or consultation was
needed, and we also needed to simplify the regime from first
principles, which is what has been happening in the past year. The
consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>
						and the changes we are introducing now are
materially different from the changes to the tax regime for life
assurance businesses in previous Finance
Bills.</div>

					<a name="070522101000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
consultation is still ongoing on some matters, and our detailed
technical amendments to the schedule following consultation are
testimony to that fact. It would be foolish to rule out coming back
next year or on Report with further detailed, consequential amendments
following this reform and no member of the Committee, or anyone in HMRC
or in the industry would want to do so. However, we will not need to
make a first principle reform, as has been done in the last
year.</div>
					<a name="070522101000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we make
more progress in any respect on the matters I that listed a moment ago,
including the transfers of business and apportionment of income
contingent to the loans and funding arrangements of structural assets,
we will be happy to return with further proposals in 2008. We will give
the Committee a detailed update on the operation of the regime so far
in a pre-Budget report, so there will be plenty of time for
discussion and consultation if changes are needed next year. I will
reply to the question on transfers asked by the hon. Member for Fareham
when we come to clause 39 and schedule 9.</div>
					<a name="070522101000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made a substantial
amount of progress on this complex area; the clauses, schedules and
relevant amendments before us are not controversial for the industry.
They do not give everything that people want, but they go a substantial
way towards doing so, and I hope that the Committee will agree to the
schedule.</div>

							<a name="070522101000577"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> Briefly, I do not know whether the Economic
Secretary plans to make a comment on the basis of taxation for
insurance companies, but as I understand it, the arrangements will mean
that there will be one basis of taxation. Previously, HMRC was able to
alter the basis of taxation in particular circumstances from what is
described as &#147;I minus E&#148;. Will the Economic Secretary
explain the circumstances in which that would have happened and why?
When the Treasury, or HMRC, no longer has the ability to alter the
basis of taxation, what will be the effect on
revenue?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000578"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Schedule 8 and clause 38 carry on the process of
simplification that I explained in my earlier comments. In particular,
the measures abolish what is known as the Crown option&#151;the
ancient rule under which an HMRC officer can, even in these days of
self-assessment, decide whether a life insurance company should pay tax
on a trading profits basis or on the I minus E basis that nearly always
applies to such companies. The current system has been part of the life
insurance tax rules since 1915.</div>
					<a name="070522101000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">When HMRC published its
technical consultation document in May 2006, there was a small passage
about the Crown option. It became clear from the responses to the
document that the uncertainty of not knowing when the Crown option
would be exercised was causing problems for the life insurance
industry, especially in the calculation by a company&#146;s actuaries
of its embedded value profits. There are ways for insurance companies
to show more realistic profit figures than those that are given by the
regulatory accounting rules of the Financial Services Authority. They
require the actuary to predict the tax treatment of the business over
the coming decade or so. The complete change of basis that is caused if
the Crown option is exercised plays havoc with those calculations. HMRC
and the industry have together devised a new approach to replace the
Crown option, to which schedule 8 gives effect.</div>
					<a name="070522101000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule sets out
unequivocally, with no element of choice for either HMRC or companies,
the circumstances in which a company will be assessed on the trading
profits basis. They are restricted to two types of specialist business.
Pure reinsurers&#151;companies that do reinsurance business only in
the market&#151;will, as they are now, always be taxed on the trading
profits basis. The same will apply to companies whose only business is
gross roll-up business, which we discussed in relation to schedule 7.
All other business that is not gross roll-up business, such as ordinary
life assurance business with UK residents, will be taxed only on the I
minus E basis.</div>
					<a name="070522101000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 8 sets out how
changes between the two bases will be handled, which is particularly
relevant for any change of basis that is caused by the schedule itself.
There are a number of transitional provisions. As part of the agreed
package, the schedule improves the mechanism for ensuring that the I
minus E basis of taxation results at least in the taxation, at
mainstream corporation tax rates, of the life insurance
company&#146;s profits that are not being accrued for policy
holders.</div>
					<a name="070522101000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
also ensures that losses and other reliefs that used to be permanently
lost when there was a change from the I minus E basis to the trading
profits basis are instead preserved and are restored if there is a
subsequent change back to the I minus E basis. That change has been
requested by and is particularly welcomed by the life insurance
industry.</div>
					<a name="070522101000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
result of extensive consultation, the schedule provides a certain,
modern and robust set of rules by which to decide basic questions about
the taxation of life assurance companies in a way that does not have an
overall revenue cost to the Exchequer. The rules will provide greater
certainty. The life assurance sector and its taxation are very
different from other parts of the economy. In answer to the question on
why that sector is treated differently regarding losses that are
carried 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>back, let me say that it is one consequence of the I minus E regime for
life insurance taxation. Another consequence of those rules is that we
have to have different rules for the way in which losses are carried
back. I hope that that answers hon. Members&#146;
questions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000580"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> I am very happy to explain the amendments and the
schedule. Schedule 9 deals with the taxation of transfers of insurance
business. Government amendment No. 89 makes a minor clarification.
Schedule 9 repeals section 83(3) of the Finance Act 1989 and associated
rules, which apply to transfers of business. In general the repeal will
have effect from an appointed day, which will be set by an order in due
course.</div>
					<a name="070522101000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a
transfer of business took place before Budget day the repeal is
intended to be effective for any period beginning in 2007. However, the
life insurance industry has said that there is some doubt about whether
the measure has that effect. To deal with that uncertainty, Government
amendment No. 89 puts matters beyond
doubt.</div>
					<a name="070522101000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, schedule 9 contains a number of measures to reform the law
relating to transfers of life insurance business between insurance
companies. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>Transfers of business are a common feature within the insurance
industry, particularly as the industry consolidates and reorganises. A
merger of companies within a group can reduce the cost of capital
significantly and make operations more efficient. The Government do not
want in any way to stand in the way of such important transactions.
Indeed, we are keen to facilitate them and to reduce the administrative
and compliance burdens associated with genuine commercial
transfers.</div>
					<a name="070522101000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transfers
of business have also, however, presented opportunities for some to try
to extract profits in untaxed form, against the intentions of
Parliament. It has therefore been necessary for the Government to
introduce a number of complex measures over recent years to block a
succession of schemes designed to avoid tax on a transfer of life
insurance business. That has led to the tax rules for transfers of
insurance business becoming the most complex part of this very complex
area, and there is anecdotal evidence that that complexity is
inhibiting genuine commercial transactions. It will come as no
surprise, therefore, that simplifying the transfer rules was an
important objective for the industry in the consultation process. We
want to facilitate that if we
can.</div>
					<a name="070522101000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 9 is
designed to achieve those twin objectives by facilitating commercially
driven transfers and protecting the tax base. The basic principle on
which we worked in producing the legislation is that transfers of
business should be tax neutral, but only where assets and liabilities
pass from the long-term insurance fund of the transferor to the
long-term insurance fund of the transferee. Schedule 9 achieves that by
clarifying the existing rules and by adding new rules where previously
there was only
guidance.</div>
					<a name="070522101000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">To sit
alongside those clarified and simplified rules, there is a targeted
anti-avoidance rule. That will not affect &#147;plain vanilla&#148;
commercial transfers, but it will protect the tax base where there is
any attempt to reduce profits or create artificial losses during the
transfer process. The TAAR will replace most of the intricate and
mechanical anti-avoidance provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>introduced over previous years, leading to a considerable
simplification, as I have explained and on which we had, I think, some
agreement a moment ago. The TAAR will operate in association with a
clearance process, so that where Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs is satisfied that obtaining a tax advantage is not a main
purpose of a proposed transaction, the TAAR will not be invoked. In
addition, the TAAR will not apply where a group can show that one
company in that group may have got a tax advantage but there is a
corresponding tax disadvantage to another
company.</div>
					<a name="070522101000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to the measures in the schedule, HMRC will be streamlining its
processes where there is an insurance transfer. HMRC officials have
talked to the FSA and will be talking to actuaries who make reports to
the court on insurance business transfers, to see whether the
requirements laid down by them about tax clearances can be made less
burdensome on both HMRC and the applicant companies and their
advisers.</div>
					<a name="070522101000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with
the other schedules, there has been full consultation on the measure,
but it is somewhat different with respect to its commencement rules:
many of the new rules, including the TAAR, start from an appointed day.
There is a power in the schedule to amend the legislation by
regulations.</div>
					
					<a name="070522101000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070522101000581"></a>The

						</b> Order. The Committee will sit again at 4.30,
with Mr. Illsley in the Chair. Mr. Illsley will
also be in the Chair on Thursday morning. From the schedule laid down
by the House for the progress of the Bill, it is clear that we are
running behind schedule. I therefore give the Committee notice now that
I shall if necessary ask the usual channels to consider timetabling a
third sitting on Tuesday 5 June, if that becomes necessary. I mention
that now because I have always found that it is convenient to inform
hon. Members, and more particularly the staff, who have their lives to
plan as well, that that might happen. Hon. Members can then adjust
their diaries if
necessary.</div>
