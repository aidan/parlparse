<a name="09061931000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000434"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): We may have lift
problems again, given the depleted number of Labour Members; however,
we are not going to divide for the time being.</div>
<a name="09061931000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was making
mention this morning of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich because a rather mischievous suggestion was made that he might
want to make a comeback in his role as Minister of State at the then
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I have heard of worse ideas. If I
may pay him a compliment, in my role as shadow fire service Minister,
rarely do I meet anyone in the fire service who has not got a good word
to say about him as a former fire service Minister. If the Government
Whips are taking any notice of what I say, they might consider my
suggestion&#151;but that has probably ruined his
career.</div><a name="09061931000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to clause 135, this morning I was making the case that had been put
very strongly by the Construction Confederation, but it might be as
well to put it into a wider context. The Opposition believe that the
Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 needs updating
to tackle the continuing problem of late and unreasonably disputed
payments in the sector. We believe in the decision to legislate, and
support strengthening the adjudication system. We consistently lobbied
for that with the last three construction Ministers. We support the
aims of the clauses on payment, and we hope that the Minister takes on
board the significant amount of lobbying that the construction industry
has put in place.</div>
<a name="09061931000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am anxious
not to stray outside the remit of the clause, but I was obviously
disappointed that the amendment proposed by the Federation of Master
Builders was not selected. We may have been minded to support that
provision, which amended the 1996 Act and dealt with the desirability
of maintaining a diverse range of contractors in a local authority
area. We are sorry it was not on the selection
list.</div><a name="09061931000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government had an opportunity, in drafting the clause, to take
cognisance of the pleas being made in the industry to roll up all the
adjudication under the auspices of the scheme for construction
contracts. As a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>result, there would have been no need for this strict
definition&#151;the division between written and oral
contracts&#151;which, as I said earlier, may well give rise to
unnecessary bureaucracy and time-wasting and impose an indicative cost
on the construction industry. However, I look forward to hearing from
the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for
Portsmouth, North. I paid her a compliment this morning, Mr.
Illsley, and congratulated her on her promotion. She is in fact on
double time this afternoon, we gather, because she is simultaneously
serving on the Finance Bill and this
Bill.</div><a name="09061931000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000435"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): Following on from the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks, I suppose the Exchequer Secretary is
fortunate that the rules change on 1 July, so she will not have to
declare that she is doing two jobs at once. I am not sure what the
salary implications are, but I am sure there are some.</div>
<a name="09061931000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should note
that this is an odd Bill, in that it puts together lots of different
unrelated elements. I suppose that that is a feature of where we are in
this Session&#151;trying to get things done before we finish for the
summer. It also shows that the Bill has not focused on issues of local
democratic involvement, which we had hoped it might when the White
Paper was introduced. Having said that, this is obviously a crucial
issue for people in the construction sector. Members of the Committee
have received a great deal of information from individual businesses
and representative organisations about those concerns. We will not have
the opportunity to talk about those as we move through this part of the
Bill. However, it seems that there is concern that the proposed changes
will not meet the needs of the sector in these difficult economic
times. We will need to return to that as we move through the clauses in
this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061931000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000436"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): On Second
Reading, I drew attention to my interest in this issue. Before we
discuss the clause, I should reiterate that I am currently the honorary
vice-chairman of the Construction Industry Council, and have for the
past four years been respectively its chairman and deputy chairman. I
thank the hon. Member for Peterborough for his kind remarks about my
past in relation to the fire service. I am afraid he will groan when I
tell him that I have a past in relation to the construction
industry&#151;I was Construction Minister between 1997 and 2001.
Before that, I was an Opposition spokesperson on  such matters
and spent some considerable time on  what became the Housing
Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act
1996.</div>
<a name="09061931000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000437"></a><b class="B">Ian
Stewart</b> (Eccles) (Lab): Is this an application for
anything?</div><a name="09061931000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000438"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> No, no. I just think that hon. Members should
be aware of my perspective on the issue. The 1996 Act gave effect to
the recommendations that came from the Latham review, which was an
important review seeking to tackle the problems of excessive conflict
and litigation in the construction industry and encouraging more
partnering and collaborative work. The Act has helped in many ways to
deal with unnecessary disputes, reducing the amount of conflict in the
industry, and  to provide speedier remedies for disputes
through the adjudication procedure and greater certainty about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>payment. Despite the progress, there are still
difficulties in this part of the Bill. It has been seen as necessary to
tidy up some of the loose ends in the existing legislation, and also to
take forward the process of assisting the industry in becoming more
productive, less litigious and more
effective.</div><a name="09061931000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a lengthy period of consultation on the proposed clauses we
are dealing with. Not every part of the industry has been happy. We are
talking about a complex industry with a large range of different
interests. Inevitably, the interests of main, sub and specialist
contractors, consultants, manufacturers and others are sometimes
different. Unsurprisingly, there was no overall consensus on the
measures necessary to tidy up the 1996 Act, but eventually, a
compromise emerged from those discussions, and that is broadly
reflected in the
clauses.</div><a name="09061931000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the clause before us, the suggestion that somehow there might be
problems arising as a result of widening the definition of construction
contracts to include oral ones is not a correct perception. There is a
difficulty with construction contracts, which are generally in writing,
but where it is necessary to vary the contract&#151;probably on site
as a result of an unforeseen circumstance&#151;an oral instruction
may be given. If that happens, the contract is no longer a purely
written one, but a combination of written and oral. Given the current
requirement that the contracts must be in writing, it could provide a
loophole for a party trying to avoid adjudication by arguing that
because there was an oral element in the contract, it would preclude
the adjudication process. That loophole will be closed by the clause we
are
discussing.</div><a name="09061931000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to the hon. Member for Peterborough that, although I hear the
concerns raised by the Construction Confederation, it would be a
retrograde step to oppose the widening of the definition to include
oral elements, due to the circumstances I have explained. That is
widely seen as a way of helping to ensure that adjudication is
effective and cannot be frustrated by litigious parties who are simply
trying to force their way through and bully other parties to a
construction contract by using the law. In my view, the change is
welcome. I hope that the Government will press it, and that the
Opposition will not oppose it.</div>
<a name="09061931000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000439"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah
McCarthy-Fry):</b><b class="B"> </b>I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Illsley, and I thank hon. Members across the Committee
for their kind
words.</div><a name="09061931000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two points that I want to deal with, the first being that made by
the hon. Member for Peterborough about the worry that the contracts
would lengthen the adjudication process. It is worth reminding him that
we are not requiring parties to use adjudication; it is available to
them if they feel it is appropriate in their circumstances. It may well
be that adjudicating an oral contract is the most cost-effective way of
determining a dispute. It may be more expensive than adjudicating a
written contract, but it would still be much cheaper than deciding the
dispute through litigation. We think we should let people choose for
themselves.</div>
<a name="09061931000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the wider
point about a single statutory adjudication scheme, it would introduce
greater clarity and simplicity but it would also represent a much more
significant intervention into freedom of contract and would prevent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>parties from agreeing the best process for resolving disputes under
their particular form of agreement. It could also curtail any future
innovation in the adjudication process. We have decided that the
balance falls on the side of maintaining parties&#146; freedoms.
However, the point is not an unreasonable one, and we have made the
offer to industry that we will conduct a thorough review of the
existing adjudication system set out in secondary legislation when we
amend it as a consequence of the changes we are making to the 1996
Act.</div><a name="09061931000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000440"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she
elucidate the remarks made in the other place on 3 March by Lord Brett
in Grand Committee when talking about a single scheme for
adjudication?</div><a name="09061931000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
would not be unreasonable. Therefore, we have made an offer to the
industry that we will conduct a thorough review of the existing
adjudication scheme set out in secondary legislation when we make
amendments&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,

time scale is the Minister looking at for that review, given that this
process has been dragging on, with consultation, for seven
years?</div>
<a name="09061931000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000441"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I wish I could answer the hon. Gentleman. I
will have to say, as soon as possible and practical, unless inspiration
arrives at some point, in which case I may be able to elucidate further
later on. I will undertake to write to the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000442"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> This clause is relatively easy and uncontentious,
so we will not burden the Committee. It inserts the new subsection
(3)(a) into section 108 of the Housing Grants, Construction and
Regeneration Act 1996, requiring parties to a construction contract to
provide in the contract the adjudicator&#146;s power to correct a
clerical or typographical error. We do not have any problems with this
tidying-up exercise. It is broadly welcomed by most members of the
construction community and we are happy, subject to the
Minister&#146;s comments, not to divide the
Committee.</div><a name="09061931000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000443"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, this clause
ensures that adjudicators can, generally speaking, make corrections to

construction contract should provide that</div>
<a name="09061931000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the adjudicator
has the power to correct a clerical or typographical

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000444"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I rise to make two points. First, I very much
welcome the provisions of the clause. It closes a loophole that has
been used by some parties to try to frustrate the procedures put in
place by the 1996 Act to allow adjudication as a relatively quick and
low-cost means of overcoming disputes. Where parties insist that the
full cost of adjudication is met by the subcontractor, it would provide
a serious deterrent to a subcontractor seeking adjudication. This
particular device has been deployed to discourage the use of
adjudication.</div>
<a name="09061931000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change
here, which makes it unlawful for any agreement on apportionment of
costs prior to the appointment of an adjudicator, is entirely sensible.
There is, however, an unfortunate by-product. Where there is a need to
apportion the costs in order to ensure that the adjudicator is paid,
that is not necessarily covered under the new provisions. The Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests that an amendment should be
made to allow for the adjudicator to propose the apportionment of costs
between the parties and to ensure that the parties are jointly and
severally liable for the adjudicator&#146;s
costs.</div><a name="09061931000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems an eminently sensible proposal. It was advocated in the other
place by Baroness Hamwee of the Liberal Democrats. I think the
Government undertook to consider it sympathetically, so I am
disappointed that there is no Government amendment today.</div>
<a name="09061931000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have the
greatest sympathy for my hon. Friend the Minister who has had to pick
up this brief at very short notice and has now been told that she is
going to relinquish it almost immediately. I am sorry to bowl her this
googly, but would she please tell the Committee whether the Government
are sympathetic in principle to the RICS amendment? Would they be
willing to accept such an amendment on Report were I to table one,
which I am minded to
do?</div><a name="09061931000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000445"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for his
comments. The Government are sympathetic to the views, but we have
looked at the situation and we have decided not to legislate at this
time. However, we would be happy to meet the RICS to discuss
its concerns. In the meantime, I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="09061931000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000446"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> This clause is more contentious and involves the
removal of conditional payment provisions and the pay-when-certified
provisions. There is concern about section 113 of the Housing Grants,
Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, which has been communicated to
all members of the Committee. Section 113 is a pay-when-paid provision
which is used in the event of a main contractor&#146;s client or
customer going into insolvency. In other words, a subcontractor will
not get paid at all in the event that a main contractor does not
receive anything from his client or customer. This is a significant
worry for small and medium-sized enterprises who are concerned that
this clause of the 1996 Act will be used to prevent them being paid in
a timely and reasonable way. The specific point raised by members of
the construction community was that the former Department of Trade and
Industry consulted on removing this exceptional sub-clause&#151;or
clause of the new construction act&#151;four years ago. It gave an
undertaking at the time that it was minded to remove that clause to
assist small and medium-sized enterprises. The Minister&#146;s
predecessor in what was then the DTI indicated that it would be
removed. However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs decided to impose the provision nevertheless, but at the same
time agreed there should be a full review of insolvency law and
practice as applied to the construction industry. That review was never
instigated.</div>
<a name="09061931000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, to
sum up what is quite a complex clause, the question asked by many in
the construction industry is why should small and medium-sized
enterprises act as insurers in respect of both the main
contractor&#146;s insolvency, and the client&#146;s insolvency? We
are looking to receive today undertakings from the Minister that she
understands the difficulties this clause may give rise to. Is there a
review specifically around this and could it be subject to secondary
legislation in the future? If we do not receive sufficient undertakings

Report.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000451"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I would not claim to be an expert on the niche
of contract negotiations in the construction sector and I think that
will become patently obvious to the Committee as we continue our
discussions about this part of the Bill. However, there is a particular
issue that was raised with me for which I am grateful to the Federation
of Small Businesses, an organisation that does a great deal of work on
behalf of its members but also in trying to improve legislation and
Government decision making. Among smaller contractors who are
effectively at the end of the supply chain, there is concern that they
are put at risk by some of the issues in the clauses as they stand. The
current economic circumstances heighten that. One of the issues
considered by our amendments&#151;I will be interested in
what  the Minister has to say about the points raised by the
FSB&#151;is the issue of what is effectively an invoice, the payment
notice, being sent by the person who is paying the bill, who is the
person who holds all the cards. Also, a supplementary notice can be
issued, changing the proposed amount for payment. There needs to be a
process to resolve such issues, as the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich rightly
said.</div><a name="09061931000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
concern is that a problem occurring in a higher tier of contract
negotiations could impact very much on the people at the bottom, the
people who are carrying out the work and, arguably, taking the most
risk. The amendments remove the payer&#146;s option to issue that
initial notice and address the question of whether a supplementary
notice can be issued altering the amount later in the process. I hope
to hear a little more from the Minister about why the Bill as it stands
is the solution that has been arrived at by the Government. How does
she feel that smaller contractors in particular can be protected from
losses?</div><a name="09061931000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000452"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I would like to support the comments of the hon.
Gentleman and to give a little perspective to the issues raised. In
particular, clauses 139 and 140 have failed to win the support of
significant parts of the construction industry, but also beyond it.
Their effect will be to enable a payer to issue notices effectively
telling the payee how much he is going to receive, which is a novel
approach to cash flow. While that in itself is unusual, there is a
further twist&#151;the payer can reduce the amount of his original
notice, as has been
said.</div><a name="09061931000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions were described by the RICS as &#147;extremely
complicated&#148;
and</div><a name="09061931000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unlikely
to be understood by users in the
industry&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061931000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">never
mind Members of Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Building said
that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div><a name="09061931000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Bill is
overly complicated and unworkable in relation to the revised payment
provisions, which may result in higher administration costs, delayed
payments and unintentionally more
adjudication.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Federation of Small Businesses and the Specialist Engineering
Contractors Group have made similar points. The point raised by the SEC
Group was about how a small business can manage its cash flow, put up a
good case to its bank when borrowing money, or be sure of paying its
employees when faced with that particular scenario. It is the most
difficult part of the part 8 construction contracts. Depending on the
Minister&#146;s answer, we are minded to support the Liberal Democrat
amendments.</div><a name="09061931000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000453"></a><b class="B">Barry
Gardiner</b> (Brent, North) (Lab): I have been contacted about
the clause by three young constituents who told me that they normally
assume an application for payment, but the provisions of the clause as
they understand them will, in effect, enable their customer to dictate
what they will be paid. The clause enables that customer to issue an
initial notice of due payment, but then to reduce that by issuing a
subsequent notice, which notice can only be challenged by legal
proceedings. As my constituents have done the work, they naturally
consider that they have the right to issue a notice of due payment,
which would be paid. On the other hand, they accept that if the
customer raises a subsequent notice that reduces the amount that my
constituents have requested, they can accept that the amount in that
notice will be the sum that will be paid, provided that there is some
justification for a lesser amount. The customer should ensure that his
notice is issued within an appropriately short period. Under the
current proposals, he could issue his second notice weeks or months
after the due date for payment. That would obviously have a great
impact on cash flow.</div>
<a name="09061931000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to subsection (1)(a) of proposed clause 110A, it seems quite
sensible, pace the amendment, to provide that a specified person might
give notice rather than the payer. There are cases in which a
designated architect would specify whether the work had drawn to a
completion at a particular phase of the contract. I do not entirely
support the amendment, but I would like clarification on the
substantive point that I believe it is trying to
address.</div>
<a name="09061931000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000454"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I understand that the amendments would
create a position in which only a payee could issue the statutory
payment notice. Under the 1996 Act, only the payer can issue the
statutory payment notice. The Bill removes that restriction, allowing
the payer, the payee or a third party&#151;for example, an architect
working for a customer&#151;to issue the notice, and we leave it to
the parties to agree in contract who should do so. The reason for that
is that the provision is permissive, allowing a broad range of
commercial practices to continue unburdened by legislation. We do not
prevent the payee-led process suggested&#151;far from it. We
expressly allow it and, similarly, we allow others to use processes
that reflect their own commercial logic as they see fit.</div>
<a name="09061931000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
suggested that the legislation is over-complex. Part of its complexity
is due to the fact that is drafted to catch a number of scenarios. For
example, we allow the payer, a third party or the payee to issue the
payment notice; the contract will simply require that one of them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>can perform that function. A payer will be entirely clear whether he or
she is issuing the statutory payment notice, whether a third party is
doing so, or whether he or she should rely on the payee to make an
application to determine the sum due.</div>
<a name="09061931000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying process is simple. A payment notice is served setting out
the sum considered to be due. That sum can be revised. The sum becomes
payable. That is the process that will be incorporated into contracts.
Contracts will clearly set out who is responsible for issuing the
payment notice.</div>
<a name="09061931000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000455"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I thank the Minister for her generosity in giving
way. We all want to see equality between the various players in the
construction industry, both small and large. Will the Minister give an
undertaking to consider taking up the idea of the statutory trust fund,
perhaps in secondary legislation, once the Bill is enacted? It works
successfully in New Zealand, Canada, the United States and throughout
Europe; it brings a lot more equality and less bureaucracy and it is
easily
understood.</div><a name="09061931000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000456"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The Government are always happy to consider
other approaches if they turn out to be practical, and we always
consider examples from other countries if they are applicable
here.</div>
<a name="09061931000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
point out that the payee&#146;s invoice has no status under current
legislation. The clause will give it much greater weight in determining
what is payable. Invoices can be payment notices if the parties agree
on payee payment notices in their contract. That is a significant step
forward, as it crystallises the amount that should be paid. Moreover,
even if the parties agree upon payer payment notices, the Bill will
allow the payee to issue a payment notice if the payer neglects to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061931000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Permitting
only the payer to issue the counter-notice is the quid pro quo. We want
to strike a balance between the interests of payers and those of
payees. Given the lack of widespread industry support for payee
counter-notices, and the fact that payee counter-notices could oblige
payers to pay more than was owed, we could not accept payee
counter-notices.</div>
<a name="09061931000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
discussed with industry stakeholders proposals for imposing a deadline
before which the counter-notice must be issued, but the feeling was
overwhelmingly against such a move. Many of those asked said that
payers would simply extend the payment period to mitigate the risk of
overpaying and/or issue conservative valuations of the work
undertaken.</div>
<a name="09061931000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
would gain greater certainty about what would be paid, we would do so
at the expense of extending payment periods and reducing the amount of
cash flow, and the objective of the legislation was to keep the cash
flowing. In any case, a counter-notice must be served before the final
date for payment, and the new sum set out in the counter-notice must be
paid before the final date of payment. It is not as though the payer
can indefinitely delay serving such a notice as a means of indefinitely
delaying payment to a payee. With that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his amendment.</div>

Rogerson:</b> I congratulate the Minister again on how she has
got to grips with the brief, given that she has not had the opportunity
to be involved in the negotiations and discussions. However, the
representations received by Committee members suggest a significant
body of opinion in the world that will have to implement these measures
that the provision is not yet quite right and that changes are
necessary. I would be letting people down if I did not give hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000458"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I put it to the hon. Gentleman that when the
original provisions were introduced by regulation in 1998, based on the
1996 Act, there were many voices across the industry that expressed
anxiety and disagreement with some of them. That is the nature of the
construction industry; it is hugely diverse, with many parties whose
interests are not always the same. In reality, the result of the
introduction of the 1998 provisions is a step forward. Although there
are inevitably discordant voices about the proposed changes, I suspect
that those differences are inherent in the nature of the industry and
do not reflect on the changes being introduced. The proposals have been
the subject of detailed discussion and, in my judgment, will improve a
process that has undoubtedly taken a lot of litigiousness and
adversarial behaviour out of the industry. I counsel the hon. Gentleman
against giving too much credence to the negative voices. Let us see how
the changes work in practice.</div>

other words, the statement in the Bill that there will be no charge to

a drafting amendment; it is a substantive amendment. I should like to

time.</div><a name="09061931000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to raise some questions about local contracting and the
desirability of local authorities having regard to that. The new
clause, which was tabled by Members who could not join us on the
Committee, sets out a helpful principle. It does not, as far as I can
see, restrict local authorities, in that it does not instruct them
always to look to local contractors or anything like that. However, it
focuses the mind on clause 66, which deals with local economic
conditions. The new clause would be a useful addition to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061931000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000478"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The new clause appears to be about access
for local contractors to local authority construction contracts. The
issue was raised on Second Reading. The new clause would permit local
authorities considering the award of construction contracts, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>defined by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996,
to have regard to the assessment of the economic conditions in their
area and to the desirability of maintaining a diverse range of
contractors. Part 2 of the 1996 Act, which regulates construction
contracts, sets out the rights to adjudication, staged payment and the
suspension of performance under the contract. The legislation has
generally worked well, but has been ineffective in certain areas. Part
8 of the Bill addresses those
weaknesses.</div><a name="09061931000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause does not relate to that issue, however. It appears to use
the 1996 Act definition of a construction contract as a convenient hook
on which to hang another issue&#151;that of securing preferential
treatment for contractors in a local authority&#146;s area by pinning
awards on the economic assessment of conditions in a local
authority&#146;s area and the range of contractors available
locally.</div>
<a name="09061931000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting
of the new clause is unclear. It is difficult to understand what is

may mean the desirability of protecting local businesses from recession

value is above the threshold. There are limited exceptions to that
regime, but none appear to be relevant here. The new clause
suggests that local firms should be favoured over competitors from
the EU and elsewhere in the UK. Such unequal treatment or
discrimination would mean that a competitor, whether inside or
outside the UK, could challenge the procurement process or the award of
the contract if it has gone to a local company that has received
preferential
treatment.</div><a name="09061931000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
view is that a mixed economy of service provision is how local
authorities achieve best value in the delivery of their services. In
statutory guidance published last year, &#147;Creating Strong, Safe
and Prosperous Communities&#148;, the then Secretary of State
reaffirmed that commitment. The relevant paragraph states
that</div><a name="09061931000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;best
value is more likely to be achieved where there is a positive approach
to achieving a mixed economy, rather than where any one supplier
dominates the provision of services in an
area.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving
that matter within statutory guidance ensures that local authorities
have the necessary flexibility to be able to consider the circumstances
for each contract. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
clause.</div><a name="09061931000147"></a>

important points to be
made.</div><a name="09061931000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an area such as mine, where many of the businesses are smaller ones, a
local authority might be able to shape the time frame and the way it
collects bids for contracts to allow groups of smaller contractors to
form consortiums so that they can bid successfully against larger
operators that operate across the whole country. That is not to say
that the larger operators do not provide best value; however, in many
cases they will not be able to and are just able to act more quickly in
getting their bids in.</div>

Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): I beg to move, That the
clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley. Although
time is drawing on, the new clauses give us a chance to change the Bill
from a centralising measure into a real instrument of localisation. The
hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) is not here to
move his new clause&#151;the Committee has previously discussed his
mysterious disappearance from the Committee membership and have
speculated about where he may be now&#151;but we have decided, in a
spirit of benign good will, to move the new clause for him
and see how we get
on.</div><a name="09061931000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the new clause may be technically flawed, so we are not absolutely
insistent on pressing it to a vote at this stage, it gives us an
opportunity to discuss and consider the whole principle of referendums
in relation to local government. The new clause raises questions such
as whether such referendums should take place, how often they should
take place, and where they should fit in the general scheme of things.
The big issue at stake, which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Skipton and Ripon explored during part of his speech on Second Reading,
is the balance that must be struck 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>in any democracy between representative democracy&#151;electing
Members of Parliament, councillors and so on to represent views in the
Commons or, in this case, local councils&#151;and direct democracy,
which includes the use of
referendums.</div><a name="09061931000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has to be admitted that traditionally Britain has not used referendums
greatly, and that the way of some places abroad, such as California and
Switzerland, has been to use them more often. Since the 1970s, however,
we have begun to use referendums at national level to decide important
constitutional issues with greater frequency. There was a 1975
referendum on EU membership and there have been referendums in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on whether Parliaments and
Assemblies should be set up in those parts of the United Kingdom, so it
seems right at this point to pause and consider whether it would be
right to have local referendums run by local councils and, if so, in
what
circumstances.</div><a name="09061931000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we take a step back from the new clause, it is clear that, in
contemporary politics, the debate between when representative democracy
should apply and when direct democracy should apply has become very
live. It would be out of order for me to spend any time on the recent
expenses debacle, but it is a sign of the degree to which the internet
and modern communication and technology are leading many people to
probe and question the traditional elected representative model.
Indeed, we have heard calls, which I am sure will be considered in
other contexts, for the recalling of Members of Parliament between
elections. That argument is about the degree to which the traditional
model of the electorate electing a representative and allowing
them&#151;as the electorate wish&#151;to stand again for election
should
apply.</div><a name="09061931000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell), who is
sadly not a member of the Committee, and my former work colleague,
Daniel Hannan, have written a book called &#147;The Plan: Twelve
Months to Renew Britain&#148; in which they wish local referendums to
be a major element in how local democracy works. I am kicking myself
for not bringing my copy along to wave at the Committee and excite its
interest even further. My hon. Friend and Mr. Hannan want
quite a low trigger for local
referendums.</div><a name="09061931000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
view is that there has to be a balance, but that the traditional model,
whereby it is assumed at local level that councillors will be elected
and then put up for re-election every four years&#151;just like
Members of Parliament and the parliamentary cycle&#151;and the
referendum instrument can never apply, is not the right
balance.</div><a name="09061931000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000481"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> My hon. Friend is making a very persuasive and
cogent argument for referendums. Does he agree that referendums seek to
revitalise and rejuvenate local democracy, as seen, for instance, in
the Greater Manchester congestion charging referendum, which was very
successful in engaging people on the issue of expenditure and
transportation? Before that, he will remember the Bristol city council
referendum on council tax when people were engaged in discussion about
local public expenditure
priorities.</div><a name="09061931000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000482"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right that
local referendums can fulfil that role. The question is about where the
balance lies, as it would be with national
Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div><a name="09061931000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000483"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> My hon. Friend will recall that referendums have
been held with built-in criteria on turnout. Those failed. If one does
not have criteria, one could have a referendum, but not a legitimate
outcome.</div><a name="09061931000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000484"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> My right hon. Friend is correct. The amendment
simply sets out the machinery by which a referendum would operate. The
question of turnout is extremely important. I must not get diverted to
national referendums, but he will remember that the question of turnout
was vital in the consideration of Scottish devolution between 1974 and
1979. He makes an important point. Where should the balance lie? We are
persuaded that referendums should apply to council tax rises above the
national threshold, as is stated in our Green Paper.</div>
<a name="09061931000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we think that referendums have a place. We would be very
interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the new clause
and whether the Government believe that there is no place at all for
referendums in local government. That would be a basis for arguing
against the new clause. However, we think that the hon. Member for
Manchester, Blackley did well to table the new clause to allow debate.
We are grateful to have the opportunity to consider it this
afternoon.</div><a name="09061931000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061931000485"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): In moving the
new clause, the hon. Member for Wycombe raised an interesting
philosophical question about the extent to which our democracy is a
representative one or one in which more decisions should be taken by
referendums.</div>
<a name="09061931000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has a one-eyed view on how the
proposal should work. For example, he speaks about the need for the
issue to be addressed at local level, but not necessarily at
parliamentary level to the same extent. Equally, he referred to his
party&#146;s suggestion for referendums if council tax increases are
above a specific threshold. Presumably the flip side is that people
should have the right to call a referendum if they feel that cuts in
services extend beyond what they feel is acceptable. He did not seem to
offer a balanced view.</div>
<a name="09061931000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000486"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000487"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> That is true. I have not had the pleasure of
reading the document to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but it
sounded as though it referred only to the need for a mechanism at local
level, rather than to the equivalent national
mechanism.</div><a name="09061931000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall and I are sympathetic to a
facility for people living in a local authority area to have the right
to trigger a referendum. Our question is on a theme that is familiar
from earlier parts of the Bill: is it necessary to set that out in
primary legislation? I would be interested to hear from the Minister
the extent to which the facility is already available to local
authorities that may wish to use
it.</div><a name="09061931000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause does not set out the precise mechanism. It merely requires
that a mechanism be in place. We are sympathetic to the sentiment
behind the new clause, but the Minister&#146;s comments might be
helpful in setting out the extent to which the option is already
available to local
authorities.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000488"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> This is an important issue. Members of the
Committee have asked whether the current powers should go further, and
what they actually are. At present, under section 116 of the Local
Government Act 2003, principal local authorities in England already
enjoy considerable flexibility to hold advisory referendums. The power
is widely drawn. It gives councils a great deal of freedom and
flexibility to hold referendums on any issue relating to their
functions or their powers of well-being set out in the Local Government
Act
2000.</div><a name="09061931000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may well be, as a result of the petitions part of the Bill, that local
councils could decide to hold a local poll as part of their substantive
response as required by clause 14, but that is about councils having
the ability to choose a referendum if they feel that it would be the
right thing to
do.</div><a name="09061931000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the petition provisions in chapter 2 of the Bill and the existing
powers in section 116 of the 2003 Act permit councils to hold
referendums, the new clause would require them to do so. We believe
that it is right to give local authorities flexibility, but over and
above that there would be an additional, uncosted burden. Therefore,
the implications for local authorities could be considerable. We
believe that the new clause goes too far in requiring referendums when
there is already a power to hold them. I hope that the Committee will
reject
it.</div><a name="09061931000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000489"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> In the light of what the Minister has said about
the effects of the new clause tabled by her hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester, Blackley&#151;she clearly did not like it very
much&#151;which would require local authorities to have referendums,
we will not seek to press the new clause to a vote, although we have
enjoyed the opportunity to have the debate. I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000490"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are keen to have this debate about the possibility of giving to local
authorities a power of general competence. I hope that it is in order
if, by way of introducing the new clause, I say a few words about the
constitutional framework in which local government is set, and if, in
doing so, I begin by saying that in many ways power has been drawn away
from the Executive in recent years.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>They must not look too surprised, as I will be coming in a few moments
to ways in which they have drawn more power to themselves, but I wanted
to start
there.</div><a name="09061931000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
members of the Executive have in recent years seen some of their powers
move away from them to the European institutions, the new British
institutions&#151;the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the
Northern Ireland Assembly and so on&#151;to quangos, and to the
courts. The movement of those powers to the courts is largely a result
of the impetus that the Human Rights Act 1998 has given to them in
terms of, in effect, making legislation rather than merely interpreting
it. However, the Executive have made up for that in recent years by
drawing more powers to themselves. They have drawn those powers from
the legislature&#151;that has been much debated recently&#151;and,
of course, also from local government.</div>
<a name="09061931000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
point, all parties that have been in government and have also been in
opposition, as we have, must concede that that process has been going
on for a very long time. At least since the war&#151;if not
before&#151;central Government have got into the habit, under our
written constitution, of interfering and directing what local councils
do. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)
recently made a speech in which he drew attention to the many ways in
which that imbalance is now causing severe difficulty at a local
level.</div>
<a name="09061931000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Members of
Parliament, we all know what it is like to have petitions brought to us
about saving wards in a local hospital&#151;that is an experience
that we have been through in Wycombe&#151;or about post office
closures. We also know what it is like to have constituents come to us
to complain about the lack of power that local authorities have in
relation to the siting of phone masts. We all know the degree to which
constituents feel emotions ranging from frustration to rage and how
little power they feel Members of Parliament have. We often hear people
complain, &#147;You can&#146;t do anything. You&#146;re all the
same,&#148; but that now also applies to local councillors. One only
has to read the e-mails and letters in the local newspaper&#146;s
letters column that say, &#147;Members of Parliament and councillors
are all powerless. They can&#146;t do anything and they&#146;re all
the same because real power is vested in Westminster and
Whitehall.&#148; That is where the clause comes
in.</div><a name="09061931000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
local councils can act only when they are empowered to do so by
legislation. If they do not do that, decisions that have been taken
will be struck down by the courts as ultra vires. We are obviously not
proposing&#151;I do not think anyone would&#151;that local councils
should become a new source of legislative authority. Ultimately, there
can only be one source: the Queen in Parliament. However, there is no
reason why not and every reason why Parliament should seek to ensure
that power is distributed as widely as possible. In a democracy, there
must be many sources of power&#151;whether they are the European
institutions in some cases or local institutions.</div>
<a name="09061931000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
would change the presumption in law that local councils really only
have whatever power Parliament decides to give them. The clause seeks
to flip that arrangement round and put on the statute book a measure
that would essentially allow local councils to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>have a general power of competence. It would then be up to Parliament to
set up what they cannot do. We are obviously not suggesting that local
councils should be able to raise
taxation.</div><a name="09061931000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will doubtless argue that the Local Government Act 2000 has
already given local authorities the power to do anything that they
consider is likely to promote or improve the economic, social and
environmental well-being of any part of their area. That is what
Ministers call a power of first resort. The argument against the case
that the Minister will doubtless put to the Committee is that the scope
of the provision in the 2000 Act is not clear and that legal
departments in local authorities&#151;which naturally are very
cautious, as legal departments tend to be&#151;are very wary of using
the powers because of legal
challenge.</div><a name="09061931000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure yet whether we shall press the new clause to a vote. We
want to hear what the Minister has to say about the way in which the
measure is constructed. However, we would like to see on the statute
book in principle, as part of our green paper, a general power of
competence that would allow councils, including town and parish
councils, to carry out any lawful action, undertake any lawful works,
operate any lawful business or enter into any lawful transaction. This
would simply be a way of ensuring that on the statute book the powers
that local councils have&#151;that Ministers argue are now present in
the 2000 Act&#151;are clearly spelled
out.</div><a name="09061931000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000491"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> To the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument for this
power being given to local government, my party would simply reply yes.
We have long advocated greater power for local government. When
considering his remarks and reflecting on the recent history of
Governments of both the Conservative and the Labour persuasion, we
realise that there has been a general tendency to take power in some
forms away from local government and vest it in quangos or unelected
regional authorities&#151;we have had a debate about the desirability
of elected and more accountable regional authorities&#151;on the
basis that certain decisions are best taken at a level that is most
appropriate to them and that that is the best place to air views and
have the
debate.</div><a name="09061931000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could go back somewhat further in history and look at Liberal
Governments getting themselves hung up on questions of devolution.
Famously, several of them foundered over it, particularly with regard
to Ireland, but it is fair to say that our party has always had a
commitment to trying to disperse power and decision making wherever
possible. In the history of this country, that has probably been done
most effectively with local authorities, which do a very good job,
although people often feel, as the hon. Gentleman said, that sometimes
the hands of local decision makers are tied. The new clause would
provide an opportunity to restore more of a balance and allow local
authorities more creativity to come up with more local solutions. That
is also the direction of travel that the Sustainable Communities Act
2007 is moving us in. We would welcome
it.</div><a name="09061931000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also talked about the constitutional framework. Part of
the problem is that in this country we do not have so much a
constitutional framework as a fairly rickety structure that bits have
been bolted and screwed on to and taken off over the years. Perhaps we
can have that wider argument another time, but my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>party believes and always has believed that re-evaluation of the
constitutional position and some form of written constitution is the
right way to go. I am not sure whether the view of the Conservative
party has moved on that subject at all, given that everything seems to
be up for debate at least, if not for the issuing of
policy.</div><a name="09061931000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the chance to debate this issue and we would certainly support
the hon. Gentleman should he seek to press the new
clause.</div><a name="09061931000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000492"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> This is certainly a very important issue and I,
too, welcome the opportunity to debate it, because that also provides
an opportunity to make some general points about the views of local
authorities. As I think hon. Members have said, the well-being power
can be used by local authorities to do anything&#151;with the
exception of raising money or things expressly prohibited by
legislation&#151;that will have an impact on the promotion or
improvement of the social, economic or environmental well-being of
their area. The breadth of the power is such that councils can regard
it as a power of first resort when seeking to improve outcomes for
their communities. It has been especially useful in the current
economic downturn for authorities, because it can be used to respond
quickly to changing circumstances in many areas, to cut through
bureaucracy and get help to people quickly when they need
it.</div><a name="09061931000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09061931000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are, of course, certain limitations to how the power is used, and the
Secretary of State retains the right to intervene if it is not being
used appropriately. The new clause seeks to remove some of those
limitations. For example, the deletion of section 3(1) would mean that
local authorities could use the power to bypass other legislation and
to do things, as I have said, that are currently prohibited or limited
by legislation. Parliament has approved restrictions in specific
legislation that will have been debated in the House, but if there is
legislation that applies undue prohibitions or limitations, or is
outdated, we have the ability to consider whether those limitations are
still appropriate. Under section 5 of the 2000 Act we have the power to
change legislation, and would do in appropriate cases. The deletion of
section 3(2) would allow local authorities to raise money
using the power, for example by imposing charges or taxes. Legislation
exists that allows local authorities to do that within some carefully
constructed
frameworks.</div><a name="09061931000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
deletion of section 3(3), (4) and (4A) would remove the Secretary of
State&#146;s reserve power to prevent the use of the well-being
power. That is a reserve power and has never been used. It cannot be
used lightly, because it is subject to a statutory requirement to
consult, and requires the approval of Parliament via the affirmative
procedure. It is a power of last resort, but one which we should
retain.</div><a name="09061931000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause also inserts new text regarding proposals to devolve more
functions to principal local authorities. It is not exactly clear what
the particular proposals might be, but I assure the Committee that the
devolution of power to local authorities and the empowerment of
communities are constantly under
review.</div><a name="09061931000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that more needs to be done to encourage local authorities to use
the well-being power. I am interested in the points that hon. Gentlemen
have made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>about how local authorities perhaps feel that they do not have the
necessary powers to undertake any particular activities. I am
interested in having discussions with local authorities about which
particular powers they feel they would need more of. I am interested in
entering the debate with the local authorities about what they feel is
particularly lacking under this power, but the new clause goes the
wrong way about having that debate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the new clause, given our clear commitment to discussing with
local authorities what more they feel we could do within existing
legislation.</div><a name="09061931000194"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000493"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The Minister has not persuaded us&#151;at
least, those of us on the Conservative Benches&#151;that she is as
enthusiastic about allowing local authorities to exercise the
competencies as we would like. None the less, she made a good
lawyer&#146;s argument. She did what I think we would do if we were
Ministers, looking at the new clause and arguing that if it came into
effect, this, that and the other would be the consequence, including
the granting to local authorities of tax-raising powers, if I heard her
correctly.</div>
<a name="09061931000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, we will not press the motion to a vote. Ministers are skilful
at putting forward such arguments, and we must take them seriously when

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000494"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="09061931000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following on
from the theme so ably articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe, I rise to speak to new clause 8, which proposes the abolition
of comprehensive area assessments, the unloved twin brother of
comprehensive performance assessments that came into force this
April.</div>
<a name="09061931000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
separate quotes. One is from the 1997 Labour party
manifesto:</div><a name="09061931000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local
decision-making should be less constrained by central government and
also more accountable to local
people.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other is from a 2007 Ministry of Justice Green Paper entitled
&#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, which said after 10 years of
Labour Government
that</div><a name="09061931000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;power
remains too centralised and too concentrated in government
hands&#148;.</div><a name="09061931000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
centralisation of power, particularly the application of sanctions to
local authorities, is now vested in the comprehensive area assessment.
It might be as well to examine the facts behind that.</div>
<a name="09061931000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
councils are subject to a significant inspection regime. That said, the
Government do not keep any central records of the cost of inspections
to local government, but in his inquiry into local government in 2007,
Sir Michael Lyons used an estimate prepared by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>the National Audit Office that said it was about &#163;2
billion a year. Michael Frater, the original head of the Lifting the
Burdens Task Force, stated three years
ago:</div><a name="09061931000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Eighty
per cent. of the costs of the performance regime relate to councils
reporting to central government, not reporting to the community. It
defies all common
sense.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comprehensive area assessment followed best value and the comprehensive
performance assessment, as Committee members know; if nothing else, we
have established during these proceedings that they are avid readers of
&#147;Control Shift&#148;, the Conservative local government
manifesto published this February, and well they might be, as it is a
blueprint of the Conservative Government to come in 10 months&#146;
time.</div>
<a name="09061931000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Control
Shift&#148; made the point that the present inspection regimes are
expensive, bureaucratic and often ineffective, in so far as they put a
premium on procedural performance rather than on the demonstrable
delivery of local public services, which would enhance accountability
to local electors. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe made a
passionate defence of localism in his remarks on referendums. It is
important to realise that what we have seen is not just the accretion
of power to a central unitary state. If I am honest&#151;I hope my
right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon covers his ears at
this point&#151;this did not start on 1 May 1997; I accept that.
However, it has certainly continued at a precipitous
speed.</div>
<a name="09061931000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000495"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman has devoted about 90 per
cent. of his remarks to alleged central control, and only about 10 per
cent. to performance. This debate is about performance assessment.
Would he like to tell the Committee about the evidence of local
government performance over the period of comprehensive performance
assessment, and the comments of people such as Michael Frater, whom he
quoted, who relished the accolade that his authority received for the
excellent service delivery that was achieved when he was chief
executive of Telford and Wrekin council? That recognition is seen by
many in local government as rather better than the performance of
central Government, which has been subject to a somewhat different
performance measurement regime. Would the hon. Gentleman like to
reflect a little on the effectiveness of performance management regimes
in driving up standards of performance?</div>
<a name="09061931000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000496"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s rhetorical
agility demonstrates why, I am sure, he is missed by the Whips. We are
not debating the history of comprehensive performance assessment and
best value. If he wants to reflect on the record and the result of
Government achievement, he might reflect on the 15.7 per cent. of the
popular vote received in a national election two weeks ago&#151;the
lowest ever of a national Government. In my book, that is a realistic
recognition of the Government&#146;s performance so far.</div>
<a name="09061931000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
my point, of course comprehensive performance assessment had its
detractors. It was not all beer and skittles. There were people who
thought that it was not that successful, and that it was not
appropriate to be used in their local authority areas. Comprehensive
area assessment has been with us for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>relatively short period of time and the jury is out. If the right hon.
Gentleman reads the <i class="I">Local Government Chronicle</i>&#151;I am sure
that, as an avid reader, he does&#151;he will know that there is a
plethora of opinions on CAA, regarding both its current performance,
and its future prospects.</div>
<a name="09061931000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000497"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> If the hon. Gentleman has also read into the
subject, he will know that when the comprehensive performance
assessment was introduced in 2001, it was almost universally condemned
by local government spokespeople, who were virtually all against it.
The result of that experience has changed the point of view of a lot of
those people, which is why the hon. Gentleman now describes a more
varied expression of opinion about CPA and CAA. The question that I put
to him earlier, which he has not answered, was about whether he has
thoughts on the performance levels of local government, and how far
that performance has improved as a result of exposure to a performance
management regime.</div>
<a name="09061931000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000498"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I certainly feel that the preponderance of more
people to vote Conservative and to elect Conservative councils in their
area will inevitably drive up performance over the next few years. If
CPA was such a good thing, why did the Government see fit to get rid of
it? I will leave that question hanging in the air.</div>
<a name="09061931000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000499"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that one of the
problems with performance management regimes is that they can, over
time, become so familiar that there is a danger that the participants
learn how to play the system to get high scores, rather than actually
improve performance. It is a genuine problem, and that is why a change
of regime from time to time is often a good measure to try to ensure
that the focus is on raising performance rather than ticking
boxes.</div>
<a name="09061931000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09061931000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000500"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> This feels like a duet with the right hon. Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich. I do not disagree with him on that point,
but I am not persuaded that the new post-April 2009 regime is going to
address the problem. I will come to that
later.</div><a name="09061931000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other key point is the impact on the perception of ratepayers. Of
course, I should call them council tax payers now&#151;perhaps I am
showing my age, having first been elected to a local council in May
1990, which is almost 20 years ago. Overall across the country, public
satisfaction with service delivery has deteriorated. Figures produced
by the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2005 showed that
average dissatisfaction with councils&#146; overall performance
increased by a third over the previous eight years, and that public
satisfaction with the overall performance of local government is low
compared with most other public service providers and has declined in
that time. Satisfaction with the value for money provided by councils
has also decreased.</div>
<a name="09061931000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific point that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
made, we agree that local councils&#146; energy and resources are
often diverted away from the delivery of better front-line services and
incremental improvements over time because of consideration for ticking
a Government box and delivering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>key performance indicators in a top-down culture. That is a classic
example of energy being diverted away from local services to play the
system, as can happen with CAAs. That is why we intend to abolish
them.</div><a name="09061931000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
might be asked, &#147;What are you going to do instead?&#148; We
believe that it is quite permissible for the Audit Commission to have a
more proactive role. Instead of a monolithic, top-down approach
involving inspecting and analysing everything, with its huge indicative
displacement activity costs, it is appropriate for the commission to
work with local authorities to focus specifically on high-risk areas
more proactively and with greater alacrity.</div>
<a name="09061931000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
in the baby P case in Haringey, there was clearly a breakdown in
procedures, lack of leadership and so on. That is an extreme example,
but the Audit Commission could have had an opportunity to assist. It
would not be appropriate in all cases, but we believe that the
commission has the skills, knowledge, experience and expertise to
deliver in that role. The CAA is also a Government initiative that
takes a top-down approach. There may be a degree of consultation now,
and it has worked out practically in some local authorities, but it has
not been successful in
all.</div><a name="09061931000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that there is too much inspection and too much focus on meeting
Government targets. We also believe that there is no evidence that the
plethora of inspection regimes are co-ordinated or working closely
together for the benefit of local council tax payers. On that basis, we
look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and we are minded
to press the new clause to a Division.</div>
<a name="09061931000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000501"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that the Opposition do not press the new
clause to a Division, not least because it is defective. Moving
sections of the Local Government Act 2003 would have no effect on CAAs,
because the legal framework for the CAA is actually in the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. There is a huge
problem if the Opposition press the matter to a Division, because it
will not achieve what they
want.</div><a name="09061931000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, section 152 of the 2007 Act clarifies the Audit
Commission&#146;s existing power to inspect best value
authorities&#146; compliance with their duties under part 1 of the
Local Government Act 1999, and enables the Audit Commission to carry
out general inspections of the performance of best value
authorities.</div><a name="09061931000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
system of assessment for CAA was introduced from April 2009, and
replaces CPA and most other rolling programmes of inspection and
assessment for local authorities and fire and rescue authorities. But
CPA remains relevant to our approach to handling the legacy of freedoms
and flexibilities that were awarded according to category of
performance under CPA. Removing those legal provisions would be
difficult.</div><a name="09061931000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Removing
section 99 of the 2003 Act would remove the Audit Commission's power to
produce reports on the performance of local authorities, and categorise
them according to performance. The new clause would remove that power
from the Audit Commission. With effect from 1 August 2009, such reports
will be undertaken only at the request of the Secretary of State.
Section 100 of the 2003 Act provides that the Secretary of State may
exercise various powers by reference to local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>of a particular categorisation, including the power to allow local
authorities to trade and to allow freedom from statutory requirements
to produce plans or strategies. It would be worrying if that power were
also removed, but that would be the effect of the new
clause.</div><a name="09061931000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
published the consultation paper on 6 May, and we want views on how the
freedoms and flexibilities package for local authorities and fire and
rescue authorities granted under CPA can be treated under CAA,
consistent with the move to providing greater freedom at local level.
We are consulting, and there are problems with the new clause, which
would not achieve what the Opposition believe it would achieve. In
fact, it would achieve the opposite, so I ask the Opposition to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="09061931000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000502"></a>Mr.

right hon. Lady explained to the Committee, I beg to ask leave to

is a pleasure to introduce a clause, the principle of which the
Minister will surely support enthusiastically, because there has been
agreement throughout the House in recent years that the whole target
business has gone too far. If you are ever inclined, Mr.
Illsley, to google local councils&#146; Government targets and press
the button, up will come a whole series of press releases from the
Department for Communities and Local Government. I believe that the one
I saw was from August last year, and it said that the Government had
cut the number of targets from 100 to 35. I would normally presume that
the Minister had no difficulty with this helpful new clause that would
cut the number of targets even further by relating them to the quality
and quantity of front-line services, but the Minister will probably get
to her feet and say that our new clause is defective for various legal
reasons, and encourage us to withdraw it. However, I encourage her to
have a substantive go at the arguments, because there seems to be a
consensus across the House that the whole targets business has gone far
too far, a point that has been conceded not least by Ministers
themselves in recent years and
months.</div><a name="09061931000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000504"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for
Wycombe is, on first reading, an attractive proposition, as it seeks to
give even greater scope to local authorities to determine how they
should be assessed and what their targets should be through the local
area agreements. It would effectively focus on outcomes and state that
they were important and that local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>should be able to decide how they would achieve those national targets.
So long as the national targets are ticked off and achieved, it is up
to local authorities to decide how they will do that, because the
process is not important.</div>
<a name="09061931000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have been trying to think of examples of where it is difficult to
separate out the process from the outcome, and that is the problem for
me. It might be a bit simplistic to say that something is either an
outcome or a process, which is my slight concern with the provision,
but we certainly support the spirit behind it. The hon. Member for
Peterborough referred earlier to the baby P case, and one could argue
that sometimes when achieving targets in terms of outcomes, for example
with vulnerable or looked-after children, there might be elements of
the process in how that is carried out. We probably could not support
the new clause as drafted, but it is a useful debate to
have.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000505"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> May I first assure the hon. Member for
Peterborough that I will say that his clauses are legally defective
only if they are legally defective, because I would not make it up.
With regard to the new clause, I think that it is true to say that
outcome-based targets are already central to the new performance
framework through local area agreements, as was set out in the original
local government White Paper of 2006 and subsequently in statutory
guidance in 2008.</div>
<a name="09061931000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid
that the new clause would lead to significant disruption to the
existing set of local area agreement targets that local partners are
now working together to deliver. It would require us to revise all 152
local area agreements, and I think that the impact on the delivery of
priority outcomes in local areas would be significant, and certainly
not something that local government would welcome, frankly.</div>
<a name="09061931000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
already working to see how we might strengthen the framework further,
including considering the Bichard recommendations on strengthening
local area agreements in the national indicator set. So we think that
it would be premature and potentially counter-productive to pre-empt
that work by making changes such as the one proposed here. I therefore
ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the

battery of legal arguments to hand this time. All that she has told the

though no change brought in by Ministers over the past 10 years has
ever done that. I do not feel that she was at her most persuasive, but
I will not press the new clause. We might return to the matter if we
get an opportunity on Report and perhaps find a way of couching it so
that it would be even less disruptive to local councils. I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000509"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> These clauses, as the Minister will well know
because the information is in the brief, are strongly supported by the
National Association of Local Councils. One might call them the NALC
clauses if it were not even more appropriate to call them the 1894
clauses. I shall explain what I mean by that date.</div>
<a name="09061931000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses relate to payments made by parish and community councils and
charter trustees. The point that NALC wishes to make by supporting them
is that modernisation is needed in relation to payments. It describes
the way in which some councils have to make payments as an anachronism
that merits modernisation. It claims that the problem goes all the way
back to the Local Government Act 1894, arguing that methods of making
payment have not been adequately updated since then, despite the Local
Government Act 1933 and the Local Government Act 1972.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> There was an echo from a
well-informed voice on the other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>side of the Committee&#151;the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich may be able to remember that Act better, I am afraid, than I
do.</div><a name="09061931000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Association of Local Councils makes the simple point that, in
effect, it believes payment by cheque&#151;which is what I presume
was written into the 1894 Act&#151;will be entirely superseded by
payment cards and internet banking within eight years. However, under
the present legislation, such online payments by the local councils and
bodies referred to in the clauses would be unlawful.</div>
<a name="09061931000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
1894 clauses in a nutshell. There may be reasons why the Minister
believes they could be better drafted. NALC, which represents
councillors of all sorts of different points of view, including
councillors from the Minister&#146;s party, says that a serious
problem is rumbling along and gathering pace. The way in which payments
are made in the modern world is changing and NALC says it will be left
exposed legally if it moves to a more up-to-date process than writing
cheques. We look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s comments. She
may be able to persuade us that the Government are preparing to act on
the matter in a different way from that which the new clause
proposes.</div><a name="09061931000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000510"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The hon. Member for Wycombe has done a good
service to the local government community by proposing the new clause.
NALC hoped that some of the issues that were originally in the White
Paper would be addressed in the Bill; the Bill is of a different
nature, so it hoped such matters could be restored to it. Hon. Members
have heard me, in previous debates, express my regard for parish
councils and their work. Sometimes they are neglected. The proposal
would give them greater flexibility as they continue to serve their
communities. I hope the Minister will allow this change, which is
rather long
overdue.</div><a name="09061931000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000511"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I certainly see that there is a case for reform
of the current rules on parish payments, and I agree with many of the
points that Opposition Members made. I have had some discussions with
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich about the
issue because it is something that he feels strongly about,
too.</div>
<a name="09061931000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had some
initial discussions that made good progress. I assure the Committee
that we will continue those discussions, so that we have a properly
worked out plan for change. We will also look for an opportunity in the
legislative programme to put that change on a firm foundation, which I
hope will receive support from all parties.</div>
<a name="09061931000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
further discussions about the issue. However, as I have said, I will
certainly give a commitment that we will look for an appropriate
legislative vehicle to make some of the changes. Having said that, I
hope that the hon. Member for Wycombe will withdraw the new
clause.</div>
<a name="09061931000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000512"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It is obviously not for the official Opposition
to pre-empt whatever NALC may think. However, having heard what the
Minister has said, I imagine that it will find her remarks reassuring.
Therefore, we will not seek to press the new clause to a vote and I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000513"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
now turn to the standards board. It is perhaps worth saying at the
start&#151;</div><a name="09061931000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000514"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I just want to make an announcement:
members of the public are not allowed to take documents from the table.
Those documents are for the members of the Committee. Members of the
public are not allowed to come behind the bar. Thank
you.</div>
<a name="09061931000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000515"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> As I was saying, we now turn to the Standards
Board. We have reflected on the history of the board for the past 10
years or so, since it was introduced, and we have come to the
conclusion that it is a classic illustration of the law of unintended
consequences. No reasonable person could object to the idea that we
should seek to ensure that local councillors conduct their work
according to proper standards. However, in these matters there is
always a danger that the law of unintended consequences applies and we
think that has been proven in this case. Labour Members ought to
consider that point very carefully if anyone anywhere proposes in any
way to apply a similar principle and a similar framework to Members of
Parliament.</div>
<a name="09061931000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain what I mean by the law of unintended consequences. If a process
is established whereby a board is set up to receive complaints but it
happens that under data protection rules, the names of the people
making the complaints cannot be published, the Government are
potentially setting up a considerable problem for local councillors. I
suspect that there will not be a Member of Parliament in this Committee
this afternoon who has not received a complaint from a
councillor&#151;probably a councillor from their own political party
but possibly not&#151;about a case in which that councillor has been
reported to the Standards Board. The councillor does not necessarily
know the name of the person who submitted the complaint. It is
certainly the case with complaints that have been made to me that the
councillor was not even aware of the charges that had been brought
against them, which is surely contrary to natural justice. The process
then flows on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div><a name="09061931000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
presenting the Committee with statistics about the small percentage of
complaints that have been upheld, I seek to draw its attention to
research that has been done by the university of Aberystwyth and others
that points to the difficulty that parish, town and community councils
have in attracting sufficient candidates. Obviously the existence of
the Standards Board will not be the only reason why people do not come
forward as candidates for those councils. However, given that such a
large proportion of the complaints are about parish councillors and
other councillors who operate at that level, the standards board
regime, which is of the nature that I have just described, must have an
effect on the number of people, and perhaps on the quality of people,
who wish to come forward; the university of Aberystwyth certainly
thinks that it does. I urge Ministers and other Labour Members to
consider whether there would be a similar effect on Members of
Parliament were a similar regime introduced at
Westminster.</div><a name="09061931000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000516"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman has not addressed the
crucial issue, which is the impact that the Standards Board may or may
not have had on standards of conduct in local government. He will be
aware that at the time it was established there was widespread concern
about inappropriate behaviour. As an illustration&#151;it is a good
news story&#151;I was judging the <i class="I">L</i><i class="I">ocal
</i><i class="I">G</i><i class="I">overnment</i><i class="I"> Chronicle</i> awards for governance and
standards in local government recently, and I saw a presentation from
an authority that began with an image of a police van with a caption
that
read:</div><a name="09061931000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
was our former leader being taken
away.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tell the story because that local authority went through a traumatic
process because of that particular incident but subsequently improved
its governance and standards, as have many others. I believe that the
existence of a Standards Board has been an important influence. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman, rather than talking about peripheral
consequences, focuses on the crucial issue of the impact of the
Standards Board in helping to drive a culture of high standards in
local
government.</div><a name="09061931000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000517"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I think that people not coming forward to stand
for local government is not a peripheral consequence. I concede to the
right hon. Gentleman that if such a framework&#151;one of his
favourite words&#151;was implemented there would be some good
consequences. The problem is that there would also be some bad ones.
The question is whether the bad ones outweigh the good. The bad ones
outweigh the good for people who are not coming forward and for
councillors who have an accusation made against them without knowing
the nature of the complaint. Is it necessary to drive up standards of
behaviour among councillors by installing the framework in the first
place? The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s answer is &#147;yes&#148;,
our answer is &#147;no&#148;. If local councils are given more
power and responsibility, standards will rise. There are other ways, to
which I shall refer, of ensuring that councillors observe proper
conduct, and that will happen
naturally.</div><a name="09061931000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, in reference to an earlier debate, the right hon. Gentleman
claimed that there was no essential difference between my right hon.
Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and himself&#151;that both
right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>hon. Gentlemen were content for the guiding hand of Government to apply.
I put it to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich that there
is still an essential difference represented in our current discussion.
It is true that occasionally my right hon. Friend feels the odd
Stalinist twitch; he was a Minister and he will get to his feet and,
such is his open and honest nature, he will put his view. In the case
of the right hon. Gentleman, who also has an open and honest
nature&#151;he is very obliging&#151;when he does not agree with
what his Front Bench colleagues say, as with the petition clauses, he
is a bit more discreet than my right hon. Friend, who naturally wants
to share his views with the
Committee.</div><a name="09061931000262"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000518"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am leaving voluntarily, I assure
you.</div><a name="09061931000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000519"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Perhaps that explains the nature of much of our
debate over the past few days. Before I wander too far from the
Standards Board, I say to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich that there are other means of ensuring that councillors
observe standards than inventing this new bureaucracy, putting it into
effect and leaving it to the law of unintended
consequences</div><a name="09061931000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000520"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> It is possible for both parties to be right in an
argument. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich makes a good
point in saying that we need to drive up standards. It is also the case
that many of us will know extremely good councillors who have been
subject to what are quite frankly malicious complaints and have had
cases drag on for months, destabilising their work and causing them a
huge amount of personal and emotional difficulty; it is a question of
balance.</div><a name="09061931000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000521"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> That is right. It is about whether the good
outweighs the bad. Looking at the Standards Board as a whole, I am
willing to concede to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
and say that it has some of the effects that he has described. It also
has the effect that my right hon. Friend described and which many
members of the Committee will have experienced at first
hand.</div><a name="09061931000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000522"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Speaking from eight years&#146; experience as a
London borough councillor, another result of the imposition of the
Standards Board is that it has corroded the relationship between
professional officers and councillors, particularly in respect of
complaints about councillors. It has also entrenched an inequality,
because for quite minor, vexatious reasons, such as getting into an
argument with an officer, which 10 years ago would have been put down
to experience&#151;those involved would have shaken
hands&#151;people can now end up in front of the Standards Board,
whereas such behaviour from officers is not necessarily subject to such
a
recourse.</div><a name="09061931000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000523"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> My hon. Friend is showing me up, because I have
not had the experience, as he has, of being a local councillor.
Naturally, I maintain close relations with councillors in my
constituency, several of whom have complained to me about the Standards
Board and related stories not dissimilar to the one related by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon a moment ago. My hon.
Friend is right.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div><a name="09061931000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">A framework is
in place already, as the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
said. District auditors are responsible for investigating financial
impropriety, the police are there for criminal cases and the courts
deal with civil cases. In the balance of things, the Standards Board
has not been a force for good. We will listen carefully to what the
Minister says, but on balance we are prepared, if necessary, to press
the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09061931000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000524"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As the hon. Member for Wycombe said, the
amendment would abolish the Standards Board for England. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made an important point
that I think the hon. Gentleman accepted: local authority standards
committees look to the Standards Board for advice and guidance,
training and direction. They would be cut adrift if the Standards Board
were
abolished.</div><a name="09061931000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Standards Board was established in 2001 as the body responsible for
investigating alleged misconduct by councillors. In 2008 we devolved
the conduct regime for local authority members to local authorities.
The local authorities are best placed to ensure that their members meet
the high standards of conduct, which those who voted for them rightly
and reasonably
expect.</div><a name="09061931000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the regime was devolved, the role of the Standards Board for England
was changed to that of a strategic regulator for local authority
standards committees, providing those committees and local authority
officers with the tools, training and guidance that they need to
enforce the often robust conduct regime in local authorities. The
Standards Board is an indispensable part of the conduct regime for
local authority members, in respect of the relationship between the
central advice, guidance, and so on, and how the local authorities
carry out their
functions.</div><a name="09061931000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Standards Board also monitors the performance of local authority
standards committees. If it believes that a local authority regime is
failing or if it is invited in by a local authority, it has the power
to assume the business of that local authority&#146;s standards
committee until it is put back on
track.</div><a name="09061931000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Standards Board can also investigate the most serious allegations of
breaches of the conduct regime, and it has accumulated a wealth of
experience and expertise in investigating very complex cases. Sometimes
local authorities prefer to refer cases to the Standards Board either
because of their complexity or because the issues involved mean that
local investigation would not be the preferred option.</div>
<a name="09061931000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would also abolish the adjudication panel for England, which
performs two important functions. First, it is where the most serious
findings of a breach of the code of conduct by a councillor are
referred for a determination of sanction by the Standards Board. The
adjudication panel has the power to determine a suitable sanction, from
censure to the suspension of a councillor from office for up to five
years. We do not consider it appropriate that a local authority
standards committee has such power of censure, although they may
suspend a councillor for up to six months. It is not right for one
local authority to ban a person from becoming a member of any other
local authority for up to five years. Secondly, the adjudication panel
is the body to which a councillor may appeal if he or she considers the
finding of their own local authority standards committee to be
unfair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div><a name="09061931000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to take this opportunity to clarify  an issue that occupied
several hon. Members on Second Reading, which is the issue
of predisposition, predetermination and bias, particularly in planning.
When we revised the code of conduct for councillors into
its current form in 2007, one of the major issues
that we successfully addressed was ensuring that councillors with a
personal or even a prejudicial interest in an issue are still able to
represent the views of their constituents, even if, in cases in which
there is a prejudicial interest, they are unable to vote on the
matter.</div><a name="09061931000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Standards Board has issued very clear guidance on predisposition,
predetermination and bias and the code of conduct. The conduct regime
recognises that it is quite proper for a councillor to show
predisposition; indeed, a councillor may be elected because of his or
her opposition to, or support for, a single issue. However, there is a
world of difference between predisposition and
predetermination.</div>
<a name="09061931000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">A councillor
should have an open mind to the merits of an argument before making
their final decision at the council meeting. In matters of planning,
that can be particularly sensitive, but the guidance issued by the
Standards Board is clear. Councillors can involve themselves in
discussions with developers, their constituents and others about
planning matters. Their ability to do that is greatly enhanced, and
their position protected, if they adopt the general hints suggested by
the Standards Board. The Standards Board also provides training
material on its website for local authorities that wish to address the
issue of councillors and planning and the conduct regime. That is the
Standards Board fulfilling its function as a strategic regulator. I
understand that that was a matter that was debated on Second Reading,
and it is important to clarify the
position.</div><a name="09061931000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000525"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Minister has explained in detail
particular sensitivities around planning. One thing has emerged in
recent years since the change in advice to local authority members on
what they can and cannot say in public prior to the determination.
Although it is entirely justified to say that someone should not take a
decision before they have seen all the evidence at a meeting, the
problem is that they are not even allowed to express an opinion about
how they are feeling at the time, prior to seeing any other evidence.
In most decision processes, we might be of an opinion, we are able to
express that opinion and we retain the freedom to change our mind when
all the facts are put in front of us. I am sure the Minister has done
that in Committee, not this one perhaps, but in other Committees. She
sees what I am trying to say. That is the problem. People are not able
to express any opinions in public prior to determination in
committee.</div><a name="09061931000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000526"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that what I said clarifies everything in
terms of predisposition, predetermination and opinions.</div>
<a name="09061931000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Standards
Board and the adjudication panel, particularly in the light of changes
that have occurred recently, are an important tool to ensure that local
authorities have support in what they try to carry out in terms of
conduct of members. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
new
clause.</div><a name="09061931000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000527"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> What the Minister had to say about
predetermination and predisposition was so interesting it almost took
my mind off the broader issue of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>Standards Board. In plain English, what she was saying was that
predisposition was basically fine, but one must not reach a definite
judgment or a predetermination, or a prejudgment. I am sorry to stumble
over my words, but it is hard to represent accurately in plain English
what emerges so beautifully from seamless civil service
prose.</div>
<a name="09061931000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the new clause, no doubt there is a danger of the official Opposition
getting into a bad habit of not pressing new clauses to the vote, just
as there can be a danger of getting into a habit of calling Divisions.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I just wanted to see whether

That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will know that I have a specific constituency interest that
causes me to table this new clause. I have been remiss in not drawing
attention to an entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. I
am a director of a company that supplies software and services to local
government, among other things. As far as I am aware, nothing I have
said and nothing I will say has any bearing on its business or was
influenced by it. For the sake of propriety, I should put it on the
record that I am a director of that
company.</div><a name="09061931000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
constituency interest is a specific issue that I believe has general
implications for every member of the Committee and every Member of the
House of Commons, and that is highly relevant to the desirable aims of
the Bill. Let me outline the specific case. The Milton Keynes and south
midlands spatial strategy covers a region, as its name suggests, from
Milton Keynes down to Luton and Bedfordshire, but not Hertfordshire. A
consultation was carried out on that spatial strategy throughout the
area of the south midlands, but not in Hertfordshire. No one in
Hertfordshire was
consulted.</div><a name="09061931000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
agreement on that was reached, preferred options were drawn up for
building homes, all of them initially within the area of the south
midlands, Luton and south Bedfordshire, including a number of locations
west of Luton. None of the initial preferred options was in
Hertfordshire. Of course, once indications of the likely preferred
options had been made public, local opposition arose in the west and
the south of
Luton.</div><a name="09061931000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Councillors
looked around for something else to do that would avoid opposition.
They discovered a loophole in the law, which would enable them to
propose a preferred option not in their own spatial area, but in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>north Hertfordshire&#151;in Lilley Bottom, which has caused some
amusement to the Committee already. It is a particularly beautiful area
of my
constituency.</div><a name="09061931000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09061931000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
residents of Luton and south Bedfordshire were consulted about that,
but not those of Hertfordshire until there were protests, after which
some mock consultation was held in my area. There were even discussions
between Luton borough council, the council in south Bedfordshire, the
Department for Communities and Local Government and the developer,
Bloor Homes, about how they would go about building in my constituency,
but with no representation from north Hertfordshire or Hertfordshire
county council at that meeting. Then, a preferred options summary
document was
published.</div><a name="09061931000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to a constituent of mine, Mr. Christopher
Whetnall, who has done a thorough analysis of the matter. He discovered
that in that document assertions were repeatedly made such as that
the</div><a name="09061931000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;strategic
urban extension to the east of the main
conurbation&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061931000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
extension of Luton into north
Hertfordshire&#151;</div><a name="09061931000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
also be planned for... by North Hertfordshire District
Council.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">But
North Hertfordshire district council denies that absolutely&#151;it
is completely opposed to the proposal and has no intention to plan for
it. However, in several places in the document issued by Luton and
south Bedfordshire, it is stated that it is intending to do
so.</div><a name="09061931000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document drawn up for the spatial strategy looks at designating areas
as green belts and areas of local natural beauty and specific landscape
value, but only in their areas. When a map was published of where it
was intended to build, including areas of north Hertfordshire, it was
not shown as green belt, let alone an area of great local natural
beauty. The councillors&#146; own consultants said
critically:</div>
<a name="09061931000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the high sensitivity of this
landscape&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061931000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

Bottom&#151;</div><a name="09061931000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;development
is not
recommended.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
none the less ploughed ahead because they were proposing to build in an
area where it does not matter what the local residents think, as they
are not able to vote for or against the councillors in Luton or south
Bedfordshire.</div><a name="09061931000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imagine
the sense of outrage and incomprehension among my constituents that
that is remotely possible. Indeed, I invite hon. Members to imagine
that sense if such a proposal were to affect their constituencies, with
a neighbouring council proposing to build in their area without proper
consultation, any representation or any responsibility for the feelings
of those most directly
affected.</div><a name="09061931000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
raises general issues. There is manifestly a loophole in the law.
Parliament did not sit around and think, &#147;We should allow one
council to propose meeting its housing targets by building in the area
of another.&#148; We did not rule it out simply because we did not
think it would ever happen. It is a loophole that needs to be closed.
It is also wholly contrary to the spirit of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061931000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not welcomed large chunks of the Bill, but the spirit of
it&#151;to encourage local democracy&#151;is one that can flourish
only if the local representatives are accountable to those whose
interests they serve and affect. If they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>are serving one lot of residents by affecting those in another area who
are unable to vote for or against them, that is the antithesis of
democracy&#151;one cannot have democracy without accountability. I
therefore urge members of the Committee to consider the proposal
favourably. It would simply close the loophole that exists
unintentionally in the planning laws before it affects their
constituencies.</div><a name="09061931000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
hon. Members fail to close the loophole and the same thing happens to
them, they will rue the day. When I raised the matter on Second
Reading, it was clear that other councils were beginning to get wind of
it and the same sort of thing was being mooted, considered or pursued
actively in other areas of the
country.</div><a name="09061931000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
counter-argument was put by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin
Hopkins). Needless to say, his constituency does not abut mine. Mine
abuts Luton, South. He said that it was impossible to build in the
Luton area and meet its target, and that building should be allowed
elsewhere. The housing targets set for each area are a reflection not
only of the needs of the residents, but of the scope for building in
the area. If that is not the case, it ought to
be.</div><a name="09061931000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
council should be set only a target that is realistic, given the amount
of unbuilt area or scope for infill development. It is clear that
housing could have been built in the area because sites within it were
identified initially that could take the required number of houses to
be built. Indeed, there is a further site south-west of Luton where a
developer has a plan to build. He has protested that he cannot get
proper consideration by Luton and south Bedfordshire because they want
go ahead and build in Hertfordshire, and not even consider what he is
proposing.</div><a name="09061931000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well,
I am not proposing the reverse of what Luton is doing to me and saying
that it is the right area. I am not an elected representative for Luton
or south Bedfordshire. I leave it to them to decide the least bad areas
in their districts in which to build houses, but they certainly ought
to consider proposals that affect their own areas before they even
dream of predatory development in other council
areas.</div><a name="09061931000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second argument put by the hon. Member for Luton, North is that Luton
is an urban area that ought to be allowed to expand, and that there
were economies of scale so that it should have planning power over the
peripheral areas. That might be the case, but it does not have such
responsibility. Its boundaries have not been increased. If it wants to
bring about a change in its boundaries, it should seek to do so through
whatever procedures exist for changing local government boundaries. It
should not try to use a loophole in the law to get round this. So far,
Parliament has not decided that Luton ought to be an area of massive
expansion and given free rein and jurisdiction over a wider area than
it already has responsibility
for.</div><a name="09061931000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third argument is that matters still depend on the planning
authorities. Luton and its chosen developers can make an application to
build many thousands of houses in Lilley Bottom, but that will have to
be considered by the planning authority, which is North Hertfordshire
district council. It has been somewhat constrained in what it can say
for the very reasons that we discussed  in the debate on the
previous clause, but it has made matters absolutely clear. I predict
that it will turn  the application down. If Luton chooses to
persist, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>matter will go to a planning inquiry and a planning inspector will be
faced with something that is designated by a local authority that has
some presumption in its favour&#151;not, admittedly, the local
authority in which the location resides, but it seems unfair that that
should be the
case.</div><a name="09061931000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whereas
I by no means think that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, I shall
fight tooth and nail during the initial planning process in north
Hertfordshire, and if it goes to a planning inquiry, I shall say that
that is absolutely the wrong area in which to build extra houses. Even
if the target for house building in north Hertfordshire were to be
raised and some of the target from Luton transferred to north
Hertfordshire, we would not build there because it is a particularly
beautiful area of green belt. It provides an area that is of great
benefit to the residents of Luton and Hitchin, which they value. One
thing that the residents of Hitchin and Luton have in common is that
they want to remain separate from each
other.</div><a name="09061931000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge the Minister to look at the new clause positively. I have raised
this issue in our debates on a number of clauses, where appropriate,
but so far no hon. Member has sought to defend the loophole. If it is
not closed, the process may proliferate nationwide. It is clearly
absurd that, in extremis, north Hertfordshire could meet its housing
target by proposing to build in Northumberland. I frequently get
letters from my constituents asking, &#147;Why are we building in
Hertfordshire, which is already the most densely populated county in
the country, when we should be building in less populated areas in the
north?&#148; The same could apply to Cornwall. The hon. Members for
North Cornwall and for Falmouth and Camborne will be relieved to know
that my constituents do not mention Cornwall, but it might occur to
them.</div>
<a name="09061931000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely, we
will end up with anarchy. One thing that the Bill seeks to do is to
promote orderly co-operation between councils, rather than conflict and
disputes. The new clause would prevent such conflict and dispute by
removing the loophole. I hope that the Minister will reflect the
undoubted will of the whole Committee that the loophole should be
closed. If there are any legal uncertainties about it, we can always
revise it on
Report.</div><a name="09061931000310"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000529"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I shall be brief, but I shall disappoint the
right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden by saying that I hope that
the Minister will not accept the new clause, which is misconceived and
inappropriate.</div><a name="09061931000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not talk about the individual circumstances in the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency, and I have no reason to dispute his
concern about them, but I note the tone of hostility to housing
development that one has grown accustomed to hearing from many
Conservative quarters. I reflect only on the fact that we have a
serious housing shortage and that if we are not serious about providing
new housing to meet people&#146;s needs, we will continue to face
serious problems of homelessness and people living in squalid
conditions, which is not acceptable in a modern society.</div>
<a name="09061931000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I object to
the new clause because it is prescriptive and because it would prohibit
the very co-operation between local authorities that the right hon.
Gentleman says he wants to encourage. It is clearly inappropriate to
prevent one local authority, with the agreement of another, from doing
a housing development that crosses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>the border between the two. I represent a constituency in a fairly
densely occupied urban area where we have housing developments that
cross borders. Indeed, people are sometimes confused as to whether they
are renting from Lewisham or Greenwich council. It would be absurd to
say that there could not be an agreement whereby a development done by
one of those councils impinged in some way on the other&#146;s
area.</div>
<a name="09061931000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
conscious of the efforts that have been made to help people to move to
other areas through new towns and other provision in seaside locations
to which elderly people can retire. Prohibiting such provision would be
completely inappropriate. Of course, we want
co-operation.</div><a name="09061931000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000530"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. If
he will support my new clause now, I will support further modification
on Report saying, &#147;Except by agreement of the councils
concerned.&#148;</div><a name="09061931000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000531"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> If the right hon. Gentleman tables such an
amendment on Report, I will consider it a lot more sympathetically, but
I could not possibly support the new clause now because I regard it as
inappropriate for the reasons I have
explained.</div><a name="09061931000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000532"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy for what the
right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden says about his
constituents. They must be mystified that such a planning process can
be under way for the area where they live, and that decisions are being
taken over well-established borders. That is a real problem. I accept
the point that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made,
because, as we have discussed, local authorities should be able to come
together and present solutions, so perhaps the measure is not quite
right. We are certainly sympathetic to the views expressed by the right
hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, and I am sure that his
constituents would expect better from the planning
process.</div><a name="09061931000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
spent several years living in the borough of Bedford&#151;not quite
Luton&#151;and my wife taught very close to Hitchin in a place called
Stotfold, just over the border in Bedfordshire. I know the area quite
well and I am sure that residents have more in common than the right
hon. Gentleman implied, even in Hertfordshire. I am sure, too, that
they get on far better than was suggested. Issues such as this do not
help the process, so if we can resolve it in some way, all to the
good.</div><a name="09061931000411"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000533"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I want to start by saying that it is difficult
to comment on the proposals that the right hon. Member for Hitchin and
Harpenden referred to, because I understand that the respective local
authorities are still at the stage of making proposals that have yet to
be tested by inspectors. I support all the comments made by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, and I want to
reassure the right hon. Gentleman that, as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Wentworth said on Second Reading, it is not the loophole
that he talks about.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="09061931000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities have no powers to require another local authority to
accommodate housing numbers that have been allocated to them. As I have
said, our policy is that local authorities should accommodate the level
of housing identified for their area in the regional strategy. We
support councils working together, even to the extent of preparing
joint plans and initiatives, so that they decide between them how best
to accommodate their respective housing needs across a sub-regional
area. But they cannot simply require another local authority to
accommodate the numbers of houses that have been allocated to them.
Where local authorities disagree, there is a role for an independent
inspector to make a decision on their proposals, based on the evidence
available and policy set out in the regional strategy and by the
Government. The proposed new clause is unnecessary and I urge the right
hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09061931000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000534"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> The point is not that I am saying one council can
&#147;require&#148; another. Councils can make an
application&#151;they should not be allowed to&#151;for planning
and that will then have their endorsement when it goes to an inspector.
What I would like is an assurance that if they did go ahead with any
such proposal, and it was granted, the houses that they built in
another district area would not count towards their target, which has
been set for their area. The Minister did not make that
clear.</div>
<a name="09061931000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000535"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As I have said, the point of the amendment
would, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
said, prevent authorities joining together, but they cannot simply
require another authority to build in their area. I suggest I look at
the record relating to the question that the right hon. Gentleman asked
and I will write to him to clarify the
position.</div>
<a name="09061931000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000536"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> Can I not bring it back on Report

<a name="09061931000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000537"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Voting on a new clause and an amendment in
Committee does not prevent the same clause or amendment being re-tabled
on Report. But when Mr. Speaker selects amendments on
Report, the amount of time given to the clause or the amendment in
Committee will be taken into account. For example, if the Committee had
had quite a substantial debate on an amendment or a new clause, that
would be taken into account by Mr. Speaker, who might judge
that sufficient debate had been had on that particular section of the
Bill. Voting on it now is not an absolute bar to raising the new clause
on Report, but it may be advantageous not to vote now as it could allow
more time for it on Report. It is entirely up to the hon. Gentleman.
That is not particularly good guidance, but this is an awkward
situation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000538"></a>Mr.

25 years in the House, it is the first time that I have proposed a new
clause in Committee, other than a Government new clause. I shall
therefore follow your advice, Mr. Illsley, and not press the
new clause to a vote. I shall table a similar clause on Report, but one
that meets the objections that have been expressed today. I beg to ask

Rogerson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause was tabled by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne,
Central (Jim Cousins), who is not a member of the Committee. I was
contacted this morning by Newcastle city council and told that
councillors wished to raise a crucial question by way of this new
clause. Current legal provisions allow for certain rights to be passed
on to male children but not female children. The new clause also draws
attention to the fact that it matters whether those children were born
prior to someone becoming a freeman or after. The council says that
those are crucial questions of equality. I am happy to raise them
today, as this may be the only opportunity to do so in the foreseeable
future.</div>
<a name="09061931000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something in
the new clause struck me as interesting. I am not familiar with such
arrangements, not having spent a great deal of my life in cities, but
these rights seem to be hereditary. I am used to things such as the
honorary freedom of a borough, which is usually given to regiments or
RAF squadrons and certain notable individuals who have made a big
contribution to the community. We spoke about honorary positions
earlier, but did not dwell on them. We passed over the
matter.</div>
<a name="09061931000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am keen to
discover why those offices are hereditary, as society seems to have
moved away from such things. Indeed, I hope that we will soon move away
from that in the other place. I want to know what the law is, and why
it might be a problem in places such as Newcastle. I note that the hon.
Member in whose name the new clause is tabled is a Newcastle

that Newcastle city council wanted this matter to be debated, and
approached the Member of Parliament in whose name the new clause was
tabled. However, it was too late to be considered as an amendment to
clause 27, which would have been appropriate. In order to have the
matter debated, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim
Cousins) tabled it as a new clause. The advice that I gave to the right
hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden applies here as well. I ask the
Committee to tread carefully in case the hon. Gentleman wishes to table
the same amendment on Report, so that he can have the opportunity to
speak on behalf of his constituency.</div>

place by Lord Graham. In our view, it meets the aims of the new clause
in a more sustainable way. I shall give a bit of background, by way of
diversion. If the hon. Member for North Cornwall has any other
questions, he can write to

decide what is selected on Report. I would not want to curtail or
stifle debate here, if Members wish to debate the new
clause.</div><a name="09061931000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000545"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Perhaps a discussion between the hon. Member
for North Cornwall and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon
Tyne, Central would be helpful, because I am advised that clause 27
meets many of the new clause&#146;s aims
and&#151;crucially&#151;in a more sustainable way. I know that he
likes that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000547"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061931000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I shall not detain the Committee for too long. The hon. Member for
Peterborough raised the issues covered by new clause 22, which would
protect those at the end of the chain who carry out work on a
construction project. It would try to prevent contractors higher up the
money-supply chain from withholding payment because of an insolvency
somewhere along that chain&#151;in particular, at the top of it. As
he has raised this issue already, I shall merely say that that problem
remains to be resolved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div><a name="09061931000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000548"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We return to the point raised by the hon.
Member for Peterborough. The new clause would protect firms from the
effects of insolvency elsewhere in the supply chain, which is, of
course, a laudable aim. However, we must ensure that, when trying to
protect some businesses, we do not disadvantage others. That would be
the case in the construction industry as in any other. Of course, the
construction industry is facing difficulties in the economic downturn,
but so are other sectors.</div>
<a name="09061931000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause suggests that we delete the insolvency exception to the
prohibition of the &#147;pay when paid&#148; clauses. The
construction industry is unique in that such clauses are prohibited by
statute, and that exception is in place for a good reason. It continues
to allow construction firms the same protection from the risks of an
insolvency as businesses in other industries. It is important to
maintain that level playing field. We need to be careful that we do not
create a situation for construction insolvencies different from that
for other businesses. Preventing construction firms from using
&#147;pay when paid&#148; clauses in insolvency situations would do
that.</div>
<a name="09061931000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consulted the industry extensively on whether a better solution could
be found than the compromise one in the Housing Grants, Construction
and Regeneration Act 1996&#151;a solution that would deliver a fairer
result for all&#151;but no clear evidence was found that the removal
of the current insolvency exception would achieve that. In those
circumstances, the sensible option is to maintain the status quo. I
therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his new
clause.</div><a name="09061931000412"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000549"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I merely note that the type of people at the end
of the chain&#151;the smaller contractors&#151;are probably more
exposed and at risk than some of the larger businesses higher up. That
is the potential problem. Larger businesses may well be able to look at
the finances and absorb costs in a different way from some of the small
contractors at the bottom of the chain. For that reason, they deserve a
little more protection than they are currently afforded, so I shall

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000564"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> May I take this opportunity, Mr.
Illsley, to thank you and Mr. Amess for conducting
proceedings in Committee with firmness but fairness and
allowing a wide-ranging and probing debate. I also thank the
Clerk of the Committee, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the policemen,
the attendants and those who have witnessed our
proceedings&#151;on some occasions, I know, spellbound by the quality
of the debate. I also thank my officials from the Department
for doing an excellent job in briefing two fairly new Ministers and, I
hope, in being helpful to other Committee members where
necessary.</div><a name="09061931000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank all members of the Committee, but particularly the Government
Whip, who has done an excellent job keeping us in order, and my hon.
Friend the Exchequer Secretary, who has stayed with us right until the
end. I want to say what a pleasure it has been working with
her&#151;albeit for a rather shorter time than we perhaps had in mind
last week. There has been a great deal of expertise on the Committee.
We have been lucky to have a number of right hon. and hon. Members who
have either direct local government experience or experience as Local
Government Ministers. That has helped us to give proper scrutiny to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061931000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as thanking Labour Members, I want to thank the Opposition Front
Benchers for their probing amendments and debate. In the end, we have a
very good Bill that will empower people to shape their local
communities, help local and regional economies through the immediate
difficulties and create robust local, regional and national economies
for the future. Thank you, Mr. Illsley. I support the
proposal to report the Bill to the
House.</div><a name="09061931000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000565"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It would be wrong of the official Opposition not
to thank you, Mr. Illsley, and Mr. Amess for the
way in which you have chaired proceedings. We hope that you have
enjoyed them as much as the rest of us. It has been a somewhat
uncertain process: we have not always been certain at what time we will
start on Tuesday mornings; we have not always been certain whether
Ministers and Government Members would be able to make use of the lift,
but they have somehow managed; and we have not always been certain
which Minister we would find
here.</div><a name="09061931000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new Exchequer Secretary must wake up each morning wondering which
Ministry she is in. The logical destination for her is the Foreign
Office, so that she can wake up wondering which country she is
in&#151;like some former American Presidents. I thank the Minister
for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination for the way in
which she has conducted herself during the proceedings. She has felt
her way into the Bill. We obviously do not think as much of it as she
does, and we will return to that theme on Report.</div>
<a name="09061931000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
enjoyed the contributions from the Liberal Democrats, with whom we
found we agreed on many occasions, although not always. We thank the
police and other
attendants.</div><a name="09061931000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
close by thanking those two stalwarts of the Committee, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and
Woolwich.</div><a name="09061931000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000566"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The mastodons done
good!</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div><a name="09061931000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000567"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It has been an education and a pleasure listening
to the mastodons on occasion. Without meaning to be impertinent, but
perhaps being a little less serious, if I were to wake up in the
morning and find myself reading in the public print that the two
intended to contract a civil partnership, I would not be altogether
surprised, although I would be surprised not to have received an
invitation.</div><a name="09061931000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000568"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> It has been a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Illsley, and that of Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="09061931000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
behalf of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall, I
thank the Ministers for taking on the brief so quickly and for handing
it on in the process of debating the Bill. I wonder whether there will
be any changes in the Ministers on Report. Who knows? I thank the
officials for giving the Ministers such inspiration so rapidly and for
responding to many of the queries that we
raised.</div><a name="09061931000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
pay tribute to the other hon. Members to whom we have had the
opportunity to listen. The hon. Member for Wycombe said that we agreed
in most part. However,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>at no point did my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall or I feel
the need to confess to or suppress any Stalinist urges. We would
perhaps be better characterised by our Penhaligon roots in our
campaigning for Cornwall and the power of the
people.</div><a name="09061931000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had the opportunity to debate some of the many and varied issues
raised by the Bill. Some of our concerns have been satisfied, but there
is plenty of meat still to debate on
Report.</div><a name="09061931000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061931000569"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank hon. Members for their comments, which I
will relate to my co-Chairman. I add my thanks to the Clerk, the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the attendants and the police for their
assistance to
me.</div><a name="09061931000381"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put and agreed
to.</i></div><a name="09061931000382"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill,

reported.</i></div><a name="09061931000413"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.54
