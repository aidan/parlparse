</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed I have two announcements. First, there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. Secondly, I remind members of the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule neither I nor Miss Widdecombe intend to call starred amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Police Authority for Northern Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 1, line 8, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (discrimination by public authorities) shall apply to the Police Authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 16, in clause 2, page 1, line 10, leave out `the' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an impartial, efficient and effective'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 18, in clause 2, page 1, line 18, after `is' insert `impartial,'.
<P>
No. 26, in clause 2, page 1, line 18, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and free from political interference and direction in the discharge of its duties'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 54.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As I said at our previous sitting, I am aware of concerns about the issue of the impartiality of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That awareness is in the context of the amendments to clause 2 that hon. Members have tabled; I suggested that I would consider ways of arriving at a different, more all-encompassing way of dealing with the matter, taking account of the issues that have given rise to the amendments. That is the purpose of Government amendments Nos. 52 and 54.
<P>
As hon. Members know, the Government intend to issue a statement of policing principles, to include reference to impartiality. Copies of the guiding principles were sent yesterday to all members of the Committee, but more are available this morning for any hon. Members who have not yet received them. The guiding principles are not set in stone; the document is a draft and hon. Members will have a chance to consider them in more detail under clause 37.
<P>
They have been sent out in good time for that purpose. However, because of our present concern with the overall matter of impartiality, I thought it important to distribute them. We would welcome hon Members' views on them.
<P>
It appears that amendments No. 16, 18 and 26 are intended to put beyond doubt police officers' duty to uphold the rule of law fairly and even-handedly. No one could disagree with that aim. It is worth pointing out that the fair employment, equal opportunities and race relations legislation already applies to the Royal Ulster Constabulary and to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. The provisions deal with the way in which the relevant organisations operate their employment practices. Our debate this morning is about how the organisations relate to the wider community in the discharge of their functions.
<P>
Hon. Members want the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be impartial in political and religious terms. That can best be achieved by applying section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 both to the authority and to officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve.
<P>
It might be helpful if I set out what section 19 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be unlawful for a Minister of the Crown, a member of the Northern Ireland Executive or other person appointed under section 8 above, the Post Office and any authority or body listed in Schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 or Schedule 1 to the Commissioner for Complaints Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 to discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate, in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the ground of religious belief or political opinion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The section continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The obligation to comply with subsection (1) above is a duty owed to any person who may be adversely affected by a contravention of that subsection, and any breach of that duty is actionable in Northern Ireland accordingly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand and support the principle of what Opposition Members are seeking to achieve by their amendments. However, section 19 already takes the concerns of the amendments into account and will move us forward constructively. If we proceed with amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 26, we would accomplish less of what is intended by them. That is why I have tabled Government amendments Nos. 52 and 54 to build section 19 into the Bill.
<P>
Section 19 is already a long-established and robust piece of legislation which enables individuals to seek redress through the courts. It is, however, far from certain that a broad requirement for the police to be ``impartial'' would be enforceable through the courts. The difference is between a tried and tested legal provision and testing out the concept of impartiality. There is also the possibility that that concept would fetter a constable's discretion to treat different individuals appropriately and sensitivity.
<P>
Acting impartially means treating everyone the same, regardless of other factors, for the same offence. Thus the first time offender of previous good character must be treated exactly the same as the habitual criminal. Such requirements do not serve the needs of natural justice or of society.
<P>
A good example would be an elderly person of confused mind who faces a shoplifting charge, as compared with a hardened criminal who is an organised shoplifter. If impartiality were applied, both those people would have to be treated the same. That is why the amendments' concept of impartiality would achieve a lesser result than section 19.
<P>
Section 19 will make a constable accountable to the law only where he or she treats people differently for the wrong reasons--discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. That is why this is the best way to legislate.
<P>
Let me now turn to why I think section 19 should apply to the Police Authority. The authority has a clear duty not to discriminate on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion--no one can dispute that. That is because it has a key role in representing the community and holding the Chief Constable to account.
<P>
The provision will oblige the authority to take account of the views of all relevant bodies and individuals in determining its objectives, and in holding the Chief Constable to account for his operational decisions. Importantly, it will also provide a clear avenue of redress through the courts to anyone who feels that either the RUC or the Police Authority has failed to live up to its obligations.
<P>
I have set out the basis of the Government amendments--robust and proven legislation in the form of section 19. That will put in place the mechanisms that the Opposition are trying to achieve through their amendments, and it will put them on a stronger footing, although it does so in a slightly different way. It also imposes a duty on the Police Authority, and I have set out the reasons why it is important that the Police Authority is conditioned by the same legislation as the RUC. Accordingly, I recommend Government amendments Nos. 52 and 54 to members of the Committee and ask them not to support amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I hope that the Committee will forgive me this morning; I have something like a frog in my throat. I just hope that I last the course.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has faced the main import of amendments Nos. 16 and 18, which stand in my name. I listened carefully to what he said and I see no problem with accepting those recommendations and both Government amendments. 
<P>
However, the problem remains that people interpret legislation largely according to the way in which they understand the words in the Bill. It would therefore not be impossible to accept my amendments as well as the Government amendments. Clearly the advice that the Minister has been given is that it is easier in the courts to test the notion of impartiality via the Government amendments invoking section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. I do not doubt that. I am not a lawyer, so I am not in a position to question it. I am sure that the Minister's advice is appropriate and correct.
<P>
At our previous sitting I referred to the activity that had taken place in relation to reform of policing in Northern Ireland. The notion of impartiality is a common thread in almost every publication and consultation of the past four or five years. It goes without saying that everyone in our society assumes that our police will be impartial, but in Northern Ireland we are dealing with a divided community and it is important to state clearly in the Bill that impartiality is a duty of the police and those associated with the police in the Province.
<P>
In his preamble to the previous Government's White Paper the Secretary of State at the time, Sir Patrick Mayhew, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The tripartite structure would continue . . . The operational independence, impartiality and integrity of the police, and their freedom from partisan political control, would be reinforced.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That theme was continued by the Labour party in its own document, which came out at a similar time.
<P>
Again, in the final paragraph of the preamble to the White Paper, the previous Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government's purpose in proposing the reforms detailed in this White Paper is to facilitate the provision of an efficient, effective, professional, impartial and responsive police service, accountable to the community through a strong, widely representative and open Police Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again the word ``impartial'' comes into the reckoning, alongside the two words in the Bill--``efficient'' and ``effective''.
<P>
Under the heading ``The Key Objective'' on page 10 of the White Paper, paragraph 1.15 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The underlying key objective . . . is the provision of a police service which:--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
i. is fair, efficient, effective and impartial''.
<P>
Yet again we find those key words.
<P>
The Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970, the legislation currently governing the Police Authority, defines the duties of the Police Authority, as constituted at that time, in section 1(2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It shall be the duty of the Police Authority to secure the maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force in Northern Ireland.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words ``adequate and efficient'' have been changed in the current Bill, in clause 2(3), to ``efficient and effective''.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister referred to the difficulties that might arise in court over the definition of the words ``impartial'' and ``impartiality''. Yet the 1970 Act uses the word ``adequate''. Surely, that word would be even more difficult to define in court, and the same problem would arise with the words ``efficient and effective''.
<P>
It is not necessary to change the wording in both subsection (1) and subsection (3) of clause 2; I would be happy if just one subsection was changed. It is important that the word ``impartial'' is included in the Bill, to make it clear to both sides of the divided community in Northern Ireland that impartiality is a primary duty in the role of the police.
<P>
There should also be clear policing aims, and I am glad that the Minister has anticipated that need by sending us the list he referred to earlier this morning. We have not yet had time to study that document, but Opposition Members welcome the Minister's positive response to our concerns.
<P>
The White Paper stressed the need for impartiality. It stated that the policing aims should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``act as part of the mutually reinforcing system of safeguards for the impartiality, integrity, and proper accountability of the police service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, it states that all police officers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``should be explicitly required by legislation to carry out their duties and uphold the law: impartially, without favour or affection, malice or ill will, without regard to status, gender, race, culture and tradition, religious belief, political beliefs or aspirations, and with an understanding of differing views.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an excellent definition of impartiality. It is in the previous Government's White Paper and has been available to the Minister for a long time.
<P>
The White Paper went on to discuss the duties of police officers. They should treat
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all persons with courtesy, consideration and dignity, recognising the individuality and value of every person''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, finally--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the benefit of the community as a whole.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a key phrase, and that is why the words ``impartial'' and ``impartiality'' are used so often in documentation related to police reform.
<P>
I am sure that the Government share the aims set out in that White Paper, and that they want them included in the Bill. I have studied the Bill, but I can find no reference to those duties of impartiality being imposed on police offiers. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain where such a reference occurs. That would help to alleviate my concern that police officers should see it as their duty--clearly stated in legislation--to be impartial at all times.
<P>
The Police Authority has a clear view on impartiality. It argues that the special policing challenges in Northern Ireland made it imperative that the police service is and is seen to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``impartial in every aspect of the service it delivers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Authority believes that its primary duty, which is outlined in clause 2, should be amended to require the Northern Ireland police service to be impartial, efficient and effective. The Police Authority for Northern Ireland, the previous Government, the White Paper and the results of consultation stress that the Government should show that they require the police services to be impartial. The Police Authority should ensure that the service is not only efficient and effective but impartial.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister. There is no problem with his amendments. But including the word ``impartial'' in one subsection of one clause on the first page of the Bill should present no problems either. Not only the Opposition but the Police Authority, and many people who participated in the consultation on the White Paper and the Bill, would welcome that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke):</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) that the amendments cover wider issues than the Minister's arguments suggested. Like my hon. Friend, I have no intrinsic quarrel with the Government amendment, and no objections to its inclusion in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister said that the new provision would be included for anti-discrimination purposes. It would demand, in today's jargon, ``equality of esteem'' for all political and religious beliefs. I support that.
<P>
The Minister dismissed the inclusion of the word ``impartial'' or ``impartiality''. He said that such a word would create difficulties in law enforcement and in definition in court, and that its inclusion in the Bill would not necessarily serve the needs of natural justice. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister should reconsider the draft principles. The first principle uses the word ``impartially''.
<P>
There is another dimension to impartiality, a concept with which the Minister found a quarrel after first describing it. ``Impartial'' not only means even-handed; it implies operational independence.
<P>
Clause 1 establishes the continued existence of the Police Authority. We are now considering its general functions. The mechanism used to deal with them is the replacement of section 1 of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970.
<P>
According to the notes on clauses the purpose of clause 2 is to set out the general functions of the authority more clearly than the 1970 Act. I do not quarrel with that objective, but I would argue that the acceptance of amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 26 would help the Government achieve it. It would give the statement of the general functions of the authority even greater clarity than in the Bill as drafted, even with amendment No. 52. I support the three amendments primarily because they are intended to be helpful rather than hostile.
<P>
The 1970 Act obliges the Police Authority to make sure that there is an ``adequate and efficient'' police force. Subsection (3) replaces that phrase with ``efficient and effective''. I do not quarrel with that change. The word ``adequate'' is now generally used in the context of resources--adequate financial resources, adequate manpower and so on. ``Efficient'' and ``effective'' are wider terms which encompass the concept of community policing, for instance, and the currently fashionable practice of objective setting. All that is in the mode of present-day thinking on police matters and is acceptable.
<P>
The amendments only marginally extend and expand the Government's thinking. Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 use the word ``impartial'' and amendment No. 26 includes the demand for the RUC to be ``free from political interference''. On reflection, I would have preferred amendments Nos. 16 and 18 to have used the word ``independent'' rather than the word ``impartial'', because it is nearer to that wider concept for which I argue.
<P>
The essence of the arguments for amendments Nos. 16 and 18, and likewise for No. 26, is that the police force in Northern Ireland and the police service--or department, as I prefer it to be called, but that is a matter for later debate--should be operationally independent as well as impartial in the more narrow sense. It should be free from political influence and impartial in upholding the law. Unless there is operational independence and impartiality, neither the police force not the police service will be able to command confidence.
<P>
It therefore seems logical to place in the Bill that statutory obligation or requirement on the Police Authority to maintain an independent--or impartial, efficient and effective--police force. Just as in subsection (3), there would be a statutory obligation that the service as a whole should be effective and efficient and, as amendment No. 26 would have it,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``free from political interference and direction in the discharge of its duties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is weakened by the absence of that obligation in clause 2(1) and by the incomplete obligation in clause 2(3). I therefore argue that the Bill would be a better Bill if, along with Government amendment No. 52, the other three amendments were accepted too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I should like to raise one point on this matter. It derives from the contribution by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) relating to operational independence, which I fully support.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is one question that goes deeply to the heart of experiences in the north of Ireland. Are there any circumstances in which wider and greater responsibility to the entire community transcends operational independence? In certain circumstances that wider responsibility demands that there not be complete operational independence. This goes to the heart of our discussion on Tuesday about the core element of political responsibility for policing. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Basingstoke about operational independence but, in a divided society, that wider responsibility cannot be met by the simple definition ``operational independence''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> I apologise, Mr. Jones, that I was not quick enough on my feet to rise before the Minister, but I would not like him to respond without having heard all the arguments.
<P>
The Minister leaves us in some difficulty as regards the issue of the Police Authority, in so far as he has yet to tell us what he wishes to achieve with the authority. It appears to us who know at first hand the workings of that body and its relationship with both the Northern Ireland Office and the Royal Ulster Constabulary that there is a move to lessen its influence and responsibility. The Minister told us that the measure had nothing to do with finance, yet he has also said that he wishes to achieve financial efficiency.
<P>
Governments have always supposed that they know best how to achieve financial efficiency. Hence the efforts apparently being made to claw ever more responsibility directly to the Government for functions being undertaken by the police division of the Northern Ireland Office. If that happens, the Chief Constable will be told at the outset that he has responsibility to account for every penny of the police budget.
<P>
I remind the Committee once more that we are discussing a police constabulary of more than 13,000 men and women. That figure may in future be reduced to perhaps 7,500 men and women, but in any event that responsibility will be a major task for the Chief Constable, without the Bill thrusting upon him ultimate responsibility for directing the way in which police stations and other physical resources are provided for the RUC. It is wrong that at this time the Police Authority should be divested of responsibility for about 14 per cent. of the budget. It means that although he will account to the Police Authority, the Chief Constable will be totally dependent upon the good will--I see, Mr. Jones, that you are uneasy that perhaps I am not sticking to the proposal being discussed. I assure you that it is not my intention to move away from it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can help the hon. Gentleman. We are discussing impartiality; the matters to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred will be discussed in later amendments. Impartiality, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Yes. I will take your guidance, Mr. Jones, and return to the matter later.
<P>
I was showing that impartiality will be impossible if the RUC is brought closer to the Secretary of State, because of the Chief Constable's financial dependence upon his good will and sufferance. Having said that, I again suggest to the Minister that he must tell the Committee the basis on which the Government will make financial judgments in that respect. The Minister avoided the question on Second Reading and at our previous sitting. I put it to him again that he does not have substantive information from the Police Authority or from the Chief Constable to enable him to make a judgment.
<P>
One of the difficulties concerning impartiality derives from the problem of the relationship involving a political master, which may in future be not a Secretary of State but someone who has been elected to a Northern Ireland assembly. It may be the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)--and I know that the Secretary of State's parliamentary private secretary has inclinations in that direction. It may be my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker), or even the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, modest though I am in promoting my own interests in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Or the Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. McGuiness)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The great difficulty in the future policing of Northern Ireland has been identified by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh; I was coming to that matter. Peculiar and strange influences are being given a considerable position in the political life of Northern Ireland. The influence that could be exercised by people such as the Members for Mid-Ulster and for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), who have no real, long-term commitment to law and order, is terrifying.
<P>
I press the point on amendment No. 26 that the Bill's primary responsibility is to ensure that we have a police force that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``free from political interference and direction in the discharge of its duties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no difficulty with any of the other amendments. Impartiality is something that every member of society has a right to expect from the RUC. I believe that there is impartiality in every police force in the United Kingdom. One has only to look at the Royal Ulster Constabulary's record in bringing the most evil people to justice to realise that that impartiality has been manifested in a practical and tangible way throughout 28 difficult years.
<P>
I once did a study of terrorist murders committed in my constituency, and then applied that principle to one or two other constituencies where there had, sadly, been many murders. I discovered that 48 per cent. of murders committed by so-called loyalist terrorists were resolved through the courts, compared with only 8 per cent. of murders committed by republican terrorists. That did not suggest to me any partiality by the RUC in pursuing the republican terrorists who had carried out acts of violence against my constituents, but rather that one tradition did not have the same readiness to co-operate with the RUC as the other tradition did. We should concentrate on encouraging people from both traditions in Northern Ireland equally to face their responsibility to ensure that their Protestant or Roman Catholic neighbours are not done to death by the terrorists who have pervaded our society for the past 28 years.
<P>
[Miss Ann Widdecombe in the Chair]As I said, I have no difficulty with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. Impartial, efficient and objective are exactly what we want the RUC to be, but it will not be that first and foremost if increased authority is directly imposed on it by the Secretary of State, or by whoever it may be in future. The Police Authority's integrity, independence and responsibility must be protected throughout the Bill, so that we do not have to cope with one tradition or the other withholding its support for the RUC on the basis that it is a police force governed comprehensively and directly by someone with a specific political interest.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For that reason I and my right hon. and hon. Friends who tabled amendment No. 26 wish to press ahead with it and would support a similar approach to amendments Nos. 16 and 18. Pursuing matters in that way will impose on the Minister a responsibility to explain why he has any reservations about amending the Bill so as to free the Royal Ulster Constabulary from political interference and direction.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Miss Widdecombe. I am sure that your previous parliamentary incarnation will have familiarised you with the issues that will be debated in Committee, and that you may find it difficult sometimes not to participate. However, I know that you will chair the Committee firmly, and I welcome that.
<P>
The hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Basingstoke touched upon much the same issues. My argument about Government amendments Nos. 52 and 54 relied on the point that legislation should achieve its objective. I know that the hon. Gentlemen accept that. Measures should be designed to be testable and sustainable in law. It would be wrong to include in a measure anything that might conflict with or cause confusion between other provisions. That is why it was decided to refer to section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. That is a clear statement of our aims with respect to impartiality; the Act has been tried and tested and is a robust piece of legislation.
<P>
The hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Basingstoke accepted the reference to section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act in the Bill, but maintained the need for their amendments, and the insertion of a reference to impartiality. However, ``impartiality'' has no specific meaning in law. Passing both amendments would create a potential area of conflict, in which courts would have to make decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Will the Minister deal with my point about the wording of the 1970 Act with its reference to an ``adequate'' policing system? How do the courts define that term? Is it easier or more difficult than defining the term ``impartiality''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not a judge and that is not for me to determine. In a sense, the 1970 Act is inherited legislation. I do not know whether the relevant provision has been tried and tested, but all hon. Members know that the use of general words in legislation creates a difficulty because they can be open to interpretation. The word ``reasonable'' is an example. That has given rise to debates in Committee on other occasions. The word ``adequate'' is, like the word ``impartial'', not easily defined. In the present case we have tried to find a different and more easily defined formulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me just set forth my argument on impartiality and our objectives for section 19 in Government amendments Nos. 52 and 54. There would be conflict if ``impartial'' and section 19 were both built into the Bill. If a constable breaches section 19, the person affected has a right to obtain damages. No such right would be provided by the addition of the ``impartiality'' concept. It would not be right for an impartiality breach to have no remedy, yet that is precisely what the Opposition amendments would achieve.
<P>
Clause 18 also relates to the duties of constables and may be relevant to this aspect of the Bill. I am prepared to consider the matter again when we reach clause 18 to see whether there is a way around the present difficulty. On a first examination, it is far from clear whether that could be achieved but, as I say, I will examine it again later, which I hope will be helpful to the Committee.
<P>
Let me return to a point raised by the hon. Member for Basingstoke about the Bill's guiding principles. He is right that those principles include impartiality. However, as I said in my opening comments, we must deal with the guiding principles at the appropriate time, when I will be happy to have a full debate. It would be inappropriate and would pre-empt our later debate if we had that debate now.
<P>
I have one comment now about why impartiality is set out in the principles but not in statute. The draft principles also note the need for fairness and sensitivity, which limit the scope of impartiality to where those will apply. Another important point about the guiding principles is that they are not binding on the proper exercise of a constable's judgment. I spoke in my opening remarks about circumstances in which constables would need to exercise judgment. If impartiality were to be applied similarly in all circumstances, it would lead to equal treatment for hardened criminals and those who find themselves on the wrong side of the law. That is why the guiding principles should not be binding.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke raised an important point about operational independence, which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone also touched upon in relation to the Chief Constable. I hesitate to say that they have not read through the Bill in detail: I know that they have. However, clause 19 specifically sets out the responsibilities that rest with and devolve to the Chief Constable who must be accountable, of course, to democratic forces. No one can dispute that: it applies to the Police Authority, the Government of the day or the Secretary of State acting in their name. No wing or arm of the state can be excused from accountability to democratic processes. It is enshrined in the principles of policing in this country--particularly in the tripartite structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Miss Widdecombe, on the first occasion that I have spoken under your chairmanship. As I said to your co-Chairman you have undertaken a long and arduous task.
<P>
The Minister claimed that the police were ultimately responsible to the Government. The Police Authority was established because of the danger of specific interests being forced upon a Chief Constable. Therefore, a buffer exists. The Bill erodes that buffer. The Chief Constable--and every other constable--is responsible first and foremost to the law, not to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's underlying sentiments. The importance of the operational independence of the Chief Constable was expressed on Second Reading and during our debate on the sittings motion at the beginning of our proceedings. The Bill does not undermine that.
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will not accept it, the Bill grants the Police Authority new powers and responsibilities, which are focused on what it should try to achieve for the communities that it represents. There is a clear difference of opinion and understanding about that, and I accept that we shall return to it constantly during our deliberations. Perhaps the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will convince me that he is right. I am always open to persuasion by good, logical, clear arguments. The hon. Gentleman has not presented such arguments so far.
<P>
I am trying to explain the way in which the Bill enhances the tripartite structure. I hope that I will eventually convince the hon. Gentleman that my arguments have more merit than his.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the transfer of financial power from the Chief Constable to the Secretary of State. He suggested that that was strange and unwelcome. He almost implied that a Secretary of State should have no say whatever in financing the police in Northern Ireland. That is an unusual point. If that was the case, how would the Chief Constable obtain financing? Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the Chief Constable should be allowed to raise taxes of his own volition to pay for his police force? Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Secretary of State is empowered by Parliament to set budgets and to decide the requirements of policing in Northern Ireland? The hon. Gentleman was wrong and his point was illogical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On this occasion, the Minister is being deliberately and knowingly perverse in his representation of my argument. I would not be foolish enough to suggest that the Secretary of State did not, through her office, provide finance for the police in Northern Ireland.
<P>
If the Chief Constable depended directly on the Secretary of State for the size of the budget, there would have to be a quid pro quo, which the Secretary of State could enforce. She could apply through the Chief Constable certain pressures on policing that she should not be able to apply. That is why there is a Police Authority to be a buffer between the Chief Constable, who has responsibility for implementing law and order, and the Secretary of State who deals with policy and budgetary matters.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We may come to this issue time and again, but I hope that we will not need to return to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister should stop misrepresenting the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what we are trying to achieve with the Bill. The Police Authority's power is not being eroded and neither are its responsibilities. It is being given new powers and responsibilities. The police grant bid will be made by the Police Authority, the grant will be given to the authority and only the day-to-day management will be devolved to the Chief Constable. We shall debate later how that will work and the reason why the Government consider it to be a more efficient and effective way of dealing with policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The Minister is probably right to say that this issue will crop up time after time, and that is because of the misnomer. If it were not called the Police Authority the issue would not arise. The difficulty arises because the Police Authority has no authority: it has functions. This will therefore be a continuing strand in the debate. Would the Minister give even loose consideration to the view that if the terms were changed there would be no expectation of a body called a police authority exercising a concept called authority and it could concentrate on doing what it is there to do, which is to exercise certain functions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Another of the themes running through the debate is whether the authority is an authority. We will come to that later. I shall certainly consider earlier suggestions and give considerable thought to them. As has been show time and again when dealing with Northern Ireland legislation, the Government are prepared to respond to reasoned and reasonable arguments when there is a broad consensus of a better way forward.
<P>
I hope that I have covered the points that have been raised. I have tried to deal with the specifics and the more general issues. I have said that the question of the word ``impartial'' being in the Bill and in section 19 of the Constitution Act could be considered under clause 18. It would be difficult to achieve, but I may be able to come to a conclusion about it before we reach that clause. If not, it could be considered on Report. On that basis I ask the Committee to support the Government amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> May I welcome you to the Chair, Miss Widdecombe. We welcome the Minister's constructive approach and his offer to look again at our proposals under clause 18. There may be some misunderstanding between us. I can see merit in his argument that to use the word ``impartial'' in the Bill in relation to the conduct of a constable in a particular situation could give rise to the difficulties that he so clearly outlined. I accept that, but what we propose, certainly in clause 2(1), is that the Police Authority should secure the maintenance of an impartial, efficient and effective police force in Northern Ireland. That is different from requiring each constable to be impartial at all times. Perhaps the Minister will consider that in the light of his proposals in clause 18.
<P>
There is every reason to put in the Bill a provision stating simply that the Police Authority is obliged to ensure that there is an impartial police force. That would send the right message to a divided community, and give the Police Authority added power and strength. We shall develop that argument later. It was clear in the past that the Police Authority had little power or recognition. Both sides of the Northern Ireland community have considered it a toothless tiger. The amendment would give a clear statement: that the Police Authority for Northern Ireland will have the task of ensuring an impartial, effective and efficient police force in the Province. It would also further strenghten PANI--which the Minister believes the Bill already does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I agree with the Minister that that it is long overdue, and that it needs to be done. The amendment would give added strength to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I do not wish to interrupt the flow of my hon. Friend's argument but surely he could add to it by referring to the principles, which we shall consider later. The way in which my hon. Friend put his view of impartiality is, of course, entirely consistent with the first principle in the draft principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point. However, it is for the Minister, rather than me, to pick up on that point when he decides to make changes. I am encouraged by the Minister's constructive approach so I shall not press the amendment to a vote. It is an important point and the Minister accepts that, hence the two Government amendments. If he could find some way of including the word ``impartial'' in the Bill at a later stage, I should be delighted, as would the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, because its view is that there should be a clear statement that it has a duty to ensure that the police force in Northern Ireland is impartial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We could bat this ball backwards and forwards. I have set forth the complications of using the word ``impartial'' in the Bill and have promised to look at it again relative to clause 18.
<P>
It is worth while drawing the Committee's attention to Clause 2(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The police force, traffic wardens and the civilian staff of the Police Authority shall form a single service which shall be known as the Northern Ireland Police Service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall secure that the Northern Ireland Police Service is efficient and effective.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire would include the word ``impartial'' in that concept. I have explained the difficulty, and we shall return to the subject. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman is not pressing his amendment. He has made a reasonable judgment, although I did not expect him to press it, as that I have attempted to take on board his argument and find a reasonable way forward that is consistent with the legislation. We will come back to it if that can be achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I fear that throughout our proceedings the Minister will attempt to evade points raised by members of the Unionist party, either by misrepresenting them or by hurling insults by innuendo across the Committee--initially in a gentle way but eventually more forcefully. We will note carefully how he conducts himself in that respect, just as we have noted how some of his colleagues conducted themselves in the past.
<P>
I find little cogency in the Minister's argument that we should not use the words ``adequate'' or ``impartial'' in legislation because they are not easily defined. I am not a lawyer, but I understand that the law is about the use of words and how they are interpreted in the courts on the basis of the expectation of the greater number in society at any time. That is how the legal system hopes to be coherent and easily understood, otherwise we would have anarchy.
<P>
The Minister argues for the words ``effective'' and ``efficient'', but those words are probably not defined legally any more than the word ``impartial''. I do not see why he baulks at the use of the word ``impartial''. If words must be challenged and defined through the legal system, so be it, but legislation should be meaningful to society and should meet its expectations. I ask the Minister to think again and not to use fallacious arguments which simply frustrate those of us who seek to help the Government in creating legislation that will best serve society in its entirety in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I said that I would think again about clause 18 and look for a way of resolving the difficulty just enunciated by the hon. Gentleman. Clearly he is not listening. I have said it two, three or perhaps four times. I am saying it again to him in the hope that he will understand this time that I intend to consider it again. On that basis we can come back to it later, or even on Report, if he is still dissatisfied with the way in which I have tried to resolve the difficulty--if resolvable it is.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>General functions of the Police Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 1, line 14, leave out `civilian' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`professional, technical, administrative and other'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 21, in clause 3, page 2, leave out lines 23 to 35.
<P>
No. 22, in clause 3, page 2, line 38, leave out from `to' to end of line 40 and insert `the police force'.
<P>
No. 24, in clause 4, page 3, line 19, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) No regulations under this section shall be made before the expiry of the period of three years beginnng with the date on which this Act comes into force'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I welcome you to the chair, Miss Widdecombe, and look forward to your guidance and tolerance. I think that both will be needed.
<P>
I readily accept that there is some pedantry in amendment No. 25 and that this will not be one of the great moments of debate on a key issue in the Bill, but the amendment should be accepted, because the words in the clause are imprecise.
<P>
The first line of subsection (2) implies that in the Police Authority there are those who are not civilians. It also implies that members of the police force, and indeed traffic wardens, are not civilians. The wording is inaccurate, because, as I understand it, the only people in any community who are not civilians are those who are subject to military law as members of the armed forces.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that it is a pedantic point. Most people would recognise the distinction that is being made in clause 2(2). However, I encouarge the Minister to accept the amendment on the ground of precision because the clause, as drafted, is inaccurate. Should a provision that is patently inaccurate become part of an Act of Parliament?
<P>
The clause could have an even wider effect. It makes a distinction between members of the police force and those who are not members: that is, the rest of the community. I understood that one of the Government's aims in changing policing was to ensure that the police force was part of the community and part of civilian life in Northern Ireland. I thought that they wanted the relationship between the community and those who are exercising law on its behalf to be based on the fact that a policeman is an ordinary person within the community, even though he has an extraordinary role to play. He shares civilianship with the community within which he exercises his duties.
<P>
The wording of clause 2 makes a distinction that almost places a barrier at the beginning of the Bill. It serves no purpose and should be changed. The rapport between the police force and the community should be recognised in the wording of the Bill.
<P>
I seek the Minister's advice because he is a man of great and deep knowledge. At our sitting on Tuesday we learned from him and his hon. Friends that a rock and a hard place could come into collision and create something new. Does he agree that non-civilians can be defined only as those who are subject to military law? If that is the case, I think that there are good reasons for changing the wording of the clause. The amendment might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as possible, but even with its deficiencies, it is more accurate than the use of the word ``civilian'' in the clause as drafted.
<P>
The implication that there are, within the Police Authority, those who are civilians and those who are non-civilians is quite dangerous. Who within a police authority are non-civilians? Who within a police authority are employed by that authority? What business has a police authority employing non-civilians? What would be the reason for a police authority representing the community to employ non-civilians? There are implications which run under the stream of pedantry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 21 and 22 and then to amendment No. 24.
<P>
The clause will make the most important and significant change to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. It comes principally from the relevant, and similar, clauses in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 which were later incorporated into the Police Act 1996 for England and Wales. The measure has been slightly reworded, but the thrust of the measure is essentially the same; it was one of the most significant changes in respect of the role and duties of police authorities and their relationship to chief constables in England and Wales.
<P>
I tabled the amendments primarily because it was argued in Northern Ireland that the model used in England and Wales was not necessarily the right one to use in the Northern Ireland context because Northern Ireland is different. I know that we use the terms ``unique'' and ``different'' all the time, but it is a fact of life that Northern Ireland is, indeed, different in many respects. Simply to take one model that works well in England and Wales and transpose it to the context of Northern Ireland is not necessarily the right way to proceed. My amendments would remove many of the changes that are proposed in the relationship between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable in respect of who is responsible for the civilian staff--and most of us understand what that term means, as it is used in legislation for England and Wales. The civilian staff are sometimes seconded by the civil service and sometimes directly employed by the Police Authority to assist the Chief Constable in his policing role and duties. Some civilian staff who work for the Police Authority are there to ensure that the authority is able to carry out its functions under the law.
<P>
The Bill proposes changes that are very different from the measures that are set out in current legislation, in the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970, although there are some similarities. It is the same as the 1970 Act, for example, in that it gives the Police Authority powers to appoint a chief administrative officer who is to be Secretary to the authority. Likewise, clause 3(1) of the Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority, with the approval of the Secretary of State, shall appoint a chief executive officer who shall be secretary to the Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a straighforward copy.
<P>
Clause 3(3) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority may, with the approval of the Secretary of State as to numbers and terms and conditions of service, employ persons to assist the police force or otherwise to enable the Authority to discharge its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no such provision in the 1970 Act. Clause 3(3) is completely new and I consider it acceptable. A similar role is established in clause 3(4), under which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority may make arrangements for administrative, secretarial or other assistance to be provided for the Authority by persons employed in the civil service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is, strangely enough, mirrored by section 3(4) of the 1970 Act; the numbering is the same. The earlier provision states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority may make arrangements . . . for administrative, secretarial or other assistance to be provided for the Authority by officers . . . of the civil service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsections (5) and (6) are more contentious. Subsection (5) concerns control of civilian staff by the Chief Constable and subsection (6) relates to agreement between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority about which of the civilian staff employed by one or the other should not be subject to the Chief Constable's control. The 1970 Act contains nothing like that. The thrust of the provisions is derived from the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 and the Police Act 1996. What is the view of the Police Authority about the new aspects of the clause? Obviously, clause 3 places day-to-day control of staffing in the hands of the Chief Constable, but it leaves the Police Authority as the employer of all civilian staff. That is an unusual arrangement. It is clearly designed to give the Chief Constable greater control of the civilian staff who are employed--directly or, in the case of those seconded by the civil service, perhaps indirectly--to make a contribution to policing.
<P>
In legal terms the provision falls well short of making the Chief Constable the de jure employer of the civilian staff. I am told that that would require the Chief Constable to be made a corporation sole. Only in that event would he be able to employ staff, buy land and invest in property. We obviously do not want the Chief Constable to act in that way. The compromise is that he controls but does not employ the staff. That is a confusing and difficult arrangement. It was considered in 1994 during the build-up to the legislation that was then planned. However, the solution was rejected at that time. It was thought that the Chief Constable should not enjoy the relevant powers, not least because to do so might be seen as compromising his operational independence.
<P>
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland is not satisfied that the compromise that is set out in clause 3(5) should be introduced. It has taken the trouble to visit 12 police authorities in England and Wales as part of its consultation process and research. It had discussions with them and concluded that what is proposed for Northern Ireland will fail to achieve the Bill's objective of clarifying the roles and responsibilities by more clearly defining what the Chief Constable, as opposed to the Police Authority itself, shall be responsible for.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland believes that if those subsections are included they will lead instead to increased confusion and uncertainty. It does not rely simply on the evidence of its consultation process. An interesting book, ``Policing after the Act'' by Trevor Jones and Tim Newburn, came out not so long ago. It details their research into the implementation and working of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 in England and Wales. Their final conclusions are varied and considerable and I shall allude to just some of their key points.
<P>
One of the recommendations is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``minimum levels of secretariat support for police authorities ought to be established and laid out by the centre.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By that I presume the authors mean by the Home Secretary and the Home Office. They continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Unless this is done, increases will be resisted by chief constables in some areas.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe they mean that if a chief constable is responsible for the budget he comes under pressure as to whether he spends that money on front-line constables or civilian staff. There is thus a conflict of interests. The Police Authority would argue that there ought to be more civilian staff to do its work, but the Chief Constable could argue against that and say that with limited resources the authority must spend them on front line constables and the police themselves.
<P>
The authors continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``How exactly this would be done needs considerable thought. We would suggest that the Home Office and Department of the Environment, in consultation with representatives of the police authorities and ACPO, should lay down recommended minimum levels of support in terms of particular posts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Their recommendations are extremely prescriptive. Finally they say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This would help police authorities meet more effectively their expanded statutory responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another recommendation relates to what the authors call
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the grey areas in which roles and functions overlap'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which they say need to be clarified. They identify three areas of joint responsibility that were becoming sources of tension. The first was financial--that is fairly obvious--and personnel management, which goes to the heart of the clause. It is about who manages the personnel, not only the constabulary but the civilian staff who are employed to assist them or the Police Authority.
<P>
The two other areas were community consultation and the production of the annual policing plan. The thrust of the reforms of the 1994 Act pretty well covered those key areas. The authors say that difficulties are already surfacing in the operation of the legislation in England and Wales. The key area on which I wish to concentrate is personnel management: who is in charge of the staff, who controls them and how can conflicts of interest between them be resolved?
<P>
Finally, while I am dealing with the book and the critique it offers, I shall read the Committee a further quotation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there remains confusion about the proper role and identity of the police authority. Many police authority members and officers appear to subscribe to a model that sees the police authority as independent and constructively critical of, yet working with, its police force. However, overlapping responsibilities between forces and authorities due to grey areas in the legislation are causing confusion and may in the future lead to tensions between chief constables and their police authorities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not saying that the research by Messrs. Jones and Newburn is necessarily gospel--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Definitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Thank you--definitive, or written on tablets of stone from Mount Sinai. However, it is the only research that has been done on the subject. The authors command respect in their field of expertise and they are saying clearly that the implementation in England and Wales of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 has caused considerable difficulties.
<P>
The authors go on to say elsewhere that some aspects of the legislation are working well, and that they merit the changes to make it work more effectively. They conclude that the scale of the police authorities in England and Wales--much smaller than that in Northern Ireland--has allowed the legislation to work well in certain cases. There is some good practice out there and the rest could follow. They are not critical of all parts of the legislation but they are drawing attention to problems, particularly with the provisions on personnel management, as regards who is in charge of civilian staff and who pays them.
<P>
I return to the Police Act 1996 and the provisions in section 15 (2). Section 15 (3) states clearly that if there is agreement between the chief constable and the police authority, certain civilian employees shall not be under the direction and control of the chief constable. One assumes that such agreement would focus on employees working exclusively on police authority functions, but the measure does not say that. It leaves the chief constable and the police authority to come to some agreement.
<P>
The parallel provision in the Bill is clause 3 (6), which seems to achieve the same ends. However, the drafting is different and, dare I say it, rather clumsy. The interjection of the phrase--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or engaged in pursuance of arrangements under subsection (4) in providing assistance to, the Police Authority''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the sentence makes it more difficult to understand and causes problems of interpretation. At best, it could be interpreted as meaning that the Police Authority and the Chief Constable have to agree on which civilian staff they are prepared to exempt from the strictures of subsection (5)--both those who are directly employed to assist the authority to discharge its functions, and civil servants who are seconded to the authority to help with secretarial or administrative responsibilities. That is a major departure from the current system.
<P>
For the first time, the Chief Constable will have a say in the numbers, grades, qualifications and composition of the civilian work force that is employed exclusively on Police Authority matters. We are not considering civilians who are employed to assist the police force to discharge its functions. There is a strong case for the Chief Constable to have a critical say in their employment. Those employees work to his agenda to implement the policing plan and to fulfil the objectives of the Police Authority and the Secretary of State.
<P>
Why is there a question mark over the arrangements that are transposed from the 1996 Act, which built on the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, which applies to England and Wales? We must return full circle to the point about uniqueness to explain the resistance and anxiety.
<P>
The uniqueness begins with the RUC, which is a police force for Northern Ireland. The sheer size of the RUC is the first striking point about it. It comprises 13,200 full and part-time officers. East Anglia has a similar population--1.5 million people--to Northern Ireland. Yet 3,000 to 4,000 police officers cover East Anglia. There is a considerable difference between those numbers.
<P>
The RUC's role combines policing with military-type functions. Therefore the RUC does a different job from that of police forces in England and Wales. It performs the same policing functions, but with extras, and it has carried them out magnificently in the years of the troubles.
<P>
The RUC has a larger budget than any other force in the United Kingdom. That is obvious from the information that I gave about its numbers. It is a much bigger enterprise than anything that exists on the mainland.
<P>
The RUC is closer to central Government than any other police force. For the past 25 years the Government, of whatever complexion, have had to deal with one of the most vicious, well organised and effective terrorist campaigns in the world. Although we hope that, in their dealings with the police, the Government never overstep boundaries and compromise the operational independence of the Chief Constable. I know from my experience as a Minister that terrorist activity means that the Secretary of State and senior Ministers have to work closely with the Chief Constable.
<P>
Apart from the RUC, we have the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, which is unlike any police authority in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is a question of scale. Currently 2,800 civil servants work in and for the Police Authority. In addition, 800 other civilians are directly employed by the Police Authority, making a total of 3,600 civilian staff.
<P>
Let me compare that with the Cambridgeshire constabulary, which covers my constituency. The chief constable has a force of perhaps 1,200 police officers to organise and manage and probably about 600 civilian staff. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland is expected to organise and manage more than 13,000 police officers and, in addition to that, he now has to take on board PANI's 3,600 civilian staff. Therefore, to transpose the system that has been running in England and Wales to Northern Ireland would not necessarily work because the scale is so different. The problems would be different and would probably be exacerbated by the greater scale. I have attempted to show that there is good evidence from the research upon which I have commented that all is not well in this concept of personnel management in England and Wales.
<P>
In view of the sensitivities attached to the civilian staff issue in Northern Ireland and the fears of those staff about their career prospects--we shall come to that in the debate on clause 4 and amendment No. 24--their potential loss of civil service status and their percepton that they will be subject to a heightened security threat if they are more clearly seen to be police employees, PANI recommends that the status quo be retained for the present.
<P>
PANI is not suggesting that the present arrangements are adequate: it believes that they are not, so it proposes that there should be no change to the primary legislation but that there should be increased effort by all concerned to develop a cohesive police/civilian staff management structure that is properly co-ordinated with the personnel management arrangements for the uniformed service.
<P>
Those are the views of the current Police Authority. Either it has not been consulted or, if it has, no one has listened to it. It makes extremely valid points in relation to what the Government propose in subsections (5) and (6). By deleting them, my amendments would not quite leave the status quo, because the clause contains some additions that I welcome and to which I alluded earlier. There is considerable concern about the way in which the subsections would work in Northern Ireland.
<P>
PANI considers that subsection (6) is unacceptable. It says that if it is to have meaningful responsibility for the oversight and monitoring of police performance and for holding the Chief Constable to account, it is inappropriate for him to have any say over either the number or the grades of staff employed to assist the authority to carry out its responsibility.
<P>
I alluded earlier to the fact that the Police Authority has had continually to counter criticism that it is ineffective. It believes it imperative that the new authority is not seen to depend upon the Chief Constable for even the minimum of support. The authority thinks that this issue will be seized upon by its critics and is keen that the substance of my amendment should be carried in the two subsections. It goes further: it believes that it should have power to appoint all senior civilian staff working in support of the Chief Constable who are of equivalent rank to RUC senior officers.
<P>
A further point arises largely relative to clause 3(3), which provides the terms and conditions of civilians working for the RUC that are to be approved by the Secretary of State. Legal advice suggests that an appeals procedure in the terms and conditions agreed between the Police Authority and the Secretary of State could not lawfully provide for reinstatement of an employee dismissed under clause 3(5)(a). Such a provision would frustrate the power of the Chief Constable to dismiss employees. The Police Authority calls for this to be clarified. The Minister may be able to address this problem, which could lead to difficulties.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 relates to clause 4, and deals with civilian staff. Clause 4(1) provides that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the transfer to the employment of the Police Authority''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of any person to whom the relevant section applies.
<P>
One of my amendments seeks to delete clause 4 completely, but I believe that we cannot debate the amendment. Perhaps a small amdendment could have been added at the end of the group, after amendment No. 24, in case, when we come to the debate on clause stand part, we cannot deal with its content. That would at least put off the evil day when these draconian measures will be implemented.
<P>
Clause 4 is about the Secretary of State going to people gainfully employed in the civil and service and telling them, at a stroke, that they are employed by some-one else. I am amazed that a Labour Government have made such a proposal. If we had done it, they would have gone crazy. How will the rights of those workers be protected? Will they be given the option of transferring? According to the Bill, they will not. On an appointed day, they will suddenly have a different employer.
<P>
I go back to the difficulties and concerns of people who are currently on the civilian staff, in both PANI and the RUC, who feel that the measures in clause 2--and those in clause 3--will identify them more closely with the police service, therefore making them legitimate targets for terrorists, especially the IRA. I am sure that concerns have been expressed both individually by those employed and through their unions. The Minister must clarify their position and say what representations he has had and why he has not taken heed of any fears that have been expressed. If the employees are transferred in this way, they fear that they will lose their civil service status, presumably with an effect on their pension rights. More important to them is their security and the fact that they now believe they will become legitimate targets, which they were not before. It is a connected issue, because we are talking about the same civilian staff. The Government seem determined to press ahead with this provision, which is unacceptable to the Police Authority. Its views seem to have been completely ignored.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there are no fears and there has not been representation? Is he saying that this is not an issue? I am not prepared to reveal sources. Is he saying that there has not been representation of any kind? If he is, it is an untruth, because there has been representation to a number of bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> I am asking the hon. Gentleman what those representations are so that the Committee can deal at an adult level with the amendment that you propose.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I propose no amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> There has been representation and fears have been expressed throughout Northern Ireland to Members of Parliament, to the Police Authority and, through channels, to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I was rather startled by the previous intervention. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire may not realise that the Northern Ireland Office has been leaning heavily on the Police Authority and others to ensure that no representations are made to the official Opposition or the Ulster Unionist party. The implications of the question by the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hesford) bear out that allegation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have almost come to the end of my comments on this group of amendments. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There should not be sedentary conversations, particularly when they are loud enough to be heard throughout the Room. Hon. Members who wish to intervene should seek the permission of the hon. Member who is on his feet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> There are several issues here. First, there is a question mark over whether the proposals for chief constables to run civilian staff in England and Wales have been successfully impelmented. The Government must take those views, the research and the evidence on board and listen to the Police Authority, which has strong reservations about the impact that subsections (5) and (6) in clause 3 will have on its ability to do its job in Northern Ireland. In respect of amendment No. 24, there is disquiet about the Government's proposals to transfer these people--
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): The hon. Gentleman has referred constantly to what the Police Authority has said. I want to know what he thinks about the matter. What he is saying now is different from what the previous Government said about it. Their proposals were exactly the same as ours. What does the hon. Gentleman think?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have made that clear throughout. There is substance in my amendments and I have considered evidence in research. I am merely stating that earlier legislation, which I supported, is not working as well as it should, and we must be aware of that. We must also be aware that transposing a measure from England and Wales to Northern Ireland does not always work. Those are my views; I am entitled to express them and I have tabled amendments to put them into effect. It is incumbent on the Government to say why, in the face of opposition and anxiety, they are determined to press ahead with the Bill as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the previous Government did a great amount of work on the issue. They proposed to do the same as we propose to do and transfer responsibility for civilian staff of the Police Authority to he Chief Constable. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the previous Government got it wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was not involved in drafting legislation or writing the White Paper--I had other responsibilities and my advice was not sought. I am saying that the Opposition have a duty in Committee to raise issues for debate so that they are in the public domain and people who have anxieties but do not have a voice know that the Committee has considered their concerns.
<P>
Those are my views and I am open to persuasion. It is amazing that Government Members should criticise a member of the Opposition who is doing his job. I am merely saying that the proposal is not perfect and asking if the Government have taken on board that it is not working as well as intended. Governments do not always get it right. Why are we here today? We are considering the ideas and the drafting of the architects of legislation--the civil servants, and other people who work for the Government--and trying to improve the measure. That is what I have tried to do. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I want, briefly, to take up a point made by my hon. Friend. I do not know what work the previous Government did on transferring civilian employees from one body to another, but I know from experience in my constituency how fraught with difficulty such as exercise can be. It is on that basis that I support this probing amendment, which would ensure that the Government give more thought to the issue than the previous Government--in my constituents' experience--did in similar circumstances.
<P>
In my constituency, there was the enormous transfer from the civil service to the private employment of the atomic weapons research establishment in Aldermaston. In Basingstoke, a number of branches of the civil service were transferred to private employers. Ideological and practical issues are involved in such transfers. My hon. Friend is right to pursue the matter because the previous Government, which I supported, did not get it entirely right in every respect. I hope that the present Government will learn from that experience, pay attention to my hon. Friend's arguments and ensure that the transfer of employment, which can be a traumatic experience, is avoided in the case of the Police Authority.
<P>
I shall be most interested in the Minister's response to amendment No. 25, tabled by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), as I believe that the hon. Gentleman is right. From my long-distant soldiering days, I recall that the world is divided into two categories: military and civilian. I should be amazed if a previous Act has set out that the police are distinguished from civilians.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> If there is anything in the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, what does he understand by subsection (7)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am not discussing subsection (7), and I will not be tempted to do so at present. We might discuss that in due course during the clause stand part debate. We are discussing the four amendments that are before us and the argument made for amendment No. 25 by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. He has pointed out that the distinction between civilian and police is incorrect.
<P>
There is an argument in principle and a practical argument for amendments Nos. 21 and 22. The principle was explained by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He made the compelling point that it is dangerous to transfer, lock, stock and barrel, institutions, structures or practices that are appropriate for one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the kingdom, without serious consideration. As my hon. Friend has said, the practical grounds are the profound differences between the structure and size of the RUC, and the nature of its tasks, which are different from those of every other police force in the United Kingdom--with the possible exception of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
The principle, added to the practical grounds, gives the argument for the amendments considerable force. Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are serious, probing amendments. The arguments in their favour point to potential weaknesses in the Government's presentation of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I listened with some incredulity to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who was supported by his hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. They seemed to be presenting themselves as the champions of the working class. I remind them of the 18 years before the Labour Government came to power. Tens of thousands of employees in the public service were thrown on to the scrapheap, without so much as a by-your-leave as a result of changes by that Government.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not say that the amendments were probing: he advanced them as strong points. He was rescued, in part, by his hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, who said that they were probing amendments. He said that he was concerned about the impact of the changes on the staff of the Police Authority. I do not think that his concern is genuine. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State questioned him on that matter, but received no response.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire seemed to be arguing that there should be no change whatever in the relationship between the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State in terms of staff management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister accused me of having no care for the civilian staff of the Police Authority. That is not the case. I have two comments on that. First, those people will be told that their status and position are to change overnight. Secondly, there is the valid point that was made by the Police Authority about undermining morale. This is a time when those important people need to have high morale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Already 2,800 civilian staff work for the Royal Ulster Constabulary--many of them in police stations. They are already in a direct relationship such as has been mentioned, already at risk and under threat in their daily life. They serve the community knowing that there is a threat. The transfer of responsibility from the conditions of service under the civil service code does not alter that. The circumstances remain the same as the staff go about their daily work and lives. We should pay tribute to the work of the civilian staff; I shall comment on the use of the term ``civilian'' later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is the Minister saying that there is universal acceptance of the transfer by the civilian staff--the 2,800 that he mentioned? Are they happy with it or has he received representations otherwise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As an ex trade union official who has in his blood a commitment to the improvement of working people's conditions, I tell the hon. Gentleman that the treatment of staff by the present Government--certainly in the case of the staff for whom I have ministerial responsibility--will be a huge improvement on any earlier treatment. It will take full cognisance of those people's fears and concerns. I shall deal in due course with the approach to tackling this matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the Royal Ulster Constabularly was the biggest police force in the United Kingdom. That is not the case. Although the non-regular officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary make it bigger, Strathclyde is its equivalent in regular officers, despite the fact that Strathclyde's population is 2.2 million, compared with 1.6 million in Northern Ireland. The Met is of course a much bigger force, with a considerably larger budget of about &#163;2 billion. Forces as big as or larger than the RUC already operate with the transferred responsibilities that we are considering. They have direct control and responsibility for management under the chief constable--or the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. The world has not stopped as a result of that.
<P>
Clearly, there will always be difficulties in management relationships in any working environment. There is nothing new about that. The change will have an impact on the people who are subject to the transfer.
<P>
The Jones and Newburn study identifies possible conflicts and areas of difficulty; it is helpful for any legislation to be examined in detail to assess whether it is achieving its objectives. However, the study does not reach the conclusion that there should be a return to the previous arrangements. It would be preferable to improve on the present arrangements. The Government have taken that into account in formulating the clause.
<P>
The clause will replicate for Northern Ireland the measures introduced for England and Wales by section 10 of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 and for Scotland by section 49 of the same Act. The rationale put forward at the time was that the sections remedied a serious defect in the operational effectiveness of a police force. It could seriously affect such effectiveness if the control of key civilian personnel were not in the hands of the Chief Constable.
<P>
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland looked at the effect of the 1994 changes in Great Britain in the context of the fundamental review of the RUC. That review was carried out jointly by the RUC, the NIO and the authority in 1995 and 1996. The summary of its findings was published in January last year. The study took place in the context of the 1994 legislation.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In its contribution to the fundamental review report, the authority commented that reform in England and Wales had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``successfully refined and clarified the respective tripartite roles and responsibilities for the management of policing resources | This has resulted in more efficient and effective use of resources''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Commenting on the existing system in Northern Ireland, the authority's input to the fundamental review report noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``civilian support staff, although being fully committed to their task, had divided allegiances due to their different terms and conditions and personnel management systems. . . . Lack of clear ownership by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable of the civilian support staff was seen to be a major debilitating factor in relation to the most effective use of this important resource.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It was commented on by RUC managers and staff themselves that the personnel management function exercised by the Police Authority was considered to be remote and out of touch with RUC strategic goals and not really in tune with RUC requirements. It was also evident that due to lack of ownership the RUC did not see the civilian staff as `theirs'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Commenting upon the passing of control of civilian staff to the Chief Constable, the authority noted that it would 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``remove the current confusion and provide the sense of belonging and ownership for both civilian staff and RUC management.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are direct quotes from the Police Authority stemming from its experience of previous legislation. We should take that into account--

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> They are selective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> They may well be selective but I do not intend to read out the entire comprehensive report to the Committee. I could do so with your leave, Miss Widdecombe, if I wanted to. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said from his sendentary position that my quotes were selective; I would say that his opinions are certainly strongly selective. I was emphasising how important it is to the Police Authority to have better and clearer relationships between staff and direct managers in the workplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not dispute that for a moment. I never said that the Police Authority was against changes to the tripartite structure: it believes that the main thrust of the Bill will be beneficial. I concur with all that. However, the quotations he cited relate to the identification of civilian staff according to which employer they are working for. That does not mean that the Chief Constable is necessarily controlling them. When it expressed the views that the Minister cited, the Police Authority might have felt--at that stage--that it was responsible for employment conditions of civilian staff. I do not know, but we are not in conflict over that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The RUC manager said that he did not view civilian staff as being his. There is a discontinuity in working environments in RUC stations and where there is a relationship between the senior RUC officers--line managers--and people providing the service. The discontinuity in the relationship arises because of another relationship affecting day-to-day control. In management terms, if working people are closer to those above them--to whom they have to report--it provides a better mechanism than when employers are remote. That is where the discontinuities and inefficiencies arise.
<P>
The Chief Constable's day-to-day responsibilities are large; there is no question of that. However, the present Cheif Constable is well up to the job. He is capable of managing difficult situations effectively. The management of personnel is important but I have no doubt that he will handle it well and gain support for his actions.
<P>
In the light of that advice and from examining the results of changes in England and Wales, we think that transferring managerial responsibility to the Chief Constable is the best, most effective way in which to provide the service.
<P>
Let us consider management and the issues that staff and others have raised about the implementation of the provision. There should be adequate time for consultation and preparation before the implementation of the regulations. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State assured interested parties in writing that those regulations would not be implemented until 2001 at the earliest. The Government have considered that carefully. They will not implement the regulations before 2001 unless joint agreement is reached earlier. The period that we have set provides ample time for consultation and preparation.
<P>
I have put in place a full implementation strategy to take into account the minutiae that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire mentioned. I do not think that we should discuss detailed aspects of conditions of service here. That subject would be better tackled in a more appropriate forum where we could consider potential difficulties, whether the regulations fully took account of those anxieties, and whether they needed to be adapted.
<P>
The implementation strategy will be devised by a steering group, which I shall chair. The Chief Constable and a senior PANI representative will also attend. Below that, there will be a co-ordination strategy. Meetings will be attended by Northern Ireland Office officials, RUC and PANI representatives. Below that, working groups will deal with every aspect of the impact of the regulations, and any anxieties that are caused by the process of change. That offer has been made to the Police Authority. The working groups are not up and running, but not because the Government do not wish to establish a procedure by which to tackle matters. We intend to implement the Bill and to ensure that all anxieties are taken into account early.
<P>
We may have to refine aspects of clause 3 that deal with PANI's staff. I am considering ways in which to amend the clause to define clearly the Police Authority's financial independence. We shall return to that on Report.
<P>
In conclusion, the 1994 policing arrangements that apply to the rest of the United Kingdom have produced clear benefits. Amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 24 would not better those arrangements; they would detract from them. Therefore, the Committee should reject them.
<P>
Let us consider amendment No. 25. My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh opened the debate, and I am sorry that he has had to wait so long for my response. The hon. Member for Belfast, North acknowledged that my hon. Friend had made an important point. All those who work for the Northern Ireland police service--officers and the staff who assist them--are civilians. Their primary duty is to provide a service to the community. That is clearly the case, but the use of the word ``civilian'' raises some issues and I shall want to see whether we can find a clearer and more precise wording to resolve that. My instinct is to support the principle underlying the amendment. Let us look at wording that would be acceptable in legislative terms. I will probably come back to that on Report.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not say where his advice was coming from and on whose behalf he was speaking. He was not prepared to reveal his sources. I have revealed all my sources, the consultation in which I am involved and the fact that the Police Authority has outlined what it sees as the best way to deal with the relationship between the tripartite structure and the responsibility for staff. Most of those concerns have been taken into account. It is an evolving situation and regulations will take account of that.
<P>
The implementation strategy that I have put in place is about engaging those who have the responsibility for carrying forward the impact of the Bill. The Government want to engage with those interests so that implementation is properly structured because we recognise that change of itself causes concern. We want to ensure that the change is handled as well as possible. I give the Committee that assurance and I hope that that message goes out to those civilians who provide a valuable service to the RUC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I had hoped that the Minister would allow me to intervene before he sat down. As the whole question of sources of information has been raised, it is important that we clarify whether the Government have written to certain people suggesting, in a not very tactful way, that they should not be interfacing with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and with me and others. Is that not indicative of a Government who are prepared to pressurise the Police Authority to an unreasonable degree? If the Minister can answer that perhaps we will be able to make a judgment on other matters pertaining to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have the documents in front of me and the hon. Gentleman does not appear to have the letter to which he alludes. We will find out what correspondence he is talking about and try to interpret it appropriately.
<P>
The structures that we are discussing, the authority and the staff all have mechanisms for raising concerns. That is why I have set out the implementation strategy approach. They do not need to be anonymous spokespersons. They do not need to talk to local politicians. [Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] Let me expand. They have mechanisms by which to relay their concerns and need have no fear about expressing disagreement with the Government about what we are trying to do. Plainly, they have a right as constituents to raise concerns, but the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone should advise people of the appropriate approach. The trade unions and the Police Authority are examples of mechanisms through which contact can take place. The best advice is to use the established mechanisms to voice concerns. That is better than to be constantly suspicious that there is some hidden agenda. I can do no more than point to the transparent and open way in which we are trying to deal with this process of change. If the hon. Gentleman wants to live in a world of suspicion--
