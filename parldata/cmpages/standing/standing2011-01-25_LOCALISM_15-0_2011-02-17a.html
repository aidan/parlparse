                           </strong> Amendment 194 is a probing amendment to test the
Government’s view of the role of local enterprise partnerships,
particularly their duty to co-operate. As it stands, the duty to
co-operate could not apply to LEPs because it applies only to persons
who exercise functions for the “purposes of an
enactment”. That means that the body whose main function is to
foster cross-boundary co-operation between local authorities on the
infrastructure needs of businesses would not have a role in strategic
planning beyond a material
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am a member of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, which
looked at the role of LEPs. Various witnesses, who gave their evidence
politely and diplomatically, felt that the LEPs were stumbling towards
a purpose in life, although the model is very difficult to see at first
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am concerned about the message that is being sent to businesses if this
flagship economic policy—I am not being facetious, because it is
genuinely seen as being so—is not considered important enough to
be given a statutory base. The Government want LEPs to take on a
strategic function in planning and infrastructure, but there is no
statutory involvement or requirement. Giving them a role in the duty to
co-operate could be the necessary step for businesses to feel that LEPs
are something other than talking shops.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000022">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
have suggested that there is no need to include LEPs in the clause
because the duty already applies to the constituent members, so local
authorities and the top people within those local
authorities—the leaders of the respective councils—would
already be involved. I do not believe that is sufficient. There seems
to be substantial scope for LEPs to be involved well beyond
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
British Chambers of Commerce suggested that LEPs could have a scrutiny
role on the duty to co-operate and a right to appeal to the Secretary
of State if local authorities failed to discharge their duty.
Alternatively, they could be directly involved in the drawing up of
planning documents. However, as a member of the Business, Innovation
and Skills Committee, I understand why the Government do not wish to
encumber the new LEPs with many of the additional responsibilities that
seemed to stick like glue to the regional development
agencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two points to raise. One, which I mentioned last week, is throwing
out the baby with the bathwater—getting rid of things without
having something really firm in mind to replace them—and the
other is the emperor’s clothes. I mentioned the diplomatic
response of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Select Committee.
There was general agreement that getting rid of the RDAs was silly,
although there was clearly a need for review. If we were to have a
complaints session covering things we did not like about the RDAs, I
would be at the front of the queue. I had many run-ins with the RDAs
and saw many of their weaknesses and faults. However, it was clear from
all the presentations that there is a definite need for a strategic
approach on the major issues that face businesses, which is what my
amendment is an attempt to put in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
pretend that my amendment—nor the Opposition’s new clause
8, which specifies some duties and responsibilities of LEPs—is
the best way of achieving what we want to do. However, we are trying to
make up for a shortfall. We are trying to fill a gap—or a
vacuum—that will be created following the demise of the RDAs.
Amendment 194 basically says that a LEP is a LEP, if it is a
LEP—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Laughter.</em>
                           <em>]</em> We have to proceed on that
basis because someone tell me what a LEP is! I understand that the
Government say that they are open-minded, but there is a difference
between open-minded and being vacant. A huge vacancy existed throughout
the hearings of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, because
business men said, “How can we possibly tell you what we see as
the role for LEPs when you will not tell us the basic framework, model
and criteria?” I think we are still in that
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall make one point about new clause 8. I believe—surprise,
surprise—that the first refusal on assets should go to the local
authorities. There are about seven in the Bradford district that were
held by Yorkshire Forward, and they are in a pretty poor state because
they were acquired for regeneration. Unfortunately, while those assets
resided with Yorkshire Forward, the mess that results from the
acquisition of assets that have just lain idle lies with the local
authority. The local authority should first be given the opportunity to
decide whether it wants to take on those assets before they are offered
to undemocratic and, to a degree, unaccountable—albeit with
local authority representation—LEPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I served on
the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee with the hon. Member for
Bradford East when we conducted the RDA inquiry. He gave hon. Members a
masterly analysis that summed up what we found—first, that it
was a mistake to abolish the regional development agencies. Should they
be tested and reformed? Yes. Were they all as effective as they might
have been? No. At their best, however, were they deeply impressive?
Yes, they were. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman was right that the
transition to the new arrangements has been poorly managed at the worst
possible time—just when local businesses and local economies
need support, guidance and assistance. Thirdly, he is right to say that
the new arrangements leave a great deal to be desired. Fourthly, like
him, we believe that if the RDAs are, sadly, to be a thing of the past,
we now have to focus on trying to make the new arrangements work in the
best interests of the economy and our local communities. The hon.
Gentleman made an interesting
contribution.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 8 would provide a statutory basis for local enterprise
partnerships. We are extremely surprised and disappointed that the
Government have failed to include provisions in the Bill that would put
local enterprise partnerships on a statutory footing. That failure goes
to the heart of the Government’s failure on the economy more
generally, and their unconvincing strategy for
growth.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can see the Government’s original intentions on the No. 10
website. Under the heading “the main elements of the Bill
are”, it states that the Bill
will:<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Create
Local Enterprise Partnerships (to replace Regional Development
Agencies) – joint local authority-business bodies brought

development.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>However,
there are no provisions related to the new local enterprise
partnerships in the Bill. In fact, the Bill is silent on any form of
growth strategy. LEPs are meant to be the flagship of the
Government’s economic policy for the regeneration of local
economies and the regions, but only seven months after they declared
that they would bring forward provisions on LEPs, the Bill has been
published without a single mention of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s mistaken conduct on the planning system is almost
entirely mirrored in their conduct on the abolition of the regional
development agencies and the way in which LEPs are being created. Their
scrapping of the previous system and dismantling of the regional
development agencies is creating huge uncertainty and depriving local
communities and businesses of vital support at a difficult time. The
Government are failing to support strong and credible organisations to
replace the
RDAs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
experience has shown that the most successful of the regional
development agencies—in which every £1
invested realised £8.14 in wealth in the local productive
economy—was Advantage West Midlands. It did not always get it
right, but some of its achievements were truly remarkable. I could give
many examples, but time

                           </div>does not permit me to go into this in detail, so I shall outline just
one. Rover nearly collapsed in 2000. In the five years that followed,
Advantage West Midlands ensured through a magnificent collaborative
effort that the supply chain diversified. That meant that when Rover
sadly eventually did collapse in 2005, the supply chain in the midlands
did not collapse with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To this day,
the work of Advantage West Midlands has galvanised a motor
manufacturing cluster in the midlands that is 150,000 strong. There are
the primes: component companies such as GKN; machine tool companies
such as Goring and BSA; and logistics companies. Warwick university has
worked with Gaydon. At the other end of the spectrum, games companies
in the midlands are working with Jaguar Land Rover on the next
generation of in-car entertainment systems. A key reason why Jaguar
Land Rover, which is now owned by Tata, committed to Britain in last
October’s historic decision was because, in the words of the
chairman and chief executive, there are only two places in the world
where there is a motor manufacturing cluster, which is key to its
development and growth, and the midlands is one of them. That historic
decision would not have been taken without the work of Advantage West
Midlands with local authorities, universities and the private sector
over many years. Forgive me, Mr Amess, for setting out that example in
some detail, but the RDAs at their best were very important
indeed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000036">&#160;</a>

Agency had to span an area from the Scottish borders down to the
fringes of the north midlands. That region was far too large for the

for one, am pleased that it is being replaced with more LEPs that will

no doubt that sub-regional arrangements have real value. If one was
having a sensible debate about reforming the RDAs, precisely that point
should be addressed. Conversely, however—I say this to the hon.
Lady with respect—because I know the nuclear industry well, as I
led for all the nuclear unions for many years, I can say that the
nature of the nuclear industry cluster in the north-west, which
stretches from Cumbria down to Warrington, is such that an intense
regional strategic and sectoral focus is needed to build on the success
of that industry at a time when it has become a sunrise industry, which
I welcome, and is no longer a sunset industry. There was never any
conflict between the notion of the regional and the sub-regional; the
two should have been partners not opposites. However, the Government
have put all their eggs in the basket of local economic
partnerships.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000038">&#160;</a>

that the RDA was in existence, that productivity was lower in the west
midlands during the 13 years that the RDA was in existence, and that
innovation rates in the west midlands were lower than in any other UK
region during the 13 years that the RDA was in existence? Given all the
evidence about the RDAs' actual economic impact, the best that could be
said is that it had no impact at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000039">&#160;</a>

intervention extraordinary. It is absolutely true, if we look at the
statistics, that the regional economy of the west midlands is such that
the area has gone from being one of the two strongest regions
economically to one of the two weakest regions economically.
The single biggest contribution to that was the devastating impact on
manufacturing industry in the midlands under Mrs Thatcher in
the 1980s, which caused serious problems. Mercifully—I do not
want to go into the example I cited in further detail—thanks to
the role of a good Government agency working in partnership with local
authorities and the private sector, we have stopped the haemorrhage in
motor manufacturing and built the basis for a solid future. I am
involved in discussions right now about new companies coming into the
midlands as part of that motor manufacturing cluster. That would not be
happening if AWM had not done what it did with regard to the decision
made by Jaguar Land Rover.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000040">&#160;</a>

important discussion about the past—sadly, the RDAs are now
history—I would like to focus on the future and how we can make
the new arrangements work. Local enterprise partnerships lack clout and
resources. As the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills has admitted, the changes are “Maoist and
chaotic”. We believe that there has been a failure to put in
place adequate transitional procedures, and that the new proposals on
LEPs are ill-thought out, inadequately resourced and lack the necessary
powers to address the problems that local economies face. We cannot, as
a consequence of the changes and the way in which the transition has
been handled, have hard-hit regions falling further behind at a
difficult time for the economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000041">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman says that he wants to move away
from looking at the past. When we talk about introducing value into a
local area, it is important to appreciate the effort and hard work of
those who work in the private sector. That is why it is important that
we work with the new plan for LEPs. This is work in progress, and it is
disingenuous for the hon. Gentleman to criticise it in such a way at
this stage. Through this innovative work, we are seeking—for the
first time in many years—truly effective joint partnership

where flourishing local partnerships were starting to be created.

substantial criticism from the private sector that it is not properly

                        <p class="tabbed">Do we, like
the hon. Member for Congleton, believe that there should now be a
strong partnership through the LEPs, as there was historically through
the RDAs? Without hesitation. Our focus is on how we make that work in
the next stages. New clause 8 and the arguments deployed by the hon.
Member for Bradford East go to the heart of that. Let us look forward.
How do we make the new arrangements work? Having decided to establish
LEPs, we believe that the Government must now trust and support local
areas to drive growth and jobs, not hold them back. If LEPs do not have
the power or the resources, as has already been evidenced, business
might walk away, which would create yet more uncertainty. Our proposals
would give LEPs a range of important powers over skills, European
regional development fund funding and RDA assets. That contrasts with
the Government’s failure to deliver a plan, leadership or action
on growth.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
particularly concerned that the Government might be preparing a fire
sale of billions of pounds of RDA assets, to which the hon. Member for
Bradford East has referred, such as business parks and development
land. We believe that LEPs and local authorities, together with the
private sector, should have first say over RDA assets to enable real
local influence. Ministers might point to the Government’s White
Paper that was published in October, but little clarity exists over the
fate of such assets. The total value of the land and property assets
held by each RDA is in excess of £500 million, which is not a
small sum. A substantial asset portfolio is held in the west
midlands, for example. We want to ensure that the integrity of such
regional assets, which were acquired for the purposes of economic
development and strengthening local economies, is maintained so that
there are no fire sales to cover large gaps in the budgets of the
Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills or the Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are also
concerned about the Government’s plans to centralise the
delivery of the ERDF into the Department for Communities and Local
Government. With the greatest respect to the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, given his well-known aversion to
anything described as either regional or European, that is like putting
a fox in charge of a chicken coop. Under these plans, it appears that
LEPs will be excluded, with the management of the fund centralised in
Whitehall—I thought we were talking about localism! There will
no longer be local and regional input, leadership and direction, which
has the consequent risk that regions’ priorities will fail to be
reflected. Will the Minister tell us how that fits into the
Government’s localism agenda? Is that why LEPs are not mentioned
at all in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to a point raised by the hon. Member for Congleton, many LEPs
share our concern about powers and funding, as do many private sector
organisations. For example, the British Chambers of Commerce and the
Federation of Small Businesses have also expressed
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a consequence of this debate, Labour Members hope, first, to enable
LEPs to have responsibility for hundreds of millions of pounds of RDA
assets, such as business parks and development land, to give real local
influence and allay fears of a Government fire sale. Secondly, we want
to give LEPs access to the £1.5 billion of European
regional development funding that RDAs 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 612<a class="bkMark" name="Column612">&#160;</a>
                           </div>previously managed but is now at risk. Thirdly, we want to ensure that
LEPs have appropriate funds for start-up and establishing plans for
growth. Fourthly, we want to give LEPs powers to oversee local
skills strategies to address local needs. Fifthly, we want to
give LEPs a stronger formal role in the development of local economic
growth
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
my dialogue with those in the private sector, I know that if they
thought that LEPs would be discharging these vital strategic functions,
it would be much more likely that they would engage, which would combat
the growing cynicism on the part of too many in the private sector. We
want the private sector to engage with LEPs to make them work, but many
in the sector will be reluctant to do so if they believe the LEPs are
but a talking
shop.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we touch briefly on the hugely important issue of
assets. We heard from the Minister of State, Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr
Prisk), only last week that assets must be sold at market value. RDAs
have been asked to look at their property portfolio, assets and
liabilities, and to develop plans for disposal to be signed off by the
Secretary of State, or the Minister on his behalf. We heard that the
priority of the approach is to the public sector at full value. There
is talk of the potential involvement of LEPs in disposals, but that
would involve significant sums, and the problem is that LEPs have been
given not one penny by the Government by way of running costs, for
example. Where would the LEPs get the money to take advantage of assets
being available for
sale?<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the Government’s approach—this is reinforced
by what was said last week—detracts from the ability of RDAs to
manage disposals in the best interests of local communities. Crucially,
it detracts from the principle of local assets for local people for
local economic development, which I think we all support. It is not
surprising that the Government are taking this approach—sadly it
is the reverse of what we believe is appropriate—because they
have said that they are under an obligation to deliver maximum value on
public sector investments for the Government as they address the
national
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000051">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us consider what that might mean in practical terms. Forgive me if I
take the midlands as an example once again. In fact, I will give three
examples from the midlands to show what has happened in the past and
the dangers inherent in what might happen in the future. Advantage West
Midlands, working closely with local authorities and the private
sector, strategically acquired a number of sites, sometimes as a
consequence of closures, so that it could have a supply of sites for
good industrial expansion and help businesses to grow, keep businesses
in Britain and attract inward investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
example is Rover in Longbridge. Together with the previous Government,
I was deeply involved with the efforts to try to prevent that tragedy
in 2005. I will never forget the awful day when we finally realised
that Rover was going to go under. Afterwards, together with AWM, it was
about picking ourselves up, dusting ourselves down and wondering how we
could make best use of the site. There has been a very effective
partnership between Advantage West Midlands and St Modwen; 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 613<a class="bkMark" name="Column613">&#160;</a>
                           </div>they developed a plan that combined industrial development, a new
college, some housing to fund infrastructure, and a town centre
arrangement in south Birmingham, because that is where the
Longbridge site is.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
emphasis was changed to achieving maximum value for the Treasury, that,
to be frank, would be secured by way of housing development, because in
that particular part of south Birmingham and in the adjacent areas
there is strong demand for housing. It is an attractive area, in a
number of ways. Private sector housing development would be likely to
attract more value for the public sector. In the event of the council
changing planning use—historically the council has not been as
strategic as it should have been, and certainly not as strategic as
AWM—that excellent project, which involves the creation of
thousands of jobs, would not proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will give a
second example, Ansty Park in Coventry. Sadly, it is another former
industrial location. Great factories that were located there closed,
starting in the era of Mrs Thatcher. Together with the private sector,
including companies such as Rolls-Royce, AWM developed the notion of a
technology park with connections to the M6. All sorts of offers were
made; for example, AWM was approached by Severn Trent Water, which
asked whether it could locate its headquarters on the site. AWM said
no, because it wanted to develop a world-class technology centre. As a
consequence, Ericsson, which had the option of shifting some of its
production abroad, went to Ansty Park and developed its productive
capacity there.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once again,
if the criterion was to be achieving maximum value for the Treasury, it
would be very likely that the site would be developed for housing.
Without the firm grip that AWM maintained by insisting on the
development of a world-class technology park, the Ansty Park site might
have ended up as a business park for logistics firms, with far fewer
jobs and much less value to the economy being created than would be
generated through the development of the technology park.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The third and
final example is Bosch in Worcester. The company needed to expand. It
wanted to move into the production of environmentally friendly boilers,
and it also wanted to develop a training hub for high-end engineers
working on Bosch product design, development and production, and the
servicing arrangements thereafter. It was a landlocked site. The
company said that it could go anywhere in Europe; it was seriously
contemplating that. The company would not commit on where it would
produce and develop the new capacity, but AWM was able to go in, having
made a £10-million investment, with a site that the company then
took advantage of. AWM rejected the short-term market value view and
took a long-term view. When it acquired the site, it argued that if it
was able to invest now, there would be up-front gain later. It took a
holistic approach, and was not driven by short-term financial
returns—in this case, maximum value for the Treasury—but
instead chose sustainable jobs that created greater gross value
added.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I come in with another angle with which the hon.

They have a negative value. They were acquired as part of site assembly
for larger regeneration schemes. If the assets with a positive value

whether the “local” that he had in mind was a visit to
his local pub this evening, after the rigours of a week in Westminster.

by some other high-level body sitting around a map, as it were, and
determining how England is to be carved up. Our approach is precisely
the opposite. That is the approach that was taken in the creation of
the RDAs, and we have had a useful discussion in recent days about some
of the anomalies of having those imposed administrative
boundaries.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept the
charge that ours was a new approach; indeed, I welcome it. I regard it
as innovative. Rather than do the usual thing, and have Ministers and
officials sit down and divide England, we decided to invite communities
and businesses across England to describe for themselves the economic
geography that they consider most relevant to their circumstances. That
approach raised some eyebrows when we put it forward. It was different
from the experience of how these things had been done. However, many
Members here—this was reflected in some of the
Opposition’s speeches in the last sitting—have been
impressed with proposals that have emerged in response to this
invitation. The LEP in the constituency of the hon. Member for
Birmingham,

of arrangements; the same goes for the Manchester area covering the
constituency of the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South. Kent,
which is my own area, and Essex and East Sussex recognise a commonality
that was not available to them in the previous
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000073">&#160;</a>

was born and brought up in Middlesbrough, and one of the fascinating
things about the response to the invitation there is that businesses in
the Tees valley, when given the opportunity to revisit and revise the
north-eastern set of regional arrangements, made a strong, clear demand
for recognition of their contribution. It has been a tremendously
successful example of how, if we trust people and allow them greater
self-determination, they will not let us down, but will impress and
rise to the

is right that there is a collective determination to try to make it

cynical people from the business community to get in there and engage.
It may not be everything it should be, but we want to make it work. The
new clause
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000075">&#160;</a>

to the future, it is right that we recognise that one of the problems

necessarily make economic sense, in terms of particular clusters in the

a LEP, and that is very much captured in the amendment. The LEP merely
reflects what has been created willingly and voluntarily, so one needs

Government decided to say no to Cornwall, so Plymouth—we are the
economic driver for the south-west—has been scrabbling around
trying to find a model that works. We think that we have something, but
it has been cobbled together. We have been forced into something with

look for strong consensus among local authorities and businesses. The

a great deal of time with businesses and local authorities in the hon.

made to the House today on arrangements for London. Looking at the
time, I do not think that today’s sitting in the Chamber has
started. If the right hon. Gentleman intervenes on me this afternoon, I
may be able to describe the arrangements. However, before any
announcements are made at questions to the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, let me say that the LEPs that have been approved
to date account for 70% of England’s gross value added, and I
suspect that that will be much higher as a result of today’s
announcement. Given that the closing date for initial expressions of
interest was just at the beginning of September, the fact that a
considerable percentage—I do not know the exact
percentage—of the country will be covered by strong LEPs is not
to be sneezed at. The right hon. Gentleman will see a strong dialogue
over the coming months in some of the remaining areas about how to come
together to form LEPs. We may be able to reflect, perhaps even later
during proceedings on the Bill, on progress in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000086">&#160;</a>

to points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth. The
Committee will rise in two minutes, so let me answer his points first.
The arrangements have been made voluntarily. Do they need to be in
statute? We considered that question when drafting the Bill, but the
overwhelming conclusion from everyone we spoke to was that there was no
reason for that. We are not talking about creatures of
Government—bodies that are there, as the RDAs were, to act as
branch officers of Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
the Local Government Association, for example, is clear that it opposes
the new clause. It says that it will strongly resist any further
requirements to set up a statutory basis. It adds that such
requirements would tie up precious time and resources in a way that was
unnecessary. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth is right, and
the chairman of the LEP in his area has also written to me to say that
it would be<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000093">&#160;</a>

an open mind. It said that it

continue to lie with the democratically elected local authorities. The
issue has therefore been reasonably considered. It is perfectly fair to
ask whether there would be some advantage in setting up a statutory
reflection of what is the case in practice, but people have come to the
conclusion that there would not.<a class="bkMark" name="11021763000096">&#160;</a>
