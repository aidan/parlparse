<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000292"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> I beg to
move amendment No. 177, in clause 157, page 81, line 42,
after &#145;bank&#146;
insert</div><a name="08111394000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;,
building society or credit
union&#146;.</div><a name="08111394000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000293"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take
Government amendments Nos. 178 and
17.</div><a name="08111394000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000294"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Without wishing to intrude into what
would normally be the province of a clause stand part debate, I shall
first say something about clause 157. I emphasise that the clause
allows the Treasury to require the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme to contribute to the costs of the special resolution regime. As
we have discussed before, the Government believe, as a point of
principle, that the financial services sector, through the FSCS, should
contribute to the costs of the
SRR.</div><a name="08111394000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are all technical. Government amendments Nos. 177 and 178
amend the clause to allow the FSCS to contribute to the costs of the
resolution of building societies and, if the stabilisation powers were
extended to credit unions, credit unions as well. That ensures that our
approach to the FSCS contributing to the costs of resolving banks can
be extended to building societies and, if needed, credit unions. We
discussed that earlier
today.</div><a name="08111394000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 17 ensures that the FSCS contribution to the SRR will not
be classified as FSCS management expenses. That brings the treatment of
the FSCS funding of the SRR in line with the treatment of the FSCS
funding of compensation payments to claimants under the scheme. I
commend these sensible technical amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="08111394000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111394000295"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I point out, for the
benefit of Government members of the Committee, that it is only as a
consequence of the presence of Opposition members in Committee this
afternoon that the Committee can continue, as I think that the
Government Benches are not quorate. I am sure the usual channels are
cognisant of our good will in ensuring that the Bill
proceeds.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div><a name="08111394000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000296"></a>Lord
Commissioner of Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury (Mr. Bob
Blizzard):</b> By maintaining their places, Opposition members
enable Government members to be carrying out other duties in the
corridor. Those members will return to Committee in due
course.</div><a name="08111394000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000297"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is always better for armies to be visible than
invisible, according to my friends with military
experience.</div><a name="08111394000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ask the Minister about Government amendment No. 17. I had
intended to raise this point in a clause stand part debate. In the
context of the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley, my understanding is
that the interest that is being charged on the &#163;14 billion that
the FSCS has borrowed is classified as management expenses and
therefore will be borne not by the depositing sector within the FSCS,
but by all participants in it&#151;independent financial advisers,
investment managers, insurers and so on. I listened to the
Minister&#146;s explanation of Government amendment No. 17. Will that
have retrospective effect or will IFAs and others have to bear that
cost, as it is currently classified as part of the management
expenses?</div><a name="08111394000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000298"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that the FSCS was used to
fund the deposit book transfer of deposits to Abbey Santander, and this
is similar to the provisions in the banking insolvency procedure in the
Bill for a deposit transfer, which the Bill provides for the FSCS to
fund through clause 110(1)(b). Provision by the Treasury under clause
110 for the FSCS to fund the use of a stabilisation tool would
technically occur before the onset of insolvency, and therefore before
the FSA can currently activate the FSCS. However, that does not mean
that the firm in difficulties might be resolved at lower cost to FSCS
levy
payers.</div><a name="08111394000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I explained when dealing with amendment No. 17, our intention is to
bring the treatment of FSCS funding of the SRR into line with that for
its funding of compensation payments to claimants under the scheme. We
believe that we have achieved that.</div>
<a name="08111394000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about interest. Yes, interest is regarded as a
management expense. However, it is a specific expense that is borne
only by deposit takers, so individual financial advisers do not pay. I
hope I have clarified the point.</div>
<a name="08111394000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000299"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. Having had conversations with IFAs, I know that the
position that he has outlined will be welcome to them, as there was
ambiguity about the provisions for the FSCS and others. IFAs will be
grateful to the Minister for clarifying the
matter.</div>
<a name="08111394000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111394000300"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I accept the
amendments. However, I am sure the Minister is aware that there is much
disquiet among building societies about their contributions to the fund
in the current circumstances. The formula is based upon their retail
deposits, which in the past was not a bad measure. The more deposits
they have, the more they should contribute to the fund. In
today&#146;s circumstances, we are bailing out people with relatively
little in retail deposits. Much of the problem is caused by the fact
that the building societies have relied on the wholesale market. It
seems a tad unfair that those that have been operating with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>significant retail deposits and lending a proportion of that money,
which is much more prudent in today&#146;s circumstances, are now
being required to pay a larger ratio into the FSCS fund.</div>
<a name="08111394000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put that
down as a marker because I believe the Minister ought to consider the
formula for contributions before Report.</div>
<a name="08111394000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000301"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the point raised by the hon.
Gentleman, which was discussed briefly in earlier debates. I know that
some building societies feel strongly about the matter, and I
understand that they have been making representations to the Financial
Services Authority, among others. I have no doubt that those
representations will continue. The Government will continue to follow
the situation closely.</div>

<a name="08111394000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000302"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have some questions about the operation of the
clause. I take the Minister back to his brief opening remarks on the
last group of amendments. Let us look at the matter in a different way.
Traditionally, when there is an administration or insolvency&#151;a
process to sort out the problems of a failing company, be it a bank or
otherwise&#151;the cost of the process is borne by the company
itself, not by its peers. Why should sound and stable banks pay the
costs of a bridge bank, temporary public ownership or the transfer to a
private sector purchaser? Surely the investors in the company,
principally the shareholders, should pay either through a lower
distribution on wind-up or through lower proceeds on sale. Why is it
appropriate for banks that have not failed to pay the costs of a bank
that has? I distinguish between the FSCS in its normal activities and
some of the costs incurred in the process under discussion.</div>
<a name="08111394000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on to more detailed questions about the individual parts of proposed
new section 214B. Proposed new subsection (1)(b) states that the
section applies
where</div><a name="08111394000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Treasury think that the bank was, or but for the exercise of the
stabilisation power would have become, unable to satisfy claims against
it.&#148;</div><a name="08111394000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
what extent would the bank have to be unable to satisfy those claims
for the Treasury to exercise that power? We have just debated amendment
No. 17 about the treatment of expenses, which relates to proposed new
subsection (2). The assumption in proposed new subsection (3) appears
to be that the costs will be borne by the banks&#151;the Minister
provided clarification on amendment No. 17 on that basis&#151;but the
new subsection does not make it clear that that cost will always be
borne by deposit takers. Is the expectation that other members of the
FSCS could bear those costs or would those costs, in the first
instance, always rest with the deposit-taking sector?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div><a name="08111394000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
proposed new subsection (3)(a), how will the Treasury determine the
costs that will borne by the scheme? What principles will it use to
determine which costs will be borne by the scheme and which will be
borne elsewhere? We spoke about Bradford &amp; Bingley on the previous
group of amendments. The FSCS has taken out a loan of &#163;14
billion to fund the transfer of balances. Scheme members will bear the
interest on that, which is about &#163;900 million per year, and they
could, potentially, also bear any defaults on the Bradford &amp;
Bingley mortgage book. One assumes that if a similar partial transfer
had to be used in the future, the FSCS would bear the same type of
costs.</div><a name="08111394000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure how much wider the definition of costs could go. Will the
scheme cover the operational costs of a bridge bank, or will the bridge
bank be expected to pay for those? If an indemnity on the value of the
mortgage book is given to a purchaser, will the Government expect the
scheme to bear those costs? Are there other operational costs that the
Government expect the scheme to bear? What are the parameters of the
costs that the scheme could bear? It would be helpful to provide some
predictability.</div>
<a name="08111394000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (3)(b) states that the Treasury shall make
regulations</div><a name="08111394000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;providing
for independent verification of the nature and amount of expenses
incurred&#148;.</div><a name="08111394000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also refers to the potential appointment of an auditor. I alluded to
that is an earlier debate on the objectives, when I raised the issue of
money being used in an efficient and economical way. Who will control
and monitor the amount that is being spent? It is all very well
auditing something, but that is a retrospective check. Will there be a
prospective check? If the FSCS and its members are to bear the costs,
is there a role for them, alongside the tripartite authorities, in
agreeing the types of cost that could be incurred? Potentially, they
will be writing a blank cheque to the tripartite authorities and they
would like a level of control over the types of cost that they will be
expected to pick up. The proposed new subsection is not clear on
whether that control would be in
place.</div><a name="08111394000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="08111394000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had some difficulty understanding proposed new subsection (4), maybe
because I am not a lawyer. Perhaps the drafting is clearer to those
better versed in the law than I. I think it is trying to set a cap on
the amount the scheme would pay, so that it would not exceed the amount
payable if the stabilisation power had not been exercised. I assume
that means that, rather than a failing bank&#146;s being dealt with
through one of the stabilisation options in part 1, it would become
insolvent and be dealt with through administration or insolvency or the
bespoke tools that we are going to deal with in part 2 and part 3. That
is the comparison that will be made.</div>
<a name="08111394000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will recognise the complex and subjective nature of the judgment that
the valuer would need to reach. The outcome of those judgments would
have a significant impact on the cost incurred by the scheme member.
Will the Treasury consult with scheme members before issuing
regulations to ensure that there is some consensus on the rules that
will guide the independent valuer? I am not saying that that will
determine the outcome but clearly there would be an opportunity to
reduce the conflict between scheme members and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>tripartite authorities&#151;perhaps avoiding the need to appeal to a
court or tribunal&#151;if there were some consensus about the process
that a valuer would use in approaching a valuation.</div>
<a name="08111394000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again in
proposed new subsection (4), I think the expense is limited to the
amount the scheme would have paid out. Is this calculated on a gross
basis, that is, does it not take into account the recoveries from the
bank or the amounts actually paid out? If the amount that would have
been paid out was &#163;10 million but for the stabilisation options,
but only &#163;5 million had to be paid and, of that, a bank had
assets that would cover &#163;3 million of costs, it would
end up with the FSCS bearing a cost of only &#163;2
million&#151;that is, the amount paid, net of recoveries. What is the
limit that the scheme will pay? Is it the &#163;10 million; is it
&#163;8 million, as the explanatory note suggests; or is it the level
of recoveries of &#163;3 million? I am not sure how, in
proposed new subsection (4), paragraphs (a) and (b) interact with each
other to determine the amount the scheme will have to bear. I would be
grateful for clarification.</div>
<a name="08111394000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
proposed new subsection (7), my understanding based on the explanatory
notes is that these expenses could be funded from a pre-funded
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Will the Minister confirm that
that is the intention of proposed new subsection
(7)?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000303"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me begin by restating why the Government
believe, as a point of principle, that the financial
services sector, through the FSCS, should contribute to the
costs of the SRR. I will then address a number of points
raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="08111394000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
strong arguments why the financial services sector should be
contributing to the costs of the SRR through the FSCS. First, where
intervention is necessary to prevent costs to the wider economy of the
failure of a bank, we believe there is a compelling argument for banks
to contribute to that cost because banks&#151;and the financial
services sector more widely&#151;benefit directly from the
achievement of the SRR objectives, particularly the objective of
enhanced financial stability and confidence in the banking system. It
is therefore entirely appropriate that the sector should contribute to
measures that achieve these objectives. Secondly, but for the use of a
resolution tool, the financial services sector would have to fund
through the services of the FSCS the cost of compensation to depositors
arising from the failure of a deposit taker. Therefore it is also
entirely appropriate that the Treasury may provide that the banks
contribute to the costs arising from the exercise of the special
resolution regime tools that are designed to address a failing
bank.</div><a name="08111394000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to consultations on the provision, the banking industry has
consistently opposed our plans. In its view, the costs of resolution
should be met by an acquiring company or the insolvent bank&#146;s
estate. However, industry should be called upon before taxpayers
contribute to any
shortfall.</div><a name="08111394000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000304"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is it the Minister&#146;s view, therefore, that
the acquirer or the estate of the failed bank should bear the costs
initially, and that anything in excess of that should be
borne by the wider financial services
sector?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div><a name="08111394000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000305"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That probably depends on the circumstances and
the particular transaction. I have tried to outline the general
principles that underpin clause 157. The clause notes that the FSCS
will be called upon to contribute to the resolution costs when a
stabilisation power under part 1 of the Bill has been used, and when
the Treasury considers that, but for the exercise of that power, the
FSCS would have normally been triggered to pay out to depositors under
the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000.</div><a name="08111394000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a number of safeguards
that the Bill puts in place around that power. First, as set out in
subsection (4)&#151;which the hon. Gentleman spent some time
discussing&#151;the Treasury will only contribute up to the
hypothetical cost of depositor compensation payments. Secondly, as also
set out in that subsection, if the FSCS pays out to depositors it
should not be called upon to contribute to the costs of any other
resolution tools for the same bank. Finally, as set out in subsection
(3), there will be independent verification of the nature and amount of
the expenses
incurred.</div><a name="08111394000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman queried the meaning of &#147;unable to satisfy claims
against it&#148;. I am advised that that is a standard term that
refers to when the FSCS will be triggered. It is in part 5, chapter 15
of FSMA. The subsections regarding the resolution received many probing
questions from the hon. Gentleman. I have already drawn particular
attention to subsection (4), which outlines some of the requirements of
the regulations, and subsection (3) sets out that the Treasury can make
regulations to specify the expenses that the FSCS should contribute to.
It is important to recognise that the regulations will be fully
consulted on. To return to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
example, we do not think that the operational costs of the bridge bank
would be
included.</div><a name="08111394000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we will consult on the regulations, it might help to briefly indicate
some examples of what resolution costs could include. We have in mind
the market value of any guarantees provided by the authorities to the
bank, financial assistance provided to support a resolution, the
administrative costs of the SRR&#151;for example, the cost
of an advisory service procured by the authorities to effect a
resolution&#151;and certain compensation
costs.</div><a name="08111394000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked whether the acquirer pays the resolution
costs. Yes, the acquirer will bear those costs. For example, under the
bank resolution fund the proceeds of any resolution will flow back to
compensation
costs.</div><a name="08111394000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of consultation. He asked whether
the Treasury will consult with scheme members on the rules that will
guide the independent valuer, and I want to be clear that the answer is
definitely yes. We can consult on any principles, but we must recognise
that valuation involves complex calculation of a hypothetical
insolvency, so it might not be appropriate to involve FSCS members in
all of the independent valuer&#146;s procedures and calculations. I
hope he appreciates that throughout the Bill we have always wanted to
commit to working with the industry in a consensual, open and
transparent manner, and that applies to the extent that it
is possible to do so in this case, just as it has with other aspects of
the Bill that we have discussed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000306"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those answers but
am concerned about who will bear the costs initially. He indicated that
the acquirer would bear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>some of the costs through the bank resolution fund, but I am still not
clear that the creditors and shareholders would bear some of that cost
as well. I am with the Government on ensuring that the taxpayer does
not bear the cost, but there is a residual concern that in trying to do
so we give the impression that the first port of call is the FSCS,
rather than the acquirer or creditors. I might return to that point on
Report to get a little more detail clarifying the
ordering.</div>
<a name="08111394000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
Minister&#146;s comments about the limit on how much could be paid, I
think we may take it that if the hypothetical cost was &#163;10
million and the FSCS only paid out net &#163;5 million, the
contribution that members would make could still be a further &#163;5
million; so the way in which that works is now clearer in my
mind.</div><a name="08111394000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000307"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This point might seem rather trivial to the
Minister, but I would like to know why in subsection (1) the
procedure is described as insolvency. The normal procedure is either
liquidation or administration, so insolvency seems to be a new term
invented for the purposes of the Bill to describe the process. Indeed,
it becomes clear in subsection (2)(b) that the order appoints a
&#147;bank liquidator,&#148; and that term is used thereafter
fairly regularly. Indeed, clauses 86 to 89 deal with the process of
bank liquidation.</div>
<a name="08111394000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
why the Government have chosen to introduce the word
&#147;insolvency.&#148; Someone rather crudely suggested that,
given that these things are normally matters for the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Treasury was a little
more lax in its language, but knowing the Minister&#146;s dual role,
I am sure that he would not have allowed that to happen. It would be
helpful to know why &#147;insolvency&#148; was used in this case
rather than the more traditional
liquidation.</div><a name="08111394000266"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="08111394000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111394000308"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): I should like to probe the
thinking behind the clause. My understanding is that in some
jurisdictions a failed bank is subject to the general corporate
insolvency laws, as is the case in this country. I understand that
there are special regimes in other countries, including Italy, Norway,
Canada and the United States. The Government&#146;s principal reason
for bringing in a special regime, as stated in the explanatory notes,
is that depositors who are eligible claimants under the terms of the
FSCS are paid out promptly when a bank fails. As I understand it, the
Government intend that to be the main thrust of the proposed new
insolvency regime. Then there are some other objectives which were
listed in the Government&#146;s consultative document earlier this
year. The first is that depositors might be deprived of access to their
accounts at very short notice if there is no special regime. The second
is that no objectives exist around the fast pay-off of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>depositors. The third is the likely destruction of any residual
franchise value. The fourth is the risk of contagion to other
banks.</div>
<a name="08111394000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see why
the Government gave consideration to the creation of a special regime.
However, I draw to the Minister&#146;s attention the fact that the
majority of correspondents to the January 2008 consultation felt that
wholesale changes to current insolvency provisions were not required to
ensure rapid payments to eligible FSCS claimants. Several parties
suggested that any new procedure should be closer to liquidation than
the creation of a new regime. But the Government have proceeded to
create this new regime.</div>
<a name="08111394000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">To what
extent has the Minister consulted with other international bodies
responsible for bank supervision in order to try to ensure that the
globalisation of banks is reflected by a similarity of treatment? To
what extent has he had discussions with the responsible bodies in our
European colleague countries, with responsible bodies in the United
States and in other countries that are becoming increasingly important
in a globalised market? While these provisions for a new regime in the
United Kingdom are before us, I should like to know a bit about the
Government&#146;s thinking in arriving at this conclusion and putting
these proposals before us. In particular, can the Minister tell us
about any discussions he has had to try to ensure that our regime does
not stand alone, but is carefully co-ordinated and preferably made
similar to those of other
countries?</div><a name="08111394000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000309"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause introduces part 2, which sets out a
new insolvency procedure for banks, based on existing liquidation
provisions. I should like to respond directly to the question posed by
the hon. Member for Fareham about the use of the term
&#147;insolvency&#148; here. We use it because the draftsman
thought that it would be a more natural, modern term in this context
than liquidation.</div>
<a name="08111394000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000310"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Why, then, is the draftsman inconsistent later in
this part of the Bill? Clauses 86 to 92 are headed &#147;Process of
bank liquidation&#148;, which seems a very archaic use of
words.</div><a name="08111394000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000311"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I suspect that the answer is that insolvency can
involve liquidation and administration too. We would need to refer to
existing law. In due course the draftsman may put words into my mouth
so that I can respond
further.</div><a name="08111394000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to respond the point made by the hon. Member for Gosport about the
importance of the existing insolvency law. There has been extensive
consultation between the Government and insolvency practitioners in
this area. We believe that we have the right sort of balance in terms
of ensuring a fast payout procedure, while having a system of law with
which insolvency practitioners are already familiar. The fact that
there has not been a flood of suggested amendments to the clauses from
those outside who follow these matters shows that there is strong
consensus in this
area.</div><a name="08111394000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s objective is to ensure effective protection for
depositors and to minimise the impact of a bank failure, while also
providing for the orderly winding up of the affairs of a failed bank in
the interests of its creditors generally. I shall set out the thinking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>behind the clause. In doing so, I hope to provide an overview for future
debates on the bank insolvency procedure, which is established in part
2 of the Bill. The procedure will enable prompt FSCS payments to be
made to eligible depositors or their accounts to be transferred to
another institution. It will also provide for the winding up of the
affairs of a failed bank in the interests of creditors as a
whole.</div>
<a name="08111394000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about allowing depositors fast access to their funds in the event of a
bank failure is an important one. As my hon. Friends on the Treasury
Committee noted, it is not just the level of FSCS compensation payout
that is important&#151;the speed of payout is also vital. The
Chairman of the Committee, referring to moves to raise the compensation
limit to &#163;50,000,
stated:</div><a name="08111394000099"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is far more important that banks be able to identify who their insured
depositors are, and that the FSCS be able to process compensation
claims quickly.&#148;</div>
<a name="08111394000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making fast payout to
depositors is indeed crucial. For depositors of UK banks to have
confidence in the system, they need to be sure that the payment will be
made quickly, and that they will be able to access their deposits
quickly. Measures to enable depositors to access their funds quickly
are important for their own sake, but also to build confidence in the
banking system as a whole, and for the maintenance of financial
stability.</div><a name="08111394000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to comments by the hon. Member for Gosport, I shall talk
briefly about how the new bank insolvency procedure has been developed.
An established feature of the UK insolvency system is the existence of
special insolvency regimes for industries where failure poses unique
challenges&#151;for example, water, energy and rail. Those special
regimes are based on provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986. Like those
special insolvency regimes, the bank insolvency procedure is a unique
process. However, it is based largely on existing provisions in UK
insolvency law and practice, particularly relating to the compulsory
liquidation of companies. It is worth emphasising the point that,
during our consultation process, stakeholders constantly referred to
the strength of the existing insolvency regime in the UK, noting its
advantages over other insolvency regimes
internationally.</div><a name="08111394000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Markets Law Committee put it very well in its response to the
April consultation
paper:</div><a name="08111394000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
existing corporate insolvency laws in England and Wales...provide for
one of the most versatile and effective insolvency regimes in the
world. They are often used as a model for jurisdictions improving or
developing their
laws.&#148;</div><a name="08111394000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a fairly comprehensive endorsement; other stakeholders made similar
points about the insolvency provisions. They were anxious, therefore,
that the Government should not make substantial changes. Bearing that
in mind, we are confident that our approach is the right one.</div>
<a name="08111394000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bank
insolvency procedure builds on the strength and effectiveness of the
UK&#146;s existing insolvency regime, closely following existing
insolvency law and practice. It will be familiar to companies and their
professional advisers. We have not changed the statutory priority order
of creditors. Consistent with existing special insolvency regimes, it
is a court-based procedure, which means that it can be commenced only
by a court order, and the whole process will be subject to the overall
supervision of the court. That will ensure transparency, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>legitimacy and compliance with the Human Rights Act and provide a forum
for dispute resolution. Many other provisions remain substantially the
same as existing insolvency law, as we shall note when we come to the
relevant
clauses.</div><a name="08111394000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
with the existing special insolvency regimes, the bank insolvency
procedure has some specific features to reflect the unique challenges
of winding up a bank, and the Government&#146;s specific objectives
of protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability. As I have
mentioned, the key difference from normal insolvency is that as well as
providing for the winding up of a bank&#146;s affairs, the process
will enable prompt FSCS payments to eligible depositors, or else allow
for a bulk transfer of their accounts to another institution. To that
end, the liquidator of the bank will have specific statutory
objectives: to work with the FSCS to enable prompt payouts to eligible
depositors or to facilitate the bulk transfer of accounts to another
institution; and to wind up the affairs of the failed bank in the
interests of creditors as a whole. The authorities and the FSCS will
have a key role in the early stages of the proceedings to oversee and
work with the bank liquidator to ensure that those objectives can be
met.</div><a name="08111394000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have used the word &#147;liquidator&#148;. Let me explain. The word
&#147;liquidation&#148; has to be used later in the Bill, because
it is the technical, legal term. In the overview clause, we can be
looser, more familiar and clearer with the readers, but we have to be
precise when it comes to the details of the
Bill.</div><a name="08111394000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
77 outlines the bank insolvency procedure in broad terms. A bank enters
the process by court order, appointing a bank liquidator. The bank
liquidator aims to arrange for the bank&#146;s eligible depositors to
have their accounts transferred or to receive compensation from the
FSCS. To achieve that, the bank liquidator will work with the initial
liquidation committee, made up of the authorities and the FSCS. When
that is done, the bank liquidator winds up the bank. To carry out those
functions, the bank liquidator has the powers and duties of a
liquidator in normal insolvency as applied and modified by clauses that
we shall discuss
subsequently.</div><a name="08111394000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that by giving a lengthy introduction to clause 77, I
have set out clearly the Government&#146;s thinking and the
principles that were applied in framing the subsequent clauses. They
have been consulted on to a very large extent and have the broad
support of insolvency
practitioners.</div><a name="08111394000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000312"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> While listening to the Minister&#146;s
careful explanation of the clause, I wondered whether liquidation
insolvency is a one-way street. If a liquidator were to be appointed
and found that he was in a position to manage the bank out of its
current difficulties, would he have the powers to do so? Would he have
the powers of a manager as well as of a
liquidator?</div><a name="08111394000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000313"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that we are talking about a
bank insolvency procedure in relation to which decisions have already
been taken that the bank has failed to all intents and purposes and is
not viable as a business. It is in those circumstances that a court
order is made and liquidators are appointed. It has gone past the stage
when there is any realistic prospect of life in the body, as I
understand it, so the role of the liquidator is
to&#151;</div>

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): In that case, why do we have
clause 101, which refers to a liquidator who thinks that administration
would achieve a better result? That provision exists in the Bill. The
Minister&#146;s answer was clear, but I wonder how it applies to
clause 101, which allows administration as a legitimate objective, not
just
liquidation.</div><a name="08111394000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000315"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am about to stand corrected. My understanding
was obviously far from perfect, because I am advised that bank
liquidation can end in a number of ways. I suspect that the way I was
describing is the most likely, but if rescue is possible, it is
certainly possible to convert to administration to assist a rescue. I
hope that answers the questions asked by the hon. Member for
Gosport.</div><a name="08111394000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000316"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to
clause 80(4)(a). As I understand it, no de minimis limit
applies, so if a bank was unable to pay a sum that was due&#151;say,
&#163;10&#151;the insolvency procedure could be triggered, but how
does that interact with the threshold conditions? We have established
that the stabilisation powers will be operated only if the FSA believes
that the threshold conditions have been breached. Presumably, there
would have to be a material breach of the threshold condition about
adequate resources to trigger some of the Bill&#146;s processes. Is
there a gap between that approach to triggering the procedures and the
approach in subsection (4)(a), which I suspect is fairly standard, but
which suggests that an inability to pay a trivial amount could trigger
them?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div><a name="08111394000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000318"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The clause is important because it sets the two
objectives for the liquidator. The first is about the depositors and
ensuring that the liquidator works with the FSCS to ensue
that</div><a name="08111394000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
soon as is practicable each eligible depositor...has the relevant
account transferred to another financial institution,
or...receives payment from (or on behalf of) the
FSCS.&#148;</div><a name="08111394000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second objective
is</div><a name="08111394000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
wind up the affairs of the bank so as to achieve the best result for
the bank&#146;s creditors as a
whole.&#148;</div><a name="08111394000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
subsection (4) makes it crystal clear
that</div><a name="08111394000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Objective
1 takes precedence over Objective
2&#148;.</div><a name="08111394000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
creates a situation in which the interests of one group of creditors
take precedence over the interests of other groups. A depositor
preference is being built into this regime. We might find that the
liquidator, to fulfil objective 1, incurs additional costs to the
detriment of achieving objective 2. That particularly applies to the
administration procedure in part 3, but it also applies here. For
example, the liquidator might need to keep the branch network open for
two or three weeks to enable payments to be made to depositors. Running
a branch network is an expensive business&#151;rent has to be paid,
staff have to be employed, there are computer costs and so on. Those
costs will be not be borne by the depositor group, but by the
creditors, who will find that their dividend or distribution on
liquidation is lower as a consequence. Will the Minister comment on
that?</div>
<a name="08111394000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
move away from the traditional way that administration and liquidation
work. The creditors would normally rank pari passu, but here there is
one subset of creditors&#151;the depositors&#151;who are given
preferential treatment over the others, to the detriment of other
creditors.</div>
<a name="08111394000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linked to
that is a point that has been raised with me by some lawyers. The
Minister was right in his remarks on the previous clause. There has not
been a flurry of commentary on part 2 or part 3 of the Bill, but that
does not mean that there is total satisfaction. There is great
dissatisfaction with it. The credit institutions reorganisation and
winding-up directive 2001&#151;I am sure that we are all intimately
familiar with it&#151;enables the same legal process and procedures
for winding up a credit institution to apply in all the then EU states,
but now European economic area states.</div>
<a name="08111394000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
is a formality. That directive is predicated on treating creditors
collectively and applying the same treatment. The Minister referred to
the special insolvency regimes for railways, water and electricity.
Yes, there are special cases to ensure that there is a transfer of
functions, but in those situations all creditors are treated equally,
whereas in this situation one group of creditors will have
preference.</div><a name="08111394000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern
has been expressed that the action taken by our good friend Iceland was
not deemed to be consistent with the directive because it was seen to
be of a regulatory nature. The concern expressed to me is that
objective 1 could suggest&#151;and there is a stronger argument for
this in part 3&#151;that the procedure is not necessarily about
insolvency, but is principally a regulatory issue. I would be grateful
for the Minister&#146;s confirmation that he believes that the bank
insolvency process is entirely consistent with the directive. I hope he
can satisfy the Committee on that point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div><a name="08111394000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000319"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause gives the bank liquidator specific
objectives and he or she will be expected to start working towards the
achievement of both objectives as soon as the proceedings
commence.</div>
<a name="08111394000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
briefly explain the background. A bank liquidator&#146;s first
objective as specified in the clause is to work with the FSCS in the
initial stages of the proceedings. The liquidator has two options: to
ensure that the accounts of eligible depositors are transferred to
another financial institution, thereby providing those depositors with
continuity in banking services, or to work with the FSCS to ensure that
those depositors receive prompt compensation payments to enable them to
rearrange their financial affairs and meet day-to-day living
expenses.</div>
<a name="08111394000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
authorities remain committed to a target of seven days, providing the
depositors of a failed bank with at least a proportion of their
deposits and the balance within the following few days, though we
recognise that this is a challenging target. A bank liquidator&#146;s
second objective is to wind up a failed bank through realising its
assets and distributing the proceeds to the bank&#146;s
creditors.</div><a name="08111394000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the legislation provides for objective 1 to take precedence over
objective 2, as the hon. Member for Fareham suggests, it is very clear
from subsection (4) that a bank liquidator is obliged by the
clause to start working towards achieving both objectives as soon as he
or she takes
office.</div><a name="08111394000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, only an insolvency practitioner who has sufficient resources
available to make sure that both objectives can be successfully
achieved would be appointed as a bank liquidator. So, while some staff
are working towards achieving objective 1, others will be carrying out
functions as they would in a normal liquidation, for example gathering
information from directors, identifying and protecting the assets of a
failed bank for the benefit of all its creditors, dealing with
enquiries from creditors and so
on.</div><a name="08111394000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the size and complexity of UK banks, it is likely that more than one
insolvency practitioner, perhaps from different firms where necessary,
will be appointed as bank liquidators. That is called a joint
appointment and is provided for by the application of section 231 of
the Insolvency Act 1986 in clause 90 of the Bill. This is common
practice in complex or high profile insolvencies and will ensure that
sufficient resources are available to protect depositors, while
conducting the proceedings in the best interests of the failed
bank&#146;s creditors as a whole.</div>
<a name="08111394000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. There has been some concern
from stakeholders that, because the bank liquidator&#146;s primary
objective is to work with the FSCS, this may lead to depositor
preference, with other creditors losing out. I will respond to those
concerns directly and put it on the record that the bank insolvency
procedure does not introduce depositor preference.</div>
<a name="08111394000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory
order of priority of creditors remains unchanged. Payment to depositors
will be made by the FSCS, not from the assets of the failed bank. The
FSCS will continue to rank as an unsecured creditor alongside the
claims of other ordinary creditors. It is also important to note that
under clause 110, any compensation payments to eligible depositors will
be made by the FSCS.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000320"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister has clarified that, but in the context
of clause 86(2)(a), as depositors are flipped over into another
institution, they will be replaced as creditors by the
FSCS.</div>
<a name="08111394000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000321"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Yes, that is my understanding. We are not
introducing depositor preference. The difference is that we want to pay
out fast to depositors. That is the purpose of the measure, and what
the Treasury Committee wanted us to
do.</div><a name="08111394000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have described, the bank liquidator is also obliged to wind up the
affairs of the company from day one in the best interests of creditors
as a whole. As we can discuss, if necessary, in relation to clause 87,
in a normal winding-up, a liquidation committee would not even be
formed until a month or two into the proceedings. Given that we are
aiming for eligible depositors to be paid within seven days, and that
the liquidator will be working on both objectives at once,
realistically, in comparison with a normal insolvency, there will be no
delay in the start of winding-up in the interests of all
creditors.</div><a name="08111394000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
objectives and the other provisions in part 2 mean that when a bank
fails, the interests of both eligible depositors and other creditors
will be protected. The key purpose is to ensure fast pay-out, without
disadvantaging other creditors, and certainly without introducing
depositor preference. I am happy to clarify
that.</div><a name="08111394000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000322"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b><b class="B"> T</b>he Minister alluded to the liquidation
committee, and it is interesting that in the first instance it will
consist of three individuals, one each nominated by the Bank of
England, the FSA and the FSCS. Given that from the outset, the
liquidator is supposed to work towards achieving both objectives 1 and
2, why are creditors not represented on the committee at that stage,
and why is it that only when a full payment resolution has been made,
creditors may be represented on the
committee?</div><a name="08111394000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the liquidator is working towards both goals, surely a representative
of the creditors should be on the committee to represent their
interests. The Minister said in response to clause 86 that the FSCS
would not stand in the stead of depositors when their money has been
paid out. That reinforces the point that the creditors rank second to,
and not alongside, other
depositors.</div><a name="08111394000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000323"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> No, they do not. Creditors are excluded only from
the initial liquidation committee, because of the need for quick action
to ensure that depositors receive their compensation or have their
accounts transferred as quickly as possible. The initial liquidation
committee will be formed by the Bank of England, the FSA and the FSCS,
who will work with the bank&#146;s liquidator to ensure that
appropriate arrangements are in place for a transfer of accounts, or to
ensure that eligible depositors are paid quickly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div><a name="08111394000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that the FSCS should be part of that initial liquidation committee,
because it will be a large creditor. However, when a bulk transfer of
accounts has taken place, or payments have been made to eligible
depositors&#151;we want that to happen within seven days for at least
a proportion of their funds, with the balance following in the
subsequent few days&#151;the liquidation will then proceed in much
the same way as normal, and creditors will be able to form a
liquidation committee if they wish.</div>
<a name="08111394000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a normal
insolvency, a meeting of creditors may decide on formal liquidation,
but it would be a month or two before any meeting of creditors is held,
so the timing in the Bill should not delay things. We are saying only
that creditors other than the FSCS would be excluded from the initial
liquidation committee. However, very quickly, once a bulk transfer and
the arrangements that I have outlined are made, we would move towards a
normal liquidation situation. In those circumstances, creditors would
be expected to be part of the liquidation
committee.</div>

Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): It is very unusual to
have a liquidation committee with no creditor representation. I can
understand that the Minister does not want that representation
initially, but he cannot argue that it is a matter of speed. If there
was a formal committee with the Bank of England, the FSA and the FSCS,
it could certainly include a creditor. I would have thought that
general creditors would be happier to have some representation right at
the beginning. I cannot see a problem with that, unless the Government
have a principled
objection.</div><a name="08111394000153"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000325"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let us compare this to the process for a normal
liquidation. We are talking about an initial fast front-end process and
a committee consisting of the FSCS, the Bank of England and the FSA,
working with the liquidator to ensure&#151;probably in
most circumstances&#151;a quick bulk transfer of accounts or fast
payout. After that, the rump of the liquidation would go through the
normal process, with creditors involved on the liquidation committee.
That is how I envisage the process
operating.</div><a name="08111394000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000326"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If it is a fast front-end process, does the
Minister envisage the initial liquidation committee lasting for only
one or two weeks, rather than for several months? After all, we have
talked about payments made within seven days and we saw the transfer of
deposits from Bradford &amp; Bingley to Abbey Santander literally
overnight. Subsection (6)(d) suggests that the FSCS may resign from the
liquidation committee. Presumably, if it was still a creditor of a bank
and did not choose to resign, it would remain part of the liquidation
committee and other creditors could
join.</div><a name="08111394000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000327"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I have been trying to explain, we are talking
about a two-stage process. I likened it to an initial fast front-end
process. Normally, a month or two into the winding-up proceedings, a
liquidation committee would be formed at the request of creditors
following a meeting of those creditors. The arrangements we are
discussing are not the normal way of doing things; we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>have proposed them to try to speed up the process. That is the purpose
of subsections (1) and (2), which provide that following the making of
a bank insolvency order, a liquidation committee must be formed made up
of representatives from the Bank, the FSA and the FSCS. Those are the
appropriate bodies to be included in the initial liquidation
proceedings.</div><a name="08111394000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000328"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> In a normal situation, the Minister would be
correct, but the situation is abnormal. Huge assets are being removed
from the enterprise, which desperately affects the remaining creditors.
Unless he has a particular objection, I cannot see why there cannot be
provision for a creditor to be on that committee, just to represent the
interests of all the other creditors. I do not see what harm there is.
It can only be of benefit, can it not?</div>
<a name="08111394000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000329"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> A key point in response to the hon. Gentleman is
that the assets are not being removed from the liquidation. The FSCS
pays out when it comes to depositors and will become an ordinary,
unsecured creditor as part of the liquidation. Once we have moved from
stage one of the process, we move to stage two. Once eligible
depositors have been paid by the FSCS, or their accounts have been
transferred, the liquidation committee will pass a full payment
resolution. Following that, if the creditors elect to continue with a
liquidation committee they will take the place of the authorities on
that committee, so we move into a normal liquidation phase. Many of the
formalities concerning membership and the role of an ordinary
liquidation committee are set out in secondary legislation and
subsection (7) preserves that position for the bank insolvency
procedure.</div>
<a name="08111394000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
important. It provides the authorities with a key role in the early
stages of the proceedings. It enables the FSCS to make a fast payout
and then to stand in the shoes of depositors by being an ordinary
unsecured creditor. Then we move to the second stage of the
liquidation, where the creditors would take the place of the
authorities on the liquidation committee and events would proceed as
with the normal liquidation process with which people are familiar. In
our view, that is a sensible measure, which combines procedures that
will be familiar to companies and their professional advisers with the
short, first phase that we believe is important if we are to achieve
the objectives of the bank insolvency procedure&#151;to ensure a fast
payout through the
FSCS.</div><a name="08111394000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

objective 1(a), then the hybrid of 1(a) and 1(b) and, perhaps as a last

in respect of subsection (1)(c). If not, they would obviously resort to
objective 1(b). In the clause, we give the authorities all the options,
but we have to be clear that bulk transfer of accounts would be the
preferred option if someone were willing to take the accounts, and if
the expenses of the bank liquidator cost the FSCS less than paying out
compensation. However, we need to operate case by case. It would be up
to the authorities to make the best decision, based on the information

amendment provides for the appointment by a court of a provisional bank
liquidator, following an application for a bank insolvency order.
Clause 82(3) specifies that a bank must be given notice of an
application for such an order. That is important, because to ensure
compatibility with human rights legislation, it is necessary for the
directors of the bank or other parties to put their case to the court
against the making of the order. That is a standard approach in
insolvency
proceedings.</div><a name="08111394000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will thus be a gap between making the application for an insolvency
order, and the court hearing that considers whether it should be made.
It is crucial to avoid the possibility of a run on the bank or any
other scramble for assets during that period. In an ordinary compulsory
liquidation, if it is considered that assets may be at risk in the
period between the filing of an insolvency application and the making
of a winding-up order, the court may appoint a provisional liquidator,
without notice if necessary, to protect the interests of creditors. The
amendment applies that provision to the bank insolvency
procedure.</div><a name="08111394000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being
able to appoint a provisional bank liquidator will protect the
interests of all creditors. For example, such a liquidator should be
able to take steps to shut down operations, preventing any scramble for
assets. In practice, the period between the application for a bank
insolvency order and the court hearing is likely to be hours only, but
the court&#146;s facility to appoint a provisional bank liquidator
will be a useful provision if the court needs to adjourn a
hearing.</div><a name="08111394000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
possibility of appointing a provisional liquidator is consistent with
ordinary compulsory liquidation, in which a provisional liquidator can
be appointed under section 135 of the Insolvency Act 1986, after a
winding-up petition is filed and before the hearing for the making of
the winding-up order. Such an appointment is generally sought only when
it is more or less certain that the court will make a winding-up order.
A provisional liquidator has powers specified by the court, generally
to protect or preserve a company&#146;s assets pending the
appointment of a liquidator and the making of the winding-up order.
Provisional liquidators are common in high-profile and/or complex cases
where assets are perceived to be at risk 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>following an application for winding up, such as in situations where it
is thought that the directors might attempt to dispose of assets prior

liquidation, therefore, exists to protect the interests of creditors.
The Committee should note that the provisional bank liquidator&#146;s
powers are limited. For example, modification (e) means that a
provisional bank liquidator may not pay dividends to creditors. Neither
would the provisional bank liquidator be able to facilitate the payout
to depositors under objective 1, as they would have to wait for a
recommendation from the liquidation committee on what option under
objective 1 to pursue. Any ambiguities about the powers of the
provisional liquidation would be clarified by the court when the
appointment was made. We believe that the amendment is necessary and
will help to ensure that we can continue to protect
creditors.</div>

that</div><a name="08111394000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;money

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000340"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause sets out the role and functions of the
FSCS in relation to a bank insolvency. It provides that the FSCS can
impose a levy, under its powers in part 15 of FSMA, in order to be able
to meet the expenditure under part 2 of the Bill. The word
&#147;expenditure&#148; in subsection (2) covers both the areas
that the hon. Gentleman asked about. I hope that that clarification is
helpful to the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000341"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a slightly odd question, but does the
acquirer have to make a payment to recognise the economic value of the
accounts being transferred from the failed bank to a new institution?
Of course, in accounting terms they would be transferred at their book
value, but the acquiring institution will gain economic value from
them, because it has picked up a new raft of current or depositor
accounts and some may be profitable, even in these straitened
times.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000346"></a>The

Government amendments Nos. 161, 162, 175 and

<a name="08111394000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000347"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments concern the secondary legislation
that will set out rules for the bank insolvency procedure, the BIP, and
the bank administration procedure, the BAP. Government amendments Nos.
160 to 162 mean that the general BIP rules for England and
Wales&#151;those that do not affect court procedure&#151;will be
made with the concurrence of the Treasury, rather then the Secretary of
State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Rules that affect
court procedure will be drawn up with the concurrence of the Lord Chief
Justice, as usual. The Treasury, rather than the Secretary of State,
will make the rules for Scotland. Government amendments Nos. 175 and
176 make the same provision for the
BAP.</div><a name="08111394000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have done this because the Treasury rather than the Secretary of State
for BERR takes policy responsibility for banks. The BIP and BAP have
been designed with specific objectives, which have been set out by the
Treasury. It is right that the Treasury should take responsibility for
agreeing the rules to make the procedures function in pursuit of those
objectives. It is likely that the rules for the BIP and BAP will draw
on existing insolvency rules. Throughout, the Government&#146;s
approach has been to ensure that we follow existing insolvency
provisions as closely as possible, as I have previously outlined to the
hon. Member for Gosport. In considering the rules for the BIP or BAP,
the Treasury will draw on the expertise of BERR, the Insolvency Service
and others in the practitioner
community.</div><a name="08111394000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000348"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> It is recognised that it will be necessary
to have insolvency rules to supplement and change the Insolvency Rules
1986, which themselves are a gloss on the Insolvency Act 1986. This is
obviously important. Will the Minister tell us when we can see these
new insolvency rules, because a firm and early timetable would be
reassuring for practitioners?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000352"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> New clause 19 is a straightforward amendment to
correct an omission in the original drafting. Clause 115 deals with the
use in evidence of statements made in the course of insolvency
proceedings. It simply extends existing provisions of the Insolvency
Act 1986 to the bank insolvency procedure. New clause 19 is a technical
Government amendment that simply replicates the provisions of clause
115 for the bank administration
procedure.</div><a name="08111394000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000353"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> The clause gives the Treasury the power to
apply the bank insolvency procedure to building societies, with any
necessary modifications. This will be achieved by secondary legislation
using the affirmative procedure. Clause 118 that follows relates to
credit unions. I hesitate to risk your wrath, Mr. Gale, but
could the Minister respond in terms of credit unions as well as
building societies? What is the Government&#146;s intention with
regard to bringing forward secondary legislation by way of affirmative
procedure? Do the Government intend a short time frame or does this
provision give the Government power to introduce the secondary
legislation in due course?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 505</div><a name="08111394000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000354"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think my wrath might be risked on that. Would
the Minister like to respond to
both?</div><a name="08111394000270"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="08111394000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000355"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Yes, Mr. Gale. In line with our
objectives of protecting all depositors and maintaining financial
stability, clause 117 gives the Treasury a power to extend the
provisions of the BIP to building societies and clause 118 gives it the
power, if necessary, to extend it further to credit unions. We
consulted widely on this issue and extending the special resolution
regime to building societies and credit unions is strongly supported by
stakeholders, including the Building Societies Association. The reason
why detailed provision for applying the BIP to building societies has
not been put on the face of the Bill is that insolvency legislation is
complex and building society and credit unions have their own legal
features, which differ greatly from those of
banks.</div><a name="08111394000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that
time needs to be taken to ensure that procedures are brought forward
that work for building societies and are fit for purpose. The
Government will consult on the necessary regulations, which will be
laid before the House in due course. The hon. Member for Gosport
presses me on when that is likely to be. The best answer I can give is
&#147;soon&#148;. That is not a definite response, but we do not
intend to delay this matter. We want to continue to ensure protection
for depositors, whether they are in banks, building societies or credit
unions. The new insolvency procedures for building societies and credit
unions will be very similar to the provisions in the BIP. That has been
welcomed by
stakeholders.</div><a name="08111394000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111394000356"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Obviously the clause will give the Secretary of
State powers to include Scottish partnerships as institutions that
might fail and therefore be required to be covered by the special
regime and so on. However, I am sure that he knows, because I am sure
that the Accountant in Bankruptcy has already advised the Government,
that if a partnership fails it is dealt with by sequestration rather
than liquidation. That does not appear to be anywhere in the Bill.
Notwithstanding the table of modifications or comments on other pieces
of legislation, which was in a previous clause, the clause does not
appear to take cognisance of the sequestration rules and law that apply
in Scotland in relation to partnerships. So can I have confirmation
that that will be changed, or can the Minister simply confirm that this
new insolvency procedure will apply with the necessary modifications as
per the previous table which describes the bits of legislation and how
they will now be interpreted?</div>
