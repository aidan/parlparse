							<a name="08012298000516"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Welcome to another day of our
deliberations; it continues to be a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I believe that we have copies of the
<i class="I">Official Report</i> of last Tuesday, when we debated the Ways and
Means resolution on the Floor of the House, which relates to this group
of amendments. Those hon. Members who are anxious to see the full
detail of the arguments should apprise themselves of the record, which
will save some time. The amendments seek to secure the operational
independence of the office of the health professions adjudicator. As I
speak, copies of the <i class="I">Official Report</i> are arriving, and I refer
hon. Members to column 796 of the <i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 January
2008, when we dealt with the Health and Social Care Bill Ways and Means
resolution on the Floor of the
House.</div>
					<a name="08012298000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the amendments to be complete and effective, the Committee should bear
in mind that an amendment removing the Secretary of State&#146;s
responsibility for setting levels of remuneration and allowances for
the chair and members of the OHPA is also required. With
that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>caveat at the outset, amendment No. 213 would give the OHPA, rather than
the Secretary of State, the power to determine whether, how and to what
extent it pays or makes provision for the payment of pensions,
allowances and gratuities to current or former chairs, or members of
the OHPA.</div>
					<a name="08012298000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 215 would allow the OHPA to determine the compensation that it
would need to award. If the Minister were to smile upon the principle
of the amendments&#151;I hope that he has a sunny disposition this
morning&#151;an amendment would be needed to line 8 to give the OHPA
the power to determine when it is right for a person ceasing to hold
office as the chair of the OHPA to receive such compensation.</div>
					<a name="08012298000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 218 and 220
would remove the power of the Secretary of State to direct the form in
which the OHPA keeps its accounts and prepares its annual accounts. I
note that amendments Nos. 217 and 219 are grouped for debate
immediately after this group. They have a bearing here, and if the
Chairman would like me briefly to mention them now, I will do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012298000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000517"></a>The
Chairman:

following
amendments:</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000518"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful. As my points on
amendments Nos. 217 and 219 are brief, I will tack them on to my
comments on the larger group of amendments under discussion. Amendments
Nos. 217 and 219 are consequent to the removal of the Secretary of
State&#146;s power over the form of the accounts&#151;I can see why
they were in a separate group, as their effect might depend on a vote.
I am extraordinarily hopeful that the Minister will smile upon the
amendments and therefore this grouping makes sense. The amendments are
to ensure that the OHPA keeps auditable accounts.</div>
					<a name="08012298000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
221 would make the OHPA produce copies of its annual report within six
months of the end of the year. There seems no reason for the period not
to be enshrined here, other than to recognise that if the OHPA were
unable, for good reason, to produce accounts within the specified
period, its remedy would be, first, the force of law, and secondly,
applying to have the publication of accounts postponed, although only
for a short period. I cannot see why it is not appropriate to put a
realistic time on the face of the Bill, as it would rightly reduce the
Secretary of State&#146;s power in the area and provide for clearer
expectations. Amendment No. 222 would remove the power and discretion
of the Secretary of State in the
matter.</div>
					<a name="08012298000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The General
Medical Council is currently independent from
Government, and the Government are seeking to remove its adjudication
function. While we have discussed whether that is necessary for any
reason other than public perception, the amendments deal with a
different issue. If the OHPA is to be established, it should be on
similar terms to the GMC in order to give it the confidence of the
profession and the public. As the Bill is drafted, while the OHPA is
independent of Government in, for example, regulating its own
procedure&#151;delineated in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>paragraph 11 of schedule 6&#151;and while those appointments which it
does not make itself are overseen by the Privy Council, it should be
noted that in terms of its finances it has a duty to report to the
Secretary of State. The Committee will remember that in her oral
evidence on 8 January 2008, <i class="I">Official Report,</i> column
38, Lady Justice Smith noted that she was &#147;sympathetic&#148;
to the GMC&#146;s point.</div>
					<a name="08012298000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">This measure
makes even less sense given that the professions, through fees levied
on the GMC and the General Optical Council, will foot the Bill, yet
they will have no power over the operational effectiveness and value
for money delivered by the OHPA. It is unfortunate that other than my
hon. Friends on the Conservative Benches, who, I am pleased to say,
were all present, the Minister and the Government Whip, there were no
members of the Committee present for the debate on the Floor of the
House last Tuesday on the Ways and Means resolution that made this levy
possible. I note that the Liberal Democrat spokesman on health, who is
not a member of this Committee, was there. I hope that the Committee
has had a chance to catch up with the proceedings that took place on
that occasion, and I hope that after that debate and these questions
the Minister will reflect that the amendments are both appropriate and
timely. We need to ensure that we underpin independence and put
motivations and incentives in place for the OHPA not only to wish to
take responsibility, but to have the chance to deliver on its
responsibility in running an independent, but appropriate,
organisation.</div>
					<a name="08012298000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addressing
the amendments, I hope that the Minister will make it clear why the
Bill states that this body should report to the Secretary of State, and
I hope that he will also take the chance to explain the revelation made
by the GMC during the oral evidence, that it was only in late November
last year that the OHPA&#146;s lack of independence was suggested by
the Department in negotiations with the
GMC.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I will be brief in the hope that I
have a voice left at the end of the day.</div>
					<a name="08012298000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the spirit in which amendments Nos. 213 to 215 and 221 to 222 have been
tabled, and concerns have been raised about the independence of the
OHPA from the Secretary of State. I have slightly less sympathy with
amendments Nos. 218 and 220, which deal with the form that the accounts
will be kept in. Presumably, some public money is involved in the
organisation, and it is entirely right for the Government to have some
direction over the clarity with which accounts are presented. I realise
that amendments Nos. 217 and 219 were tabled to ensure the accounts
will be auditable, which was an attempt to achieve clarity in another
way, but it is right that, through the Secretary of State, Parliament
has a chance to scrutinise the matter.</div>
					<a name="08012298000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000520"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health
(Mr. Ben Bradshaw):
						</b> As the
subject will probably take up much of this morning&#146;s
proceedings, as well as addressing the points raised by the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Eddisbury, I want to make a few general
remarks about the independence of the OHPA, which is a theme that runs
though this morning&#146;s clauses, schedules and
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08012298000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the Committee remembers that the status of such
organisations is not defined by their name or definition, but by the
powers given to them by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>Parliament. As a result of the powers that we intend to give the OHPA in
the Bill, it is likely that the OHPA will be defined by the Office for
National Statistics as an executive non-departmental public body, which
is a type of arm&#146;s length body. The GMC&#146;s powers and the
proposed powers for the OHPA are similar in many respects&#151;for
example, as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, both bodies have the
power to make rules that are then subject to approval by Privy Council
negative resolution procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012298000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does
that mean in terms of independence? An ENDPB does not have to refer any
of its professional judgments back to the sponsoring Department; it
does not have its professional decisions overturned by the Department
or Ministers; it does not have to explain to the Department why it has
made any professional decision; and it does not have to give the
Department details of its professional decisions. The key aspect of the
independence of the OHPA is its panels and their independence of
judgment. There is total independence in the panels&#146;
professional decisions, and Ministers will have no power to interfere
in any adjudication decision made by them.</div>
					<a name="08012298000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Romsey has mentioned, however, the OHPA is a public body
that will be set up with public money. Although it will mostly be
funded by the professionals who use it, it is likely to receive some
ongoing public money, which means that clear lines of accountability to
Ministers and Parliament are important. The Committee and the GMC have
expressed concerns, which were raised in the debate on the Ways and
Means resolution, about having proper controls over the OHPA&#146;s
costs. That is precisely why we expect the OHPA to be an ENDPB, which
is a tried and tested model that will allow the OHPA complete
independence from Government in every aspect of the adjudication
function and the Secretary of State and the Treasury to ensure that the
fees charged are
reasonable.</div>
					<a name="08012298000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could refer to plenty of models of successfully operating
ENDPBs&#151;for example, the Independent Police Complaints Commission
and the Financial Services Authority. In the area of health, other
examples include Monitor, the Appointments Commission, the Council for
Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and the Healthcare Commission itself.
All those bodies have demonstrated their independence from sponsoring
Departments in decision-making processes.</div>
					<a name="08012298000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State will have the power to make directions in a limited sphere and
only with regard to payments and loans made to the OHPA by the
Secretary of State. Let me state this clearly because it is one of the
assurances that the leaders of the GMC sought: that is the only power
of direction in the Bill that the Secretary of State has with regards
to the OHPA; they will not be given a general power of direction, and
the power to direct in schedule 6 is strictly limited to making
payments and loans to the OHPA. As recently as last week, I had
detailed discussions with the leaders of the GMC, who were reassured by
that. The hon. Member for Eddisbury has referred to Lady Justice
Smith&#146;s support for the expressions of concern about
independence, but I recall that when we asked what alternative Lady
Justice Smith favoured, she did not suggest one, which was also true of
the GMC in its evidence.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>
					<a name="08012298000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="08012298000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
appointments, GMC lay members are appointed by the Privy Council,
although in practice, that is delegated to the Appointments Commission.
As recommended in our White Paper, &#147;Trust, Assurance and
Safety&#148;, that is being altered, so that all members of the GMC
are appointed by the Privy Council. The Bill provides for the Privy
Council to appoint the chair, the non-executive members and the first
executive members, and it is expected that the Privy Council will make
use of the Appointments Commission for those positions. In that
respect, there will be no difference between the appointment of GMC
members and the OHPA members. I hope that that is the reassurance that
hon. Members are seeking on the independence of the appointments
system.</div>
					<a name="08012298000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to remove the power of the Secretary of State to make
determinations on remuneration and allowances for chairs and members,
pensions and the form of the OHPA&#146;s accounts. For the reasons
that I have just described, it is important that the Secretary of State
has those powers. In the debate on the Ways and Means resolution,
Opposition Members emphasised the importance of proper financial
oversight, and one of the main concerns at the GMC was that the level
of fees would not simply
escalate.</div>
					<a name="08012298000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 221 and 222 specify the time scale with which the accounts should
be laid, but we do not think that the independence of the OHPA should
be fettered in that regard. Amendments Nos. 217 and 219 concern
auditability. We recognise that there needs to be proper financial
propriety and accountability, but the accounts of public bodies are
auditable simply by the virtue of their existence. In addition, one of
the mechanisms by which that is guaranteed by the Bill is the role of
the Comptroller and Auditor General in carrying out an audit of the
annual accounts. That means that all the OHPA&#146;s financial
affairs will be subject to audit, and nothing will be exempt from that
requirement. We do not think that the amendment is necessary, so I ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
it.</div>
					<a name="08012298000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000521"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> It is interesting to have the report on the
further discussions that the Minister had with the GMC. I am glad that
he had them, not least in the light of the comments made by Lady
Justice Smith during the oral evidence session. I fully accept his
general statement of principle that the name of a body does not
describe whether it is independent&#151;it is the powers granted to
it, and the accountabilities and authorities that are contained within
its strategic and operational procedures. I also accept that nobody is
arguing for an alternative model and that the issue concerns the
current framework.</div>
					<a name="08012298000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once one
accepts that the OHPA will come into existence and that it will be
carved out of the current GMC, it becomes important as a matter of
principle to decide, having established that model, the expectations of
its true ability to be unfettered. Regardless of how unfettered such a
body might be, if public money is used, there must be accountability,
not least towards moneys, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman addressed
two of the amendments on that basis.</div>
					<a name="08012298000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed that the Minister has decided that amendment No. 221,
which would make the OHPA produce copies of its annual accounts within
six months 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>of the year end, is over-fettering. That seems to be the one area where
one should lay out the expectations on being accountable for public
money and put an expectation of time upon that. In many ways, that
gives the cover for all the rest to be much more independent, because
one would have an approximate time period between the operations and
the accountability by ensuring that accounts were produced and
presented within six months, which is a really tight time frame in
accounting terms.</div>
					<a name="08012298000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
therefore not persuaded that the Minister has demonstrated that there
is a true prescription for independence from Government. We should not
underestimate how much the GMC has delivered on success. That is a
different approach with the OHPA than has hitherto been the case, and
it has come about not because the GMC was regarded as having failed,
but to retain the best parts of what it has been able to deliver in
this area, including independence from Government. There is an
opportunity to maintain trust with the public and to retain the
confidence of the profession. It is vital that we have that
complementariness in the process. On that basis, I will put the
amendments to the test, including amendments Nos. 217 and 219 if that
is acceptable, by seeking to divide the Committee on amendment No.

					<a name="08012298000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing amendment, so I shall not trouble the Committee with a
Division. It is useful to note that members of the OHPA can be members
of the civil service pension scheme, which further highlights the
closeness of the OHPA to the Government. I am also concerned that the
Government are voting yet another liability on the civil service
pension scheme. As the Committee will be aware, the Chief Secretary to
the Treasury is still too embarrassed to reveal to the House the
state&#146;s liability for public sector pensions. The estimate is a
year overdue, but actuarial firm Watson Wyatt estimates that the
liability today could be as high as &#163;960 billion. Given the size
of the liability, I am concerned that the Bill puts no limit on the sum
that the Minister for the Civil Service might determine.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>
					<a name="08012298000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I noted in
the debate on the Ways and Means resolution, the OHPA is effectively a
tax-generating body through the combination of its fee structure and
its dependence on the Government. In it, we see doctors, opticians and
associated professionals funding a Government body directly. Not only
are there no effective checks and balances on how the OHPA spends its
money&#151;the Committee is effectively examining a blank cheque that
the Government are writing but which the professionals will have to
pick up&#151;but what is there to prevent the Minister for the Civil
Service from squeezing extra money out of the OHPA, and consequently
doctors, to pour into the public sector pensions black
hole?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000539"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, it is
custom and practice for executive non-departmental public bodies to be
able to join the civil service pension scheme, which does not mean that
their employees become civil servants. The problem with the amendment
is that it removes the requirement for the OHPA to make payments to the
Minister for the Civil Service, although it would be able to receive
benefits from the civil service pension scheme, which it could join by
virtue of paragraph 15 without being required to make a payment into
it. In our view, the amendment is flawed, and it is perfectly normal
for people who work for ENDPBs to be eligible to join the civil service
pension scheme.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000543"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Amendment No. 223 seeks to include the regulatory
bodies in the list of persons to whom the OHPA must send copies of its
annual accounts. Amendment No. 224 gives the regulatory bodies, in
addition to the Privy Council, the power to direct the OHPA as to
matters dealt with in the report. The amendments do not establish what
we are truly seeking&#151;effective control of the operating costs of
the OHPA by the bodies, and ultimately the professions, which fund it.
It would be wrong of the Committee to propose a cap on OHPA spending,
because it must have the resources to adjudicate fitness-to-practise
cases in a timely and effective manner. Having said that, there need to
be more effective checks and balances to potential profligacy than the
Bill currently provides. As the Committee knows, full GMC registration
on the medical register will rise to &#163;390 a year with effect
from April 2008, having been frozen at &#163;290 per annum since
2002, and GOC registration stands at &#163;169 pounds per annum.
Those costs will presumably go up again given the creation of the OHPA,
because while the adjudication costs should remain substantially the
same, two bodies invariably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>cost more than one to run. That is not rocket science, and it would be
helpful for the Minister to indicate by what amount he expects the fees
to
escalate.</div>
					<a name="08012298000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the oral evidence-taking session, Sir Graeme Catto noted that while, in
his opinion, the GMC did not think that the move to the civil standard
of proof would have, in terms of numbers</div>
					<a name="08012298000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any significant effect at the
serious end of the spectrum...There may be an impact on doctors
whose practice has failed to a lesser
extent&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">although,</div>
					<a name="08012298000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
impact is likely to be small&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister tell the Committee what
sort of increase the Department is expecting in the number of
adjudications, as that obviously plays into any debate on the costs of
the
OHPA?</div>
					<a name="08012298000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its written evidence, circulated to the Committee yesterday, the GOC
noted</div>
					<a name="08012298000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provisions of
paragraph 19 of Schedule 6 as to financial accountability. There are
provisions elsewhere in the Bill allowing representations to be made to
OHPA regarding the fees paid to OHPA by the regulators. However, there
is no mechanism for the regulators to take further any concerns they
may have over excessive expenditure (hence higher fees) should those
representations not be met with an adequate response.... We
acknowledge that OHPA must be independent of, and not accountable to,
the regulators. There should, however, be a mechanism to ensure proper
oversight of OHPA&#146;s expenditure that takes into account the
views of the regulators.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In support of
the amendments, it also
said:</div>
					<a name="08012298000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would expect the regulators to be provided with OHPA&#146;s annual
accounts and business plan, and to be invited to provide comments on
those documents to the Secretary of State. We would welcome these
arrangements to be provided for in the Bill. If they are not to be
provided for in the Bill, we would expect to see these in the
regulations to be made under new clause
7(1)&#148;.</div>
				
					<a name="08012298000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister now tell us what the running costs, as a distinct item
from the adjudication costs of the OHPA, will be? Will that come out of
the fees, or from a Government grant? In the debate on the previous
group of amendments, the Minister said that it would be, at least in
part, a publicly funded body. I hope that the amendment and a direct
question will flush out from him precisely what will be the split
between those costs that will be recoverable through fees and those
that will effectively be a subvention on the public purse. I also hope
that there are sustainable expectations that it will remain a public
subvention rather than something that will be clawed back from doctors
themselves over time, notwithstanding that in our view the Government
have not established that the OHPA is effectively a public body rather
than an independent
body.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08012298000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
powers will the profession and the current councils have over value for
money issues with the OHPA? What protection will the profession have
from continual fee hiking? What guarantees are there that the Committee
is not voting for a blank cheque and what increase in adjudications
will the move to the civil standard bring? Some questions about the
Privy Council, to which the Minister alluded in his more general
remarks at the beginning of the previous group of amendments, may be
more appropriate for a stand part debate. Therefore, I move the
amendments on the basis of the arguments just
advanced.</div>

Gidley:
						</b> I have no problem with amendment No. 223. Given
the arm&#146;s-length, but hopefully in some way joined-up,
relationship between the regulatory bodies and the OHPA, it is
important that the regulatory bodies receive the reports.</div>
					<a name="08012298000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
slightly more difficulty with amendment No. 224. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that there needs to be some mechanism to scrutinise spending.
He mentioned the increase in fees of the GMC and I know from my own
profession that provisions in the section 60 order were responsible for
a big fee increase that did not go down well among the profession. I
assume that it is the same with doctors. Having said that, the
mechanism advanced by the hon. Gentleman is rather over-prescriptive
and although he wants greater financial clarity, it seems that the
amendment as drafted provides room for professional games
playing.</div>
					<a name="08012298000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000545"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> It is worth reminding the Committee at this
stage that the genesis of the OHPA was concerns
resulting from the Shipman inquiry about the
independence of the adjudication system from the medical profession.
The hon. Gentleman seemed to be more concerned about independence from
Government. I warn him that in pushing the amendments&#151;I will
come back to this in a moment&#151;he is taking us back into a sphere
where the organisation would not be as independent from the profession
as I am sure he would want it to be.</div>
					<a name="08012298000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 223, which is about sending a copy of the report to the relevant
regulatory bodies, clause 100 already requires the OHPA to make public
information relating to it and the exercise of its functions. It is
anticipated that, in line with best practice, the publication of its
annual reports will be carried out in that manner. We do not think that
requiring it additionally to send its reports to the regulatory bodies
is
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08012298000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 224 seeks to confer the power to direct the content of the OHPA
annual report on to the regulatory bodies. We do not think that it
would be appropriate for the regulatory bodies to direct the OHPA,
which we are setting up to be independent. It is important that the
OHPA&#146;s decisions are seen to be made in an independent manner.
The whole point is to set up a body that is independent from the
regulatory bodies and therefore from the professions. Even if that
problem could be overcome, we do not think that it would be appropriate
for the regulators that use the services to say what information the
OHPA should provide in its annual report. Although the regulators may
use the OHPA services, it should not be accountable to them for how it
discharges its adjudication functions per se. That is dealt with
through the power of appeal to the High Court that the regulators have
if they are concerned that the OHPA is making decisions that are too
lenient. On those counts I hope that the hon. Gentleman is
reassured.</div>
					<a name="08012298000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
fees, which we discussed at rather more length than most of us were
expecting during the debate on the ways and means resolution, I
indicated that the estimated current cost of the General Medical
Council&#146;s adjudication is around &#163;11.5 million a year.
That would be apportioned between the regulatory bodies using the
OHPA&#146;s services. However, I went on to add that the GMC is
currently engaging a firm of financial advisers, which is undertaking
an independent assessment of the costs, and it expects that report to
be available by the end of January. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>shall look at that very carefully. As I also made clear in the ways and
means debate&#151;and this was one of the GMC&#146;s
concerns&#151;the Government have said that we will meet the set-up
and transitional funding costs of establishing the new organisation. We
will also help out where High Court referrals could create a potential
burden, such as when the appeals courts overturn a decision. We do not
think that it would then be fair to expect those costs to be met by the
GMC, the equivalent organisation or their members.</div>
					<a name="08012298000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a
sudden increase in costs&#151;one could imagine a Shipman or
equivalent type of inquiry&#151;there is a power in the Bill for the
level of fees to be varied throughout the year, for them to be reviewed
and for the regulatory bodies to appeal against decisions. The fee
setting will also be subject to full consultation when the regulations
are
discussed.</div>

Mr. Hood, and I would not want to disappoint you. The Privy
Council has various powers  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>under schedule 6, notably the appointment of the chair, non-executive
members, the first executive members, removal of members and
regulations concerning those responsibilities. While the explanatory
notes state, in relation to the Council for Healthcare Regulatory
Excellence,
that:</div>
					<a name="08012298000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

					<a name="08012298000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">they make no
mention of either the Appointments Commission, or the

appointments. Does the Minister agree that the councils should have a
right of recommendation to the Privy Council for executive and
non-executive members, rather than the power of recommendation lying
solely with the Department? Can he also clarify the actual process that
the use of &#147;Privy Council&#148; signifies in schedule 6? That
would be a helpful clarification before we decide whether the schedule

						</b> In response to the last question, the reason for
that system is that it most closely replicates the existing system of
appointments to the GMC. The OHPA will be the UK-wide body, hence we
have the Privy Council route; the Privy Council covers the whole of the
UK. The professions, including the GMC, were concerned that that should
be the case. As I said earlier, we have included provisions in schedule
10 that allow the Privy Council to delegate its powers of appointment
regarding the board members, through directions. We have done that
following discussions with the Privy Council and I would fully

schedule 7, page 135, line 6, leave
out &#145;must&#146; and insert &#145;may&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
inserts a new section into the Medical Act 1983 that provides for the
GMC to publish guidance on what are known as indicative
sanctions&#151;that is, what sort of sanctions should be applied to
the doctor depending on the facts found by the adjudication panel. In
addition, the OHPA must take account of the guidance and new section
40A, which is set out in paragraph 11, provides the GMC with powers to
refer decisions to the relevant court on certain grounds such as
leniency.</div>
					<a name="08012298000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it
is intended that the OHPA will be a separate and independent body with
an overall adjudication function, the new provisions I have outlined
will allow the GMC to continue to determine the sanctions that should
apply in fitness to practise decisions and the OHPA must take account
of such guidance in making its determinations. Further, the GMC will be
able to challenge decisions by the OHPA panels on a number of grounds.
The amendment is an attempt to provide the OHPA with greater
independence. The Minister spoke 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>earlier about the need for that, and the fact that it was highlighted by
the Shipman case, but it is not clear in the Bill that the OHPA will be
as independent as it should be.</div>

							<a name="08012298000552"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Schedule 7 inserts a new section into the
Medical Act 1983, allowing the regulator to publish
guidance on the factors affecting the
registrant&#146;s performance and the appropriate sanctions. The
provision of such guidance follows Lady Justice Smith&#146;s
recommendations as part of the Shipman
inquiry:</div>
					<a name="08012298000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Urgent
steps should be taken to develop standards, criteria and thresholds so
that decision-makers will be able to reach reasonably consistent
decisions at both the investigation and the adjudication stages of the
FTP procedures and on restoration applications.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under schedule 7, the OHPA will be
required to take account of such guidance in exercising its functions;
the guidance will not be binding and it will make its final decision
based on the facts of each individual case. The amendment would remove
the requirement on the OHPA to take account of the guidance and replace
it with an optional duty to do
so.</div>
				
					<a name="08012298000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="08012298000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
GMC has and will retain responsibility for setting and maintaining the
standards required of doctors. The guidance on the standards is
published as good medical practice and is widely regarded as setting
the international standard for medical practice. The GMC currently
publishes guidance for use by its fitness to practise panels when
considering what sanctions to impose following a finding that the
fitness to practise of a doctor may be impaired. Currently, the medical
and lay panellists appointed to sit on the panels exercise their own
judgments in making decisions, but they must take into consideration
the standards of good practice that the GMC has established, which have
been drawn up&#151;and will continue to be drawn up&#151;after wide
consultation, and which reflect what society expects of
doctors.</div>
					<a name="08012298000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">To allow the
OHPA discretion as to whether it will take account of that guidance
would, we believe, be likely to lead to confusion and possibly even
challenge about the conduct and outcome of cases. We think that it is
right and proper that the OHPA should take account of good practice
guidance, which is after all the basis on which the cases will be put
before its panels. That is why we have placed the obligation on the
OHPA in the Bill. As I have said, the panels will not be obliged to
follow rigidly the guidance published, but they must take account of
it. Given those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Lady will feel able
to withdraw her amendment.</div>

					<a name="08012298000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to make only those who are legally
qualified eligible to be chairs of fitness to practise panels. We note
that under schedule 6, the chair of the OHPA must be legally qualified
and that clauses 96 and 97 make provision for legal and clinical
assessors respectively to give relevant advice to fitness to practise
panels. I ask the Committee to bear in mind the fact that there is a
cross-referral from clause 93 to clause 104, which is the standard of
proof clause. Due to the way in which the Bill is drafted, we find
ourselves debating this element before we come to the standard of proof
element, but I am sure that members of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>Committee will recall the evidence of Lady Justice Smith in relation to
both matters, particularly on understanding the question of grading the
proof required when moving to the civil standard of proof. That would
not pose problems for somebody who was legally qualified, as I will
come on to when we debate clause 104, but she expressed concern about
the chairs of the panels not being legally
qualified.</div>
					<a name="08012298000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lady Justice

a disciplinary tribunal is a job for a legally qualified person, not a
lay person. Legally qualified people who appear in front of such
tribunals are capable of running rings round the tribunal if no one on
the panel is legally qualified. The proceedings would take a lot longer
than they needed to if there was not a legally qualified chair. You
would achieve a much higher standard of reasoned decision if you had a
legally qualified chair because writing a judgment, which is what such
a decision is, is a job that requires professional
expertise.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and

					<a name="08012298000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">She was referring to
recommendation 79 in her fifth report of the Shipman inquiry, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08012298000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the event that the GMC retains control of the adjudication stage, it
should appoint a number of legally qualified chairmen who should, as an
experiment or pilot, preside over the more complex FTP panel hearings.

there are benefits, whether in terms of the improved conduct of
hearings, more consistent outcomes, improved reasons and/or fewer
appeals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note in
particular that the recommendation is conditional on the GMC retaining
control of the adjudication stage, which of course it is not, and that
pilots are sought on more complex hearings. At the time of the inquiry,
she also explored the possibility with Sir Donald Irvine, the former
president of the GMC, who
noted:</div>
					<a name="08012298000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think the arguments are pretty closely balanced, but I think on balance
I would stick with a non-legally qualified Chairman provided that
people are well trained and that there is a very good legal
assessor.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
her oral evidence, Lady Justice Smith brought out the issue of having
if not legally qualified chairs, at least a legally qualified person on
the panel, which would fit into the Bill most obviously at clause
93(2). While clause 96 makes provision for a legal assessor, there is
no requirement for fitness to practise panels to have a legal assessor
in full-time attendance. During my examination of the Minister in an
evidence-taking session, he said that the Government would be willing
to look at the issue of legally qualified chairs and
were</div>

					<a name="08012298000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful,
therefore, if he will give me the reference for that assertion as I
cannot see it in the GMC&#146;s evidence. It is vital to make the
link between what the Minister said and the GMC&#146;s evidence on
that point. As I read it, the GMC was more at pains not to give extra
work to lawyers&#151;as someone who has not practised for 19 years,
that comment cannot be levelled at me&#151;and to point out the
constantly high quality of the decisions that its fitness to practise
panels make.</div>
					<a name="08012298000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
helpful communication from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking
(Mr. Malins) who is both a lawyer and sits on the GMC panel.
He makes the following point, which is important in case anyone thinks
that the amendment is a veiled criticism of the calibre of the people
who are currently chairing the
panels:</div>
					<a name="08012298000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have sat under about a dozen chairmen. One of these is, as it happens,
an ex clerk to the Justices and a solicitor and he is tip top. Under
him, cases rattle on at a correct and proper
pace.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">He compliments the
person and goes on to say that they are doing well. I will not read out
the whole letter, but my hon. Friend points out how essential training
is&#151;not least in matters of procedure and law&#151;for the
system to work well. Considering the new scheme that the Government
have put in place and Lady Justice Smith&#146;s concern about the
absence of legally qualified chairmen, we have reached the point where
if we are to make any difference to and improve what the GMC has done,
it should be without criticism of the past because that would be both
disproportionate and unfair. The amendment provides something extra to
enable us to ensure that future prospects are
improved.</div>
					<a name="08012298000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in response to my questions on the civil standard of proof, when Lady
Justice Smith prayed in aid for her argument in favour of legally
qualified chairman she
said:</div>
					<a name="08012298000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;How
the measure works in practice will require considerable training. That
is one of the reasons... for having a legally qualified chairman.
The chairman will understand how it works. If you tell a lay person how
to apply the sliding or variable standard of proof, they might find
themselves in some difficulty, but a lawyer would
not.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social Care
Public Bill Committee, </i>8 Jan 2008; c. 40, Q71.]</div>
					<a name="08012298000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, although I thank
the Minister for his earlier willingness to consider the issue more
closely, I have shown that a number of considerations need to be
addressed: the change that the creation of the OHPA delivers, the
impact and interpretation of the civil standard of proof, the
complexity of the case before the panel and the length of time it takes
to conclude a
panel.</div>
					<a name="08012298000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was the GMC&#146;s understanding that the Bill did not preclude the
selection of legally qualified chairs. I believe that to be true, but I
would be grateful if the Minister could confirm it. However, for the
legally qualified person to be eligible to chair, they would have to be
on either the lay members list or the professional members list, so
they have two eligibility hurdles to leap, rather than just one. Would
it not be sensible for the Bill to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>make some provision for future regulations concerning either a legally
qualified list or a demarcated legally qualified constituency in both
lists?</div>
					<a name="08012298000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the evidence I have laid before the Committee and the advice of such
wise heads, it would be advantageous for the Department to follow Lady
Justice Smith&#146;s original recommendation and at least set up a
pilot to establish whether legally qualified chairs make a substantial
difference. If the Minister is amenable to that idea, the Bill should
be framed to reflect most effectively the outcomes of those
pilots.</div>
					<a name="08012298000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister recognises that the hearings could be made more efficient
through the use of legally qualified chairs. I also hope he recognises
the power of Lady Justice Smith&#146;s contention that the silver
standard of proof would be better administered by a legally qualified
chair and that it might be useful to pilot
that.</div>

system works, with the skills set to harness the arguments and present
them in a reasonable form, should not be dismissed lightly. Even if the

further at the provision. I was persuaded by Lady Justice Smith that

							<a name="08012298000568"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>As I have indicated, we agree with what
Lady Justice Smith said and that a legal chair might add some
discipline to proceedings, which could be helpful in lengthy and
complex cases. However, we are not convinced that the panel would need
a legally qualified chair in every case of fitness to practise, as the
amendment would require.</div>
					<a name="08012298000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give a
couple of examples that might be helpful. For instance, if the issue at
stake is the physical or mental health of the practitioner, one might
argue that it would make more sense to have a medically qualified,
rather than legally qualified, chair. A legally qualified chair would
probably be unnecessary in review hearings where the panel is
considering whether continuing restrictions are required. The same
applies to conviction cases where the panel considers a case that has
been handled in the courts, or in determination cases where the panel
is considering a decision by another regulator, perhaps one from
abroad. Findlay Scott referred to those concerns in his evidence to the
Committee. He did not specifically say that there may be cases where a
medically qualified chair would be preferable, but he implied it
strongly when he said that he did not see a need for both legal
assessors and a legally qualified
chair:</div>
					<a name="08012298000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
we have sought to do within the current arrangements is persist with
the model based on the legal assessor but occasionally have legally
qualified chairs where that is an
advantage.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and

it is not necessary to have a legally qualified chair, but what we are
trying to do, and what we will try to do on Report, is to think about
the matter and bring back something that will meet the concerns raised

impression that if fitness to practise was applied to someone with a
health concern they would be dealt with by a different panel to the one
dealing with someone who is bad. In that case, it would be fairly easy
to make a distinction between the two. It is not enough to have
somebody who is medically qualified. For example, a surgeon may have
little sympathy with mental health problems. Therefore, we need to
finesse some of the Minister&#146;s
arguments.</div>

that have been raised. Will he also accept that that was Lady Justice

the panels. It is also worth bearing in mind that Lady Justice
Smith&#146;s recommendations were informed by a particular case,
which was very lengthy and complex. It would be unwise of the Committee
to ignore the fact that many of these cases are more straightforward.
As the GMC argues, its current system, in which it sometimes has
medically qualified chairs, works very well in some of the simpler,
less legally complex cases.</div>

							<a name="08012298000573"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I recognise that the Minister has said that he
will go away and consider the matter. He said that he might be able to
bring some proposals forward on Report and we look forward to that.
However, the argument is quite significant. In the evidence sessions
and in Committee, we have had to focus on and think carefully about the
issue. We all recognise the seriousness of the matters that the fitness
to practise panels will have to deal with; there will be grades of
seriousness and grades of consequence. Ultimately we are talking about
the trust that we and our constituents have in the medical profession,
and the trust that the medical profession has in the
process&#151;whether it will be dealt with properly and efficiently
and with the requisite understanding. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth rightly said in his intervention, there are things
that will be common to all the cases, such as the matter of
procedure&#151;in other words, a legal understanding of the way that
justice operates and, as Lady Justice Smith said, the need to ensure
that there is capacity to have the professional skill and capability to
be able to right a judgment.</div>
					<a name="08012298000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we go back
to my famous and beloved Venn diagrams, that would be the outer circle.
Instead of having another overlapping circle, there would be another
circle within that circle for cases that require medical expertise.
What we are discussing is where the default should lie. Should the
expectation be that there is always a legally qualified chair and the
rest should be done through advice from panel members and assessors,
including the medical profession; or should the default be that we
should not presume that we need the legal expertise or the
qualification because we will not always need traditional procedural
skills, notwithstanding the commitment to
training?</div>
					<a name="08012298000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that because we have sought to indicate that by picking up on
where things were already heading with the proposals for pilot, because
Lady Justice Smith gave some reasoned and cogent evidence and because
the Minister promised to return to this matter on Report, as I hope he
will, I could take the opportunity to withdraw the amendment. However,
I decline to do so. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>want to test the Committee so that it can be put on the record that we

understands the distinction between lay and professional balance on the

professional balance on fitness to practise panels, which is the issue
that we are contending with here. The amendment would keep a proper lay
and professional balance on fitness to practise panels, particularly
when the panel consists of more than three individuals, and would avoid
too large a majority either way. The Bill does not seem to provide that
guarantee. I would also be grateful if the Minister could give the
Committee an idea of how he envisages that point being addressed in

First, it could preclude a simple majority decision by a panel;

solely to maintain parity between lay and professional members, and,
thirdly, it should be noted that the rules of some of the regulators,

						</b> I want to pose a few questions to the Minister on
legal assessors, which bring us back to the debate that we had on
amendment No. 204. I am curious about what assessment has been made of
the cost and effectiveness of legal assessors and how it would compare
with a system in which there was automatically a legally appointed
chair. Bearing in mind the arguments about time made by Lady Justice
Smith, I wonder how the decision to have legal assessors has been
arrived at. Some clarity about costs and effectiveness would be helpful
in informing our decision, because there is no doubt that we shall
return to the matter on Report.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> I, too, would be interested in answers to those
questions. Also, following our debate on amendment No. 204 to clause
93, which to my great surprise and disappointment the Government did
not feel minded to accept, we know that the Government do not accept
that there will be a legally qualified chair. Given that, we need to
understand whether legal assessors will be on the fitness to practise
panels for their whole duration, or whether they will be ad hoc,
popping in and out. That is significant in deciding what we might
return to on Report, so I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s
views on the importance of access to legal advice and qualified,
skilled
people.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the
matter. I did not make an argument about costs in our earlier debate on
amendment No. 204, which would have required all panels to have a
legally qualified chair. To have that requirement and a requirement for
legal assessors to be available would be unnecessarily duplicative and
add costs. I think that that was one of the General Medical

concerns.</div>

response to the hon. Lady&#146;s question, we have not assessed the

have legally qualified chairs. I hope to be able to say a little more
about that on Report.</div>

about the new provisions because health cases are currently heard in
private. Will the Minister clarify under which circumstances a hearing
may be held in private and whether that would be for health cases only
or whether there would be a trigger point? I assume that that has to be
decided case by case by somebody: who would make that decision and what
framework would be available for them following that decision? While we
all believe that openness and clarity are important in such cases,
there are occasions where that has to be balanced against sensitive

it sounds as if she is limbering up for not supporting us in any vote.
I am sure that that is not true and that I will be able to persuade
her. The clause as drafted makes the OHPA seek the views of the groups

take account of such views.</div>
					<a name="08012298000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 225, 206, 227, 226 and 228, which we have tabled, all amend clause
102. They seek to strengthen the consultation process by ensuring a
full and public response from the OHPA to any consultation on rule
changes. The amendments would require the published response to detail
where specific views have been expressed by the Council for Healthcare
Regulatory Excellence or the regulatory bodies, and that would also
strengthen transparency in decision making by the OHPA. Amendments Nos.
226 and 228 specifically relate to the role of the Privy
Council&#151;this may be the point that the hon. Lady sought to have
elucidated&#151;given that it has to approve the rules because of the
way that we have a trans-internal national

							<a name="08012298000603"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> My curiosity was piqued by the fact that I have a
hazy understanding of what the Privy Council does. In my own regulatory
body, I am frequently told that we must do things because the Privy
Council has told us to. I have spoken to a number of Privy Councillors
who say, &#147;I don&#146;t know anything about that.&#148; I
have looked on the Privy Council website and it is very obscure as to
who actually advises the Privy Council. It seems to be a back-door
method by which the Department of Health can impose its will. If the
measure is aimed at greater clarity in Privy Council decision making, I
fully welcome it. I have had some difficulty in tracking the process of
Privy Council decision making because the decisions do not seem open to
any public scrutiny.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000604"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> It would stray beyond the scope of the amendment
to give even my extraordinarily limited understanding of the workings
of the Privy Council, other than to recognise that, as I understand,
&#147;Privy&#148; is not intended to signify that it should be
withheld from scrutiny and accountability when done in the names of us
all. It is a council whose first and primary loyalty is its adherence
to the monarch. Because of our constitutional arrangements, the
sovereign powers of law making are in Parliament rather than with the
monarch, and it is effectively a form of delegated administrative
implementation. Therefore, the Privy Council always acts upon
constrained and tight legal advice. That is as far as I dare to take
it, without getting into a debate.</div>
					<a name="08012298000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments were deliberately designed&#151;and I think that this is
the satisfaction that the hon. Lady seeks&#151;to require the Privy
Council to respond to any representations made by the two regulatory
bodies, whose registrants are covered by the OHPA. If the Privy Council
cannot give such a public statement, through this it would have the
power to direct others to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>make statements on its behalf, or indeed through the Department. The
main point is that there is transparency and accountability through the
publication of these matters.</div>
					<a name="08012298000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will help to ensure confidence in the new body, by adding
much greater transparency to its decision making process for patients,
the public and indeed doctors. It will ensure that there is clarity
about any rule changes and those reasons will, I think, be
critical&#151;I dare say that that is not a point of contention. It
is also important for the OHPA to ensure that it fully considers the
views of the regulatory bodies that have long-standing experience of
dealing with adjudication in fitness to practise cases, and have the
primary interest in the effective application of their own
standards.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000605"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> This, and the next couple of clauses deal with
accountability, consultation and patient and public involvement. It may
be helpful if from the outset I remind the Committee about the extent
of patient and public involvement in the OHPA.</div>
					<a name="08012298000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
lay members on its board and, under clause 93, there will always be a
lay member on its hearing panels. Under clause 100, the OHPA will be
required to keep the public informed of its activities and, under
clause 101, it will have to consult. Under clause 102, it will have to
consult on drafts of its rules&#151;specifically with bodies that
appear to represent the interests of patients and other persons whom it
considers appropriate, including regulatory
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08012298000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to address those matters in a number of specific ways.
I stress that, as an executive non-departmental public body, the OHPA
will be expected to follow best practice on consultation as set out in
the Government&#146;s code of practice. Criterion 4 of that code
states that feedback should be
given</div>
					<a name="08012298000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regarding the
responses received and how the consultation process influenced the
policy.&#148;</div>

specific statements within the criterion cover how responses should be
analysed with particular attention given to representative bodies. The
consultation should state when and where the summary responses will be
published, an explanation should be given of how to respond to specific
questions, and information should be provided on themes not covered by
the question. The code of practice has proved popular with stakeholder
organisations who regularly participate in consultations. The code has
also been used as a model by other public sector bodies in the

Nos. 226 and 228 place a requirement on the Privy Council to note
representations made to the OHPA by the relevant regulatory bodies. I
have already mentioned that under clause 202 there is a requirement for
the OHPA to consult with other bodies, including regulatory bodies. The
difficulty I have with the amendment goes back to something I said
earlier: it moves away from the OHPA being independent from the
professions and the regulatory bodies who use its services. The
amendment does not suggest the independence that we all want for the
OHPA, particularly if further representations are allowed. In addition,
by providing the regulators with a secondary pathway to make
representations on the rules, the consultation process is undermined
because it would exclude other parties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>specified in legislation and others who may have responded. Any
modification to the rules will be on the basis of discussions between

co-ordination between the OHPA and the CHRE. In practice, I am fairly
sure that the bodies would communicate anyway, but the thrust of
regulation appears to be to try to streamline and unify the mode and
style of regulation. In the briefing that the CHRE provided to some of
us, it said that it expected the procedures of the new body and those
of the regulators to be harmonised over time, where appropriate, so in
the interests of overall best practice, it would be helpful to impose a
duty on both the OHPA and the CHRE to ensure that the whole matter is
joined up and that any changes are made with the maximum exchange of

extend the function of the CHRE to cover the performance of the OHPA,

independent body with statutory functions to adjudicate on matters of
fitness to practise referred to by the GMC and, at a later date, the
GOC, which

					<a name="08012298000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">We reach
another important issue. The Bill allows an Order in Council to
transfer any of the functions of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.
The  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>amendment would limit that power to transferring functions pertaining to
regulation. Currently, the regulation of pharmacy is shared by two
bodies&#151;the RPSGB and the PSNI. The Government have decided to
split the functions of the RPSGB, leaving it with responsibilities for
leadership within the profession and representation of the profession,
as with the Royal Colleges, and transferring its role in regulating and
inspecting pharmacy premises, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to a
new body, the general pharmaceutical council, as set out in paragraphs
1.29 to 1.36 of the White Paper, &#147;Trust, Assurance and
Safety&#148;. As the explanatory notes put
it:</div>
					<a name="08012298000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
RPSGB&#146;s responsibilities towards pharmacists for professional
leadership are potentially in conflict with its role as an independent
regulator for the profession itself. The professions are taking on an
increased clinical role in the treatment of patients, whereby
pharmacists have the autonomy to prescribe potent drugs. Therefore,
this dual responsibility does not provide sufficient reassurance to the
public that there is effective independent regulation of this role.
Separation of the regulatory system from that of professional and
clinical leadership will allow each distinct function to focus solely
on its core role...Amendments are required to section 60 of the
Health Act 1999 to allow an Order made under that section to remove the
statutory function of pharmacy regulation from the RPSGB and the PSNI
and transfer these functions to the proposed General Pharmaceutical
Council.&#148;</div>
				
					<a name="08012298000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012298000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the essence of what we are discussing here. My understanding is that
the RPSGB is happy with the separation of functions, so we will not
quibble with that. In its briefing, it notes that schedule 8 allows the
transfer of</div>
					<a name="08012298000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all of the
RPSGB&#146;s
functions&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">to the General
Pharmaceutical Council. Throughout the discussions between the RPSGB
and the Department of Health, it was understood by both parties that
only the regulatory and directly associated functions would be
transferred. The current wording would allow current or future
Governments to strip all functions of a membership organisation and
place them with an independent body that reports to Parliament. That
would place the profession&#146;s ability to form a professional body
in the hands of a Government who could remove several functions from
the new body and place them within the public sector. The RPSGB
understands that the Government intend to set out in secondary
legislation the functions that are to be removed. The Government have
expressed the aim of extending the remit of that secondary legislation
to include more than regulation. Therefore, we need to be clear whether
they are trying to have it both ways, or whether there is some covert
agenda that has not been fully
exposed.</div>
					<a name="08012298000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
RPSGB maintains that, as the Bill stands, subsequent secondary
legislation could extend the remit further to include most of the
activities undertaken by the RPSGB. Its concerns are supported by
paragraph 329 of the explanatory notes, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08012298000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
primary purpose of the inclusion of subsection (2A) is to ensure that
these statutory functions, which are separate but connected to the
regulation of individual practitioners, are brought within the scope of
section 60, so that changes can be made across all of the
RPSGB&#146;s and the PSNI&#146;s functions where
necessary.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
vital phraseology.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>
					<a name="08012298000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, this will facilitate the transfer of all of the RPSGB&#146;s
and the PSNI&#146;s (subject to a decision by Northern Ireland
Ministers to proceed in this way) functions under these Acts to the
proposed General Pharmaceutical Council which the Government intends to
create in the future by a section 60 order.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to emphasis this next
point:</div>
					<a name="08012298000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
it is also envisaged that these powers will be used to modernise the
requirements in relation to pharmacy premises in
particular.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the
explanatory notes and the memorandum on delegated legislation suggest
that the power will be used on regulatory functions only, there is no
reflection of that and hence no limit to the Secretary of
State&#146;s power in the Bill. That seems particularly obtuse when
our amendment would put it simply and succinctly. Settling that issue
is important not only for clarity of legislation, but because there is
real concern that if the Government wield that amount of power over the
RPSGB, they will severely hamper the body&#146;s ability to criticise
the Government and represent its profession when the time
comes.</div>
					<a name="08012298000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have given no reasons to the RPSGB as to why they want to
create powers beyond the scope of transferring regulatory functions.
While I should note that powers under section 60 are governed by the
affirmative resolution, it is important that the legislation should be
as tightly formed as possible. There is no reason for the
open-endedness of the drafting here. I hope that the Minister will
agree and accept that the amendment has been tabled both to clarify and
to assist him and his Government to be consistent with their declared
approach, which is not reflected in the drafting of the
Bill.</div>

Gidley:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I hope that my voice survives this debate.
I should declare an interest here as a fellow of the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. It is a body to which I pay
considerable sums each year. This measure has caused great concern. It
is worth the Committee noting a little background. The Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is unique among professional
bodies, as it represents the profession and also regulates it.
Sometimes those two functions have not sat easily side by side. Until
fairly recently there was great resistance to changing, but it is clear
from the way that modern regulation is going that a body with a high
proportion of lay membership struggles to become an effective
representative body. I stress that now, except in Luddite quarters,
there is little or no opposition to the splitting of the
functions.</div>
					<a name="08012298000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern, however, about which body is going to do what. Although the
Bill deals only with the setting up of the General Pharmaceutical
Council, the profession has also been vaguely promised that it can set
up a body akin to a royal college, the shape of which is currently
being consulted on in various ways. However, there have been few
promises of any funding, and the Government have, in some ways rightly,
taken a step back and said, &#147;This is for the profession to
decide.&#148; Nevertheless, the joint working in past years means
that some of the society&#146;s functions have become intertwined.
For example, the education department deals with the setting of
standards, which falls neatly into the new GPhC&#146;s remit, but
also deals with other educational matters that are perhaps more
relevant to a body akin to a royal college.</div>

but it is not beyond the wit of man. It is only fair to the society and
its members, at a time when the profession is faced with a White Paper,
community pharmacists have just struggled with a large reclamation of
money for category M products and people are not sure what plans the
Government have for pharmacy, that there be far greater clarity about
which roles are to be transferred to the GPhC and which are not. I
support the amendment fully, because it would force the Government to
come up with some device by which that process can be
undertaken.</div>
					<a name="08012298000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
always a fan of secondary powers, but a clear commitment to regulation
or to putting a list of functions in the Bill on Report would be
helpful. It would give the organisation the necessary clarity in
transferring its regulatory powers to the GPhC by the allotted time.
The process is complex; it is not as straightforward as just saying
&#147;These two departments will transfer to the GPhC and the others
won&#146;t.&#148; I cannot see any reason why the Government would
want to resist a change that would make the process more transparent at
this early
stage.</div>

							<a name="08012298000634"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I have sympathy with the spirit behind the
amendment, but our view is that it is based on a fundamental
misunderstanding of the schedule. There is no possibility of any
functions other than regulatory functions being transferred under the
Bill. The scope of section 60 of the Health Act 1999, which the
schedule is amending, is confined to regulation. It will therefore
enable only functions relating to regulation to be transferred to the
proposed new General Pharmaceutical Council. The schedule also confirms
that an order under section 60 of the 1999 Act cannot be used to
abolish either the RPSGB or the PSNI, as both have functions relating
to matters other than professional regulation. I therefore urge the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div>

there.</div>
					<a name="08012298000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagine
that the concerns behind the amendment are that the appointments
functions of the Privy Council could at some point be transferred to
individuals such as the Secretary of State. That would be an
understandable concern, and I want to assure the Committee that there
is no intention to undertake such a transfer. However, there are
circumstances in which the appointments functions carried out by the
Privy Council might be better carried out by a body other than itself
or the regulator of the profession&#151;the Appointments Commission,
for example, which we have already discussed with regard to the
appointment of members and chairs to those
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08012298000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example of the sort of flexibility that might be needed is with regard
to the appointments of members of councils themselves. As I have said,
at the moment, the Appointments Commission makes the Privy Council
appointments under delegated powers, but in the future we might want to
look at where the bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could
have a role in relation to some of those appointments. Those are the
reasons for the flexibility, and I hope that in the light of that, the

O'Brien:
						</b> Amendment No. 209 is a probing amendment to
clarify the Government&#146;s intentions on the lay-professional
balance on the councils. The Committee will recall that I made a
similar distinction on the fitness to practise panels. Amendment No.
161 has the same probing purpose.</div>
					<a name="08012298000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
209 would amend schedule 3 of the Health Act 1999. As it stands, the
1999 Act prevents the imposition of a lay majority on the regulatory
bodies by secondary legislation. The amendment would ensure clarity of
lay and professional members of the councils of regulatory bodies. The
Bill will allow a lay majority to be imposed through secondary
legislation, through a section 60 order, which is made by Her Majesty
by Order in Council subject to the affirmative resolution. Under
schedule 8, lay majorities could be imposed by secondary rather than
primary legislation, as the current legislative framework requires. The
GMC in particular argued for clarity in the evidence sessions as a way
of strengthening independence from the Government, which is the
dominant provider of health care in the UK, and from any single group.
That independence is critical to ensure continuing confidence in the
regulatory system, as we have discussed many times.</div>
					<a name="08012298000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
memorandum on delegated legislation, the Government note that the
provision</div>
					<a name="08012298000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will allow
councils of health professions bodies to have a lay majority, should
they wish. It will be used as and when such councils request such a
change&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister confirm whether the Government have taken a position on lay
parity or majority? Will the councils truly be free to make such
decisions themselves, or will the Government urge or coerce them? There
is a valid concern that the Government are giving themselves the power
in order to have something to do if and when there is another
professional scandal&#151;there may well be such a scandal. It is not
our job to provide hooks by which the Government can say that they have
done something when, in fact, the authority must rest with the panel
that we are considering.</div>
					<a name="08012298000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000659"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I tabled amendment No. 161 to tease out
some of the Government&#146;s thinking on lay
members. I fully understand the public confidence arguments. The old
regulatory bodies had very low lay representation&#151;a token
handful of members&#151;which did not engender any sort of public
confidence. The numbers of lay members on all regulatory bodies has
increased significantly, and there is a lay voice, as it
were.</div>
					<a name="08012298000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, to
some extent, this is smokescreen approach. No attempt appears to have
been made by anyone to assess the impact of lay members. Has decision
making improved as a result of the greater proportion of lay members?
Do the public have greater confidence in the system? Have they even
noticed what is happening in professional regulation? Alternatively, is
the measure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>simply a sop to the chattering classes who like to talk about public
representation on every board? I do not mean that pejoratively&#151;I
think there are many situations in which we would benefit from
increased public
involvement.</div>
					<a name="08012298000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was fully behind the concept of increased lay representation&#151;I
frequently challenged some in my own profession for being stuck in the
mud on the issue. I thought that the patient voice would be more
central, but, because of the nature of the people who are selected for
such positions, I do not think that that aim has been achieved in the
slightest, if it was ever an aim. Some lay members are extremely good;
others come across as little more than professional committee
sitters.</div>
					<a name="08012298000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The selection
of lay members and what they can bring to the process is an issue. For
example, from talking to health professionals on various bodies about
fitness to practise, I learned that some of them are yet to be
convinced that lay members are necessarily a good thing. That is not,
as I cynically thought, because lay members are harder on the health
professionals. Often the reverse happens. The attitude that doctors, or
whoever it might be, cover up for their colleagues is in the dark ages.
The overriding aim of most health professionals who sit on a
professional regulatory body is that the profession is seen in a good
light. They do not want rotten apples in the barrel and to some extent
they are harder on their colleagues than other people. That is why I
ask whether there has been any change in decision making as a result of
having lay members, and what assessment is being made of the effect
they have
had.</div>
					<a name="08012298000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lady
Justice Smith said in her evidence that she wanted to enhance the lay
voice. I think that that is absolutely right. We are required to
produce an evidence base for many areas of policy these days, so I have
three simple questions. What evidence is there that increased lay
representation improves decision making? What assessment have the
Government made of the impact of lay members and the potential impact
of the lay majority? What attempt is made to balance the skills needed
in an effective regulatory
board?</div>
					<a name="08012298000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000660"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> We are trying to ensure that the councils of the
health professional bodies can move to a lay majority should they wish
to do so. Currently they cannot and to enable them to do so is a
sensible freedom to give. The fact that osteopaths and opticians
already do have or are moving towards lay majorities demonstrates that
there is a desire among some people to do so.</div>
					<a name="08012298000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. Lady&#146;s question, experience of the involvement of
lay members is positive. It is important to remind ourselves that the
genesis of the legislation&#151;the hon. Lady referred to Dame Janet
Smith&#146;s inquiries&#151;is that public and patients need to be
reassured that the professional regulatory bodies are not dominated by
an in-built majority of professionals. That is a fundamental part of
the Bill. All we are seeking to do is to ensure that there is parity on
the professional bodies, which is I think supported by everybody except
the British Medical Association, and that if some regulatory bodies
wish to move to a majority, they can do so&#151;at the moment they
cannot. No one will force them to do it, but if that is what they want,
they should have the freedom to do so. The impact of the amendments
would be to take that away.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister. As I
said, it was a probing amendment and just to make sure the record is
correct, I wish to state that I am grateful to the hon. Lady and her
colleague, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West, for adding their
names to our amendment&#151;No. 161. I mistakenly suggested that they
should lay claim to that amendment. Considering what the Minister has
said, if further issues need to be pursued, there will be more
appropriate moments later.</div>

							<a name="08012298000662"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I noted that the Minister did not respond to what
the Government&#146;s thinking was on the future of the balance. I
think it was the Foster report that said that if the bodies moved to
parity they would be reviewed in a few years, whereas if they decided
on a lay majority they would be left alone for a while. That signals
that the Government&#146;s thinking was to try to move to lay
majorities in all cases. Did the hon. Gentleman get that impression
too?</div>

						</b> We romp on. The Health Act 1999 specifies
secondary legislation cannot be used to transfer core functions of the
regulatory bodies to any other organisation, so the amendments seek to
enshrine in legislation the investigation of the fitness to practise of
their registrants as a core function of the GMC and GOC, and that the
investigation function can be transferred to the OHPA or another body
by recourse to primary legislation only.</div>
					<a name="08012298000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
8(2) of schedule 3 to the 1999 Act enshrines the four functions of the
regulatory bodies as</div>
					<a name="08012298000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;keeping the register of members
admitted to practice, determining standards of education and training
for admission to practice, giving advice about standards of conduct and
performance, administering procedures (including making rules) relating
to misconduct, unfitness to practise and similar
matters.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth function, set out in paragraph 8(2)(d), relating to issues of
unfitness to practise, consists of two separate but key activities:
investigation of a doctor&#146;s fitness to practise, and the
adjudication by panels of individual cases. The argument for separating
the two activities was set out in the fifth Shipman report and
supported by the Government. However, to ensure that the
separation  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>does not lead to the wholesale transfer of investigation as well as
adjudication, the primary legislation should be explicit that one of
the regulatory bodies&#146; core functions will remain the
investigation of a registrant&#146;s fitness to practise. That would
also ensure the integrity of the four functions of the regulatory
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08012298000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000667"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> It is clear from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
words that his concern is what I thought it probably would be: to
prevent the order-making power being used to transfer the role of
investigations to the OHPA. I entirely agree with that point. The
transfer of investigatory powers would be utterly contrary to our
reason for creating the body in the first place, and I can assure the
Committee that we have no intention of doing so. However, it is
important that we ensure to take the right powers now, so that we are
able to make the transfers that the OHPA will need. The role of the GMC
and the GOC, for example, is more than just the investigation of
complaints. They must consider whether the allegations are</div>
					<a name="08012298000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an impairment of fitness to
practise&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">against the
standards that they have set; whether sufficient evidence can be
obtained; whether a case needs to be referred to the OHPA for
adjudication, or whether other action would sufficiently protect the
public.</div>
					<a name="08012298000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Investigation&#148;
hardly covers the presentation of cases to the hearing panel. I think
that Members will agree that that stretches
&#147;investigation&#148; beyond its dictionary limits. Equally,
although the OHPA has no role in carrying out investigations, its
panels may, during the hearing, request the regulatory body to provide
further information that might require additional investigation. One
could argue that that could be defined as an investigatory function,
although it is clearly part of OHPA&#146;s role as an
adjudicator.</div>
					<a name="08012298000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Orders
under section 60 have proved an effective means of keeping professional
regulation up to date, and of responding both to changes and to public
expectation of regulators. The process for section 60 orders requires
public consultation on a draft of the proposed legislative changes, and
the order is subject to the affirmative procedure. It seems highly
unlikely that any attempt to transfer non-adjudication functions would
survive such scrutiny, nor would we ever wish to attempt it. I hope

							<a name="08012298000671"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> We arrive at the proposed high-profile
and significant change to the standard of proof.
Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 are probing amendments to seek clarification
on the role and nature of the civil standard of proof. They are, in
part, an attempt to reflect on the face of the Bill the sliding scale
with which the civil standard of proof is ostensibly applied within
common law. Amendment No. 57 seeks a similar change to clause 115,
which deals with the standard of proof in proceedings related to the
registration of social
workers.</div>
					<a name="08012298000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lady
Justice Smith made three recommendations relevant to this discussion in
her fifth report of the Shipman inquiry. As regards evidence, she said
in recommendation
80:</div>
					<a name="08012298000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
part of their training, FTP panellists should be advised about their
discretion to admit hearsay evidence and other forms of evidence not
admissible in a criminal trial. Panellists should also be advised,
during training, that it is entirely appropriate for them to intervene
during FTP panel hearings and to ask questions if they feel that any
issue is not being adequately
explored.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards
standard of proof, she said in recommendation
81:</div>
					<a name="08012298000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
GMC should reopen its debate about the standard of proof to be applied
by FTP panels. The civil standard of proof is appropriate in a
protective jurisdiction. It is arguable that the criminal standard of
proof is appropriate in a case where the allegations of misconduct
amount to a serious criminal
offence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards
reasons for findings of fact, she said in recommendation
83:</div>
					<a name="08012298000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;FTP
panels should be required to give brief reasons for their main findings
of fact.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">The civil
standard was taken up by the chief medical officer in &#147;Good
Doctors, Safer Patients&#148;, as his first
recommendation:</div>
					<a name="08012298000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
adjudicating upon concerns about a doctor&#146;s performance, health
or conduct, the standard of proof should be the civil standard rather
than the criminal standard... This will reduce the number of cases
where a doctor is not judged &#145;bad enough&#146; to enter formal
General Medical Council procedures but is still a cause of serious
concern to professional colleagues, management or patients in a local
service.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012298000672"></a>
							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
think that it would be helpful if the Minister were to give us some
guidance on how that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>change will be implemented, so that doctors understand that although it
is a change from the criminal standard to the civil standard, the
longer-term consequence could still be that a doctor is found unfit to
practise? Has he had discussions with the GMC and the BMC about how
doctors will prepare for such cases? Although a lot of the drivers in
this part of the Bill have come from some high profile and tragic
cases, in the interests of natural justice, what guidance will be given
to doctors to ensure that they have the right preparation and support
to ensure that they put the evidence in a timely way, given the
potential long-term
consequences?</div>
					<a name="08012298000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000673"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention. If the Minister feels it would be helpful to intervene, I
am happy to give way; otherwise, I am sure that he will address the
matter when he responds to the amendments. That is the test that we
should apply with patients&#146; safety and welfare uppermost in our
minds, while recognising that we are so dependent on the medical
profession that we must ensure that it believes that there is trust and
natural justice in this process.</div>
					<a name="08012298000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, the civil standard was taken up by the chief medical officer
in his report. That report also noted the example of New
Zealand&#146;s adjudication body, the Health Practitioners
Disciplinary Tribunal, which uses the civil standard of proof. The
chief medical officer noted what he saw
as</div>
					<a name="08012298000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;long-standing
discordance in the threshold for determining an unacceptable standard
of practice between the General Medical Council and the NHS
employer...[which] can lead to a situation where a doctor survives a
challenge to continued registration, but is not regarded as someone
whom an NHS employer would trust to look after patients
safely&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">He also noted
that</div>
					<a name="08012298000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is argued by
some that the sanctions imposed by the General Medical Council are so
devastating to an individual doctor&#146;s livelihood and reputation
that the criminal standard of proof must apply (those who advocate this
cite human rights legislation when it is suggested
otherwise)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, the chief medical officer does not make much of
an argument for the civil standard beyond accepting Lady Justice
Smith&#146;s recommendation.</div>
					<a name="08012298000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government White Paper, &#147;Trust, Assurance and Safety&#148;,
noted the Government&#146;s agreements with both Lady Justice Smith
and the chief medical officer. Chapter 4
stated:</div>
					<a name="08012298000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
standard of proof itself refers to the level of certainty that must be
achieved in order to prove disputed facts and is applied only in
determining whether or not alleged facts are found proven...The
criminal standard of proof requires that panels assessing facts about
health professionals must be wholly convinced that the facts are fully
proven, beyond any reasonable doubt, or they must find in favour of the
health professional...Generally, the civil standard requires that
the facts are judged more likely than not to be true (known as
&#145;the balance of probabilities&#146;). However, the civil
standard of proof can be flexibly applied to take into account the
circumstances and gravity of individual cases, with more serious
matters requiring a greater degree of probability of the evidence being
true...The sliding civil scale is already used by the substantial
majority of health
regulators&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">in child
protection cases and employment tribunals.</div>
					<a name="08012298000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
importantly, the White Paper stated:</div>
					<a name="08012298000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is clear legal authority that, in cases of sufficient gravity, the
flexibly applied civil standard, sometimes referred to as the sliding
civil standard, is virtually indistinguishable from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>criminal standard. This is most likely to be applied to cases that are
of sufficient gravity that a health professional might lose his or her
livelihood.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012298000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Trust,
Assurance and Safety&#148; picked up on the theme established by Lady
Justice Smith and the chief medical officer that professional
regulation is a protective jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="08012298000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White
Paper also
argued:</div>
					<a name="08012298000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is currently a perception...that the criminal standard of
proof...acts as a bar or an impediment to the referral of
complaints to the GMC. It is considered that this results in a culture
of hesitancy and reluctance to refer cases to the GMC...The
perception that it is not worth taking action due to the perceived
difficulties in proving allegations to the required standard of proof
potentially weakens public confidence in the health regulators and
threatens public health safety. It is intended that the use of the
sliding civil scale will go some way towards removing this perceived
bar or impediment&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note with concern that, as with the creation of OHPA, the legislative
move seems to be as much in response to perception as to actual fact.
In an answer to a question put by me in the oral evidence session, Lady
Justice Smith restated her commitment to the civil standard of proof
and its location in the common law of England.</div>
					<a name="08012298000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having set
out the political trajectory of the clause, it would be helpful for the
Committee if the Minister were to outline the impact of the move to the
civil standard, which is a point picked up by my hon. Friend the Member
for Tiverton and Honiton. I want briefly to consider the standard of
proof itself, in which case we can judge more carefully how long it
will take to conduct FTP panels, fairness&#151;both within and
between adjudication&#151;changes in the quality of issues referred
to FTP panels and the question of defensive
medicine.</div>
					<a name="08012298000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the standard of proof, it is right to draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to the written submission by the Medical Defence Union, which
argues that</div>
					<a name="08012298000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
criminal standard of proof of &#145;beyond reasonable doubt&#146;
or of &#145;being sure&#146; does not create an artificially high
standard of proof as it does not equate with certainty. A reasonable
doubt is the sort of doubt that might affect the mind of the person
dealing with matters of importance in his own
affairs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
the relevant ruling is Walters <i class="I">v</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>the Crown 1969.
There is also an interesting legal argument, which may be better
pursued in another place, that the civil standard does not offer a
balance of probabilities as precise as 49 to 51 per cent., as Lady
Justice Smith contends. I think that that arises from rulings such as
Lord Bingham in B <i class="I">v</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>Chief Constable of Avon and
Somerset Constabulary 2001 and Lord Phillips in Gough
<i class="I">v</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary
2002.</div>
					<a name="08012298000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister were to outline both the evidence for
the move to the civil standard beyond Lady Justice Smith&#146;s
recommendation and examples where the criminal standard has led to
dangerous or incompetent doctors being allowed to continue to practise.
Linked to that is the question of the fair application of a sliding
scale, rather than a more definite measure. Lady Justice Smith, while
making it clear that she supported the move to the civil standard
whether or not fitness to practise panels have legally qualified
chairmen, asserted that</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>
					<a name="08012298000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a legally qualified
chairman...will understand how it
works.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social
Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c.
38<i class="I">.]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="08012298000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">That poses an
obvious issue of fairness between hearings, as, if the different chairs
are applying the civil standard to different levels, a doctor who would
be found liable under one chairman might be found not liable under
another. It would be helpful if the Minister were to advise the
Committee on the checks within the system, as nobody wants an increase
in costly, time-consuming and psychologically wearing appeals. That is
one of the key points that has arisen as result of this
move.</div>
					<a name="08012298000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000674"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that there may be an
additional layer of complexity? We need to understand whether the
sliding scale in relation to the seriousness of each case relates to
the degree of professional failure or to the consequences of that
professional failure, which are two separate matters and may be applied
differently in different
cases.</div>
					<a name="08012298000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012298000675"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is precisely
right. The question is whether the sliding scale is geared to
perception or reality&#151;until the hearing has happened, one cannot
be sure&#151;of professional failings or the consequence of those
failings. I would add a third aspect, which is the potential sanction
or remedy that is within contemplation. The big question, which I put
directly to Lady Justice Smith in the evidence-taking session, is how
can one know what evidence will be required to prove matters of fact
until and unless one knows the gravity of the matter and the range and
gravity of the potential sanctions, penalties or removal of livelihood
that might be at the end of the process. That is what is so
difficult.</div>
					<a name="08012298000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness,
Lady Justice Smith said in her oral evidence&#151;one of the great
benefits that we have had from that process&#151;that she did not
feel that that was something that I should be over-concerned about. She
said that there has been some experience, which is part of the body of
our common law, and that there is sufficient expertise. However, she
linked that to having a legally qualified chair of the panel. That is
why it was difficult to argue for the amendments in the order that we
have discussed them today, although I understand the procedural reasons
for that. In many ways, it will be helpful to go through the discussion
on Report, because, as the Minister has quite fairly and properly
pointed out, he has it in mind to introduce a measure on a legally
qualified chair
position.</div>
					<a name="08012298000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that we may be interrupted, but the issue is sufficiently
important that we must ensure that we do not rush it unduly. I have
made the point about fairness between hearings and between two
different sets of circumstances and individuals. There has also been
some question over the fairness within a hearing, particularly in
relation to a standard of proof where the bar is raised ever higher as
the hearing proceeds. Neither the Government briefing nor our witnesses
have clarified that for us, other than the somewhat compelling
assurance that Lady Justice Smith was able to command. I would be
grateful, therefore, if the Minister were to touch on that specific
matter in his
response.</div>
					<a name="08012298000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Delay
is also something with which we must be concerned. It is plausible that
hearings will take longer under the civil standard of proof,
particularly at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>beginning. Has the Minister looked at the pace at which hearings under
the civil standard take place, both in our regulators and other
countries, and does he expect either a temporary or permanent increase
in the length of time taken? In light of that, what training will be in
place for those who sit on fitness to practise panels?</div>
					<a name="08012298000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
couple of other areas that I want to cover, and I am happy to proceed
until I am drawn up short. On quantity, Sir Graeme Catto noted during
the GMC&#146;s oral evidence that while he did not think that the
move to the civil standard of proof would have &#147;any significant
effect&#148; in terms of numbers at the serious end of the
spectrum,</div>
					<a name="08012298000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there may be
an impact on doctors whose practice has failed to a lesser
extent&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012298000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, he
said</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>
					<a name="08012298000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any impact is likely to be

					</div>
					<a name="08012298000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">What increase in
the number of fitness to practise hearings does the Minister expect to
arise from the move to the civil standard? We have touched on that
point before, and an answer would be welcome.</div>
					<a name="08012298000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
would like to touch on defensive medicine. I do not want to be
unnecessarily critical&#151;far from it&#151;but I thought that it
was slightly unfortunate that Dr. Buckman and the BMA had not gauged
more effectively whether it is an issue across the profession. While he
did not make the case as effectively as he might have done, there is a
justified
concern.</div>
