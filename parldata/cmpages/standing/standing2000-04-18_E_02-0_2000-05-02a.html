<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 10, leave out from ``information'' to ``and'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`about the age, address, date of birth and National Insurance Number of persons aged 74 or over.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 14, leave out from ``information'' to ``and'' in line 15 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`about the age, address, date of birth and National Insurance number of persons aged 74 or over'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 14, in clause 4, page 2, leave out line 39.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I hope, Mr Illsley, that you had an enjoyable and relaxing Easter break-it was all too short. I hope that we can make progress on the Bill today.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth). The amendments in the group are probing amendments, but they raise important issues, in particular, that of the way in which the social security information that is to be provided will be determined. In the Bill, the definition of such information is widely drawn and is subject to secondary legislation that will prescribe the information that is to be made available to the BBC and its contractors.

<P>
That is a sensitive matter. As has been pointed out before, the information will not go only to the BBC-if, indeed, it goes to the BBC at all; it will go to the companies that supervise both the issuing of licences and the granting of free licences. It is not unreasonable to seek reassurance as to how the information will be determined, and an assurance that its quantity and type will be strictly curtailed. That goes to the heart of the concerns that were expressed on Second Reading about supplying social security information in the way set out in the Bill, which is a significant departure from normal practice.

<P>
The Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting will recall that, on Second Reading, it was suggested that the information to be supplied should be specified in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are designed to achieve that. Encouragement for such an approach comes from the notes on clauses. It would be helpful for the Committee to have them to hand, as they specify the information that the Government intend should be released. The Committee must ask the Minister why the Government chose not to specify in the Bill the quality and type of information that is to be made available, and why they decided instead to set out a wide definition that is subject to an order-making power. If the information were specified as amendments Nos. 4 and 5 propose, there would be no need for an order-making power; that is why amendment No. 14, which relates to clause 4, fits into the debate. Other issues relate to the order-making power, and I hope to raise them during clauses 4 and 5 stand part. However, amendment No. 14 is of interest in the context of the current debate only because, if the information to be released were specified in the Bill, there would be no need for an order-making power.

<P>
The Opposition are prepared to accept that the Government are betraying no sinister motive or unexpected intention in choosing to deal with the issue in the way that they have chosen. I expect the Minister to say that the Government are attempting to cover every eventuality, and that we should bear in mind that there might, in future, be unforeseen changes in the type of social security information that is kept and the way in which it can be used to identify the over-74 population. However, such matters could be addressed by an order to vary the information specified in the Bill. It would not require the wide powers that clauses 4 and 5 provide.

<P>
We want the Minister to give the Committee and the House the explanation we deserve. Why have the Government chosen the process they have when it might have been preferable to specify the information in the Bill, given that the latter option might have reassured those who were concerned about the release of such information?

<P>
<B>The Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting (Janet Anderson):</B> I repeat the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) that you had a pleasant Easter break, Mr. Illsley. Like him, I wish that it had been longer, but at least another break is coming up soon.

<P>
I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said about the probing nature of the amendments. I again put on record the Government's gratitude for his support and that of his hon. Friends for the principle of the Bill. When we debate clauses 4 and 5, I hope that we shall have an opportunity to discuss the order-making powers set out in the Bill, but I should like to deal now with the issue of why the information is not specified in the Bill.

<P>
I welcome the opportunity to reassure the Committee about the degree of parliamentary control over the information that is to be provided to the BBC, and to make clear why that is an appropriate use of secondary legislation. Hon. Members are, understandably, concerned to ensure that there is control of the personal information that may be released by the Government to third parties, and that the Government do not take power to make the law through secondary legislation in inappropriate circumstances. I hope to reassure the Committee on both counts.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 would specify on the face of the Bill the information that can be supplied to the BBC. There is no question that the Government will decide arbitrarily what in information should be provided: it must be prescribed by order. That will give the House the opportunity to scrutinise the information that will be released and to satisfy itself that it is reasonable for the administration of the scheme. Measures to ensure that there are strong sanctions against releasing the information unlawfully will be debated in connection with later amendments.

<P>
There is a need for the flexibility that secondary legislation gives to the House. The hon. Member for Ryedale has already touched on the possible reasons for that. Although we are confident that the information needed for the smooth administration of the current scheme is name, age, national insurance number and address, and, where appropriate, the fact that a person has died-that is important, if we are to avoid causing unnecessary distress to families-the successful operation of the scheme depends on the interface between the BBC's current licensing scheme and the DSS database, as currently structured. We cannot rule out the possibility that one or both of those sets of information may be restructured at some unspecified time in the future in such a way that the interface no longer works in exactly the same way as is currently proposed. This morning, the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) and I had a conversation about the fact that we would not want to rule out the possibility of introducing, at some time in the future, different reduced-fee schemes, either to replace the current proposal, or in addition to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): We did, indeed, have a conversation earlier about that matter. I asked the Minister for an assurance that such a scheme would not suddenly come across the horizon just before a general election, with all the political expediency that has accompanied the presentation of the Bill. As the Minister knows, I recently wound up for the Opposition on the debate on the BBC and concessionary licence fees. I pointed out that the BBC should have instigated the concessions, not the Government. The BBC has confirmed in its report to me-which I presented to the House-that it would have liked more consultation prior to the Bill's publication. Will the Minister comment on that point?

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> We have had extensive discussions with both the BBC and the Department of Social Security about the Bill, so I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's assertion that they have not been sufficiently consulted. Neither can I accept his allegation that the Government have acted out of political expediency. A general election is some way off and it is a long time since the proposal was first announced. I am aware that, on Second Reading, several hon. members expressed a desire for the scheme to be extended; I do not have a crystal ball, but I can say today, on record, that the Government have no plan to do that. Nevertheless, it would be short-sighted of us to arrange matters so that a technical Bill would be required if any change was to be made to the acheme. We contend that secondary legislation is most appropriate in cases such as this, where details can be changed without upsetting the principles that are fully debated in the course of a Bill's passage.

<P>
It is important to note that the list of information that the amendment would put on the face of the Bill is incomplete. It omits the name of the person and the fact, where appropriate, that the person named has died. Both peices of information are vital to the verification of claims for free licneces. In addition, the proposed wording relating to the information that may lawfully be passed to the BBC is less precise than we intend.

<P>
I cannot accept the assertion made by the hon. Member for Ryedale that the definition of the information is loosely drawn in the Bill. The amendment mentions information ``about'' the age, address, date of birth and national insurance number of persons. We intend that the relevant order should provide that the information in question should ``consist of'' the age, address and so on. That is far more specific. The DSS would, under the terms of the amendment, be able to release information about, for example, what type of property was involved, if they held such information,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as as result, or for the purpose, of the exercise of functions  in relation to social security or war pension.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be ``about'' the address, but would not ``consist of'' the address. Surely, it is better to have tight and restrictive wording in an order than to have a looser formulation in the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to amendment No. 14 and said that it is consequential to amendments Nos. 4 and 5. If, as the Government propose, the information that can be transferred to the BBC is to be specified by order, the definition of the term ``prescribed'' must remain in clause 4. It is required for the purposes of defining information of a prescribed description in clause 1-in other words, the information that the DSS may supply. However, even if the information that the DSS may supply to the BBC were specified on the face of the Bill, a definition of the term ``prescribed'' would still be required in clause 4 to give meaning to ``prescribed'' categories of reduced fee licences referred to in clause 2(2)(b), in connection with which the information may be used.

<P>
I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee that the Government's intentions are genuine. We believe that we have set out the best way in which to administer the scheme in order to ensure that all pensioners who are entitled to a free television licence can get one easily and with as little trouble as possible when the provision is implemented on 1 November. I ask the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the Minister for the reassurance that she has given about the tight prescription of information that the Government intend to set out in the statutory instrument made under the order-making power in clauses 4 and 5. It will be useful to have that exchange on the record and I hope that, not only members of the Committee, but other hon. Members will find those remarks helpful when they read the Hansard report. I know that the Minister appreciates that that is a sensitive one, about which many hon. Members are concerned.

<P>
I accept that there would still need to be a definition of the term ``prescribed'' even if specific information were to be in the Bill, as we propose. Given that the matter is urgent, will the Minister tell us when she expects a draft statutory instrument to be published? It will be clear from our debates that we want the matter to make speedy progress, and that the 1 November implementation date should be met. When the Bill returns to the House, those who have not been able to attend our proceedings might raise again some of the old canards that were debated on Second Reading. Therefore, it might be helpful if, by Report, we were to have a draft statutory instrument that prescribes exactly what the Government intend by way of the information to be released.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> We are aware that it is important that people have as much information as possible, as quickly as possible, about how the scheme will operate. We should be able to bring forward a draft of the order by Report. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful. We have had an important exchange of views and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Use to which information may be put</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> During our previous debate we raised the prospect of further concessionary or free licence schemes being introduced. It seems clear from clause 2 that the Government intend to take the legislative power to do that, in the event of such a decision being taken. It is important to obtain clarification as to the Government's intentions.

<P>
First, will the Minister tell us what is meant by the definition in subsection (2) of ``Reduced-fee licences''? Do the Government mean the current concession scheme for residential homes or warden-occupied accommodation for old people, about which we have all had some difficulty in our constituencies; or do they anticipate the possibility of broader application, such as the extension of the scheme to all pensioners? My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole pointed out that the latter proposal would be extremely popular, and that if its announcement coincided with various other events, the Government would reap the full benefit. We cannot complain about that-it is what all Governments do-politics is politics after all. However, it became clear on the debate on Second Reading that such a proposal would be popular with many of the hon. Members.

<P>
A separate, but equally important, issue is whether the Government contemplate the introduction of a reduced-fee concession for other groups and, if so, which groups they have in mind. I do not want to detain the Committee by speculating about what groups of people might be thought deserving or what action might be regarded as politically advantageous. However, it is important that the Committee understands the full potential of the clause. Why has the clause been drafted as it has been? One suspects that the Government's aim extends further than simply ensuring that, were they to go down such a road in future, they would not have to go through the legislative process again. Why have the Government chosen, through the clause, to go further than appears strictly necessary to implement the free television licence for all pensioners aged over 74?

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the issue raised on an all-party basis of groups of people, in particular the deaf and the blind, who do not necessarily also fit into the over 75-category. Is the Minister thinking of such people in connection with reduced-fee licences? If so, I should point out that Opposition Members have drawn them to the attention of the House on many occasions, and it is not the preserve of the Government to bring forward measures that allow them to appear as though Labour is the only socially inclusive party. We are as well, as can be seen in Hansard.

<P>
In connection with reduced-fee licences, will the Minister assure us that further consultation has taken place with the BBC? I have been assured that consultation has taken place on the points that I raised, which relate to the essence of the Bill, but the BBC should have been consulted specifically about the provisions of clause 2. Will the hon. Lady tell us what the BBC said, or can a copy of its response be lodged in the Library or sent to me? The clause appears to go beyond the initial aim of the Bill. It is probably worth reading the minutes of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, when representatives of the BBC appeared before it and I put the same point to the governors and the director-general. Hansard shows that they would have preferred further consultation on the wider implications of the Bill. Can the Minister assure us that that has now taken place?

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale about the reference to reduced-fee licences in subsection (2). I shall deal with that later, in the course of my comments on clause 2 as a whole.

<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole referred to other groups of people. As he knows, the Government are concerned about social exclusion. My right hon. Friend The Secretary of State and I have met with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People to discuss the needs of the deaf. My right hon. Friend is doing all he can to encourage broadcasters to improve the proportion of subtitling of their programmes. The hon. Gentleman will also know that, in response to the Davies review, the Government accepted the case for half-price television licences for the blind. Previously, they received a reduction of £1.25: that dated back to when the licence was principally for a radio. It had therefore become out of date. We recognised the need for action on both matters.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of proposals for a reduce-fee licence. The Government have no such proposals at present, but, if they had, they would consult with the BBC, because it is important to proceed with the same aims in mind. I have had more than one meeting with TV Licensing and officials of the Department of Social Security to discuss the contents of the Bill and how the Government intend to proceed. The BBC was happy with the way in which we dealt with the matter.

<P>
Clause 2 provides the counterpoint to clause 1. Members of the Committee will agree that we have had full debates on clause 1, which provides that the Secretary of State may supply social security information to the BBC and the contractors who administer television licensing for the BBC. There are concerns about contractors receiving information and I shall deal with them later. Clause 2 sets out the uses to which such information may be put. It places strict limits on the purposes for which the social security information provided under the Bill may be used. That will ensure that social security information is used only to facilitate the issue of free television licences, including the associated short-term or reduced-fee licences, to which I shall refer in greater detail in a moment.

<P>
The purpose of giving the BBC the power to use that social security information is to ensure that the over-75s, who are often frail and sometimes confused, receive their free licences with the minimum fuss and bother. The information will enable the BBC to check applicants' entitlement to a free television licence, in most cases without having to demand that they find their birth certificate or other documents proving their age. Without clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, every elderly claimant would have to provide documentary proof of age, which would be difficult for a substantial proportion of that group.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): May I draw the Minister's attention to the new clause that was not selected, which addresses a matter that I raised on Second Reading, namely, whether further thought has been given to those persons who may be eligible for a no-fee licence, but have already purchased one? Will they be eligible for a refund?

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I read the hon. Gentleman's new clause, which, as he says, has not been selected. First, we want to ensure-as does TV Licensing-that as many people as possible are aware of the concession. Everyone who has a television licence will be written to, explaining that anyone in the household aged 74 or older should apply for a no-fee licence. Therefore, we hope that the question of refunds will not arise, as people will have been made aware of the scheme. We are looking at the details of that operation. When in my constituency recently, I came across an elderly woman who had purchased enough stamps to pay for her licence for a whole year. She will be able to have half of that reimbursed. We want to be as fair as possible and I will let the hon. Gentleman have exact details as soon as I can.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Without the provision, many people would be put to the inconvenience-and sometimes the expense-of obtaining the necessary documentation. In addition, the BBC would still have to police the concession; without the information, it would probably have to adopt a much more intrusive approach to checking claims, which could turn a welcome concession into a burden. I am sure all hon. Members want to avoid that.

<P>
The specified social security information will also be used to help the BBC to determine whether or not a person can be issued with a short-term licence. Short-term licences have been created so that people who are about to become entitled to a free licence can pay a fee based on the number of months between the date when their old licence expires and the date on which they become entitled to a free licence-that is, on 1 November this year, if they are 75 before then, or on their 75th birthday. Without the information, the business of getting a short-term licence could become a burden, not a welcome saving.

<P>
It might be helpful if I explain why the use of the information for short-term licences falls within the powers of this Bill. The new short-term licence was introduced by the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Licence Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2000, which came into force on 1 April this year. The licences are available only to people who are approaching the date on which they become eligible for a free licence, and they will be issued back-to-back with free licences. Any use of the information by the BBC to check that applicants for short-term licences will turn 75 when they say they will is, therefore, a use in connection with free licences. Of course, in practical terms, that check is, by definition, the same check as the one the BBC carries out before issuing a free licence.

<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale said, rightly, that we have included in subsection (2) a provision relating to reduced-fee licences, to allow flexibility in case further concessionary schemes are introduced at some future date. For the provisions of the Bill to be used in connection with any new concessionary scheme, the scheme itself and any new type of information to be used in connection with such a scheme would have to be prescribed in an order laid before Parliament. Even then, it would be for the Secretary of State to decide whether or not to disclose information under such an order. The BBC will have no power to require disclosure. In fact, the Government have no plans at present to prescribe any new categories of reduced-fee licences, nor is there a need for social security information to be used to verify entitlement to any reduced-fee licences currently in force, such as the one for the blind.

<P>
Social security information is not needed to administer the 50 per cent. reduction for the blind which we introduced with effect from 1 April. That is because the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, as amended, already provides for applicants to demonstrate their entitlement to the concession by means of a certificate issued by their local authority. Nor is social security information required to administer the existing accommodation for residential care scheme, which the hon. Member for Ryedale mentioned and which is constantly raised with us on the doorstep. Social security information is not required to administer that concessionary licence scheme, as the qualifying criteria for the concession relate to the accommodation occupied and the way in which it is provided or managed; applications are made by housing managers on behalf of all residents in a scheme.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> May I tease out how the social security information will be used in sensitive circumstances? The Minister has said that a record will be kept of when a person dies. That is important in connection with qualifying for the licence. Will guidelines be issued on how the information is to be used? It is a sensitive matter if someone dies and another member of the household immediately receives a demand for a television licence fee. What period will elapse before such a demand is issued? Will attention be paid to individual circumstances? Someone aged 76 may die and the other person in the household, who is 74, will receive a demand for a television licence shortly before qualifying for the concession. Certain circumstances need to be handled sensitively and I am keen to know how.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> That is an important point. I welcome the opportunity to reassure the hon. Gentleman, because we have discussed with TV Licensing the need for the scheme to be operated as sensitively as possible in such circumstances. The Government are already on record as having said that, when someone dies during the term of a no-fee licence, the free licence will operate until the date of expiry. The family will continue to benefit from it, but they will have to purchase a new licence on its expiry, unless another member of the household is aged 75 or more. We understand the need for the matter to be dealt with sensitively, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government and TV Licensing have taken that on board.

<P>
Clause 2 and clause 1 lie at the heart of the Bill. Cluase 1 provides for social security information to be provided to the BBC, and clause 2 restricts its use. I am sure that all hon. Members understand the need for that and the reasons why the Government have chosen to proceed as they have done

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful for the Minister's reassurances. In respect of the use of social security information, the most telling two words in regard to future plans are that there are none ``at present''. We can talk about that among ourselves another time.

<P>
I want to make a brief comment on the exchange between the Minister and the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker). In his new clause, he raised the important issue of refunds. The Committee will understand why the new clause was considered beyond the scope of the Bill, which is concerned with making provision for the disclosure of information, not the mechanics of making a refund available.

<P>
Did I understand the Minister to say that TV Licensing, or whoever the contractor might be, would write to everyone that they had identified as being eligible? That goes to the heart of what we discussed in our previous sitting. It is clear that the Government envisage that TV Licensing will have a database-for lack of a better term-of everyone who is eligible? If the organisation is to write to everyone who is eligible, it should not be beyond the wit of man to devise a system whereby, if someone mistakenly goes to buy a television licence, the alarm bell rings and someone says, ``They shouldn't have bought this. Return the money.'' That seems to be the practical solution to a potential difficulty, but, given the way in which the Government have chosen to implement the scheme-which becomes clearer as we proceed with our debates-I should have thought that the problem that the hon. Member for Lewes has identified ought never to arise. With that comment, I hope that we can make progress and approve the clause.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I should like to respond briefly to that important point. I am sorry if the hon. Member for Ryedale misunderstood what I said earlier; I may not have been clear enough. TV Licensing will write to everyone who has a licence, and invitations to apply for a free licence will be issued to eligible parties. We have decided that the best and simplest way of gaining the most comprehensive information needed to check the claims is by way of transfer of information from the DSS. However, some people might not be caught by that, which is why everyone who is eligible should be given the opportunity to apply for the licence. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 1, line 23, leave out ``(a recipient)''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 9, in page 2, line 1, leave out ``a recipient'' and insert ``the BBC''.

<P>
No. 10, in page 2, line 2, leave out ``a recipient'' and insert ``the BBC''.

<P>
No. 11, in page 2, line 3, leave out ``recipient'' and insert ``BBC''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> These are probing amendments, which provide a peg for a debate about the offences relating to wrongful disclosure of information. The clause provides much-needed reassurance that the provisions of clauses 1 and 2 will be strictly applied. We seek further clarification as to the persons and bodies to which social security information will be supplied, because those bodies will be liable if information is wrongly supplied or used in ways that are beyond the scope of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 1 makes it clear that only the BBC-or, more likely, the BBC's contractors, who supervise TV licence fee collection-will receive the information supplied. Clause 3, however, in creating important offences in respect of the misuse of the information, introduces the concept of ``a recipient''. We appreciate that it is mainly a drafting issue to decide exactly who will be liable for the offences.

<P>
Our amendments are offered in the spirit of helpfulness. As I said, we understand that only the BBC and its contractors or staff will have the information, but instead of ``the recipient'', the words ``the BBC''-clearly defined in clause 1 to include all the relevant contractors-would be more appropriate. We also want to focus attention on the importance of supervision by the BBC and contracting companies at the most senior level in respect of the need for proper security about the information.

<P>
Another important matter is that the current wording-``the recipient''-it does not make it clear exactly who is liable. Who would be prosecuted for an offence under clause 3? Is the recipient the clerk or the administrative assistant who might inadvertently have released the information to the wrong source-we shall return to that theme in connection with amendments Nos. 6 and 7-or is the BBC as a corporation the recipient? Surely the corporation should be made to answer for any inappropriate use. Contractor companies will receive information regarding the supply of free television licences; that, too, raises the question of who would be prosecuted.

<P>
The Royal Parks (Trading) Bill, which is awaiting Report, refers to individual directors being liable to prosecution for offences committed under that measure. The Committee must consider whether the definition of ``a recipient'' makes it sufficiently clear that the directors of the companies that supervise the issuing of licences will themselves be liable for the wrongful use of information.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Tredinnick </B>(Bosworth): Does my hon. Friend agree with me that the problem is the sheer scale of potential misuse? There is so much that can go wrong and so much information that can be put into the wrong hands in error. That makes it all the more important that there should be sanctions. The public will not forgive the Government if the Bill does not have proper teeth to use against those who make errors. I support what my hon. Friend says.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. In our debate on amendments Nos. 6 and 7 we shall consider the extent to which the inadvertent release of information will be caught by the Bill. My view on the matter is not necessarily the same as that of my hon. Friend. He is, however, absolutely right to say that the highest level of supervision of the use of the information is needed. People at the top, not just the poor clerks or assistants who deal with the information, should be liable if something goes wrong.

<P>
I shall not detain the Committee by speculating on how some of the information could be wrongly used, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) that the wrongful use of information, especially if it is deliberate, is unacceptable and should have serious sanctions. That is why we support the creation of the offences. Our amendments are designed to ensure that there is a definition that catches everyone who should be caught by it. I am not entirely clear that the use of the phrase ``a recipient'' achieves that-[
Interruption.]

<P>
We believe, not only that there should be offences, but there should be severe penalties. The Minister knows that there was a discussion on Second Reading about whether imprisonment was an appropriate sanction in such a matter. My hon. Friends drew attention to the fact that the penalties appeared to go beyond those for offences under similar legislation. However, on reflection, I concluded that clear wrongful use of such information is sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment for those who commit such offences; it would be for the courts to decide whether such a sanction was appropriate to the case. That might explain why we have not tabled an amendment in respect of the penalties imposed by the clause.

<P>
Is the definition of those who would be caught by the offence sufficiently wide-ranging to include directors, or should we consider amending the Bill on Report to make that more obvious?

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I thought for a moment, Mr. Illsley, that you had a pager message with some of the answers to the questions, but clearly you had not. All our debates on this clause and previous clauses leave me with suspicions about the way in which information might leak out and be used by other bodies. The national insurance database, which contains information about benefits, crime prevention and justice, will be available to commercial organisations; that might set an unhealthy precedent for the future. More specifically, on the issue of responsibility resting with the BBC, it is of paramount importance that no confidential information is released.

<P>
Will the Minister answer three questions? Does she consider it appropriate that confidential information can be obtained by persons providing the BBC with services in connection with the television licence, in the way mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale? Why are those persons not specified in the Bill? Will the Minister specify them? Will she also confirm that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any person providing the BBC with services in connection with television licences<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
includes commercial companies? Those commercial companies have to go through a vetting process. What will that process be?

<P>
The question of prosecution is vitally important. It went through my mind that holding the board of governors and the director-general of the BBC to account may, in certain circumstances, hold great attraction-indeed, it would lend itself to a BBC fly-on-the-wall documentary, which I am sure would be watched avidly by all licence-payers who wanted to ensure that they were being treated properly, in the light of the amount of money that is spent at the BBC.

<P>

<B>Janet Anderson:</B> All the contributions on the amendments have raised important and valid concerns. The hon. Member for Ryedale mentioned the suggestion made on Second Reading that the penalties in the Bill are too draconian. I welcome the fact that Opposition Members now agree with the Government. The hon. Member for Bosworth emphasised the need for the Bill to have teeth in respect of any misuse of information. Such is our intention.

<P>
The Committee has expressed concerned about whether the definition of a recipient relates to an individual or a company, and about vetting contractors, The purpose of clause 3 is to protect information supplied to the BBC by the DSS against further disclosure. By ruling out employees of contractors, amendments Nos. 8 to 11 would narrow the range of persons who could be guilty of an offence if they disclosed information. I am sure it was not the intention, but that is our interpretation.

<P>
As drafted, the effect of clause 1(1) and (2) is that DSS information can be supplied either to the BBC itself, or to persons supplying services to the BBC. In either case, even though the information is supplied to the BBC or to a contractor, it will, in practice, come into the hands of the employees and consultants of the BBC and its contractors. Therefore, to protect information supplied to the BBC, clause 3(1) provides that either the BBC or its contractor is guilty of an offence if it discloses the information without lawful authority. Furthermore, the effect of clause 3(2) is that anyone who could in practice obtain the information-either the BBC, a contractor or staff of either-is also capable of being charged with the offence under clause 3(1) or (2). Under amendments Nos. 9 to 11, only staff of the BBC-employees or consultants-could be guilty of the offence. An undesirable effect of that would be that disclosure of information supplied to the BBC, if it were made by an employee or consultant of a contractor, would not be covered.

<P>
We believe that there must be a match between the people who have access to the information and those who can be guilty of an offence if they disclose it. Persons falling outside the net could disclose the information and not suffer a penalty. That would reduce the important protection that the Bill rightly gives to the information supplied to the BBC by the DSS. As drafted, the Bill preserves the principle that personal information should be protected-an important point, which was raised by the hon. Member for Bosworth. It makes no sense-and fundamentally weakens our protection-to narrow the range of persons who could be guilty of an offence to employees or consultants of the BBC when the information will also be used by contractors and their employees.

<P>
Having said that, I turn to the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale about the people who will be caught by these offences. Concern has been expressed that the current safeguards against unlawful disclosure of personal information provided by the DSS under the Bill are insufficient, because the offence of unlawful disclosure in clause 3 would not catch the directors of a company that disclosed such information. The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to the Royal Parks (Trading) Bill, which has such a provision. It has been argued that the deterrent effect of the offence would be enhanced if there were a possibility of personal criminal liability for directors.

<P>
The Government accept that personal information supplied to the BBC or its contractors for the purposes of administering free television licences should be as safe as it is in the hands of the DSS or its contractors. While we do not want to catch a company director who has exercised all due diligence to prevent unlawful disclosure by his company or staff, it would not be acceptable for a director or other senior manager to avoid responsibility for an offence arising from his or her negligence, or at which he or she had connived, or to which he or she had consented. It is reasonable to expect the senior management of companies handling such information to protect it and to ensure that their employees are aware of their responsibilities. To answer the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, we would expect employees to be made aware of their responsibilities under the legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Is that a matter that will be built into the director-general's contract with the BBC, to make sure that he is aware of his responsibility? At this stage, I do not want him to be the first person to appear in the fly-on-the-wall documentary to which I referred earlier.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> Nor do we.

<P>
On the issue of vetting, there is no special procedure for DSS or BBC contractors in the sense of checking whether persons are fit and proper and checking criminal records. However, strict contractual conditions impose a commercial sanction in addition to the criminal ones that we are debating. We would expect the record of contractors and bona fides to be taken into account before the contract is awarded. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Returning to directors and people in senior positions of responsibility, I am happy to consider the possibility of extending the offence of unlawful disclosure to cover company directors in such cases and, if appropriate, to introduce a Government amendment on Report. Details of what precisely is required to give effect to that are still under consideration. However, such a provision is likely to provide that, if an offence is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to the negligence of, a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, that officer-as well as the company-shall be guilty of the offence.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tredinnick:</B> That is a most significant concession. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale would agree that the hon. Lady has gone a long way to allaying our serious concerns. If the Government have not made a U-turn, they have certainly taken a right turn. I put the cross up to Dracula at this point. If a mechanism is to be introduced on Report by which directors are to feel the heat in certain circumstances, that is greatly to be welcomed and I thank the hon. Lady.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. In the spirit of his intervention, I am not sure whether we have taken a right turn; in view of some recent utterances of his colleagues, it may be his party that has taken it. We are happy, as I said, to further examine the possibility of extending the provision through a Government amendment on Report. Furthermore, we would be happy, in a spirit of co-operation, to hear the views of Opposition Members on how best to deal with the matter. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her response. I assure her that it was never our intention to narrow the scope of the people who could be caught by these offences. On the contrary, we want to widen it. We are grateful for her offer of further discussion on how best to achieve our objectives-informally at first, and then on Report. As my hon. Friend. the Member for Bosworth said, it is an important issue. We must get this part of the Bill right. For the present, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 24, after ``he'', insert ``knowingly''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 3, after ``he'', insert ``knowingly''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We seek to ensure that we have the correct definition of what constitutes an offence. As was made clear in our previous debate, wrongful disclosure should not be tolerated, so there should be a clear criminal offence and a potentially heavy sentence. Any breach of confidence by disclosing the information made available under the Bill is extremely serious, but that begs the question whether any wrongful release of information in whatever circumstances should be an absolute offence, or whether there ought to be a requirement that the information has been released knowingly or deliberately for an offence to have been committed. In other words, should any accidental breach be caught, or should we take the view that only deliberate disclosure should be subject to the criminal law under clause 3? Accidental disclosure could occur in several ways, especially through electronic transfer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> How would the amendment deal with disclosure throught negligence?

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am coming to that. Although there is a question about whether or not negligent disclosure should be caught-that is a matter for us to debate-I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the report of the debates of a year or two ago on the Data Protection Act 1998-a much more substantial piece of legislation than this Bill. Then, grave concerns were expressed by the staff of the Data Protection Commissioner that criminal sanctions should not apply to an accidental disclosure. That is why I chose to raise the matter in an amendment.

<P>
I do not want to water down the legislation; however, notwithstanding what we have just said about criminal penalties and the need for supervision and security, it will almost certainly be clerical or administrative staff who are held responsible and liable if there is an accidental transfer of information. I suspect that none of them have, as yet, given the slightest consideration to the offences and penalties for which we are making them liable through the Bill. I suspect that they have no clue that Parliament is passing legislation as potentially draconian as this. However, it is not for us to bring forward an amendment to clarify the position.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lewes mentioned negligence, which came up in our previous debate. If the right systems are not put in place and information is released in circumstances that cannot be argued to be inadvertent, but that arose from a degree of recklessness on the part of those running the show, there is a serious question of whether that should be caught. Our purpose in proposing the amendments is to tease out the effect of the Bill. We are not necessarily saying that it should have been drafted differently, but we are expressing genuine concerns about the extent to which the offences would be considered absolute; and whether, to be caught by them, information would have to be released knowingly or with a degree of negligence or recklessness.

<P>
I hope that it will be clear from what I have said that, although we think that the offences are extremely important, given the penalties and the fact that we are extending liability to include directors-a decision of which we approve-we need to know what the burden of proof will be in respect of the commission of such an offence. That is the key issue. We would usually discuss a matter such as this under criminal justice provisions, rather than in connection with a technical Bill that relates to disclosure of information for television licences. None the less, it is an important matter.

<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the defence provided in respect of lawful authority puts the onus on the individual to prove that his belief was reasonable. That strengthens my determination to make clear what would constitute a release of information that fell within these provisions, that was an offence under the Bill, that could be prosecuted and that could attract such severe penalties.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I will make two points. The first, relating to negligence, was drawn to our attention by the hon. Member for Lewes. I understand that a negligence clause should be part of a BBC employee's contract, so the matter will have already been set out for employees.

<P>
Does the Minister intend that existing contracts between the BBC and contractors or employees should be renegotiated, so that they set out the meaning of negligence in this instance, as well as, secondary to that, setting out the meaning of ``knowingly'' disclosing information? If so, we must consider a different arena, because the issue is not merely one of a concessionary licence, but of the way in which contracts are agreed in the first place. Inevitably, renegotiating those contracts will cost a great deal of money. The omission of any mention of that matter in the Bill causes me great concern. The House should not pass a Bill that does not take account of legal ramifications that go beyond the matter the Bill initially sets out to cover. I should like the Minister's reassurance that the re-setting of contracts has been allowed for.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> The debate has confirmed what we already knew, which is that the protection of transferred information is paramount. That is what the Government intend. I have noted the important points made by the hon. Members for Ryedale, for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and for Lewes.

<P>
The amendments would make it easier for the BBC, or one of its contractors, or employees of the BBC or of its contractors, to get away with disclosing information supplied by the Department of Social Security under clause 1. That causes us concern. An offence would be created only if disclosure were a deliberate act. It would mean that a careless or thoughtless person who released information accidentally-perhaps by leaving it in a public place by mistake-would not have committed an offence. It would mean that, if a person thought that the information had been obtained in some way other than under clause 1, he or she would not commit an offence by disclosing it. If amendment No. 6 were made, a person who thought, however unreasonably, that he or she had lawful authority to release information would not be committing an offence.

<P>
The amendment would reduce the protection that the Bill rightly gives to the information, although I do accept that there is an important balance to be achieved here. The Bill as drafted preserves an important principle, namely, that personal information should be protected. It is protected in the same terms as used in section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. That section makes it an offence for an employee or former employee of the DSS to release personal information obtained in the course of his or her employment.

<P>
Like section 123, clause 3 provides a defence. It is a defence for a person charged with the offence to prove that the disclosure was made in the reasonable-even if mistaken-belief that he or she was making the disclosure with lawful authority, or that the information was already public. A person would be able to use that defence provided that he or she had deliberately considered the question of whether he or she could disclose the information, and had decided, on reasonable grounds, that he or she could.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale raised a particular point about electronic transfer of information. That is to the forefront of our minds these days, in the midst of the technological revolution as we are. Hacking into an electronic transfer would probably be regarded as theft by the hacker, rather than disclosure by the sender. However, there is an important issue in respect of faxes or e-mails sent to a wrong address. There could be an offence there, so perhaps it is necessary for us to look at whether the defence provided is sufficient.

<P>
In short, the Government believe that the clause as drafted strikes the right balance. It provides a firm sanction against reckless disclosure, but provides a defence in cases in which disclosure follows a considered and rational process of consideration of the lawfulness of that disclosure. That is the important point. That balances the right of individuals to have their personal information protected, with the right of individuals not to be treated as criminals without proper cause.

<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole raised a legal point about contracts between the BBC and contractors. As I said ealier, it is expected that people in that position should know the provisions of contracts they enter into, and that it should be made plain to contractors what their responsibilities are under this legislation. However, I shall write to him in more detail about that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I raised that point because there are existing contracts. I understand fully the points made by the Minister about how the DSS may process the information and how responsible its employees are; it is when the information gets to the BBC that great concern arises. The DSS may well be a tight organisation, but the BBC, with the contracts that are currently in place, is a much harder organisation to control. I just wanted to put that on record.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> That is very important and I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. I hope, however, that I have reassured the Committee and I ask that the amendments be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This has been an important debate and I am grateful to the Minister for the spirit of her reply. She accepts that we are not trying to water down the Bill, but that we simply want to ensure the right balance. I am grateful for her suggestion that she will give further consideration to the accidental release of information by electronic transfer. It may well be that that can be dealt with by extending the defences. Perhaps we shall return to the issue on Report.

<P>
I have a suspicion that those who will be affected by the Bill are not aware of the provisions. I suggest that we take the Data Protection Commissioner's advice on those matters. I have previously dealt with the subject at considerable length in Committee-the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) will remember how gruelling the experience was. The staff affected have an interest that the Committee should protect. If people may be caught by a provision, and it is important that they understand it and that they know what their contractual responsibilities are. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 2, leave out lines 9 to 11.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 13, in page 2, leave out lines 15 to 17.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendments concern a relatively minor matter. They follow the long-established procedure that when one is not sure of the meaning of a certain phrase one seeks to delete it and uses that as a peg for a brief exchange of views, which will tease out the meaning from the Minister.

<P>
Subsection (3)(b) says that it is not an offence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to disclose information which has previously been disclosed to the public with lawful authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear what information that might be, or how such disclosure might arise. Subsection (5) provides a limited number of circumstances in which disclosure can be made with lawful authority. Clearly, any disclosure associated with court proceedings must be covered. That would be particularly important if any offences of wrongful disclosure became the subject of a prosecution. Disclosure is lawful if the person to whom the information relates has given consent. That might arise on appeal from a refusal to grant a free or reduced-fee licence. Otherwise, however, informations is permitted to be released only for uses in connection with granting lincences, as specified by clause 2. Therefore, the scope of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>previously disclosed to the public<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not clear.

<P>
We accept that subsection (3)(a) allows publication of information or statistics about free or reduced TV licences, which require such information, and that provision reassures us that individuals will not be identified. However, the information covered by subsection (3)(b) could include identification. We are not clear about what that paragraph means or what it adds to the defences in subsection (5), so I hope that the Minister can put us straight on that.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I accept what the hon. Member for Ryedale said about the spirit in which he tabled the amendments. I do not know whether he has seen the excellent film ``The Insider'', which came out recently and contains a wonderful performance by Russell Crowe. The subject that we are discussing forms an important part of the plot, and I recommend that film to Committee members who have not seen it.

<P>
Amendment No. 12 would remove the provision that states that is is not an offence to disclose information that has already been lawfully disclosed to the public, and the hon. Gentleman seeks a definition of that provision. Amendment No. 13 appears to be consequential upon amendment No. 12. The Government find the amendments somewhat illogical, although I am sure that they were not intended to be. If information has been made public with lawful authority-for example, if it has been read out in open court, or has been made public with the consent of the person who is the subject of the information-why should a BBC employee, for example, be guilty of an offence if he simply repeats information received under clause 1 that is already in the public domain? That does not seem very fair.

<P>
We must ensure that personal information is protected and the Bill aims to preserve that important principle. Indeed, that theme has run through all our debates. It protects personal information in the same way as it would be protected under section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. That section makes it an offence for an employee or former employee of the DSS to release personal information obtained in the course of his or her employment. Like sections 123, clause 3 provides a defence. It is a defence for a person charged with the offence to prove that the disclosure was made in the reasonable, even if mistaken, belief that he was making the disclosure with lawful authority, or that the information was already public. That defence could be used, provided that the person had deliberately considered whether he could disclose the information and had decided, on reasonable grounds, that he could.

<P>
The Government believe that clause 3 strikes the right balance. It provides a firm sanction against reckless disclosure, but provides a defence where the disclosure is made after a considered and rational consideration of its lawfulness. That balances the right of individuals to have their personal information protected with the right of individuals not to be treated as criminals without proper cause. We have sought to strike that important balance in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured by that. I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. She has confirmed our understanding of the clause. I can see that, without the specific inclusion of subsection (3)(b), a member of staff of a director might be accused of wrongful disclosure and have to rely on the defences. If the information has already been released, there should be no question of that happening. I hope that hon. Members throughout the House, not just those in this Committee, will be helped by that clarification of the fact that there are no other means of releasing the information with lawful authority beyond what is clearly prescribed in the Bill. That clarification is needed for what may come later, given what was said on Second Reading. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are, I hope, coming to the end of our sitting. We have already discussed the power to extend the provisions of the free-licence scheme, so I do not intend to detain the Committee much further on the matter. However, we need to place on record the fact that the order-making power, referred to first in clause 4 and provided for specifically in clause 5, has two quite separate effects.

<P>
First, it provides for the order to give effect to the release of the information. The Minister reassured us that the information that will be made available will be set out in the statutory instrument that gives effect to the Bill; I hope that a draft becomes available before Report. Such an order is a clear requirement under the system chosen by the Government, and gives scope to extend the proposals to other potential recipients. The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), who has just joined us, is a great advocate of extending the measure to all pensioners.

<P>

<P>
The phrase:
<P>

<P>
makes it obvious that the proposal is not age-related, although it was introduced on an age-related mechanism. We have had enough political exchanges about what the Government might do in the run-up to an election, but the Committee should be aware that, if it accepts clauses 4 and 5, it will be approving an extremely wide power. That will fill some hon. Members with the hope and expectation that the provision may be extended in future.
