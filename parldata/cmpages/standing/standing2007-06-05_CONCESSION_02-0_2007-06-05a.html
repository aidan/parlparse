Rowen:
						</b> We now come to a specific group of amendments,
which deal with London and the London boroughs. Members will have had
representations from the London boroughs about the current operation of
the concessionary fares scheme. Most Members will be aware that London
is unique in that the arrangements for reaching a decision about the
funding of the London scheme do not allow the boroughs to use an
appeals mechanism if they, Transport for London and the Mayor fail to
reach agreement. That is an anomaly, and the amendments would ensure
that the funding of the freedom pass for London runs along the same
lines as the scheme that exists in the rest of the country.</div>
					<a name="07060622000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the amendments were
discussed in the other place, the Mayor of London made all sorts of
ridiculous statements to the effect that, in seeking to put London on
the same footing as every other authority, we were in some way or other
opposed to the freedom pass, but that is not the case. We seek to
ensure that the London boroughs and Transport for London can arrive at
an orderly and fair agreement as to the costs of the scheme. If no
annual agreement is reached, we want to ensure that there is a
mechanism similar to that in the rest of the country and to extend it
to involve the Secretary of State, so that there can be some form of
appeals mechanism. Notwithstanding that, amendment No. 22 would ensure
that the current scheme, as agreed and funded, continues while the
review takes place. That is only right and fair.</div>
					<a name="07060622000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The London boroughs have no say
over how the scheme operates, while the Mayor has total freedom to
impose any changes that he wishes. We fundamentally believe in
devolving decision making as far down as possible, and giving one
person the right unilaterally to impose a policy on 20-odd
democratically elected London boroughs is, in our view, not
satisfactory. As with the other parts of the Bill, we are talking about
regularisation and a national scheme, and I hope that the Minister will
see that the funding situation in London is an anomaly. We want the
appeal mechanism for the London boroughs to be on the same basis as
those for other authorities and passenger transport authorities. I am
sure that the Minister will agree that that will be a right and proper
way to proceed.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): I rise to support what the hon.
Gentleman has said about the inequities in the scheme in London. I
want, too, to mention amendment No. 19, which gives the Committee the
opportunity to revise an iniquitous section of the Greater London
Authority Act 1999, namely, the reserve free travel scheme, which is
imposed on London boroughs when Transport for London or the Mayor
cannot agree the annual increase. Effectively, TFL has the upper hand
in negotiations and extremists can hold London boroughs to ransom.
Although the scheme has never 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>been invoked, its existence weighs too heavily in favour of TFL in
negotiation and is heavily resented by the London boroughs. Indeed, all
hon. Members will have received a briefing to that effect from London
councils.</div>
					<a name="07060622000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since TFL
was formed seven years ago, the cost of providing the pass has risen by
some 52 per cent., resulting in cuts to services elsewhere and higher
London council tax. TFL is now attempting to use that power to hold
London council tax payers to ransom over its takeover of the north
London line. TFL wants almost to double the cost of providing the pass
on that line. The Association of Train Operating Companies is paid
&#163;600,000 by London boroughs, and TFL wants &#163;1
million for the same service. Again, I venture to suggest that that
will be iniquitous and will result in cuts in services and higher
council tax.</div>
					<a name="07060622000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Mayor of London will claim that anyone who wishes to affect the reserve
free travel scheme has some evil plan to abolish the freedom pass. Any
sensible person knows that that is complete nonsense. Indeed, on Second
Reading I raised the issue and the Mayor suggested in a press release
that I wanted to see the pass go. That was clearly not so, and we made
that point clearly. However, sometimes truth and reality do not seem to
strike the Mayor. We want value for money and a better deal for
Londoners, which are something that the free-spending, profligate Mayor
all too often fails to understand.</div>
					<a name="07060622000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere in the Bill the
Minister has introduced proposals, which we support, to ensure that
disputes between operators and travel concession authorities are
equitably decided. Indeed, the operators have been granted an extra 28
days to appeal if in dispute. In London, TFL&#151;the
operator&#151;can impose the cost on those who pay, namely, the
boroughs. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that he had no
clear plans to change the reserve free travel scheme. However, in the
spirit of fair-mindedness, the Minister must recognise that the
arrangement is iniquitous and unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="07060622000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 19 would give
London authorities the right of appeal against the imposition of an
increased fare amount that they consider excessive. As the Minister
grants and extends that right elsewherein the Bill, it would
be pernicious and unfair not to extend the same rights to London
authorities. Amendment No. 19 would give a period of only seven days
for a London authority to register its appeal, while elsewhere others
get the advantage of 56 days. The Secretary of State or his delegated
authority, rather than TFL, should then decide the cost of the scheme
if no agreement is reached in the negotiation period. Although it would
impose some extra duties on the Secretary of State, it would bring
London into line with the rest of the country. That can only be fair,
justifiable and equitable.</div>
					<a name="07060622000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint Committee on Human
Rights has already expressed some concerns about the robustness of the
appeal process outside London, whereby an operator can appeal to the
Secretary of State if it believes that the amount that it is awarded
for carrying concessionary pass holders is inadequate. I guess that
that is partly recognised in the increase in the appeal period to 56
days.</div>
					<a name="07060622000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As there is no
mechanism in London whereby the boroughs can appeal if they consider
the amount that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>TFL determines, as an operator, excessive, this matter must be
considered of even more concern than the issue that the Joint Committee
was raising in the first place. Therefore, I urge the Minister to
confirm to the Committee that the Government will reconsider the matter
and offer support to the amendment that stands in my name and that of
my hon. Friends. If she is unable to give us reassurance, I should
like, with your discretion, Mr. Bayley, to find some way of
testing the Committee&#146;s view on the
matter.</div>
					
					<a name="07060622000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060622000262"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Gillian
Merron):
						</b> These amendments bring us to the thorny issue of
the London reserve free travel scheme. Lord Davies of Oldham,
representing the Government in the other place, discussed it in
considerable detail during debates on the Bill. I hope that hon.
Members will forgive me for echoing much of what has already been put
on the record, because the Government&#146;s position has not
changed.</div>
					<a name="07060622000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the reserve free travel scheme is to guarantee concessionary travel
in London in situations where there is no agreement either among the
London boroughs, or between the boroughs and Transport for London about
how best to provide and to fund the national
minimum.</div>
					<a name="07060622000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 21 seeks to alter section 240 of the Greater London Authority Act
1999 to replace a discretion for London boroughs and TFL to agree
arrangements to provide travel concessions with an obligation to agree
arrangements that include the national concession. That would be a
significant change. Arrangements for concessionary travel are different
in the capital. The 1999 Act secures that the boroughs are able
voluntarily to agree schemes with TFL. The voluntary arrangements are
underpinned by a safety net: the reserve scheme. If the voluntary
arrangements do not meet certain minimum requirements, the reserve
scheme is triggered. That system has successfully delivered
uninterrupted concessionary travel in the capital over the past eight
years.</div>
					<a name="07060622000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
effect of the amendment would be somewhat contradictory. The ability to
enter into arrangements implies that all parties do so voluntarily and
by agreement. The amendment would force the parties to agree. How do we
force parties to agree? Officials have designated that as a shotgun
wedding of an agreement. What would happen if the parties did not agree
or if an agreement or contract is breached and that leads to
termination of the agreement? Simply stating baldly that something will
happen is, I fear, not the same as putting in place a framework to
ensure that it does
happen.</div>
					<a name="07060622000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
clearly an intentional link with amendment No. 22. That introduces the
idea of replacing the reserve scheme as the fallback arrangement for
London with a rolling over of the current arrangements. Hon. Members
will not be surprised to learn that I am also concerned with that idea.
As there is no guarantee that these arrangements would be in place, and
given that we could not roll over arrangements that did not exist, we
would effectively have no guarantee of concessions in London. I suspect
that that is where the true purpose of amendment No. 21 lies. The logic
of all this is complicated. If we force the parties to agree, there are
arrangements in place, but if those arrangements are not up to scratch,
we trigger the safety net. What is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>safety net? It is rolling over those arrangements, but they may not be
up to
scratch.</div>
					<a name="07060622000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
22 proposes that the Secretary of State would be able to specify the
terms of the arrangement, but we need to pause for a moment. Has the
Secretary of State not already specified the terms of the safety net?
Is that not laid out clearly in legislation? In my view it is. It is
called the reserve free travel scheme&#151;the very scheme that the
amendments seek to remove and
replace.</div>
					<a name="07060622000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 23, 24 and 25 are consequent upon the principles embodied in
amendments Nos. 21 and 22, thus I do not propose to refer to them in
detail. Amendment No. 19 brings a new element to the equation: the
specific issues of cost. The amendment provides for the addition of new
paragraph 5(8) to schedule 1 to the 1999 Act in relation to the London
reserve free travel
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060622000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5 of
schedule 1 to the 1999 Act allows TFL to stipulate the charge per pass
payable by London authorities to cover the costs to it of providing the
concessions under the reserve free travel scheme. The amendment would
allow London authorities to appeal to the Secretary of State when they
consider the charge to be excessive, and for the Secretary of State to
determine a lower amount if appropriate. However, paragraphs 5(3) and
5(4) of schedule 1 to the 1999 Act already specify the costs that may
be included in calculating the costs of the reserve free travel scheme
and any further matters that must be taken into
account.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060622000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07060622000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">TFL will
already be aware that if it is not reasonable in its assessment of
costs and charges, London authorities will judicially review the
determination and may even refuse to pay while a review is under way. I
understand that there are genuine concerns among the London boroughs
about the reserve free travel scheme and its perceived inequity.
However, as we have heard&#151;I hope in the points that I have
made&#151;it is a complex area in which, I fear, no one solution will
please all people.</div>
					<a name="07060622000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State said on Second Reading that until the London
boroughs and TFL can agree a way forward with any potential change to
the reserve scheme, we are not convinced of the case, which the
amendments partially make, for removing the guarantee of a minimum
standard of concessionary travel throughout the capital.</div>
					<a name="07060622000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been a reference to
the comments of the Mayor of London, who, of course, is able to look
after himself. However, looking at the press release, the concern is
the exact point that I have made. The amendments call for the abolition
of the Mayor&#146;s guarantee of the freedom pass. London Councils
transport and environment committee agreed on 14 September
2006 in a briefing that it should lobby for the abolition of the London
reserve scheme. In doing so, it is not surprising that for the 1
million older and disabled people in London who benefit, there are
immense concerns.</div>

						</b> I rise to make some brief comments and to seek
the Minister&#146;s reassurance because, on the face of it, the
clause gives me and my colleagues some
concern.</div>
					<a name="07060622000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the Bill is to extend concessionary free travel on eligible
services to eligible people. Until now, the mechanisms of application
to verify service provision, of operator reimbursement, and of travel
concession authority reimbursement have been via local government.
However, subsection (1) allows the Secretary of State to alter that
mechanism by order, and to impose a central system in relation to
reimbursement and/or other administrative functions of the English
travel concession authorities under sections 145 to 150 of the
Transport Act 2000. The Secretary of State could therefore take such
powers and, in effect, underfund the scheme, which would impose greater
burdens on local government grants. Additionally, the Secretary of
State could take such powers and, by not using the mechanisms of local
government, render the whole scheme opaque, withno right of
appeal for operators or for local
government.</div>
					<a name="07060622000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the clause provides a mechanism to appeal to the Secretary of State in
the event that such powers are taken, the Secretary of State is not
actually under an obligation to take the powers. Will the Minister
therefore clarify under what circumstances the Secretary of State might
wish to take such powers, thereby altering the thrust of the Bill? Will
she reassure us that the relevant order would be dealt with by
means of the affirmative regulatory impact procedure, and that there
would therefore be an obligation to prior consultation? Will she also
assure us that, notwithstanding the making of the order by affirmative
procedure, there would also be a vote in the House? Will she further
confirm the exact nature of the parliamentary scrutiny that is intended
by the clause drafting, and, finally, will she explain the
circumstances in which the clause would
apply?</div>

						</b> The amendments deal with reciprocal arrangements
between the other nations of the United Kingdom. I wish to make it
clear at the outset that by proposing a minor change from
&#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;, we are not suggesting
that the Secretary of State should impose complete reciprocity at the
beginning for someone living in, say, the Shetland Isles to be able to
use the system in London. The particular areas about which we are
concerned were those referred to on Second Reading by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). He
raised the issue of authorities being on the border and circumstances
in which a pensioner may need to visit a hospital that is just over the
border. Under the current arrangements, there is no system in place for
reciprocity. We are concerned about limited circumstances in which
people in border towns may need to access services just across the
border.</div>
					<a name="07060622000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">This a probing
amendment. I hope that the Minister can assure us that such
arrangements will be put in place to cover those instances when it is
important that someone can access a service that is just over the
border. If that does not happen, we shall disadvantage many people who
might have to travel considerably further to access a hospital, whereas
just a few miles down the road in, say, Scotland&#151;as is the case
in Berwick-upon-Tweed&#151;is a hospital that people need to
access.</div>
					<a name="07060622000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is not about extending the provision across the piece, but dealing with
a specific situation in which there is a border town and the services
that people may need to use are only a few miles away. I hope that the
Minister can assure us that some reciprocal arrangements will be put in
place fairly quickly. That would certainly satisfy my right hon.
Friend, who represents a border
constituency.</div>

					<a name="07060622000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my
concern is that the amendment would not set any time frame by which the
Secretary of State could work. Conservative Members are worried that
the amendment could delay the start of the 2008 scheme in England,
which would not be wise. Unless a time frame can be established, we
shall be cautious about it.</div>

								Gillian
Merron:
						</b> I understand the intention behind the amendments
from our previous discussions. I accept the wish to move swiftly
forward in respect of the mutual recognition of concessionary bus
passes throughout the United Kingdom. However, now is not the time. Our
absolute priority must be to implement a workable, national concession
in England in April
2008.</div>
					<a name="07060622000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the Bill
provides for the legislative changes that would be needed to allow for
mutual recognition in the future. The hon. Member for Rochdale made a
specific point about short journeys across borders, to hospitals and so
on. I emphasise that local authorities already have the discretionary
powers that they need in order to allow their residents to cross into
and out of devolved Administrations and England using their
concessionary passes. That is the way to deal with that specific point.
However, there is a wider point to be made. As a Government, we want
older or disabled people resident anywhere in the UK to be able to
travel on any eligible local bus services in the
UK.</div>
					<a name="07060622000223"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I remind the
Committee that concessionary travel is a devolved policy area. One of
the reasons why I cannot agree to amendment No. 14 is that we would be
legislating for Welsh Ministers without proper consultation and without
their agreement. Surely it is also not desirable to oblige the
Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to do something for which there
has not yet been full consultation with the devolved Administrations,
operators and users. We must ensure that the arrangements work
effectively and that the important work on the practical issues is
done.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060622000232"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07060622000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is also no guarantee that the recognition of Scottish passes in
England, as would be obliged by the amendment, would be mirrored in
Scotland or Northern Ireland, by the recognition of English
concessionary passes there, nor that the Scottish or Northern Irish
Administrations would agree to fund travel by their concessionaries in
England and Wales. Moreover, questions about eligibility, modes and
timing are just some of the issues that would need to be discussed and
agreed, in addition to pass recognition and funding arrangements for
the reimbursement of operators. To repeat a well worn figure, from
April next year the Government will be providing around &#163;1
billion a year for concessionary travel in England. Further spending
will occur in the devolved Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07060622000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any move to mutual recognition
will of course incur further costs, which are extremely difficult to
predict at this stage. We know from the introduction of the Scottish
national scheme that people&#146;s travel patterns change when
concessions are enhanced. It would seem wise to have in
place&#151;and working well&#151;the provision for people to travel
across England in the first instance. Once those data are available, we
shall have far greater certainty on the costs of extending coverage
still further. Hon. Members are already pressing me for more certainty
on funding and reimbursement in respect of the April 2008 changes. The
Department is working to provide that certainty in England for next
year, and we do not wish to put at risk all the hard work that local
authorities, operators and the Government are doing in preparing for
the implementation of the national concession.</div>

						Forcing the
arrangements for mutual recognition to be hastened, particularly where
there is provision for local authorities to come to a sensible and
local arrangement, would threaten the successful implementation of the
English national concession. I hope that hon. Members would not want to
do that. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> Earlier today, we discussed the extension of what
might be classed as a committed public service vehicle. One of the
classes included the use of a ferry or boat. The amendment, which I
have been asked to move by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives
(Andrew George), relates to the Isles of Scilly. They merit a special
mention under clause 2, where the national arrangement is extended to
them. As was pointed out on Second Reading by some hon. Members, there
are no buses on the Isles of Scilly, and some people have questioned
why the scheme should apply there. I am sure that hon. Members know
that five islands make up the Isles of Scilly, and that just over 2,000
residents live on those islands. The Isles of Scilly operate as a
unitary and county council that runs all its services from a narrow
council tax base.</div>
					<a name="07060622000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is for
that reason that I am asking the Minister to make a specific and
special exception in extending the scheme to the Isles of Scilly. At
present, the cost of the ferry boat to the mainland is &#163;7 per
trip. The council has reckoned that it will receive no more than
&#163;10,000 in the revenue support grant settlement as reimbursement
of the costs of introducing a concessionary scheme. There is no way
that a council could operate its own special concessionary scheme with
that sum of money. Furthermore, it cannot fund such a scheme because
its council tax base for providing all the services for just over 2,000
residents is so narrow.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>
					<a name="07060622000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are asking for the same sort
of arrangement that operates for Scotland. Residents from the islands
of Orkney or Shetland, for example, are permitted to take one ferry
journey a year to the mainland and then use the buses. I have not
specified frequency in the amendments, but we are looking for some
recognition from the Department that the Isles of Scilly are a special
case, and that there is no way that the council, which has to fund all
the other services on such a narrow council tax base, would be able to
introduce its own
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060622000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would extend the scheme to use of the ferry boat by residents only. The
scheme would not apply to tourists who are visiting the Isles of Scilly
if they use the boat&#151;they would pay the full price&#151;but it
would enable residents to access services on the mainland via a free
ferry
ride.</div>

To access buses on the mainland, residents have to take the ferry.

								Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The amendment that I proposed this morning gave the
Secretary of State the power to implement that change. Clearly, I would
not have expected him to introduce a blanket exception right away; I
would have expected him selectively to introduce exceptions or to
extend the scheme, so that for rural areas without any other
services&#151;no bus service, for example&#151;community transport
would qualify under the concessionary fares scheme. That is
fair.</div>
					<a name="07060622000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe that the biggest cost would fall on rail if the scheme were
extended to everyone, as the Minister said this morning. My immediate
reaction would be to look at communities, particularly rural
communities&#151;the Isles of Scilly would fall under that
definition&#151;consider the alternative forms of transport that are
available and ensure that those qualify under the scheme. There could
be a gradual roll-out, enabling people who would otherwise not benefit
from the national scheme to receive some benefit. That is all we are
asking the Minister to
consider.</div>

Merron:
						</b> It is interesting to see the excitement with which
hon. Members debate the Isles of Scilly. I have not had the pleasure of
visiting them yet, but my predecessor did, and officials were there 10
days ago to discuss transport issues with the council. One of the
points they reported back to me on, about which I can assure the hon.
Member for Rochdale, is that the Isles of Scilly will, as I mentioned
earlier, be working closely with Cornwall county council in preparation
for April 2008. I commend them for doing
so.</div>
					<a name="07060622000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is good
news for older and disabled people, because for the first time it makes
the council of the Isles of Scilly a travel concession authority,
meaning that it will be able to issue concessionary passes to eligible
residents that they can use anywhere in England when visiting the
mainland.</div>
					<a name="07060622000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a
little bit surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments, because
they would give the Secretary of State two powers. First, he would be
able, by order, to extend travel concessions
to</div>
					<a name="07060622000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;water-borne public
passenger
transport&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060622000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">serving the
Isles of Scilly, which in my language means ferries. Secondly, he would
be able to change who is entitled to concessionary travel in the Isles
of Scilly. The Secretary of State already has the power, under clause
8(1)(a), to expand eligibility for the national concession to new
categories of people living in the Isles of Scilly. Similarly, there is
a power under clause 8(1)(b) to include ferries serving the
Isles of Scilly in the statutory scheme, so that they can offer free
travel to all England
pass-holders.</div>
					<a name="07060622000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the council of the Isles of Scilly already has the power to
agree voluntary schemes with transport providers, allowing
discretionary travel concessions to its residents under section 2 of
the Local Government Act 2000. That could, for example, include free
travel on ferries. The people best placed to take account of unique
local circumstances&#151;no or few buses, for example, or being on an
island&#151;are those in the local authorities involved in
discretionary schemes. That is why we have protected that
right.</div>

							<a name="07060622000299"></a>Paul

						</b> Does the Minister accept that, given that that the
Isles of Scilly only has a population of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>2,000, the council tax base does not provide the resources to enable the
introduction of a discretionary scheme providing the full panoply,
including social services and education, which must have
priority?</div>

Merron:
						</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman that on Second
Reading, and earlier in the Committee&#146;s deliberations, some hon.
Members mentioned the funding for concessionary travel that goes to the
Isles of Scilly through the formula grant system, even though there are
currently no bus services operating there. It is worth gently pointing
out that the council could use that money to provide travel concessions
on ferry services and other modes of transport. The hon. Gentleman
might take that constructive message back to the hon. Member for St.
Ives, who represents constituents on the Isles of Scilly, because there
is scope in that regard.</div>
					<a name="07060622000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments constitute
unnecessary duplication and they are somewhat inappropriate. I restate
my belief that it is right for local authorities, given their knowledge
of local circumstances, to decide for themselves what discretionary
enhancements are best for their residents. These proposals would simply
duplicate powers that are already held by the Secretary of State and
the council of the Isles of Scilly. I therefore ask hon. Members not to
press the proposals to a Division.</div>

					<a name="07060622000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment moves our discussion on to the important issue of the
deadline that applies for operators wishing to appeal to the Secretary
of State 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>against local authority concessionary travel reimbursement arrangements.
As I explained in my letter to members of the Committee on 23 May, Lord
Bradshaw raised the issue of the appeals deadline in the other place.
The deadline is 28 days from new or varied reimbursement arrangements
taking effect, and he suggested that that was not sufficient time for
operators to make an evidence-based decision on whether to submit an
appeal to the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07060622000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Bradshaw&#146;s
amendment on Third Reading on 5 February extended the deadline
by which bus operators could appeal to the Secretary of State against
English local authority reimbursement arrangements under the Transport
Act 2000 from 28 days to 56 days from the time new or varied
reimbursement arrangements come into
force.</div>
					<a name="07060622000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Davies of
Oldham, for the Government, responded favourably to the amendment on
the grounds that provision of extra time should offer scope for the
full gathering of high-quality data. That would mean that any appeals
that operators felt compelled to make would be more firmly grounded in
empirical evidence. It should also help reduce some of the uncertainty
that local authorities might otherwise face from more speculative
appeals.</div>
					<a name="07060622000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Third
Reading, Lord Bradshaw tabled a second amendment on the issue to make
changes to the Transport Act 1985, but in the event, it was not moved.
Amendment No. 1 brings back the principle behind that second amendment.
Under the current arrangements regarding local authority travel
concession schemes, under the Transport Act 1985, an authority
running a local scheme can serve an operator with a participation
notice, which requires the recipient to participate in the scheme. The
operator can appeal to the Secretary of State against that, and the
deadline for the appeal is currently 28 days from the date of the
participation
notice.</div>
					<a name="07060622000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will accept that the amendment would largely mirror the
changes already made to the Transport Act 2000 by virtue of
clauses 3(4) to 3(6), by extending the appeal deadline to 56 days from
the date the operator&#146;s obligation to participate in the scheme
would start. That would help to align the provisions for appeals under
the two concessionary legislative regimes. As appeals under both sets
of legislation are, in practice, often made jointly by operators, the
proposed changes to the 1985 Act would help to facilitate the
practice.</div>
					<a name="07060622000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
part of the amendment would make a connected change. At the moment, an
operator intending to appeal against a participation notice must give
the authority notice of his intention to do so, either before the
operator appeals or, if the participation notice requires it, before
the end of a period specified in the notice. Regulations provide that
that period cannot exceed seven days. That provision, which allows a
local authority to specify that operators must give the authority
notice of their intention to appeal within seven days, undermines the
purpose of extending the appeals period and negates the benefits of
giving operators more time to get the data and so on before
appealing.</div>
					<a name="07060622000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment tackles that problem by providing in effect that the local
authority can specify that the operator must give seven days&#146;
notice, or such other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>period as may be specified in regulations, before they can lodge an
appeal. In other words, operators can give notice of an appeal at any
time before they lodge the appeal, except in cases when a local
authority specifies that it would like seven days&#146; notice, or
any such other time as may be specified in regulations, when at least
that notice must be given. The amendment would only apply in England. I
hope that hon. Members can see the benefits that it will bring and will
support
it.</div>

						</b> For my part, I can see the benefit of the
amendment and I am grateful for the letter of explanation that we all
received dated 23 May. There is one point, however, that I want to
raise, on which I hope that the Minister will reflect. It is the
illogic of what she has just argued considering the rejection of my
amendment No. 19. If we were to change the wording of her letter to
read &#147;an authority running a local scheme can serve an operator
with a participation notice&#148;, TFL, running a local scheme, would
be able to serve a London borough with a participation notice, yet in
London there would be no possibility of appeal. We have just gone
through that. The Minister accepted that my amendment, which would have
given the London boroughs some appeal process, did not in any way
affect the minimum guarantee. Although the amendment brings some
consistency and order to the Bill, it highlights yet again the
completely iniquitous state that London boroughs are left
in.</div>

							<a name="07060622000305"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07060622000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, under
clause 8, the Secretary of State gave herself powers to introduce the
national scheme and clause 9 contains provisions on how the variation
for reimbursement and administrative arrangements will operate under
the current scheme. On Second Reading I think that the Secretary of
State quoted a figure of around 215 local councils or transport
authorities that will have responsibility for introducing and running
the scheme. New clause 3 would provide a framework, rather than impose
national arrangements, within which negotiations for the introduction
of a local scheme could operate.</div>
					<a name="07060622000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is obvious to most hon.
Members that within many authorities the five big bus companies
probably run and operate a large number of the services provided. A
considerable administrative and bureaucratic burden will be imposed on
individual councils or passenger transport authorities entering into an
arrangement on the operation of the scheme in their local authority.
New clause 3 would provide a framework for the basic outline of the
scheme to be agreed nationally. I know that the Secretary of State has
asked a number of working parties to work on parts of the Bill and that
they have sought to bring about agreement on how it might operate. The
statutory framework via which such negotiations could take place would
be provided by setting up a concessionary bus fares council. The bus
council would include representatives from user groups, local
authorities, the Department for Transport and anyone else that the
Secretary of State considers appropriate, which would obviously include
the operators. That would allow us to reach some agreement and would
save an awful lot of duplication as a result of individual arrangements
having to be negotiated.</div>
					<a name="07060622000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading many hon.
Members referred to how schemes had operated in their locality and the
ways in which operators who had not been happy with the agreed scheme
in a particular authority had then successfully appealed to the
Secretary of State. For example, in the case of Greater Manchester,
that then imposed an additional cost of &#163;3.5 million
this
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>financial year on the passenger transport authority. If we could agree
to establish a concessionary bus fares council, an appeal and
subsequently the imposition of an additional charge on council tax
payers would be unnecessary because agreement would have been reached
between the operators, the users and the councils responsible for
operating the scheme on how the broad framework of services would
operate.</div>
					<a name="07060622000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, the new clause would not remove the right of individual local
authorities to negotiate enhancements and departures, but it would
provide an overall framework. Given the Minister has said that we will
have an ITSO compliant scheme and a national database, a concessionary
bus fares council would provide the framework within which those
discussions could take place. That would not detract from the work of
the Department; rather it would reflect the views of some of the user
groups and working groups that are currently meeting to discuss the
Bill and provide a statutory framework within which they could
operate.</div>
					<a name="07060622000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will agree to the new clause because it is genuinely an
attempt to strengthen the Bill. There are no additional costs attached
to the provision; indeed, it would probably save money because it would
reduce the duplication that local authorities will have to engage in if
they each have to negotiate a framework for their own scheme. I hope
that she will agree to the new clause because it would place processes
in the Bill that are already happening anyway. It would strengthen
those processes and provide everyone with a framework within which to
operate.</div>

						</b> I am slightly perplexed by the intentions behind
the new clause because it almost replicates the existing concessionary
fares working group, although it attempts to put the group on a
statutory basis. I believe that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments
indicate that the intention is to formalise the consultative
arrangements between the Department, local authorities, operators and
user groups. If that is the case, I would have to ask hon. Members to

						</b> The point I was making before the Division was
that, if the new clause&#146;s intention is to formalise the
consultative arrangements, I must ask the hon. Member for Rochdale to
cite the specific reasons why the arrangements need changing, and why,
presumably, they are not working effectively. The concessionary fares
working group involves representatives from all tiers of local
government&#151;PTEs, London Councils, district, county and unitary
councils, the Local Government Association, operator representatives
from the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the Government offices
for the regions and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>the Department itself. The group has been meeting monthly for almost a
year, and it met regularly before that time.</div>
					<a name="07060622000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members might also wish to
know that several sub-groups of the working group provide advice on
particular issues. For example, the operations and technology sub-group
is considering, among other issues, the technical specification of the
proposed national passes. It has met once a fortnight for many months.
Funding and reimbursement sub-groups have recently been re-established,

that the concessionary fares working group and its sub-groups have put
into considering concessionary bus travel matters over the past two
years, both in advance of the changes that were introduced in April
2006, and in preparation for the implementation of the proposed
national concession in England later next year. The working group plays
a vital role in driving the implementation forward, and I put on record
once again my appreciation of its efforts and involvement.</div>
					<a name="07060622000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, user group
representatives&#151;pensioners and disabled people&#151;play an
important role in keeping the Department informed about issues that
concern them as concessionaires. I recently attended a meeting of the
stakeholder group, and I welcome the opportunity to hear from people
who will benefit first hand. Engagement will continue, especially as we
prepare to communicate to potential users the key messages about the
national concession.</div>
					<a name="07060622000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should remind ourselves that
the Department relies not only on informal consultation. For example,
we have just begun formal consultation on the design and
technical specifications of the national concessionary pass. The
consultation is open until 20 July, and to the public as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="07060622000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I return to
the purpose of the new clause. From a recent and informal canvass of
members of the concessionary fares working group, there is little
appetite for putting it on a statutory footing. I was happy to hear
that result, because such action would increase bureaucracy and reduce
the flexibility of the group to respond to changing circumstances, and
I am not at all clear about the added value. Would council
recommendations be binding? If so, how would they be enforced? If not,
how would they be useful? How many members would the council have? How
would they be chosen? What would be the decision-making procedure? How
would it be administered? Who would fund it? And how exactly would it
help all parties to implement the national concession successfully next
year?</div>

after the legislation has been implemented?</div>

Merron:
						</b> Yes, it certainly will. As I believe I said on the
Floor of the House, in April 2008 we will assign dedicated people in
the Department to assist local authorities with any administrative
difficulties that they might have. Not only will we have continuity
beyond April 2008, which is important, but we will make available extra
support. I do not doubt that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>hon. Gentleman&#146;s intentions are good, but setting up a statutory
concessionary bus fares council could have a negative effect, by taking
up valuable time and resources at precisely the wrong moment.</div>
					<a name="07060622000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will of course examine the
forward role of the concessionary fares working group. To put a more
positive slant on local authority assistance, I should point out that
it is already available. The Department is providing local authorities
with clear, dedicated resources to ensure that the measures work for
the benefit of their communities. Bearing all that in mind, I urge
reconsideration of the need for such a statutory body. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new
clause.</div>

role of the non-statutory voluntary group, which appears to be the same
as the role that I envisaged for the concessionary bus fares council, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Clearly, that will be endorsed by other members of the Committee. I am
delighted that we have been able to complete our deliberations well
within the timetable. Like a well-run bus service, the deliberations
have been punctual and the ride has been smooth and comfortable. There
have been no deviations from the route, and no emergency stops or
concessions&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

not run out of gas. Quite seriously, Mr. Bayley, I am

record my thanks to the Clerks, to those who prepare <i class="I">Hansard</i>, to
members of the Committee on both sides who have participated so well,
and to the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for
Motherwell and Wishaw, without whom none of this would have been
possible.</div>

						I also thank
the Bill team, my private office, officials at the Department and the

want me to add a last-but-not-least thanks to the Chancellor, who
announced the extension of the concession in the Budget. I look forward
to Report and, more importantly, to the enactment of the Bill. It is a
source of pleasure and great pride, as I am sure it is to hon. Members
and colleagues, to be involved in Government legislation that will make
a real difference to some 11 million people. It is a central plank of
the Government&#146;s work to tackle social exclusion and to improve
access to bus services. I welcome the conclusion of the Committee and I
thank everyone, including you, Mr. Bayley, for your
assistance. I look forward to the next stage of the Bill&#146;s
