Question resuming 
<H4><center>Clause 7 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Use of information by Board </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 3, leave out lines 17 to 19 and insert 
`by the Board'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 23, leave 
out from `supplied' to end of line 24 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`only to officers of the Board.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Davies:</B> The amendments follow the concern that I expressed in our discussion of the previous 
clause and schedule about confidentiality. It is possible it is certainly not impossible that the Government 
might succeed in assuaging our concerns and fears, and in those circumstances, we might not need to 
press the amendment to a Division. 
<P>
We set much store by the amendment, because we seek to ensure that information that is available to 
the Board of the Inland Revenue is not misused. What is more, we wish to ensure that a surreptitious 
expansion of the range of people to whom confidential personal information could be communicated does 
not happen, as it would result in a loosening of the strict principles that we have always held and which 
we believe should be preserved. 
<P>
The part of clause 7 that we find particularly objectionable, which the amendment seeks to remove, 
is the paragraph that enables the board to pas on information to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person providing services to the Board". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Under our amendment, the board could obviously use information internally, but it would be 
prevented from passing on information involving the personal details of a taxpayer or a contributor to the 
national insurance fund to persons outside the board. 
<P>
We need some assurance about how those powers will be used and what is meant by 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person providing services to the Board". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I may be wrong, in which case I look forward to an explanation, but I assume that that provision 
covers subcontractors to the Inland Revenue who may take over some of the functions currently exercised 
by the Contributions Agency that have now been passed over to the Revenue perhaps firms such as 
Andersen Consulting, the former employer of the Economic Secretary. 
<P>
It is a matter of considerable concern that people who may sometimes have a temporary role 
providing services to the Inland Revenue will acquire personal information. No doubt such companies will 
have some sort of contractual responsibility to preserve the confidentiality of such information, but a large 
number of human beings will be working for that company or are themselves subcontractors to that 
company who can use that information when they leave that employment or when the contract comes to 
an end. 
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
In practice, it will be impossible to pursue such people if there is a breach of confidentiality. All 
kinds of things could result in such a breach. Someone may make an indiscreet comment in a pub, 
thinking that he or she is frightfully clever to have inside information about someone known to both 
parties in the conversation. However, it could be a more serious matter, such as selling confidential 
information for commercial gain and so forth. 
<P>
Indeed, recent serious cases have come to light of lists being acquired from the Driver and Vehicle 
Licensing Agency in Cardiff that have been misused for commercial purposes, acquired by people who 
used that information as a mailing list to send junk mail about various services. That is the sort of thing 
that might happen. 
<P>
The obvious way to prevent that happening is to say that information of a personal nature that is a 
distinction that I was trying to persuade the Government to make in relation to the previous schedule 
should not be passed on to such people. Obviously, information of an aggregated kind, perhaps protected 
by a code number, could, in accordance with our amendment, be passed on to such necessary 
subcontractors. 
<P>
I shall listen with an open mind to the Government's explanation of why the amendment should or 
should not be accepted. If the Government do not want to accept it, I shall expect to hear a clear, reasoned 
argument why not. We are looking for a clear description of the rules and protections that the Government 
intend to use to enforce confidentiality I hope that they have thought carefully about the matter and I hope 
that they will give us some reassuring answers on a subject by which, as I said, we set much store. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hewitt:</B> I very much hope that I shall be able to assuage the concerns of the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford. Amendment No. 1 seeks to leave out lines 17 to 19 rather than lines 16 to 18, 
but that is a fairly technical matter. 
<P>
As I said in my remarks on clause 6 and schedule 6, the intention of clause 7 is to make appropriate 
use of the information that it has, and that it will have after the transfer to it of the Contributions Agency, 
for carrying out its various functions. That includes being able to pass information freely to the contractors 
who provide the Board with services provided always, of course, that the information is used by those 
contractors only for the purpose of providing services to the Board of the Inland Revenue. Of course, those 
service providers, whether they work for the Inland Revenue or for the Contributions Agency, are 
contractually bound to keep data confidential. Indeed, they sign statements and undertakings to that effect. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Is it the company, the contractor or the subcontractor that gives that undertaking and 
signs those terms and conditions that can be pursued for breach of contract if confidentiality is breached; 
or is it every individual who is given access to that information? I believe that individuals given access to 
confidential information in the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office have to sign the Official Secrets 
Act, which binds them legally. Does the Economic Secretary refer to a personal and individual obligation, 
or a contractual and corporate obligation? It makes all the difference. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I believe that it is both, since the persons supplying the services are responsible for 
ensuring confidentiality. 
<P>
Let me explain the background. The previous Conservative Government brought outside contractors 
into the heart of Government. We understand, at least in part, why that was done. But there are 
consequences to bringing private companies in to Government Departments or agencies, or in this case 
the Inland Revenue, and contracting others to provide services such as computer services. 
<P>
A contractor who is providing computer services, whether to the Contributions Agency or to the 
Inland Revenue, will on occasion need to test the programs in action and to handle real data. In order to 
run such a test, the contractor needs to be able to read that data not to pry on taxpayers or contributors, but 
to ensure that the program is running as intended, to identify and correct any problems that there might be 
in the program and thus to meet their contractual obligation of providing IT services to the board or the 
Contributions Agency. 
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be that we would have to tear up the contracts that we inherited 
for the provision of IT services, or we would have to stop the contractors doing this type of testing of 
programs on real data. It would, therefore, be much more difficult to identify and fix faults; there would be 
worse public services; and, there would be more errors. There is a danger that if unfixed problems in a 
computer program gave rise to compensation claims, the public sector would be liable for such claims, or 
contractors, operating under contracts negotiated by the previous Administration, might require additional 
payments because we had imposed on them a less efficient way of identifying and trying to resolve 
problems. 
<P>
The amendment, although I understand its probing nature, is completely inconsistent with the 
concerns that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford and his colleagues have about the operation of 
NIRS2 the computer system that will be transferred with the agency to the Inland Revenue as a result of 
the Bill. We shall eventually come to that issue under clause 28. But, their concerns, if I am right in 
anticipating them, are inconsistent with the effect of the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford will accept my assurance that there is nothing sinister about the provision. It 
simply preserves the existing provisions between the Contributions Agency and its contractors, which has 
not given rise to any breaches of individual confidentiality or privacy an issue on which I share the hon. 
Gentleman's concerns. The clause transfers those provisions to the Inland Revenue as a consequence of 
the transfer of the Contributions Agency. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his 
amendments, but we shall oppose them if he does not. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I accept the Economic Secretary's sincerity when she fully says that she shares my 
concerns. It is gratifying to have her reassurance that so far there have been no breaches of confidentiality 
on the part of outside contractors. The risk that is addressed in our amendment remains theoretical, and 
long may it be so. 
<P>
When the Economic Secretary said that if the amendment were accepted, the Government would 
have to tear up their contract with existing providers of IT services, I could not help feeling that it might 
be a good idea to at least be in a position to threaten to do that. However, that anticipates the debate that 
we shall have subsequently either later this evening, or on Thursday on clause 28. In the light of the 
Economic Secretary's assurances, for which I am grateful, and her reasoned response to our arguments, to 
which we shall draw her attention if there are breaches in the future, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, inpage 3, line 36, after `Part' insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to the rights of any employer or employee hereunder affected to appeal to the Commissioners 
or to the Courts'. 
<P>
This is a very important point, and I suspect that the Economic Secretary or the Minister of State 
may be tempted to say that the amendment is unnecessary, otiose and already provided for. If that is the 
case, we shall all welcome it, but our amendment would reinforce the fact that we do not have arbitrary 
government. I know that the Labour party, in its heart of hearts, is not anti-democratic, so I cannot believe 
that it wants arbitrary government. Let us imagine reading the clause in vacuo. If a being from Mars 
landed somewhere on the globe and picked up the clause in a Bill that was in danger of being enacted he 
would conclude that the Government were very arbitrary. It states that an officer of the board will decide 
<P>
"whether. . . a person is or was an earner and, if so, the category of earners in which he is or was to 
be included" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether a person is or was employed" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether a person is or was entitled to pay contributions of any particular class". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
So it goes on, throughout the clause. It is extremely arbitrary. The clause should clearly state that the 
provisions are not arbitrary. 
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
 
<P>
It is strange that clause 9, to which we will come later, has some attributes of the clause but at least 
has the decency to say that its measures are subject 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to the provisions of this Part and of the Social Security Administration Act 1992" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
which provides for tribunals and similar matters. However, the ridiculous clause that we are debating 
contains nothing like that; it does not state that it is subject to the protections in some other Act. It says 
simply that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it shall be for an officer of the Board. . . to decide". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That constitutes arbitrary, tyrannical government. 
<P>
Our amendment offers protection against that. I do not mind if it is tautologous and duplicates other 
protection, or if the Minister is about to tell me that everyone under common law has a right to judicial 
review and so on, so that arbitrary government is impossible. There is no harm in a belt-and-braces 
approach. English law is full of it we frequently and traditionally make provisions certain by repeating 
them in legislation. The rights of employers or employees to appeal to the commissioners or courts rights 
that are referred to elsewhere in the Bill and in the corpus of existing legislation should therefore be made 
explicit in a preamble to the clause, thereby setting a healthy context for the otherwise extraordinarily 
arbitrary-sounding powers that it gives Revenue officials. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can provide some reassurance to the hon. Gentleman. If he turns over the page to 
clause 11, he will see that it states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This section applies to any decision of an officer of the Board under section 8" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
the one that we are discussing and that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the case of a decision to which this section applies 
<P>
(a) if it relates to a person's entitlement to statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay, the 
employee and employer concerned shall each have a right to appeal to the tax appeal Commissioners" . 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That clause fully meets the objectives of the hon. Gentleman's amendment admittedly not within the 
same clause, but both clauses are in part II. 
<P>
I have examined the amendment carefully to see whether anything in it is not captured by clause 11; 
I cannot find anything. If I am wrong, no doubt the hon. Gentleman will draw that to my attention. 
However, I hope that he agrees that clause 11 meets his concern and withdraws his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman I should also be grateful for assurance on another 
matter. I make no bones about the fact that if I had tried to read in full every Act referred to in the Bill and 
potentially modified by the Bill I would have done little else for the past 12 months. I do not therefore 
know what section 121D of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 says, but it is clear from my 
reading of parts of clause 11 that that Act could set aside the protections contained in that clause. 
However, if he can assure me again, that would be reproduced in Hansard that it will not do so, and 
confirms that clause 11(4) fully meets the objectives of the amendment, I will be happy to withdraw the 
amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can indeed assure the hon. Gentleman that subsection (4) will not set aside the impact 
ofclause 11. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, the clause will provide for 
officers of the Board of Inland Revenue to take decisions on specified matters relating to national 
insurance contributions, statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. The list of decisions to be taken by 
officers which is set out in paragraphs (a) to (l) of subsection (1), is largely derived from the list of matters 
currently reserved for determination by the Secretary of State under section 17 of the Social Security 
Administration Act 1992 the current legislation. 
<P>
Although straightforward, this important clause is somewhat lengthy, but necessarily so. The 
Committee will agree that those matters on which Inland Revenue officers will take decisions in future are 
clearly specified in the clause. It should stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 9 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations with respect to decisions </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This clause is based on section 11 of the Social Security Act 1998, and provides the 
framework for Inland Revenue decisions on the matters specified in clause 8(1). Subsection (1) will allow 
for the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations about decision making. Again, this clause is 
straightforward. It will provide the machinery for the Revenue to make decisions for which it will become 
responsible as specified in the previous clause. It should stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am intrigued by one point, which we should explore for a moment. Subsection (3) 
refers to experts. Subsection (2) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where it appears to an officer of the Board that a matter before him involves a question of fact 
requiring special expertise, he may direct that in dealing with that matter he shall have the assistance of 
one or more experts." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In what circumstances will the experts be used? What experts will be involved? Most important this 
goes to the heart of our system of natural justice will the expert's advice, report or conclusions be equally 
available to the appellant? I should like the Minister to give a specific answer to that very specific 
question. 
<P>
The Minister knows that it is a principle of English law that, when matters of fact are to be 
determined in a court of law, neither side must conceal material facts from the other. If the prosecution 
knows of a fact that is material to the defence, it must be disclosed and vice versa. In the interests of 
natural justice, it is important that that principle should apply under the clause because the same matters 
are at stake. I have tried to be very succinct; I do not want to take up more time than is required, but I 
should like a clear answer to that question. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The Revenue currently assumes that such expert assistance will needed only in cases 
that involve medical issues, such as statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay. The intention is that the 
Revenue will have access to medical advice from SEMA doctors, who currently provide such advice to the 
Benefits Agency. The experts' opinion will be disclosed to the other side, but there can be an appeal, 
which, I think, is what the hon. Gentleman had in mind. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that assurance. It is not ideal that the Government want to take a 
general power to give their officials the right to call experts and then explain that, in practice, it will be 
used only in a narrow context for doctors or medical experts. The situation is not satisfactory; I am a great 
believer in the Government taking specifically what powers they require. They should not yield to the 
temptation which is enormous, given their large majority to take more powers than they require and open 
up the field much wider than was intended. Clearly, that will give rise to abuse in the future. 
<P>
I shall not make more of the point, other than put down a marker. I am glad that we are having a 
fairly productive discussion on the clause. The Government's assurances have been recorded and they 
know that their colleagues in the Treasury who will be taking over so many functions will be responsible 
for living up to those assurances. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 10 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Decisions varying or superseding earlier decisions </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause deals with decisions by the Inland Revenue under clause 8 that may need to 
be varied or superseded for some reason. It may seem a slightly curious clause, but it is not a novel 
provision. It reflects sections 9 and 10 of the Social Security Act 1998 and provides the power for the 
Inland Revenue to make regulations to cover aspects of the variation or superseding of decisions. 
<P>
The clause provides the flexibility that is needed if circumstances change or if decisions are found to 
have been based on incomplete or incorrect facts. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Stephen Davies. I am sorry, I mean Mr. Quentin Davies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> There are so many people around with the name "Davies", that there could 
easily be a Stephen in the Room. 
<P>
I have been reasonable throughout our proceedings. I have certainly not been vexatious or 
unnecessarily obstructive. If that is the only weapon remaining to one in the face of unreasonable 
behaviour from Labour Members, however, it can and must be used. But I do not believe that that is the 
right way in which to conduct our proceedings. 
<P>
The clause creates enormous problems for Opposition Members. It really is a Henry VIII provision, 
is it not? It must be read out for the benefit of those people who will be reading Hansard without a copy of 
the Bill in front of them. It states that "The Board" just a board 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may by regulations make provision ... for any decision of an officer of the Board ... to be varied 
either within the prescribed period or in prescribed cases or circumstances, 
<P>
(b) for any such decisions to be superseded, in prescribed circumstances, by a subsequent decision 
made by an officer of the Board, and 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
this is the most extraordinary provision of all 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) for any such decision as confirmed or varied by the tax appeal Commissioners on appeal to be 
superseded, in the event of a material change of circumstances since the decision was made, by a 
subsequent decision made by an officer of the Board." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is an extraordinary situation in which one can go to appeal, get a decision by the commissioners 
and then an Inland Revenue official can say, "Oh, a material change of circumstances has taken place. I 
am setting aside the decision of the commissioners." That is a negation of the whole concept of an appeal 
and it leads back directly to the prospect of arbitrary and tyrannical bureaucratic government. We are not 
having that. It is completely out of the question. 
<P>
The least that the Government could decently have done would have been to provide that, if the 
member of the Inland Revenue considered that there was a material change of circumstances, he should 
have the right to go back to the commissioners to ask them to vary their decision in the light of the 
supposed change of circumstances. It would then be for the commissioners to decide whether there had 
been a material change of circumstances, not one of the parties to the original issue that was arbitrated by 
the commissioners. That is a complete negation of every principle of natural justice. I do not expect the 
Government to give an assurance, but unless they can persuade me that I have fundamentally 
misunderstood the purpose of the clause and agree that we can reconsider it, we shall vigorously oppose it 
and similar proposals in other legislation. 
<P>
<H5>9 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I, too, am pleased that we are making some progress. 
<P>
There could be a number of circumstances in which a decision would need to be varied. The most 
likely is where an appeal has been made against a decision or where an officer of the Inland Revenue has 
concluded that the original decision was based on incorrect or incomplete facts, or was wrong in law. 
Alternatively, a decision may be superseded where it has ceased to be relevant through a change in 
circumstance or law. The clause provides the flexibility for decisions to be corrected in those 
circumstances. it reflects existing provisions and is not a novel arrangement. 
<P>
I should make it clear that officials will not be able to overturn tribunal decisions within the context 
of the subject matter and the period of appeal. A different result may be appropriate if there are subsequent 
changes of facts. The clause allows for that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it is appropriate 
to reflect existing arrangements. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. The Minister has done nothing other than reinforce my serious concerns. The 
commissioners can take a decision, but the Revenue official who was party to the disagreement that 
caused the commissioners to arbitrate can overrule them on the grounds that they either got their facts 
wrong or were wrong on a point of law. How extraordinary! It demonstrates the difference between image 
and reality that so pleases new Labour. It thinks that people cannot tell the difference between the two. 
The image is that the national insurance contributions payer has a right of appeal against arbitrary 
decisions made by an official in the Revenue, which we dealt with in clause 8. If that person goes to the 
commissioners and they decide in his favour, they can be overruled by the Revenue. The Revenue is not 
merely a party to disputes under arbitration by the commissioners, but is an appellate tribunal that 
overrides the commissioners. It can base its decisions either on a point of law or on a point of fact. 
<P>
What is the point of this charade? It would be insulting to be a commissioner in such circumstances. 
It is certainly an insult to offer the national insurance contributions payer the image of a right of appeal 
when in reality there is no such thing. That is utterly obnoxious and unacceptable. It is no use the Minister 
telling me that the provision is not new. I am not interested in that. The Committee's job is to make good 
law now. It is about time the Government recognised that that is the Committee's responsibility. It is no 
use appealing to a precedent that might be good or bad. It is up to us to decide on the merits of the 
principle and whether it should continue to be enshrined in English law. It seems to me that we are going 
against every fundamental principle of our tribunal process that is fair, evenhanded and objective. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> May I offer a final explanation? If the circumstances or the law change, the decision 
may need to change. If an appeal decision is overturned, a further appeal could be made. The original 
decision would be overturned only if the facts change, not if the official did not like the commissioners' 
finding. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister is no doubt making a valiant attempt to defend the indefensible. Of course 
that is not an acceptable explanation. Appeals in all judicial or quasi-judicial contexts can be based on law 
or fact. It is no use having an appeal on a matter of fact when a part to it is able subsequently to overrule 
the body that has given the judgment, on the grounds that it got the facts right and the commissioners got 
the facts wrong. The Minister is digging deeper into a hole. I am extremely sorry that the Government 
endorse this proposal. It is a shocking clause and we shall continue to oppose it.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
</FONT><B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We now come to five clauses dealing with the appeals process for national insurance 
contributions and related matters. It may help if I provide some background to clause 11. 
<P>
When the Social Security Act 1998 became law, a new appeals tribunal was created to hear appeals 
on all decisions of the Secretary of State for Social Security in relation to social security matters. That was 
a substantial modernisation of the law and a simplification of the social security appeals process. We made 
a commitment at that time that we would look again at the approach to national insurance contributions in 
the light of the proposed transfer of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue. After such 
consideration, we concluded that it would make much more sense for appeals on national insurance 
contributions, statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay functions that were transferred to the Inland 
Revenue by the Bill to be heard by the tax appeal commissioners. The main reason for that decision was 
that the same issue will often arise in a tax case and a contributions case. A common examples arises from 
a dispute over employment status whether someone should be treated as employed or self-employed for tax 
and national insurance contributions purposes. Entitlement to statutory maternity pay and statutory sick 
pay is a similar case in point. 
<P>
It is neither helpful nor efficient for the appellant to have to take his or her case to separate tribunals, 
one of which deals with social security and the other with tax, when the same matter and the same set of 
circumstances have to be judged. It is costly and worrying to the appellant, and it is also costly to 
employers, whose liability, especially to national insurance contributions, hinges on the appeal decision. 
The proposals under clause 11 and subsequent clauses ensure that appeals on contributions matters and on 
statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay will be heard by the tax appeal commissioners. That 
decision has been welcomed by members of the business community, who clearly believe that enabling 
them and their employees to bring cases directly to the tax appeal commissioners, instead of to two 
separate bodies, will save them time and money. I hope that allays any fears about the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I wondered whether the Economic Secretary was reading her brief for the next clause 
because she seemed to touch on several points germane to clause 12. 
<P>
I understand that there is perhaps some difficulty if one is required to take one's case to the unified 
appeal tribunal and to the Inland Revenue commissioners. However, our concern about the change to the 
appeal structure is, first, that the appeal structure is a complete charade because it can be overturned by 
the body against which one is appealing, so it is rather a waste of time. I believe we established that 
during the debate on clause 10. 
<P>
I am concerned because, although Inland Revenue commissioners are fine, upstanding people we 
discovered this morning, Mr McWilliam, that your colleague, Mr. Malins, has, in his time, been a general 
commissioner at the Inland Revenue they have no experience in social security cases. I hope that the 
Economic Secretary realises that sick pay and maternity pay involve consideration of many human 
problems of a social security nature that have nothing to do with tax, and however expert one is in the 
field of tax, one may be new to such matters I dare say that some people might even be less sympathetic, 
but that is not so much the point. The point is that they will have no expertise. Does the Economic 
Secretary plan to spend any taxpayers' money on providing additional training to commissioners both 
general and special commissioners because, under the Bill, both will be able to hear appeals?

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. Of course we are putting in 
place arrangements to ensure the smooth operation of the new appeals process from April. 
<P>
As I said, in many cases, the issues that arise on appeal in relation to national insurance 
contributions are the same sorts of issues that already arise in relation to tax appeals. Therefore, both 
special and general commissioners will have experience of dealing with such problems. However, we are 
ensuring that tax appeal commissioners will be given further training before they begin to hear appeals on 
decisions relating to the functions that the Bill transfers to the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
<B>Mr Davies:</B> We have been debating points that I thought would arise in relation to clause 12, and the 
main substantive point that I wished to raise under clause 11 has already been dealt with in our discussion 
of clause 8, because clause 11 relates to clause 8. I am grateful for the hon. Lady's assurances, and shall 
not seek to impede the inclusion of the clause in the Bill. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 12 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Exercise of right of appeal </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Clause 12 addresses the way in which the process for appeals should work. It specifies 
how an appeal should be made and provides rules for determining whether the appeal should be heard by 
the general commissioners or special commissioners because both will, in various circumstances, be able 
to hear appeals. 
<P>
Clause 12 essentially replicates the provisions that exist for appeals in income tax matters but with 
some particular treatment to reflect the different nature of national insurance contributions, statutory sick 
pay and statutory maternity pay, which are the functions transferred to the Contributions Agency. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I have some brief questions for the Economic Secretary relating to subsection (1) and, in 
particular, to the period of 30 days within which an appeal must be lodged. 
<P>
I see from the explanatory notes that the 30-day appeal deadline has been lifted from section 31(1) of 
the TMA, which I assume is the Taxes Management Act. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> indicated assent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> How many appeals are ruled out of court because they exceed the 30-day deadline? Do 
the Government propose to examine whether 30 days is the right period and is there any flexibility so that 
special circumstances, such as a bereavement or a fire, can be taken into account? I should be grateful for 
the Economic Secretary's response to those points. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. The 30-day period is the same 
as for income tax appeals, but, as with such appeals, if a Revenue officer is satisfied that the appellant had 
a reasonable excuse for a late appeal, he may admit the appeal. If the officer is not satisfied about the 
reasons for the late appeal, he must refer the appeal to the commissioners, who will then determine 
whether the late appeal should be admitted. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 13 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations with respect to appeals </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Clause 13 provides for regulations to set out the detailed procedures for handling 
appeals. As I have said, those procedures will be based on the established procedures in the Taxes 
Management Act. Therefore, no new points of substance arise on the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Again, I am not sure that I can accept the Economic Secretary's assurance, at least not 
without having more detail. As I read the clause, it seems to me, rather intriguingly and frighteningly, 
that it could be used to override the procedures set out in clause 12. Clause 13 states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Board may, by regulations made with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord 
Advocate" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
in other words, all agreed among the Government 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make provision with respect to appeals to the tax appeal Commissioners under this Part." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It then says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations ... may, in particular", 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
but it does not exclude anything. Therefore, if we pass the clause, we are saying to the Government, 
"We are setting up an elaborate procedure in clause 12, but if you do not like it or subsequently want to 
bury it, you can go ahead and do it anyway". That is insulting to Parliament and frightening from the 
citizen's point of view. Perhaps I should be told if I am reading the clause wrongly. If I am not, we cannot 
accept it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The intention of the clause is straightforward, perhaps frighteningly straightforward, to 
use the hon. Gentleman's word. It simply follows existing tax appeal procedures. 
<P>
The intention is simple. As far as possible we want appellants, their advisers, Inland Revenue staff 
and the appeal commissioners to use a single set of procedures based on familiar tax procedures. Clause 
13 gives effect to that and is modelled on the corresponding provisions of the Taxes Management Act. It 
is fair to say that the hon. Gentleman's fears about the clause have not been realised in relation to tax 
appeals. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister has not addressed my fears at all. All that she has said is that there is 
already an element of arbitrariness in the system, so let us extend it. Conservative Members believe that, if 
there is an element of arbitrariness in the system, we should use this opportunity to reduce it. 
<P>
The Economic Secretary recognises that there is a great deal of disruption at present as a result of 
her getting rid of the unified appeals tribunal and replacing it with this arrangement for social security 
cases to go before the tax commissioners. If we go to the trouble of producing a new appeals procedure, we 
must have a good new provision rather than an obnoxious and unacceptable one. It will create a 
tremendous sense of uncertainty. The Government will be able to vary the arrangements that we have 
debated this evening as they see fit. 
<P>
I am afraid to say that the provision marks a further step towards arbitrary government. We want less 
arbitrary government in this country, regardless of which party is in power. Parliament has already 
abandoned far too much of its influence on the nation's affairs. The problem has existed for one or two 
generations but it has been exacerbated enormously in the past 18 months. One must take a stand 
somewhere, and we should do so here and now by throwing out the clause.

<H4><center>Matters arising as respects decisions </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
</FONT><B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The clause will put in place another part of the appeals process jigsaw. It will allow for 
regulations to be made that set out what happens pending a decision being taken, or where a decision that 
has been taken is under appeal, and for the consequences of such a decision being varied or superseded. 
The clause is straightforward and will mirror current procedures in relation to tax decisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It just gets worse, does it not? The clause is another unacceptable encroachment by 
officialdom on natural justice. It appears that the Revenue has drafted clauses on behalf of Ministers who 
have paid them little attention and who have the invidious task of defending them. The bureaucracy has 
drafted its own charter. A series of clauses beginning with clause 8 will give arbitrary powers to unelected 
officials. That is particularly true of clauses 12, 13 and 14. We have discovered that the supposed 
counterbalance of a tribunal is fraudulent and can be overridden on appeal by the official who is taken to 
the tribunal. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> As usual and characteristically, my hon. Friend understates his case. [Laughter.] 
Subsection (3) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations under this section must be made with the concurrence of the Secretary of State in so 
far as they relate to statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In other words, officials will be able to make regulations that relate to anything else without the 
concurrence of the Secretary of State. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is right. We know that the Secretary of State is no longer allowed to 
cross the street without the Treasury's consent. 
<P>
I should say to those who think that I am taking an unduly pessimistic or black view of the clauses 
that my fundamental interpretation of their trust and significance has not been contested by Government 
members of the Committee. It is a depressing prospect. 
<P>
Clause 14 will create an extraordinary situation when there is an appeal awaiting the commissioners' 
determination. We know that the whole process is a deception because the commissioners' ruling may be 
set aside by the official. Pending that, the official will determine what happens. In an appeal process 
involving a dispute between two parties, neither party can be impartial because both are, by definition, 
partial to the case before the tribunal. However, one part will be able, arbitrarily, to determine the conduct 
of the other until the appeal is heard. I wonder whether citizens of the Chinese empire under the 
mandarins had a worse deal than people will have under the Bill. Unless I have seriously misunderstood 
the purport of the clause, it is fundamentally unacceptable in principle.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am afraid that the nightmarish vision conjured up by the hon. Gentleman is so extreme 
that it is probably impossible for me to satisfy him on the matter. I simply reiterate 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way? 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, we have pursued the matter already. 
<P>
Clause 14 derives from section 80 of the Social Security Act 1998. The Secretary of State's consent is 
needed for any regulations covering statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay. Any regulations made by 
the Inland Revenue under clause 14 will, of course, have to be laid before Parliament in the normal way, 
and will be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's nightmarish visions may entertain the Committee briefly, but they should not 
be allowed to detain us in implementing this sensible measure. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies :</B> Again, the Economic Secretary is not contesting my understanding of the purport of the 
clause. I am sorry that she is not able to do so, and I am sorry about the position that the law will be in if 
the Bill is enacted. The hon. Lady is implicitly confirming that by 
{**fcsaying that she is following various precedents. If there are such precedents, they are the wrong ones to 
follow. The Committee should be trying to write better law, to produce more objective justice, to introduce 
better checks and balances into the system and to ensure better rights for citizen and principles of justice. 
This is no joke. The clause is heading in quite the wrong direction. It is obnoxious and I hope that my 
hon. Friends will join me in voting against it.

</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I mentioned a few minutes ago the Social Security Act 1998 and the new unified appeals 
tribunal that it will put in place. The new decision-making system and the new unified appeals tribunal is 
not yet in force. They will come into operation during the second half of 1999, and will be introduced in 
phases. The new unified appeals tribunal under the 1998 Act will therefore come into effect after the day 
appointed for the transfer of the operational functions of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue. 
It will therefore come into effect after the day when we want the decisions referred to in this group of 
clauses to become appealable to the tax appeal commissioners. The group of clauses setting up the appeals 
process through the tax commissioners refers to the 1998 Act, so clause 15 is necessary to enable 
appropriate powers to be taken to deal with the transitional period when the 1998 Act referred to in the 
clauses on the appeal system has not yet come into force. The clause deals purely with that temporary 
transitional period. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have a one-sentence question. Do I read the clause correctly in supposing that it could 
be used to override clause 16, by Executive action? We have already heard that clause 13 could be used to 
override a previous clause, clause 12. Are we witnessing a new phenomenon, whereby a clause could be 
used, as a result of a wholly Executive decision, to override a subsequent clause, clause 16? 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No. Clause 15 will not have that effect. It will simply ensure that the decision-making 
regime and the appeals regime that the Bill introduces, which will come into effect on 1 April, will be able 
to operate alongside the present arrangements for social security adjudication before the 1998 Act comes 
fully into effect. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Economic Secretary has just repeated the section of her brief that she read out 
before. I ask my question again, based this time on the words of the clause: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may by regulations" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
we know what that means 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"modify any of the enactments to which this subjection applies" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That subsection applies to: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Acts amended by section 16 of, and Schedule 7 to, this Act." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Clause 16 immediately follows. The only way in which I can interpret that is that the Secretary of 
State may use regulations to amend clause 16. The Economic Secretary has still not persuaded me that the 
clause does not bear the significance that I attributed to it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall try one more time. Subsection (2) relates to the Acts amended by clause 16. The 
power conferred by clause 15 is purely one of modification. It applies only during the transitional period, 
and only for the purposes that I have already spelt out. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We must accept the Economic Secretary's assurance. I am sure that it is given in good 
faith, and it is an encashable assurance for future purposes should we need it. On that basis, we shall not 
seek to oppose the clause. 
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 8, line 27, leave out from 
beginning to end of line 9 on page 9 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Provision may be made by the Inland Revenue by regulations as to the making by their officers

<P>
(5) Subsection (2) and (3) of section 8 of the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, 
etc.) Act 1999 and sections 9 to 12 of that Act shall apply to relevant decisions as they apply to decisions 
under section 7 of that Act.'. </font></ul>
<P>
At this late stage, having now reached the point at which I make my first contribution, I welcome 
you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. 
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to give the Committee, and, I hope, the Government, a chance to 
reconsider the slight difference in this case in the treatment of matters that go to appeal that have 
previously been heard by Inland Revenue staff. In other cases, when decisions have been taken under the 
Bill by Inland Revenue staff, the appeal and variation of such decisions is also dealt with by Inland 
Revenue staff. It seems logical that that should happen throughout. It is slightly odd that in this case the 
tribunal attached to the Department of Social Security, rather than the Inland Revenue staff the tax 
commissioners should hear matters on appeal. In this case, the special commissioners, rather than the 
general commissioners, would probably be needed to hear such variation on appeal cases. That seems to 
be the area in which it might be expected to lie. If the Government genuinely believe that the right 
solution is to leave matters in the hands of the tribunals, I hope that they might be able to explain rather 
more fully than they have so far why they think that. 
<P>
I doubt whether there will be many such appeals. They will be to do with SERPS, and they will cover 
rather esoteric and probably rather technical matters. Appeals will not be heard often, and it may be a bit 
much to expect social security tribunals to attain a great expertise in such matters expertise that will 
probably be needed. 
<P>
I understand that some thought is being given to the possibility, if we go down that line, of a tax 
expert being attached to the tribunals. If so, it would surely be sensible for appeals to be heard in the first 
instance by the commissioners rather than attaching special tax experts to a tribunal that would otherwise 
not have the necessary expertise. It seems that special commissioners deal in such technical matters quite 
frequently, and they could very soon gain the necessary expertise to deal with those other matters. 
<P>
Only one small matter of all those that we are considering goes through the special procedure of 
being passed back. As the Government have gone to all the effort of passing matters across to the Inland 
Revenue, it seems rather odd that that small group of appeals should go back to a social security appeal 
tribunal. I hope that the Government will be able to give a better explanation of why they are using that 
procedure. They may conclude that the amendment is correct and should be added to the Bill. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Timms:</B> I warmly welcome the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) to his speaking role in 
the Committee, and I congratulate him on the way in which he put his argument. I shall try to explain our 
thinking. 
<P>
Although responsibility for the policy and legislation on the contracting out of SERPS will remain 
with Social Security Ministers, which is quite correct, the contracting-out employment group, the unit in 
the Contributions Agency that administers contracting out, will transfer to the Inland Revenue with the 
rest of the agency. The position is rather different from that that applies in the other areas of policy that 
we have been considering. 
<P>
As a result, Inland Revenue officers will be responsible for making such decisions as whether to 
issue a contracting-our certificate or whether to manage any disputes on such decisions. The processes 
that they will follow are set out in the Social Security Act 1998 and the supporting regulations. In 
accordance with those regulations, any appeal on contracting out will be made to a DSS unified appeal 
tribunal and thereafter to the social security commissioners. Clause 16 makes the necessary amendments 
to section 170 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, to enable the policy intention to be met. 
<P>
It was always intended that contracting-out matter would fall under the new DSS decision-making 
and appeals system, and the 1998 Act reflects that. When it was decided that the contracting-out 
employments group would transfer to the Inland Revenue with the rest of the Contributions Agency, it 
was also decided that contacting-out decision making and appeal processes should remain under DSS 
legislation. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, disputes in that area are extremely rare, but they are 
usually about the amount of contracted-out pension that is due. 
<P>
The main reason for that decision is that the unified appeals tribunals are the best bodies to deal with 
such disputes, given the close relationship between them and SERPs. We left contracting out under DSS 
legislation to ensure that individual appeals were heard by appeal tribunals with expertise in such matters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We think that the proposals in the Bill are right. The fact that Revenue officials will 
make decisions does not automatically mean that tax commissioners are the more appropriate body to hear 
appeals. Neither do we want to burden tax commissioners, even the special commissioners, with appeals 
on matters in which they have no expertise and which are properly matters for the social security unified 
appeals tribunals. 
<P>
On one set of appeals, however the hon. Member for Newbury touched on this a stronger case can be 
made for reading across to the work carried out by the tax commissioners on to the certification 
arrangements that employers should follow when opting to contract out. There are parallels with appeals 
on tax approval for pension schemes, but, since contracting out was introduced in 1978, I gather that there 
has been only one appeal relating to certification arrangements because the contracting-out process is 
largely one of self-certification. Employers are clear about what conditions they need to satisfy to contract 
out and, if there are any difficulties, they can simply contact the contracted-out employment group for 
their problems to be speedily resolved. There is no reason for thinking that that will change. 
<P>
Rather than make alternative provision for such rare cases, which would be difficult, it makes sense 
for those few appeals to be heard by the same body as hears SERPS appeals. We have provided for the 
tribunal to seek the assistance of expert witnesses, such as actuaries or pensions lawyers, and appellants 
can also take expert advice and present it to the tribunal in support of their appeals. 
<P>
That is how we decided to tackle the problem. There were extensive discussions in another place. 
Liberal Democrat peers pursued the question of whether appeals should go down the tax or the social 
security route. In the debate, my nobel Friend Baroness Hollis said that if our judgment proved to be 
wrong, clause 23 provides that the appeal route can be changed by Order in Council rather than by 
primary legislation. It would therefore be possible simply to change the route, if practice showed that it 
was necessary. 
<P>
On the basis that we shall keep that appeal route properly and continuously under review, I hope that 
the hon. Member for Newbury will be content to withdraw the amendment.

deliberations. 
<P>
Not all of the work of the Contributions Agency is directly related to the collection of national 
insurance contributions. It shares responsibility for some of its work with other departments of the 
Department of Social Security, particularly with the Benefits Agency. Clause 17 deals with the award of 
national insurance contribution credits and home responsibilities protection. 
<P>
The clause simply maintains the existing administration of those two aspects of work; it has no 
implications for individuals' contributions records. Decisions on credits or on home responsibilities 
protection, whether they are taken by the Benefits Agency or by the Inland Revenue, will be made under 
the same decision-making and appeals systems provided by the Social Security Act 1998, once the latter is 
in force. That would ensure that decisions on entitlement to types of credits and home responsibilities 
protection are consistent, balanced against a minimum risk of operational disruption for our staff, for 
contributors and for benefit recipients. 
<P>
<H5>10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have a number of problems with clause 17. The issues are important and must be 
treated seriously. First, we object once again to the Government trying in the Bill to write themselves a 
blank cheque and filling in the numbers later. As we know, that has characterised several clauses. 
Subsection (1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may make arrangements with the Board for any of his functions". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is not good enough. The Government should decide what they want to do and present to 
Parliament a proper project to achieve it. We should then be able to debate its merits. We are not about to 
give the Government a two-way bet, which would be the effect of acceding to clause 17. That point of 
general principle applies elsewhere in the Bill, and I make no apology for raising it. 
<P>
The second problem is that the clause is one more example of the Revenue's creeping empire- 
building, which is running parallel with the Government's determination to make increasing inroads into 
the national insurance system and eventually to destroy it. That is undesirable, so we object to the clause 
on those grounds an objection that reflects the consistent position that we have taken throughout the Bill. 
<P>
The third problem is perhaps more pragmatic, but it is an important human issue. We should put 
ourselves in the position of those who will be affected by the provisions mainly those who earn national 
insurance credits. As you know, Mr. McWilliam, that is one aspect of the system to which Conservative 
Members are extremely attached; if you have gathered nothing else about our position during the past few 
hours, you will have taken that on board. 
<P>
One of the nice aspects of national insurance is the system of credits. For instance, a mother who 
spends her time looking after her small children can nevertheless gain some credits from the system. Such 
family responsibilities are a good case for increasing those credits, and if the Government had proposed 
that we should, of course, have supported it strongly; but they did not. On the contrary, and quite apart 
from destroying the national insurance system, the Government are not a family-friendly Government. 
Their rhetoric says that they are family friendly, but there is a complete divergence between rhetoric and 
reality. 
<P>
The Government are imposing the working families tax credit, under which anyone can get paid for 
looking after children except the children's mother; that surely is wrong. We learn from the newspapers 
that the Government are about to get rid of the married man's allowance and that they are about to tax 
child benefit. A series of regressive measures is planned on support for the family, which is regrettable. 
Nor do the Government care about national insurance credits. The Inland Revenue might take over 
consideration and determination of those matters, but the Secretary of State can arbitrarily, and at any 
time, take that decision whenever he wants to or, more likely, whenever he is told to by the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer. That is the world being created by the Bill. That change of structure, framework and 
atmosphere damages the interests of the people whom national insurance credits are designed to help. 
<P>
The Revenue understandably has a culture of maximising returns from the taxpayer. It is in the 
business of raising money and collecting it, and of not having to be sympathetic to those who want to take 
it out. Occasionally, albeit grudgingly, they pay interest because people have paid too much tax. Tax 
inspectors are rewarded by virtue of their maximising revenue to the state. It is probably inevitable that a 
tax-raising authority should develop such a culture and be run on such principles. I like to think that the 
national insurance system, which hitherto has been in the hands of the Benefits Agency and previously the 
Department of Social Security, is staffed by people who have rather a different culture one of supporting 
the human needs of those who qualify for national insurance benefits and who therefore are more inclined 
to take a helpful and positive attitude. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The remuneration of tax inspectors does not arise under clause 17, nor does 
the remuneration of members of the former Social Security Department. I am having great difficulty in 
following the hon. Gentleman's argument. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have some difficult in following yours, Mr. McWilliam. I agree that the remuneration 
of tax inspectors is entirely irrelevant to the clause, which is why I have not mentioned it. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman just did so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, Mr. McWilliam, since you must by definition be right, and I must by 
definition be wrong, the lateness of the hour must have caused me to use words without realising it. I was 
endeavouring to talk about the culture, the value system and the approach of individuals to their tasks, and 
how that approach is influenced by the values of the organisation for which they work. I hope that that is a 
fair definition of the culture of an orgnaisaiton. I know that I used the word culture; I did not talk about 
remuneration at least, not knowingly. I am sorry that such a misunderstanding should have arisen. 
<P>
It is a serious point that I put to the Committee,Mr. McWilliam, and it is highly relevant. National 
insurance credits are designed to help a vulnerable and worthy part of the population for insurance, 
mothers looking after their children at home and, as a result, not being able to work or to establish credits 
through class 1 contributions. Those very worthy members of our population will be faced with a very 
different culture when dealing with the Revenue, when the Secretary of State inevitably decides to transfer 
that responsibility for the Benefits Agency to the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
I have set out three reasons for disagreeing with the clause. They are all good reasons, and I invite 
the Government to challenge any of them. Two are on points of general principle and they apply 
throughout the Bill; one is specific to clause 17. On our present understanding, we cannot accept the 
clause as it stands.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I note with interest that the hon. Gentleman quoted the opening line of the clause. 
Phrases of that sort appear in most Bills. He does not like it, but it is a common feature of legislation. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about creeping expansion. I assure him that there is none in the Bill. The 
great majority of credits awarded by the Benefits Agency are due as a result of a benefit claim. However, 
some credits are not dependent on the making of benefit claims; for instance, national insurance credits 
are available for periods of jury service or for time spent on approved training. Those claims are dealt with 
by the Contributions Agency. Now that the agency is being transferred to the Inland Revenue, the question 
is how to handle the situation. The clause proposes how it should be done. 
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's third point, nothing in clause 17 reduces, diminishes or curtails the award 
of national insurance credits. I agree that they are an attractive feature of the system; they are not affected 
by the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have already conceded that national insurance credits are not formally affected by the 
clause. Nothing in the clause says that officials in the Revenue will administer those credits less 
sympathetically than officials of the DSS or the Benefits Agency, but I have explained the reason for my 
fear. I hope that the Minister's assurance will be taken on board by his officials and by those in charge of 
the new functions assumed by the Inland Revenue, and that they will indeed so conduct themselves in the 
exercise of that function that they give members of the Conservative party or Members of the House no 
cause to say that my fears were justified. 
<P>
I am sorry to say that the Minister was not able to satisfy me on the first two points. On that basis, it 
would be difficult for me or my hon. Friends to support the clause. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Schedule 7 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Decisions and appeals </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That his schedule be the Seventh schedule to the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Although schedule 7 is fairly lengthy, it simply makes the necessary consequential 
amendments to existing regulations relating to decision making and appeals. We had a fairly full 
discussion on appeals, in relation to clauses 11 to 15, earlier this evening. The nuts-and-bolts legislative 
re-engineering in schedule 7 is necessary because the Bill interacts with the existing responsibilities of 
two different departments. The transfer of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue and the new 
provisions for appeals in earlier clauses require changes to legislation as diverse as the Taxes 
Management Act 1970, the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the 
Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Act 1998. That is the purpose of the schedule. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As the Economic Secretary says, the schedule is long, muddled and fairly difficult to 
follow. I am worried about a number of points that require some elucidation. 
<P>
Paragraph 25(3), at the bottom of page 52, states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"but nothing in this subsection shall confer a right of appeal in relation to a prescribed, or a 
prescribed decision, or a prescribed determination embodied in or necessary to a decision." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That seems to circumscribe the right of appeal in an undesirable way. Will the Economic Secretary 
explain the exact purport and effect of that? 
<P>
I was also intrigued by paragraph 20, which inserts into the Pension Schemes Act the following: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Inland Revenue shall prepare, either annually or at such times or intervals as may be 
prescribed, a report on the standards achieved by their officers in the making of decisions against which. . 
. an appeal lies to an appeal tribunal". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
At first sight, that provisions seems acceptable what is wrong with the Inland Revenue preparing 
reports? However, the Revenue's interpretation of the provision might lead it to prepare a report that 
shows that it has always won on appeal, and that it has extracted the maximum amount of money from 
those contributing and paid the minium amount to those receiving. The conclusion it would wish to be 
drawn from such a report would be that the Revenue had done a very good job and should therefore have a 
bonus. 
<P>
That is a question of culture and of the framework of incentives and motivations affecting 
individuals in organisations. It poses a difficulty, however, as we established in our discussion of earlier 
clauses that a Revenue official could subvert an appeal by overruling the commissioners on a point of law 
or some other point. That is a serious situation, which I never dreamt would affect our legal system, but 
which will clearly affect it significantly. We do not want to push the Inland Revenue to exploit the 
excessive powers that the Government propose by providing it with an additional incentive to show that it 
has won on all counts in various appeals. Appeals should be, as far as anything can be in human affairs, 
objective and should give full weight to the case made by an individual. 
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
If the bureaucracy is somehow given an incentive to win the appeals and at the same time is given 
powers that destroy the even-handedness of the appeals system by giving more weight to the Revenue than 
to the appellant, you are constructing a system within which, with the best will in the world and with the 
most altruistic and public-spirited officials that you could wish for, you will inevitably, given human 
nature, lead people to behave in a way that none of us would want and that even the Government might 
not want to defend. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I find it flattering that the hon. Gentleman describes me as altruistic, but I am 
constructing no such system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps I may retrospectively go back over my use of the second person singular and 
replace it with the third person impersonal. I shall then be within the bounds of order, Mr. McWilliam. I 
am sorry that I have again transferred that rule. 
<P>
I am making serious points. Paragraph 24 is the most extraordinary administrative muddle, because 
it states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations may make" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
again the words "may make" 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provision requiring the Secretary of State...to refer the issue to the Inland Revenue." 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The thrust of the Bill is to take powers away from the Secretary of State and give them to the 
Revenue. Yet under this schedule further regulations may make further provisions requiring the Secretary 
of State to hand over other responsibilities. The provision is otiose, in view of the wide-ranging powers 
that the Revenue has already obtained at the Secretary of State's expense. I can only conclude that every 
possible chain has been utilised to bind the Secretary of State in future and make sure that he has no 
liberty left to stand up to whatever the Treasury decides to do in national insurance matters. 
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will at least respond to my serious concerns about the purpose of 
these reports, the extent to which they will give Revenue officials an incentive to win all the appeals at all 
costs so that they can declare a good result in their annual report and the extent to which the sentence in 
paragraph 25 to which I referred restricts the right of appeal to claimants. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall do my best to reassure the hon. Gentleman on his three points. First, paragraph 25 
simply mirrors section 12(2) of the Social Security Act 1998, with its limitations on statutory sick pay and 
statutory maternity pay appeals. As the hon. Gentleman will recall, we made provision in an earlier clause 
for appeals on matters relating to national insurance contributions, statutory sick pay and statutory 
maternity pay to be transferred, with the Contributions Agency, to the appeal provisions for Inland 
Revenue matters the tax appeal commissioners. No new restriction is created by this part of schedule 7 on 
what Parliament agreed only a few months ago. 
<P>
The report to be prepared by the Inland Revenue under paragraph 20 is on standards of decision 
making, not on the number of appeals heard. The issue is simply one of transparency of decision making. 
The provision ensures that, where the Inland Revenue is making decisions and the appeal against those 
decisions lies to the appeal tribunal constituted by the Social Security Act 1998, the Inland Revenue will 
have to prepare a report, annually or at prescribed intervals, on the standards of decision making achieved 
by its officers. Of course, that will not give the contracted-out employment group an incentive to increase 
the number of appeals so that it can earn an extra bonus. It will simply ensure that Parliament has proper 
information about the standard of decision making achieved by officials. That is a matter of transparency 
and parliamentary accountability, and I hope that it will be welcomed by the Committee. 
<P>
Thirdly, paragraph 24 introduces a provision to enable the proper interaction between decisions 
made by the Secretary of State for Social Security and decisions made by the Inland Revenue because, in 
the case of a claimant for a contributions-based social security benefit, the decision to be made by the 
Secretary of State may turn on a prior decision made by the Inland Revenue in relation to the claimant's 
contribution record. Paragraph 24 ensures that decisions are made by those who have the authority to 
make them and in the proper order, so that claimants' rights can be properly established. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for dealing with those three points. I suspect 
that what is meant by a proper balance between the Secretary of State and the board is that the Secretary 
of State shall be well and truly at the behest of the board. 
<P>
I am grateful for the hon. Lady's assurance that paragraph 25 does not go any further in limiting 
rights of appeal, but what she said was that it does not go further than the Social Security Act 1998. In 
other words, it does not go any further than another Act that the Government have already managed to 
push through with their large majority. We can only regret that, but it does not mean that we intend to 
accept the reassertion of the reduction in appellants' rights that is contained in schedule 7. 
<P>
On the issue of Inland Revenue's annual report, the Economic Secretary confirmed my worst fears, 
because she said that it would report on the standard of decision taking. What does the standard of 
decision taking mean? How can one measure the standard of decision taking in cases that go to appeal? I 
can think of only one way: to count how many appeals one wins. If one wins most or all of them, there is a 
good standard of decision taking. If one does not win any, there is a bad standard of decision taking. That 
is how it will work in practice. 
<P>
Since the Government have already given the Revenue powers in the clauses that have been agreed 
to, sadly, as a result of the Government's majority essentially to vitiate the whole appeal tribunal system, 
to predetermine the outcome of appeals in the way that it wishes and to override the commissioners, both 
on matters of law and fact, there is not much chance for an appellant. The report simply reinforces the 
incentives for the Revenue to drive things in that direction. That is regrettable, and I suspect that some 
Revenue officials have misgivings about being expected to work in that fashion. So although I am grateful 
for the hon. Lady's comments, I must say that they have confirmed my worst fears about the schedule and 
I ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 10, leave out lines 20 to 34. 
<P>
The reason for the amendment is clear. It is consistent with our position on the Bill. We are 
concerned with the integrity of the national insurance fund. Anything that appears to give the Secretary of 
State, who is an agent of the Treasury, the right to make arbitrary levies on the national insurance fund is 
to be resisted in the same way as we resisted the pernicious provisions to enable the Revenue to do 
likewise, although those have, sadly, been passed. Purported ultra vires payments have been made out of 
the national insurance fund. That serious allegation is being investigated. If the clause is passed, more 
payments will be made. 
<P>
I am extremely concerned about accountability. It will be difficult for Parliament to know whether 
the Secretary of State or the Treasury is accountable. The clause may refer to the Secretary of State, but 
elsewhere we have made it clear that he cannot do anything without the say-so of the Treasury. The clause 
is unnecessary and dangerous. I am sure the Minister will say that it is essential to the Bill and that it goes 
to the heart of the Government's project although he will not be frank enough to admit this to undermine 
the independence of the national insurance system and fund. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The position is different. The clause corrects a defect in the Pensions Schemes Act 
1993. Age-related rebates for money purchase schemes were introduced in April 1997. The then 
Government intended rightly that those should be paid from the national insurance fund. Unfortunately, 
they failed to put in place the necessary provisions to enable that to happen. Instead, the legislation 
provides that rebates should be funded from money voted by Parliament. A straightforward error was 
made in the previous Government's drafting. The clause changes the legislation so that rebates can be paid 
from the national insurance fund, which was the intention. The clause merely corrects the underlying 
problem. 
<P>
The amendment would leave the national insurance fund with a gain of o82 million and the 
Consolidated Fund with a loss of the same amount. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the 
correction is sensible, proper and above board. It genuinely corrects an error. The clause does not affect 
individuals or employers who run occupational schemes. It is a technical Government accounting matter. 
There is no loss or gain in overall public expenditure. We are correcting the pots of money. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to allegations of ultra vires payments. He may have in mind the o500 
million payment mentioned by the Chairman of the Social Security Committee on Second Reading. In 
fact, the payment is one thousandth of that sum just under o500,000. The payment is not ultra vires. It is 
entirely correct according to the legislation, but it was not taken from the right pot. We want to change the 
legislation so that it can properly be taken from the national insurance fund. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. The clause does not refer specifically to SERPS 
rebates for money-purchase schemes. The Government have reduced the level of rebates despite the 
abolition of the dividend tax credit. That is scandalous. At a time when it will be harder for such schemes 
to achieve solvency on the basis of anticipated incomes, the Government have dealt a double blow by 
reducing the age-related SERPS rebates to money-purchase schemes, to which the Minister referred. That 
is a matter on which I have already taken the Government to task. The Minister is probably reluctant to 
discuss it now he may well be too shame-faced to do so. 
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
His explanation is sufficient guarantee that the clause will be used only for the purpose that he has 
just described. That is an important assurance and I accept it in good faith. 
<P>
Amendment negatived. 
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 21 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Property, rights and liabilities </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause is the first of two concerning the transfer of property, rights and liabilities 
alongside the transfer of functions with which preceding clauses have dealt. 
<P>
It is a straightforward and necessary measure that will provide that the property, rights and liabilities 
of the Secretary of State are transferred to the Inland Revenue or the Treasury when the related functions 
are transferred. For example, if a supplier has contracted with the Department of Social Security to supply 
paper clips to a Contributions Agency office, it should supply them instead to the Inland Revenue. 
Similarly, a case made against the Department of Social Security in respect of action taken by the 
Contributions Agency about national insurance contributions through the courts will, from the date of 
transfer, be made against the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is my exact understanding of the clause. The subsequent clause is rather more 
fascinating. It deals with what happens when a contract 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May we discuss the next clause when we reach it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I wanted to save the Committee's time by making one observation that relates to two 
clauses, but if you do not wish me to do that, Mr McWilliam, I will not. 
<P>
There is the retrieving point that the reference in subsection (2) to "property, rights and liabilities" 
presumably includes the NIRS2 contract, which we shall discuss in due course. Whether the Government 
regard that as an asset or a liability is an intriguing question. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 22 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Special provision for certain contracts </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause deals with contracts and with subordinate contracts that, although they may 
be wholly related to transferred or retained functions, are made under the terms of a framework contract 
that covers both types of functions. 
<P>
Two contracts that we intend to specify by order under the clause deserve particular mention. The 
first is that signed by the previous Government for NIRS2, the new national insurance recording system, 
to which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford just referred. Hon. Members will be aware of the 
difficulties associated with the implementation of that system. Although NIRS2 provides other agencies of 
the Department of Social Security with information, it is integral to the work of the Contributions Agency. 
It is therefore appropriate to transfer the contract to the Inland Revenue with the Contributions Agency 
transfer. 
<P>
The second contract is that made with the Newcastle Estates Partnership for the redevelopment of 
the Longbenton estate in Newcastle, where many Contributions Agency staff are based. Although other 
DSS agencies occupy parts of the Longbenton estate, the Contributions Agency an establishment with 
which you are doubtless familiar, Mr. Mcwilliam is the principal occupier and has managed the contract 
on behalf of the other agencies. Therefore, that contact will also transfer to the Inland Revenue. In 
keeping with good contract management, the Contributions Agency is discussing the implications of the 
transfer with its suppliers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My only concern relates to mixed contracts. Although the Minister's explanation did not 
make it entirely clear, the clause deals with mixed contracts involving the provision of goods or services to 
the part of the Contributions Agency that will be transferred to the Inland Revenue, and to the part of the 
bureaucracy that will remain nominally, at least under the control of the Secretary of State. 
<P>
Let us suppose that there is a paper-clips contract to use the Minister's own example for the 
Contributions Agency and the Benefits Agency. Under the clause, the contract will have to be split. How 
will that be done? In what position will private sector commercial partners of the DSS and its agencies 
find themselves should they want to litigate or deal with a contractual problem? Where there is a failure of 
contract by the Government in this case, the Benefits Agency as a branch of the Inland Revenue private 
sector business must know who their partners are, so that they can pursue the relevant organisation. 
<P>
Will the Minister explain how the clause will effect the provision of goods and services? Will 
commercial partners know which agencies they will be dealing with, and which organisations will be 
liable for the Government's obligations under any commercial contract that the clause will cover? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The default arrangement under subsection (3) is that the DSS will retain the contract. It 
will ensure that the Contributions Agency can continue to receive goods and services under the contract as 
part of the Inland Revenue, but the contract will remain with the DSS. 
<P>
However, there are cases such as the two to which I referred where the contract is of such importance 
to contributions work that it would be appropriate for the Inland Revenue to take over management of it. 
Subsections (4) and (5) allow for such cases, and an order would be made specifying which contracts 
would be treated in that exceptional fashion. In the absence of such an order, the contract would remain 
with the DSS in respect of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 23 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to transfer functions by Order in Council </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It might be helpful if I explain that the purpose of the clause is to allow further transfer 
of functions between the Secretary of State and the Inland Revenue through an Order in Council. An 
Order in Council is the normal process for transferring functions between Departments under the 
Ministers of the Crown Act 1975. However, for the purposes of that Act, the Inland Revenue is not a 
ministerial Department, which is why we need the Bill to transfer the functions from the Contributions 
Agency to the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, it has not been easy to be certain which of the many 
complex functions exercised by the Contributions Agency or other parts of the Department of Social 
Security should be transferred to the Inland Revenue. We believe that the new boundaries are right, but we 
want to ensure that, in the light of experience, we can come back and adjust the boundaries by Order in 
Council rather than by fresh primary legislation. The proposed procedure was approved after due 
consideration in another place. 
<P>
Anticipating the concerns of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I stress that the transfer 
of functions under the clause is symmetrical: the clause would permit transfers from the Inland Revenue to 
the Secretary of State, as well as from the Secretary of State to the Inland Revenue. It does not, however, 
provide a general power to transfer functions between the Inland Revenue and the Secretary of State. The 
ability to transfer functions by Order in Council is restricted to the functions specified in subsection (2).

<P>

<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I am intrigued by what the Economic Secretary has just said. Subsection (2) seems to 
provide for a huge transfer of functions by Order in Council. There are important exemptions, as she said, 
but the subsection will cover large areas. She said that we would be reassured by the idea that the transfer 
would be symmetrical in other words, that it could go in either direction. The only way in which I find 
that reassuring is that it would enable the Government to repeal all but the entirety of the Act simply by an 
Order in Council. 
<P>
If in due course, as I hope, the Government come to repent of their decision-making skills in this 
matter, they could reverse a huge amount of what the Committee is spending its time on transferring from 
the Secretary of State to the Inland Revenue. As I have always believed in the redemption of political sin 
even in this Government's capacity to repent of their errors I welcome the fact that they might be able to 
reverse their decision so swiftly, although if one builds into a Bill the ability to repeal it by Order in 
Council, one is perhaps indicating that one is not certain about its merits in the first place. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, may I indicate my 
intentions? At or about 11 o'clock, I intend to suspend the Committee for about 20 minutes to give the 
catering staff some certainty as to when hon. Members will wish to have a cup of coffee or whatever they 
wish. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, who makes a 
telling point. 
<P>
I give credit to the Economic Secretary for her lucid exposition of the purpose of the clause. Only 
two words in that exposition were wrong: they were "come back". She said that the Government wanted 
the ability to come back. One thing that the clause does not reflect is any intention that the Government 
could do so. They are trying to avoid the necessity to come back to Parliament if they get it wrong, and 
admit that they want to do something else. They want, therefore, to reinsure themselves in advance 
against the mistakes that they presumably think that they will make. 
<P>
Therefore, the clause does not provide for the Government to come back on some of the issues; we 
would welcome it if it did. The clause enables the Government to go away, not come back and do what the 
hell they want. That is not acceptable. Once again, I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to vote against the 
clause standing part of the Bill.

Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 24 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision for Northern Ireland </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Northern Ireland has its own social security system and its own national insurance fund, 
as I discovered when I spent some time last year working with the Secretary of State. 
<P>
It has always been the policy to maintain parity between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. 
National insurance contributions in Northern Ireland are administered by the contributions unit of the 
Northern Ireland Social Security Agency, which is part of the Northern Ireland Department of Health and 
Social Services the DHSS, an abbreviation that many of us will recall from some years ago. As on the 
mainland, the bulk of national insurance contributions are collected by the Inland Revenue alongside 
PAYE. Much of the remaining work is carried out on behalf of the contributions unit by the Contributions 
Agency in Longbenton. 
<P>
It would make little sense to leave Northern Ireland out of the new arrangements in the Bill, so the 
intention is straightforward: to transfer operational responsibility for national insurance contributions in 
Norther Ireland to the Inland Revenue, in parallel with the transfer of the Contributions Agency, and to 
transfer policy responsibility for national insurance contributions throughout the United Kingdom to the 
Treasury and the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
The Bill was initially drafted with the aim in mind that the Northern Ireland Assembly would have 
assumed its full powers by now. It was drafted to allow the policy transfer later than the operational 
transfer. The position is now somewhat simpler. The Assembly has not yet assumed its full powers, 
despite the enormous efforts that are being made, so on Second Reading last week, my right hon. Friend 
the Secretary of State for Social Security announced that we propose a single operational and policy 
transfer on 1 April. 
<P>
With the clause, we can achieve a direct transfer from the Northern Ireland Department, which holds 
the function, to the Inland Revenue or the Treasury, as appropriate. That would be done by Order in 
Council on 10 March, the last Privy Council meeting this financial year. That is one reason why we seek 
early Royal Assent once the Bill has been scrutinised in the other place. The result will be a clean, 
simultaneous shift of national insurance contribution operational and policy functions across the United 
Kingdom on 1 April. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> If, on their establishment, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland 
Executive wished to revisit this issue, would they have the power to do so? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, they would not.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I thought that I saw the Minister rising, Mr. McWilliam. He moved slightly upwards. I 
therefore intended to allow him to speak, as I normally do. However, if he does not wish to make any 
comment on the clause, I should be grateful if I could catch your eye. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Twitches are unfortunate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> For the assistance of the Committee, I shall be happy to make some remarks about the 
clause, which is concerned with delegated legislation under the Bill. It provides that parliamentary control 
of statutory instruments made under the Bill should be by way of the negative resolution procedure. 
<P>
I remind members of the Committee of the advice of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and 
Deregulation, which, in its first report of this session House of Lords paper 7 of 9 December 1998 
expressed itself content with the requirement for the negative rather than the affirmative resolution 
procedure for statutory instruments. It stated in paragraph 7: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is nothing in the Bill which it is necessary to draw to the attention of the House." 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not wish to take issue with their Lordships; it is too late to make any more enemies. 
<P>
To me it is a matter, first, of the importance of the subject and, secondly, of the Government's 
perceived intentions as to whether Parliament should grant them the right to make regulations under the 
negative as opposed to the affirmative resolution procedure. Given the importance of the issue, which I 
have dwelt on at sufficient length during the day, and given the Government's clear intentions and the 
disturbing impression that, in spite of all that has already been done to bind the Secretary of State and put 
him under the Treasury's control, they need further powers to make Orders in Council, further transfers 
and so on, it would be wrong to give them a further blank cheque at this stage in the Bill. We should deny 
them that power and should reject the clause.

<H4><center>Clause 26 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Savings, transitional provisions, consequential amendments, repeals and revocations </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause introduces three technical schedules, schedules 8 to 10, which cover savings 
and transitional provisions, further consequential amendments and repeals and revocations. I should be 
happy to provide clarification on any of those schedules. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry that you, Mr. McWilliam, say we have had a large number of votes during 
the day. We have indeed; but I am extremely sorry that Opposition Members have lost the votes. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My only complaint was that my vote was not being recorded. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall not embarrass you, Mr. McWilliam, by asking you to tell the Committee on 
which side you would have cast your vote. However, I have no doubt that any objective observer listening 
to our proceedings the putative visitor from Mars would have concluded that the argument has been won 
by Opposition Members in a number of areas, not least savings. 
<P>
When I first saw the schedule about savings, I thought that it was splendid and that we would hear 
about all the savings of public money that the Government would make. We discovered this morning that, 
far from it, there will be a considerable net loss of public funds. All this nonsense about administrative 
savings is just that complete nonsense. However, were we successfully to oppose the clause and the 
schedules, which are technical in nature, a Bill that runs largely against our better judgment would simply 
have been further confused and rendered inoperable. I therefore see no point in opposing the clause or the 
schedules.

<P>
Government amendment No. 7. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We come now to an important matter. The knowledge that things are going badly wrong 
in the national insurance records computer is a reality that has rightly overshadowed our debates on 
Second Reading and now in Committee. At a time when things are wrong with what is an absolutely 
essential aspect of the Contributions Agency's operations, it is extraordinary that the Government choose 
to transfer the work of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue. 
<P>
Many analogies have been drawn with the private sector during our proceedings, and not only by 
Opposition Members as everyone will acknowledge. If you wanted to get rid of a subsidiary in the private 
sector, you would clean it up first. Some one could not be expected to take it on if the accounts were 
wrong or there were undisclosed liabilities. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Two "yous" almost constitute a flock! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> One could not possibly sell an operation in the private sector without first cleaning it up. 
One certainly could not conceive of getting anyone to take it on unless the potential acquirer clearly knew 
what he was taking on, what the liabilities of the operation were, whether its accounts were in order and 
unless he had fair title to the assets. 
<P>
The NIRS2 computer has failed to operate. The Government have given us assurances, but they do 
not seem to have realised that there is a problem. It has been laid at the door of the previous Conservative 
Government, a matter that I shall come to in a moment. This Government have had responsibility for the 
computer since 1 May 1997, but did not realise for about 15 months thereafter that there was something 
wrong with the contract. 
<P>
When the Government did realise last summer that something was wrong, presumably they assessed 
the position. However, it must have been an in adequate and perfunctory and less than competent, 
exercise, because it led the Secretary of State to write in a serious letter to all right hon. and hon. Members 
that the problems would be susceptible to a solution in two weeks. That was a gross misunderstanding and 
underestimate of the problem. 
<P>
We have now received assurances from the Government that everything will be all right by 1 April. 
If so, I hope that they will accept our reasonable amendment. It would enable them to meet their target 
and transfer the work of the contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue with everything in order by the 
deadline of 1 April. If the Government cannot get matters in order, it would be a salutary discipline for 
them to focus on the need to sort out the problems before they make the transfer. 
<P>
This is another instance of parliamentary accountability being taken unduly lightly by the 
Government, no doubt under the pressure of their confidence and ability to manage the media on the one 
hand and, given their enormous majority, their ability to steamroller anything through the House on the 
other. But the Government are getting into a bad habit of mind, a comment that describes so many of their 
initiatives and so much of the Bill. I am sceptical about whether the problem will be resolved definitively 
by 1 April. If that is achieved, however, let the Government have the courage of their convictions and 
accept our amendment without further ado. If they use their parliamentary majority to steamroller the Bill 
through and reject our amendment, a big accountability problem will arise. Whom shall we call to account 
for the problem after 1 April? The immediate answer would be the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the 
Paymaster General. However, if we were to write to or to ask questions in Treasury questions or in 
Committees such as this of either of those Ministers of the Crown we would be told: "The matter relates to 
events that took place before1 April. That is when the problem arose. Nothing has gone wrong while I 
have been in charge since 1 April, so the hon. Gentleman will have to raise the matter with my right hon. 
Friend." If I were to do so in a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam, I know exactly what 
would happen. You would immediately say that I have been in the House long enough to know that I 
should not ask questions relating to Treasury responsibilities of a social security Minister, or the other way 
round. Once again, I would be told to sit down and behave better. No doubt that would amuse everyone, 
but we know where it will lead. The essential function of parliamentary accountability will be thereby 
frustrated, which is not satisfactory. 
<P>
Subsections (a) and (b) would present no danger to the Government's achieving their proposed 
timetable for the transfer of the Contributions Agency revenue, an objective that we do not share but 
oppose. Accepting the amendment will not present an obstacle to their achieving that, as long as they can 
achieve their own declared deadline of cleaning up the problem by 1 April. 
<P>
Secondly, if the Government cannot achieve that, it is quite unreasonable to take a job that is half or, 
for all I know, a quarter, or 80 per cent. completed, which is still a mess, and transfer it to another agency 
of Government. That is a job ill done, and it is not an acceptable procedure. 
<P>
Thirdly, if the problem continues past 1 April, it will be an extremely useful discipline, as I hope 
Ministers will acknowledge, for officials to be under some pressure to perform. The transfer of the 
Contributions Agency, to which I am sure officials in the Inland Revenue are looking forward as much as 
the Treasury, will have to be delayed until the problem can be sorted out. 
<P>
I now come to an absolutely crucial part of the amendment the issue of compensation. We have 
listened with considerable disquiet to what the Government have said on the subject. What they have done 
is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and could have been done only by a Government who are becoming 
extremely arrogant, out of touch and neglectful of their fundamental responsibilities as a Government. 
They have high-handedly said that everyone who has been disadvantaged can have an ex gratia payment 
of o10. If you and I do mean you,Mr. McWilliam were to lose hundreds of thousands of pounds because of 
the bad, perhaps dishonest or negligent, behaviour of, for example, a bank or a second-hand car dealer, 
you would be rather insulted if someone said, "Here's 10 quid; go and play in another street." It does not 
even begin to address the issue. 
<P>
It is an extraordinary state of affairs, that reflects the complete failure of the new Labour 
Government to consider the legitimate interests of the poorer citizen. For most of this century, the Labour 
party has projected itself to the public as the defender of the interests of the poor guy, the small guy 
against capitalism, big business and the over-privileged in our society a very seductive, entirely 
respectable and, in many ways, morally attractive stance. Now, at the end of the century, New Labour 
comes to power and simply rides roughshod over the interests of small people. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinarily, the new Labour Government have ensured that small savers, whose savings income 
is below the tax threshold, will pay tax. That is disgraceful. In the same spirit, we are now told that those 
who have lost more than o100 because of the failure of the national insurance records system computer 
will be compensated, but those who have lost less than o100 will be given no compensation. They will be 
paid the money that is due to them, but they will receive no compensation. That is extraordinary. 
<P>
Again, the small guy, or small woman who deals only in small sums and, therefore, whose losses are 
proportionately small will lose out altogether. That is extremely unfair and unreasonable. I should not 
want to be associated with a Government who had that extremely unpleasant order of priorities. It is not at 
all good enough, and the Government should do better. If they want to do so, they now have a wonderful 
opportunity: they can accept the amendment. 
<P>
The second paragraph of amendment No. 5 proposed subsection (2B) deals with the definition of 
compensation. All we are asking for is that the common principles of fairness should be applied. The 
Government should observe the commonsensical and natural justice idea that what is sauce for the goose 
is sauce for the gander. They should apply to themselves the standards that apply to citizens and other 
groups in society. They should follow what is regarded as being acceptable or non-acceptable conduct. Just 
because the Government are so powerful as they now are they should apply those standards to themselves. 
<P>
The Government have made much of the pensions mis- selling scandal. I shall say no more about 
that, because, Mr. McWilliam, you would rule me out of order. However, much could be said on that 
subject much more than is usually said by representatives of the new Labour Government. 
<P>
As with the previous Conservative Administration and as with all the regulators the Personal 
Investment Authority and the Financial Services Authority, which the new Labour Government have set 
up it is absolutely clear that pensioners who have been mis- sold pensions and have lost money as a result 
should be compensated. They should be compensated if they have lost out because of the negligence, not 
necessarily the criminal dishonesty, of others. In other words, they should be put back into the position 
that they would have been in if they had not been mis-sold that pension. That is the definition of 
compensation. 
<P>
There should be no suggestion that people will be given o10 or o50, or paid interest only, so that they 
go away. That is not satisfactory. It is only fair to compensate people genuinely. The word "compensate" 
means to make good the losses that people have incurred. We are asking for nothing less but nothing more 
than the Government should apply to themselves the principles that they rightly have insisted that the 
private sector should apply to itself. Compensation should mean just that, not some nominal, symbolic 
payment in lieu of compensation-there is great deal of difference between the two.

<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Did the original contract negotiated by the previous Conservative Government, or the 
revised contract that they negotiated in 1997, contain provisions for compensation should the contract 
fail? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Government have refused to tell us about those provisions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Just a second, I shall deal with the point. Of course, I should be happy to give way to 
him again if he is unsatisfied with my response and wishes to intervene. 
<P>
We have made several attempts to discover what provisions there are for the sub-contractor 
Andersen Consulting to pay compensation for computer mismanagement or breakdown and for 
determining responsibility and therefore liability for compensation. At each attempt, we have been told 
that it is a matter of commercial secrecy. I therefore cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's questions: I was 
not a member of the previous Administration and I am not privy to the secrets of the present 
Administration. He must ask his hon. Friend the Minister. 
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle </B>(Liverpool, Garston): Will the hon. Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In a minute. 
<P>
Having asked the question, the hon. Gentleman obviously did not listen to my answer or perhaps he 
was trying to distract me with a red herring. If so, it will not work. I will give him the detailed answer and 
will then revert to talking about the amendment. 
<P>
The issue of Andersen Consulting compensating the Government for failing to fulfil its contractual 
obligations is important, but is separate from that of the Government's liability for the computer errors and 
for their failure to pay sums due to citizens under the national insurance system. The Government have 
made it clear that they have something close to contempt for the national insurance system and for 
people's reasonable expectations of receiving benefits under that system. However, for the clarity of our 
debate it is important to keep those two issues separate. 
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to know the provisions on compensation, he could read 
the repeated reports of the National Audit Office on the issue and some of the Public Accounts Committee 
reports, where they are set out in full. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but I am not sure whether the contract provisions are set 
out in those reports. If they are, I shall look at them with interest. 
<P>
Whenever the issue is addressed, the Government and Labour Back Benchers are immediately 
anxious to go back to the wonderful old argument that it is all the other guy's fault: the Tory 
Administration signed the contract. I have never pretended that everything the previous Administration 
did was perfect if it had been, presumably we would still be in office. There is no secret about that and 
there is never any embarrassment in recognising the truth. However, blaming the previous Government is 
not good enough, on two grounds. First, the Government's attempt to deflect any questioning about the 
performance of the national insurance records computer is counter-productive; it is an own goal. As I have 
said, the Government did not realise that there was a problem until about 15 months after they came to 
power that was not very clever, was it? They then drastically underestimated the position last autumn. 
<P>
The second reason why the Government's position will not wash, but will boomerang back on them 
and hit them where it hurts they had better be careful is that Labour did not win the election by going to 
the country and saying, "Vote for us; we won't do any better than the Tories, of course and we might even 
do worse, but if that happens, we'll just say that the Tories didn't do too well either." If they had said that, 
they would not have won the election. They went to the country and said, "Vote for us and our wonderful 
new deal; things will be spectacularly better than they have been". Yet on this matter, as on so many 
others, the Government have monumentally failed to deliver. 
<P>
The Government must grow up and realise that they will be judged against their own promises at the 
election and against the expectations that they constantly and deliberate raise. The Opposition are 
determined to discharge our responsibility of not being distracted into abstract historical arguments and of 
constantly reminding the Government of their obligations and promises so that they can perform a little 
better. We have witnessed the growing gap between those promises and the dismal reality. We have talked 
about that in many contexts and it often applies to this matter. 
<P>
Compensation must be genuine. The obligation to compensate cannot be discharged by symbolic 
payments. That is insulting and it will not make people go away. Compensation must be fair, especially 
for the poorest and less well-off people. Their losses may be small in absolute terms and by the standards 
of new Labour politicians, but they are significant to them. We cannot have a dual morality in which the 
rich and prosperous and those on modest incomes or above get fully compensated, while those whose 
losses are less absolute terms are neglected. 
<P>
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Interest must be paid at the rate that it would be 
paid by the citizen if he was in default in his obligations to pay the state, in particular the Inland Revenue. 
There is as much negligence and responsibility in the Government not meeting their deadlines for making 
payments as there is in the citizen who is late in paying his tax bill or his contributions to the national 
insurance system. Wemust have equivalence, straightforwardness and evenhandedness. The Opposition 
will continue to insist on those qualities, whatever the Government's majority. 
<P>
Let no one say that people should be compensated for the interest that they might have received from 
the bank or building society if they had had the cash in hand earlier. Some people might have run up 
debts. The cost to them of being paid late by the national insurance system is an interest charge; it is not 
the loss of a deposit rate of interest, Most important, if the state is late in paying the citizen, it must pay 
compensation at the rate that the citizen has to pay when he is late in paying the state. 
<P>
The other essential point that must be established if there is to be any justice in dealing with this 
lamentable state of affairs is that compensation genuinely puts people back in the position that they would 
have been in had the state not defaulted on its obligations. We insist on that. Once again, what is sauce for 
the goose is sauce for the gander. The Government must apply to themselves the principle that they apply 
to others. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has used the argument that what is sauce for the goose is sauce 
for the gander three times. If anyone else tries to make that argument, I shall rule them out of order on the 
basis of tedious repetition. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> This is the first chance that I have had to say anything of length since you have been in 
the Chair, Mr. McWilliam, and I welcome you to it. 
<P>
I do not agree with the amendment, but I should like to comment on aspects of new subsections (2A) 
and (2B). The fault with the NIRS2 computer lies with the Conservatives. The contract, which they set up 
incorrectly, forms the basis of the problem, which was extended by their poor renegotiation of the 
contract. A large share of the blame must lie with them. The Labour party's failure to realise how bad the 
problems were and its unusually optimistic estimate of how quickly the problems would be resolved did 
not help matters but that is not the basis of the problem. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> May I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the issue of compensation is irrelevant to the 
question of which Administration is responsible for the mess? We are discussing the liability of the state. 
The Labour Government have taken over the state as a result of their electoral victory. Just as the new 
Labour Government cannot default on a gilt issue for which the Conservative Administration were 
responsible, they cannot default on the matter that we are considering. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that 
the state is liable, he must acknowledge that obligations should be met, irrespective of the colour of the 
political Administration in power. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I regret having given way to the hon. Gentleman because he intervened before I tackled 
compensation, which is covered in proposed new subsections 2A, 2B, and 2C. I agree with part of the hon. 
Gentleman's argument. Therefore, it might have been preferable if he had waited before intervening. 
<P>
Subsection 2A(a) would ensure that the Bill was not implemented before the NIRS2 computer system 
had been introduced. However, the Bill's operation is not affected by whether that system is in place. 
Although I accept that the NIRS2 system is not fully operational, that is not a reason for delaying the 
Bill's implementation. 
<P>
Subsection 2A(b) would prevent the Bill from operating. Firms always send in their national 
insurance contributions some time after they have been made. At the beginning of every financial year, 
there is a period during which people who retired at the end of the previous financial year will be owed 
retirement benefits, which depend on the amount that they paid in the previous year. That will not be 
noted on NIRS2 for some time, even when the new system is up and running. If the system did not operate 
until, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"payments reliant on national insurance contributions have been outstanding for a period of more 
than thirty days" 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
it would never operate. That is not a sensible provision. 
<P>
In view of subsection 2A(c), it is not clear whether the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has 
caught up with the Government's latest pronouncements on compensation. He suggested that the poorest 
people those who were owed less than o100 would not receive compensation. The Government have 
changed that system, and decided to introduce at least o10 compensation for everyone. If anything, that 
will overcompensate the poorest people. I am not against that it is good that the poorest should be 
overcompensated but that wrecks the hon. Gentleman's argument. 
<P>
I have sympathy for subsection 2B. The hon. Gentleman is right that the state should ensure, 
whenever possible, that citizens are restored to the position that they would have occupied had the 
Government's programme not failed so badly. He is right to say that the identity of the Administration 
who were at fault for the programme's failure does not matter. It is the state's fault, and the state should 
compensate people. Therefore, I have some sympathy with the philosophy behind subsection 2B. However, 
I am not sure that an amendment to the Bill is the best way in which to insist on that compensation. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will take note of the spirit of subsection 2B and that the Minister will be 
prepared to take it into account that compensation is due, and that the Government will be willing to pay 
it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford acknowledges that the 
contract for the system was signed under the previous Administration. He has not always been aware of 
that. However he acknowledged it, albeit somewhat grudgingly, earlier this evening. 
<P>
I shall reiterate the current state of play on NIRS2. A stabilisation and recovery plan, which is 
managed by senior DSS personnel, has been developed. Before Christmas, NIRS2 was able to establish 
entitlement to short-term benefits incapacity benefit and jobseekers allowance for claims throughout the 
country. Since6 January, the system has been processing claims for long-term contributory benefits 
widow's benefit and retirement benefit. So NIRS2 is now processing claims for all the contributory 
benefits for which it is supposed to be used. 
<P>
However, since the beginning of January there has been a new problem. Because of the delays of last 
year not all the 1997-98 contribution records have been posted to the system. Those records were needed 
for the first time to establish benefit entitlement from the beginning of January this calendar year. About 
two thirds of them were in place by the end of last year but the rest were not. I receive daily reports on the 
number of contributions records posted and am keeping an extremely close eye on how the number is 
increasing. 
<P>
The system is up and running but it is not fully operational. The priority is to roll out the remaining 
parts of the system, to process the remaining end-of-year returns and make the remaining payments of 
age-related rebates. It is expected that the Benefits Agency will take six months to clear all the backlogs 
once the contributions records have been posted and it is possible to move on to reviewing the interim 
award that has been made. Backlogs in the Contributions Agency will not be cleared for 18, or possibly, 
24 months after that. They certainly will not all be cleared up by 1 April, as the hon. Gentleman 
suggested. 
<P>
Where benefit payments are delayed as a result of NIRS2 problems, payment of compensation will be 
automatically considered under the existing departmental rule. I am grateful to the hon. Member for 
Newbury for reminding the Committee that the Secretary of State announced on 1 February that those 
who do not qualify for compensation under the existing rules and who have experienced unreasonable 
delays will receive a flat-rate payment of o10. Anyone entitled to more than o10 under the normal 
compensation rules will receive the due amount. 
<P>
It might help the Committee if I go into a little more detail about how those compensation payments 
will be made. I need to do so under three headings. The first is those who made retirement pension and 
widow's benefits claims with the date of entitlement falling before6 January 1999 before NIRS2 was able 
properly to process those claims. A computer scan will be run to determine cases where either an initial 
award or an emergency payment was made between 19 June 1998 and 5 January 1999. The o10 
compensation payment will be awarded automatically to all those cases. That could include cases where 
the delay was for a reason other than problems with NIRS2 functionality. But to identify whether the delay 
related to NIRS2 would be complex and disproportionately costly, so we are not going to attempt to make 
that distinction. The payment will be made in either case. 
<P>
The second group is for retirement pension and widow's benefit claims with date of entitlement 
after6 January 1999. Cases that receive either an initial award or an emergency payment will, when they 
are finalised, receive a o10 compensation payment if they fall outside consideration of a compensation 
payment under the Department's normal rules. That is a generous approach and is certainly, as the hon. 
Member for Newbury said, more generous than appears to be envisaged in the amendment before us. 
<P>
The third group is those who claimed incapacity benefit. The position here is rather less 
straightforward because one either is or is not entitled to benefit. The concept of initial award and 
emergency payments is not appropriate in this instance. Cases will be identified on review. Claims made 
between 19 November 1998 and the end of 1998 are not affected as NIRS2 functionality to support 
processing of new claims to incapacity benefit was available during that period. Some of the claims since 
4 January are affected because of the unposted contribution records of 1997-98. That problem was not a 
factor between 19 November 1998 and the end of the year, because only the previous year's contributions 
records were needed in that period. 
<P>
Officials are considering three options for determining whether delay has been unreasonable, and 
there is therefore entitlement to a o10 payment on incapacity benefit cases. The first option is to pay o10 
compensation on all claims made between 19 June 1998 and 18 November 1998 and since 4 January 
1999, in cases in which claimants have suffered any delay however short as a result of lack of NIRS2 
functionality. 
<P>
The second option is to pay a o10 compensation on an all claims made between 19 June 1998 and 18 
November 1998 and since 4 January 1999, when delay due to lack of NIRS2 functionality exceeds the 
primary clearance target of 10 days that the Benefits Agency operates in cases of incapacity benefit. 
<P>
The third option is to pay o10 compensation on all claims made between 19 June 1998 and 18 
November 1998 and since 4 January 1999, when delay due to lack of NIRS2 functionality exceeds the 
secondary clearance target of 30 days for incapacity benefit. Ministers will receive a submission tomorrow 
outlining those options in more detail and recommending a preferred one. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford suggested that the o10 compensation payment will 
not be made to those losing less than o100. That point was picked up by the hon. Member for Newbury, 
who said, correctly, that the o10 payment will be made to all those who have suffered loss as a result of 
the difficulties with NIRS2, on the bases that I have just set out. Those who, under the normal rules, 
would be awarded higher amounts of compensation, will get that higher amount, too. 
<P>
I turn to compensation made for delays in the payment of age-related rebates. Compensation is being 
paid at 0.5 per cent. of each payment for each month of delay. The first payments were made on 1 
November. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made a case for calculating individuals' actual losses. 
That is not practical. The level of compensation was discussed and agreed with the Government Actuary, 
who agreed that 0.5 per cent per month was a reasonable level of compensation, given the prevailing 
market conditions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the Government Actuary acts in good faith 
in such matters. 
<P>
The rebate is calculated on the basis that is paid in the October following the end of the tax year in 
which it is due. That means that, at present, some people gain if their rebate is paid before October. So the 
rebate has always incorporated a swings-and-roundabouts element. The logic of amendment No. 6 is that, 
in future, we should pay reduced rebates to people paid before October or try to recover their gains. That is 
an impractical way of dealing with these matters. 
<P>
It is most important to make the payments quickly and in a way that is cost effective for the 
contributions agency, pension providers and scheme administrators. That points to straightforward 
compensation arrangements, not to another task for NIRS2. It would take a long time to sort out the 
calculations envisaged in the amendment. 
<P>
The difficulties with NIRS2 do not mean, as the hon. Member for Newbury suggested, that we 
should delay the transfer process. The transfer does not impose any significant additional burden on the 
system. The necessary changes are important but minor in scope, so as to ensure that computer-generated 
forms are correctly labelled and written. 
<P>
Those responsible for managing the system and negotiations with Andersen Consulting will transfer 
to the Inland Revenue. The same people will do the same work to get the system fully functional, and 
there will be no loss of experience or knowledge. Recovery plans will continue across the Benefits Agency 
and the Contributions Agency. They will be overseen by senior officials of the department of Social 
Security and the Inland Revenue, as happens now. 
<P>
It is not true that the problems with NIRS2 have been identified only at this late stage. Our plans for 
the stabilisation and recovery arrangements for NIRS2 have been able to proceed alongside the transfer 
plans. They are well established, and we have been able to plan around any issue arising from the transfer. 
I am confident that the NIRS2 recovery programme has taken full account of the impact of the transfer. 
<P>
<H5>12 midnight </H5>
</P>
<P>
Plans for the March changes to the system are well in hand. They involve changes other than those 
relating to the transfer, but which need to be made at the same time. An attempt at this stage to unwind 
matters, and proceed with some changes in March, but not those relating to the transfer, could give rise to 
additional risk and cost. The difficulties with NIRS2 are not sufficient to justify a deferral. Added 
uncertainty and unplanned delay could distract managers and staff from the task of recovery as the current 
plans do not. The amendment would thus risk significantly worsening matters. 
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept that the Government are working to put right the difficulties 
with NIRS2 but that, in any case, there is no reason to defer the transfer of the Contributions Agency 
functions until after the problems are resolved. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is an important matter. It is right that both Labour and Opposition Members have 
not been influenced by the lateness of the hour to contain unreasonably the breadth of discussion. I am 
grateful to the Minister for one thing at least: he has put on the record a more detailed account of the 
predicament of the different categories of national insurance beneficiaries who have been affected by the 
computer shambles. I expect his remarks to be read with interest by all those concerned and their advisers. 
<P>
One of the Opposition's complaints is that the Government have not made a statement in the House 
about the problem. We have now come as close as we shall, I expect, to such a statement, and that is 
something to be thankful for. As a result, no doubt, of the lack of a statement in the House, I had missed 
the excellent news that the Government are now to provide the o10 compensation to everyone, in addition 
to what will be due individually. We shall examine the small print, but that, too, sounds like good news. 
The Government resisted any such action as late as last month and therefore I and others have been 
confused about it. It is good to know where we now stand. 
<P>
I was less than satisfied by the Minister's remarks about other aspects of compensation. It was not 
clear to me although we must, again, examine the small print in this respect that it has been established 
beyond doubt that no one will be under-compensated by the o10. I am thinking particularly of people in 
the widow's benefit or incapacity benefit categories. That alone would lead me to press the amendment. 
<P>
Much more serious and disappointing is the response that I received about two central aspects of the 
matter. In answer to the question that the Minister put to me rhetorically, I can tell him that 6 per cent. 
per annum, or 0.5 per cent. a month which might amount to slightly more, if calculated monthly is quite 
inadequate. The only fair way to decide the interest rate at which to remunerate people for late payment is 
to adopt the principle that I set out previously, which the Minister ignored. He clearly thought that there 
was natural justice in my proposal; perhaps he was embarrassed to mention it. I am now more convinced 
than ever that it is the only fair basis for solving the problem. When the state is late in its payments to the 
citizen, it should pay interest at the same rate as the citizen must when he or she is late in his or her 
payments to the state. It is as simple as that and it is wholly unsatisfactory that the Government are 
seeking to depart from that clear principle. 
<P>
We are also dissatisfied that the Government have failed to impose on themselves the same standards 
that they expect of others. That is the very definition of hypocrisy. If I were to apply that term to any 
individual, you would rightly rule me out of order, Mr. McWilliam. I do not do so: I have no animus 
against any individual member of the Committee, least of all the Ministers who are doing an honest job 
this evening in trying to set out the Government's brief bad case though it is. 
<P>
It nevertheless remains institutionalised hypocrisy by the state. One standard is being applied to the 
citizen in respect of compensation; another standard will be applied to pension providers and others from 
pharmaceutical companies to car manufacturers against whom a citizen may have claims; and another 
principle altogether will be applied to the state. What is the difference? It is that the state is currently in 
the hands of the new Labour Government with a vast majority who can write their own rules and produce 
blank cheques for themselves as they please. That is a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of affairs. 
<P>
I do not want Labour members to think that there is the slightest weakening of opposition on this 
matter. We believe profoundly that two clear principles should be applied to compensation. The 
Government are not applying them, which is a shameful dereliction of duty. We will certainly press the 
amendment to the Vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, inpage 17, leave out lines 4 to 7. 
<P>
We move on to the sole Government amendment. I should like to crave your indulgence, Mr. 
McWilliam, and bring the whole Committee together now that it has passed midnight by wishing many 
happy returns to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle). [Interruption.] I am 
heartened by the warmth with which the Committee has joined me in conveying those good wishes. 
<P>
The amendment introduces a standard procedure for Bills that start in another place. It removes the 
privilege amendment in subsection (8) the means by which another place formally negatives the Bill's 
provisions when they involve a charge on public funds. The privilege amendment avoids the formal 
infringement of our privileges in relation to supply. Given that the proprieties have been observed, the 
provision can now be dispensed with. The supply motions were agreed on Second Reading last week. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is the usual clause that wraps up a Bill by dealing with its short title, 
commencement and extent. Subsection (2) brings a number of provisions into force immediately on Royal 
Assent. They are concerned principally with powers to make regulations so that those, for example, 
providing for the new appeals arrangements can be in place in time for the transfer of functions. 
<P>
The clause allows for separate commencement dates for most of the provisions by which functions 
are to be transferred. That was done so as not to prejudge the views of Parliamentary by including a 
specific date. However, as my right hon Friend the Secretary of State announced on Second Reading, we 
intend to make a commencement order under the clause for simultaneous transfer of the operational 
functions of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue and of national insurance contributions 
policy functions to the Treasury or, where appropriate, the Revenue, on 1 April. 
<P>
Northern Ireland, as has been said, has its own social security legislation. We intend simultaneously 
to transfer the corresponding functions in Northern Ireland to the Inland Revenue by an Order in Council 
under clause 24. Accordingly, the majority of the Bill is limited in its territorial extent to Great Britain. 
However, existing tax legislation covers the United Kingdom, so clause 28(5) provides for the Bill to 
extend to Northern Ireland in so far as it supplements or amends existing tax law. 
<P>
This is the final technical clause in a largely technical Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I rise at this stage of our proceedings merely to compliment Ministers on what is, even 
in the context of this Bill, quite extraordinary cheek. I refer to the end of subsection (8) which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds". 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
You will know, Mr. McWilliam, having studied the Government's explanatory notes on the financial 
effects of the Bill 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have dealt with that in Government amendment No. 7. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> On a totally different matter, may I point out that clause 28 has one significant difficulty 
concerning the geographical distinction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland? We had a long 
discussion about that earlier, but I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why, although there 
have been references to the Northern Ireland Assembly, there is no reference to the Northern Ireland 
Executive. Is there a technical reason for that, given that we anticipate that a Northern Ireland Executive 
will be established shortly? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> May I make a couple of points on the clause? We have heard this evening about the 
NIRS2 computer system and the problems with it. It is incumbent on all of us to realise the knock-on 
effects of that. The Minister spent some time going through the details of what needs to be done to rectify 
the position and we are grateful to him for doing so. However, it is important to recognise that the transfer 
of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue is likely to add a huge bureaucratic burden to the 
Revenue. The Minister has demonstrated that the bureaucratic overload in the system, added to the 
breakdown of the national insurance computer system, threatens the Government's claim that the transfer 
will lead to significant improvements in customer service. I question the cost-effectiveness of that transfer 
and I ask the Minister to respond to that in the context of clause 28. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the Minister will not respond because the matter was raised before 
the hon. Gentleman was in the Committee. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall take your advice, Mr. McWilliam, and confine myself to the comments that the 
hon. Gentleman made about Northern Ireland. The issue that he raises would more properly have been 
raised under clause 24. The Northern Ireland Executive will not be a player a transfer will be made, as I 
explained when we discussed clause 24, from the Northern Ireland DHSS to the Inland Revenue. The 
Order in Council under clause 24 will transfer those functions the Northern Ireland Executive will not 
figure in that process. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>New Clause 1 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Protection of employment rights </center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an employee of a government department or 
public body who is transferred to another such department or public body in accordance with this Act 
shall be entitled to the same terms of employment as those to which he was entitled before transfer, and 
shall suffer no reduction in remuneration, pension entitlement, retirement age or any other employment 
right or benefit as a result of transfer.'. [Mr. Davies.] 
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will tell me that my new clause is not necessary, and that the protections that 
it seeks are enshrined in other legislation or in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 
Regulations 1981. If that can be clarified, the new clause will have been worthwhile. If not, the new clause 
is badly needed. 
<P>
I hope that new Labour, which seems to have forgotten its responsibilities to those whom it used to 
claim to represent, will not object to our insisting that individuals who have served the state well in the 
Contributions Agency or Inland Revenue or, putatively, in other agencies, as the Bill gives the 
Government powers to do more or less what they want with any part of the bureaucracy do not suffer as a 
result of the changes. Different agencies have different retirement rules, for example, which must be 
causing anxiety among staff facing a transfer. 
<P>
I hope that I do not have to dwell on this matter at great length it will not be necessary if the 
Government provides the assurance that I seek. If this question has been dealt with, the Government 
should make an explicit assurance on the record. If not, we may have to return to the point and press the 
new clause to a vote. 
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I hope that, for the final time this evening, I can provide the hon. Gentleman with the 
assurance that he seeks. I welcome his concern for the employment rights of civil servants whose jobs will 
be transferred to the Inland Revenue from 1 April. I wish that the previous Government had shared his 
concern. 
<P>
If the new clause were accepted, however, it would not override any other provision in the Bill. 
Nothing in the Bill changes the terms and conditions of staff who transfer to the Inland Revenue because 
the Bill does nothing to override employment law, which is expressed as the hon. Gentleman anticipated 
in a variety of other statutes. That law rightly restricts unilateral changes to terms and conditions of 
employment. 
<P>
If the transfer of staff were to proceed without discussion of the changes to terms and conditions of 
employment, however, the Inland Revenue would have a number of different groups of staff with different 
terms and conditions of employment. That would be a messy and unsatisfactory outcome, but it flows from 
the previous Administration's delegation of responsibility for fixing terms and conditions to departments 
and agencies under the next steps programme. That is why such a variety of terms and conditions exist in 
different departments and agencies. 
<P>
The Inland Revenue has carried out extensive negotiations with unions that represent staff at the 
Contributions Agency and contributions unit, with the aim of securing agreement on bringing their terms 
and conditions broadly into line with those of the people with whom, from 1 April, they will work at the 
Inland Revenue. That process of negotiation involves a complex series of changes, which are less 
significant for staff at the contributions unit than for those at the Contributions Agency, because their 
existing terms and conditions are already very similar to those of Inland Revenue staff. 
<P>
The negotiated package has now been announced, and was circulated at the end of the last week in, 
among other things, the briefing document. "Talkback", to all the staff involved. The unions have now 
embarked on a process of further consultation with members. 
<P>
I very much hope that the staff who are to be transferred to the Inland Revenue will agree to the 
revised terms and conditions negotiated by their unions and offered to them. However, if they reject them, 
they will retain their existing terms and conditions of employment because the Inland Revenue has no 
power under employment law and rightly so to force them to change. In other words, the alteration in 
terms and conditions is voluntary. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will accept my assurance that new clause 1 
would not add to the employment rights of the staff who are to be transferred to the Inland Revenue. I also 
hope that he will accept my assurance that, as good employers, we and the Inland Revenue are treating the 
staff affected fairly, and with full consultation. In the light of those assurances, I hope that he will 
withdraw the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for those remarks. I am extremely glad that I raised the matter, because it 
is clear that had I not done so, we should not have received that very clear assurance. Indeed, we would 
not even have discussed an issue that it would have been wrong for Parliament to neglect in considering 
the changes. The Minister has made it very clear that no one will have a gun held to his or her head. Staff 
will remain entitled to their current employment terms, unless they voluntarily, and individually the 
changes will not be imposed as a result of a collective solution negotiated with the unions agree to 
exchange their present terms and conditions for the new ones being offered. The Minister indicates with a 
nod of her head that I have properly understood her. In that case, I am delighted to find that the purpose 
of tabling the new clause has been achieved, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion. 
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have had a very interesting day in Committee, ably led by you, Mr. McWilliam, and 
by your colleague, Mr. Malins. You kept the majority of the Committee in good order throughout the day, 
for which we are grateful. 
<P>
I want to thank my hon. Friends for their work and contributions. The thought might have crossed 
their minds during the day that they could have been involved in more stimulating activities, but I am 
grateful to them for their steadfast support. I particularly want to thank my hon. Friend the Economic 
Secretary to the Treasury for her role in Committee. At one point, the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford seemed to be under the impression that we were both Social Security Ministers. That is a tribute 
to the joined-up characteristics of the Government and the way in which Ministers from the Department 
of Social Security, the Treasury and other Departments work together seamlessly. 
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Newbury for his thoughtful contributions to the discussion, and for the 
shrewdness and wisdom with which he casts his vote throughout the day. [Interruption.] I also thank the 
hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford for his vigorous and energetic contributions, which are always 
enjoyable although my confidence on that point was, at times, put under strain today. I pay tribute to him 
for his efforts, and to all Opposition Committee members. 
<P>
I should put on record our thanks for the tremendous work done by the officials, Clerks, Attendants 
and the staff of Hansard. In particular, I thank officials from my Department and the Inland Revenue, who 
have worked hard today and, indeed, in the lengthy period leading up to today. The work has been done in 
a helpful way and with great good humour. Finally, I express again my gratitude to you, Mr. McWilliam. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am delighted to be able to agree with the Government at this late stage in our 
proceedings. I am sure that I have made my share of errors and slips of the tongue I may even have 
displayed ignorance, on occasion. However, I have never believed the Economic Secretary to be a Social 
Security Minister, and I do not know how that impression was given. That confusion is perhaps 
reminiscent of the slight disagreement that I had with you, Mr. McWilliam, on whether I had referred to 
the remuneration of Inland Revenue officials. The record of our deliberations in Hansard will doubtless be 
the final arbiter on who got what right. I shall probably be proved wrong, although I do not believe at this 
stage that I should be. 
<P>
I thank my hon. Friends for their support. When one is in a minority in the House, a certain amount 
of patience and determination is required, although I trust that we shall not be a minority for too long. In 
Standing Committees, Opposition Back Benchers need to demonstrate rather more in the way of effort and 
dedication than members of a large Government majority. I am particularly grateful to my Whip, who has 
stood by me throughout our proceedings. 
<P>
I am also grateful to the two Ministers from different Departments. As was noted, the good humour 
of our debates was perhaps slightly under threat for just a moment before lunch. Of course, I do not 
believe that that was in any way my fault. Regardless of who was at fault, good humour was rapidly 
restored and we had a constructive debate during the afternoon and evening. The Bill is important, and I 
hope that each of us feels that it has been thoroughly explored from our differing perspectives. 
<P>
I thank the staff of Hansard, and officials, who prepared an admirable briefing for Ministers. 
Throughout the day, I have been enviously looking at Ministers' wonderfully neat files. Clearly, such work 
has contributed greatly to the concrete nature of our business and our ability to give a full account of our 
deliberations to the public. 
<P>
Finally, I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston. It is just conceivable 
that she has thought of better ways in which to celebrate her birthday than discussing this important Bill. I 
hope that the remainder of her birthday will compensate for her efforts in the course of the past 12 hours 
or so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Like the Minister and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I thank you, Mr. 
McWilliam, and your co-Chairman in particular, for your efforts. I am probably one of the few Committee 
members who has not met the lash of your tongue today, and I shall quickly sit down before I do. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Members for East Ham (Mr. Timms), for Grantham and Stamford 
and for Newbury for their kind words about my colleague and me. I thank all Committee members for, by 
and large, staying in order, and for coming to order eventually when called to do so. I wish the hon. 
Member for Liverpool, Garston a happy birthday. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, I 
can think of lots of better ways in which to spend one's birthday than this. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
I thank the Clerks, who have done superb job in keeping my colleague and me up to scratch with the 
substance of a highly technical Bill, and the Committee Sub- Editors who have looked after us so well. My 
thanks, too, to those people whom one never sees and who get little thanks the transcribers, who 
transcribe our proceedings prior to editing. I also thank the police, the Doorkeepers and everyone who has 
helped to make this Committee a pleasant and interesting experience. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
