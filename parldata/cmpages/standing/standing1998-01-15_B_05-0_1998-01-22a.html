<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman A. Godman </B>(Greenock and Inverclyde): On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. I do not want to delay the Committee's proceedings, but wondered if you knew how long we shall sit today. I am perfectly relaxed about returning to Scotland tomorrow, but it would help me to organise my diary if I knew whether we are to sit late this evening and into the small hours tomorrow.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can understand a longing to be in Scotland. I have been given no notice of how long we shall sit, and would suggest that the hon. Gentleman speaks to some of his hon. Friends, who may be able to enlighten him.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Advance notice of public processions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): I beg to move amendment No. 227, in page 3, line 12, after "leaving", insert "or posting".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 37, in page 3, line 13, after "with", insert "or for".
<P>
No. 38, in page 3, line 13, leave out "nearest to" and insert
"whose area of responsibility covers".<P>

<P>
No. 228, in page 3, line 13, leave out "starting place" and insert "place of commencement".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I fully understand the desire of the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) to return to Scotland. Some of us would like to get back to Northern Ireland this weekend, given the worrying circumstances that currently exist in the Province. The matter of our return to our constituencies this weekend lies in the hands of the Government. The Committee can sit on Tuesday and Thursday of next week, if necessary; there is no need to sit all night, but if the Government decide to do so, that is what we shall do. The hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde should speak to his hon. Friends on that matter.
<P>
During recent weeks we have seen on the streets of Belfast the consequences of policies going wrong. Ulster Unionist Members are worried that the Bill will get it wrong again; that is why we have tabled reasonable amendments, such as those that we are discussing this morning.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 refers to the advance notification of public processions and proposes to insert after "leaving" the words "or posting". I should like to explain the reasoning behind the amendment. An individual is supposed to leave the notice with the sergeant at the police station nearest to the proposed starting place of the procession. Occasionally, the organisers of processions have some difficulty in completing the notice on time; they rush to the nearest police station only to find that it has limited opening times and is closed. Even if the station is open, there is no guarantee that a sergeant is present; he could be ill, or on leave and not available for some time.
<P>
When the police receive notice of a parade it is passed up the line. I do not, therefore, see any need for it to be left with a sergeant; it should be sufficient to leave it with any police constable. A constable is nearly always on duty at the desk in a police station; the sergeant has better things to do.
<P>
I do not see why notice must be physically left at the police station. It could be posted. If someone knows that the police station is closed at the time that he is in town, he could post the notice knowing that it will be delivered the following day. It is perfectly easy to bung a stamp on it and post it to the police if necessary with a certificate of posting. Such a provision would not worry me. An attempt should be made to get notice to the police on time, and it should be possible to accept it if it is posted or if it is left with the police constable on duty at the time.
<P>
I have a measure of concern about the final words in clause 6(1) which refer to
"the police station nearest to the proposed starting place of that procession."<P>

<P>
I am not sure what that means. In parts of Northern Ireland, the police station nearest to the starting point of a procession may not necessarily be responsible for it. Police stations, especially those in rural areas, operate within given boundaries, and many processions take place in rural areas. Rather than leaving notice at the nearest police station, it would be much wiser to accept the words in amendment No. 38 and leave it at the police station
"whose area of responsibility covers"<P>

<P>
the starting place. Notice should be left with the police officers who have to police the area in question.
<P>
I have described the reasons behind the amendments. I hope that the Minister will accept that they are valid and will accept them. More than anything else, the amendments would tidy up the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): Like the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross), I was surprised by the appearance of amendment No. 227 on the selection list. It did not feature on the out-of-date list of amendments that I was working on. However, I wish to speak more to amendments Nos. 37 and 38 than to amendment No. 227.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that amendment No. 37 would widen a parade organiser's permitted scope of action when he gives advance notice. Clause 6(1), as it stands, is unreasonable. Although I have no personal experience of organising a parade, it is no doubt a laborious task with a host of details to attend to. I am sure that it is a time-consuming occupation, but the Bill will add to the demands on those organising legitimate processions.
[Mr. Andrew Hunter]
<P>
According to the Bill, the organiser will have to take the time and the trouble to go to the
"police station nearest to the proposed starting point of that procession."<P>

<P>
The starting point may be some distance from where the organiser lives, and, as the hon. Member for East Londonderry pointed out, there is no reason to assume that the nearest police station will have an operational role in the policing activities that may follow.
<P>
The Bill demands that the procession organiser delivers the notice in person to a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary of the rank of sergeant or above. I agree with the hon. Member for East Londonderry that the demand is unreasonably restrictive. In normal circumstances, a police officer of the required rank will be in the police station, but sometimes a sergeant or more senior officer will not be at hand. He may be involved in other duties, especially if the station is a charging station, where the presence of an officer of that rank is required at key stages in the charging process. In a substation of a larger division, especially in a rural area or small town, an officer of the required rank may not be available. In those circumstances, the organiser of the parade should be permitted to leave the notice at the station for the required ranking officer, rather than have to hand it to the officer personally.
<P>
There is another dimension to the argument. The organiser will go to the police station to leave the notice, in accordance with the requirements of clause 6, which makes considerable demands on him. He has to go to the police station not less than 28 days before the intended date of the procession, or as soon as is reasonably practicable. The written notice must be in the prescribed form and include the date, time and route of the intended procession, the likely number of participants, and the name and address of the person who is in charge of controlling the procession. The organiser also has to provide any other details that the Secretary of State requires.
<P>
In contrast to the demands imposed on the organiser, none of those details are, according to the Bill, of the slightest immediate concern to the officer who takes possession of the notice. He is not required to go through the details, or to check that the notice is in the form prescribed by regulation, or to verify the notice.
<P>
The only requirement of the RUC under the Bill is that
"The Chief Constable shall ensure that a copy of a notice ... is immediately sent to the Commission."
<P>
I presume that the Chief Constable will establish procedures for the notice to be sent to his headquarters for onward transmission, or to go directly from the police station to the commission. If no action is required of the police officer of the rank of sergeant or above, or of any other officer at the station, other than to forward the notice to the commission, there is no reason why the notice has to be received personally by a particular officer. It would be petty and silly not to allow the parade organiser to leave the notice at the police station, if needs be, eventually to be taken up by an officer of the rank of sergeant or above for onward transmission. However, the Bill does not require the organiser of a parade personally to meet any particular police officer at the station.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone) I support the amendments dealing with the handing in of notice. As good Unionists, we want as much parity as possible with the rest of the United Kingdom. In England and Wales the Public Order Act 1986 applies. It states:
"If delivered not less than 6 clear days before the date when the procession is intended to be held, the notice may be delivered by post by the recorded delivery service".<P>

<P>
In other words, in this part of the Kingdom, people intending to hold a parade are able to send notice by recorded delivery.
<P>
In Scotland, the legislation stipulates that notice has to be given to a regional or inland council. It states that it can be given by being posted to the main office of the regional or mainland council so that in the normal course of post it might be expected to arrive not later than seven days before the date on which the procession is to be held.
<P>
Thus in Scotland and the rest of the British mainland it is clear that postage and recorded delivery are appropriate for giving notice. There is no sustainable reason why it cannot be delivered in the same way in Northern Ireland an equally integral part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
Returning to the case of Scotland, notice has to be given to the appropriate council "in whose area" the procession is to be held; and in England and Wales:
"Notice must be delivered to a police station ... in the police area in which it is proposed the procession will start".<P>

<P>
If a procession in Scotland crosses into England, it has to be delivered to
"the first police area in England"<P>

<P>
on the proposed route. That seems much more sensible than delivering it to the nearest police station because few people will be able to judge what is the nearest police station.
<P>
Some Northern Ireland police stations have restricted opening times from 9 am to 5 pm and the chances of finding the sergeants there can be remote. They have often been on night duty so they are not there. People may be asked to make an appointment for another day when the sergeant will be there. At the moment, the police insist that notice is given to the main station. If there is a parade where I live, my village has a police station, but there is no guarantee that a sergeant will be there. The general rule is to go to the main police station in Omagh rather than to the nearest station in Beragh.
<P>
The amendments are reasonable and sensible. What will happen if someone goes to the station at 5 minutes to 12 on the eighth, 22nd or the 29th day and no sergeant is present? Will the person be breaking the law because of the unavailability of a police sergeant? As I said, the amendments are sensible and I fully support them.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Hon. Members have questioned the validity of new arrangements for dealing with applications for and notices of parades, but the clause replicates the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 in providing for notices to be handed to police officers. It is a straightforward translation from existing legislation.
<P>
The arguments were based upon supposed situations but not one example was given of actual difficulties. The hon. Member for East Londonderry did not say that complications or problems had arisen when he or someone else tried to organise a parade.
<P>
The hon. Members for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) and for East Londonderry said that problems could arise because RUC stations are not open all the time or because a sergeant may not always be present. In such cases, the organiser would be required to return when the station was open or when the sergeant was present. That would mean that the organiser had a valid reason for not meeting the 28-day requirement. Clause 6(2)(b) provides that if it is not reasonably practicable to meet the 28-day requirement, notice should be given as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter. Allowance is made in the Bill to deal with difficulties such as stations not being open or the sergeant not being there.
<P>
There are other reasons why the RUC prefer the notice to be handed to a reasonably senior officer. Although there is no requirement to check through the document, the sergeant usually goes through it to ensure that it is properly filled in and that there is no technical reason to refuse the request to hold the parade hon. Gentlemen have more experience of such matters than I have.
<P>
The proposal is designed to assist parade organisers. A reasonably senior officer is responsible for receiving the document, going through it with the organiser and giving advice if there are any technical problems. The officer will see that it is filled in properly so that there will not be any dispute about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Minister said that the clause merely translates the 1987 order to the Bill. But that is not a sustainable argument for refusing to amend the Bill to make it more amenable to those who organise parades. To argue that a measure cannot be changed merely because it is a carry-over from an order is ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not argue on the grounds of a catalogue of difficulties that have existed since the 1987 order came into being. He did not say that the measure was completely impractical or that it had caused a breakdown in communication between the RUC and parade organisers. He has not said that documents are not submitted in time or that they contain errors that need constant to-ing and fro-ing between the RUC and the parade organisers. If the hon. Gentleman had cited a range of such shortcomings resulting from the 1987 order there would be some merit in his argument, but neither he or his hon. Friend advanced their case on that basis. They simply said, "Now we have an opportunity to change the legislation, let us change it," but they have no good grounds for doing so. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I cannot accept what the Minister said. He said that we did not give examples. Time and again I went to my local station in Dungiven to see the sergeant not necessarily on this issue because there could be any one of a hundred reasons for a person having to attend a police station only to be told that the sergeant was not there; that he was out at an accident, or on different duties, or whatever. The person might then be asked to return the next day, or asked whether the sergeant could call on him. That might happen to me perhaps because I am a Member of Parliament and live only a mile away but the same facility would not necessarily be offered to everyone. My hon. Friend suggested, and the Minister did not deny, that in Great Britain there is a far easier procedure.
<center><b>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair]</b></center>
<P>We are told that a person crossing the border from Scotland to England has only to give notice. The Labour party is adept at organising all sorts of marches throughout the country, and good luck to it. All that it has to do is to give notice to the first police area into which a march will move. That does not arise in Northern Ireland. There is only one police force and long may that remain. I know instances of a procession beginning in one substation area or divisional area and ended in another, and returning. We say that the fact that something is written in earlier legislation does not mean that it is on tablets of stone forever.</center></H4>
<P>
My amendment proposes the use of the term "place of commencement" instead of "starting place". The former term was used in earlier legislation but I suspect that in law they mean the same. If the draftsman saw fit to change the legislation previously, and the Government accepted that 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recall the Minister saying that it would be reasonable to expect an officer to read through the notice with the organiser to ensure that it was correct? I, too, feel that that would be a reasonable expectation. Also, will the hon. Gentleman consider that clause 6 places only one requirement on the police? It states:
"The Chief Constable shall ensure that a copy of a notice given under this section is immediately sent to the Commission."<P>

<P>
Would not it be wiser to amend the Bill to eliminate the anomaly that the officer would go through the notice and the statutory requirement that the notice be sent immediately to the commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Another point arises here. The Government propose that the period beforehand be extended. The Minister has said that if the organiser went to the police station and the sergeant was not there, he could return the next day; the sergeant's absence would be a reasonable excuse. However, the organiser could go back to the station the following lunch-time and be told that there had been a car accident down the road and the sergeant was attending to that. He could be on any of a hundred necessary duties. The organiser could return the third, fourth and fifth day because the sergeant was not there. That would be nonsense. All we ask is that he be permitted to go to the police station and leave the document there. If there is anything wrong with it the sergeant could telephone to say, "You should do so-and-so" or "Something is wildly wrong with the[Mr. Ross]
document." The amendments seek first, that the document be given to the sergeant as soon as humanly possible in the circumstances, and secondly, that it be given to the sergeant whose substation covers the area in which the procession begins. He would then see that the procession would begin in his substation area but continue to the next one up the road, and decide that he must inform his senior officers. This is not to make things more difficult for the organisers or the police, but to streamline the procedure as much as possible. If the Minister thinks about this seriously he will realise that our amendments are helpful.
<P>
As I said earlier and as the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) also pointed out, an organiser may live some distance away. Bands can come from quite a distance. They may have to put in a notice and as I understand it, they have to give notice to their station when they are leaving because they may be processing to a bus from the hall. A whole series of actions have to be taken. The organisers of processions and those taking part should be allowed to post the notice, especially when they have a whole month in which to do so. We shall come to that issue later. There is no good reason why some if not all of these amendments should not be accepted. I urge the Minister to reconsider his earlier comments.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I do not know how long you will be in it but you have an exciting day ahead of you.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen's points would be valid if they could give examples of where these supposed events have led to a breakdown between the parade organisers and the RUC. There has been 11 years' experience of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, and hon. Members have not given any examples relating to that but have only concocted suppositions based on it. That is where the weight of the argument would lie.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that the 1987 order used the phrase "place of commencement". That has been changed in the Bill to starting place. I am told that it is because the draftsman of the Bill is a fully paid up member of the Plain English Society. The intention here is to get clear wording. The main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument concerns the procedures which relate to it. The procedures have not been shown to be flawed.
<P>
There is a fundamental difference between Northern Ireland and Scotland, England and Wales. In Northern Ireland parades can be contentious. There can be major points of conflict associated with them. That is not the general experience in the rest of the United Kingdom: there may be some difficulties with some demonstrations but it is not the norm. They do not result in large numbers of police officers on the street nor in the throwing of petrol bombs and hundreds of army personnel being deployed to maintain public order. There is a different environment in Northern Ireland, hence the need for the Bill and the 1987 order. No cogent arguments have been advanced and I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The Minister is being completely unreasonable. To make an argument here one apparently needs to come along with chapter and verse and all sorts of examples. We are telling him that there have been examples. I told him that I have often been to the police station when the sergeant was not there and that I had to return. That may not have been with one of these documents, but there could be any one of a hundred reasons why someone has to go to his local police station. I have to go back or ask the sergeant to call on me, which he does occasionally when it is necessary. It is sheer common sense and the Minister abandons common sense when he says that we are being unreasonable. I am not minded to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 3, line 16, leave out "28" and insert "7".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 85, in page 3, line 16, leave out "28" and insert "21".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> It is nice to see you in the Chair, Mr. Maxton. We seem to be operating under a variety of Chairmen; in fact, it is something of a rainbow coalition.
<P>
I see that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) has also tabled an amendment on the same subject as mine. In the previous debate the Minister told the Committee that a 28-day notice period was not such a serious matter, because it would be possible, on failing to speak to the sergeant, to come back every day for a week. If the sergeant were ill or otherwise not available that would be a reasonable excuse. If the 28-day period is therefore not set in stone in that context, I argue that it cannot be set in stone in the present context. A seven-day notice period already exists elsewhere, I do not see any reason for that to be changed. We were told with respect to the previous amendment that we should realise that Northern Ireland was different. It is not that different. In most instances it is made different only because of the terrorist war, and the past few days have provided ample evidence of that.
<P>
A serious issue that has arisen previously in the Committee arises again on this amendment. It concerns the fact that most of the processions are annual or bi-annual events. The police and organisers know when the relevant dates are approaching. The dispositions must be made well in advance, so that if a large number of men are needed they will be available although often not many are needed. If the police are doing their job they know what is coming and I feel sure that the RUC is doing its job.
<P>
The people who are intent on opposing a procession and maximising trouble are not dead sure about its timing. They do not have records concerning all processions. They need hard and fast knowledge of the time. They need time to organise. They cannot just whistle up people in five minutes, or even two or three days. Here we are, going as far out of our way as possible to give the IRA a full month's notice of when a procession will go down a given road.
<P>
In the past, the IRA has attacked processions. On a Twelfth parade in the early 1970s, it placed a bomb in a building in Belfast, but thank God the police found it. I have already mentioned the time it tried to ambush and kill members of children's organisations at a memorial service on Remembrance Sunday on the same day as Enniskillen, which will be recalled with equal horror.
<P>
The Bill will offer those people a whole month to prepare. Is it sensible to provide for that period of formal notice? Loyalist institutions will be prepared to co-operate with the police if they want firm notice a considerable time ahead and if difficulties with the parade arise. However, a provision for 28 days is wrong. It will provide the maximum opportunity for the violent to cause mayhem and murder and gather their forces to create opposition.
<P>
The Minister knows as well as I do that if loyalist institutions are convinced that an effort is being made to deal with terrorists and the opposition on the street and to ensure that normal freedoms apply, the police will receive full co-operation. The Government have an opportunity to go some way towards that by ensuring that the informal arrangements, which have always existed between the RUC and parading organisations, can continue. Those arrangements should not be formalised in 28-day notice, which will create immense danger to all concerned. Once 28-day notice is given, a parade is frozen for a particular time and day. However, it is possible to introduce a degree of flexibility. A shorter period of notice would make life difficult for the ungodly.
<P>
I appreciate that hon. Members on the Government Benches have never organised a procession, but I have. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone has been involved, but I suspect that he has. I have helped to organise large processions for the loyalist organisations and I know the amount of work that goes into them. I also know what can and cannot be done. I am aware of the informal arrangements that were always made with the police to ensure that the day ran smoothly. As I have a clear background knowledge of the issue, I am entitled to say what I am saying.
<P>
Notice of 28 days is inherently wrong. Minimum notice should be seven days, but that would be on the clear understanding that it would be possible to give informal notice and detailed information to the police on the time, date and place of a parade. In such cases, seven-day notice would be more than sufficient for the police to complete their arrangements and to make life difficult for those of evil intent and easier for everyone else. That is the principle behind the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire tabled an amendment for notice to be given 21 days before a parade. That is the existing position, but, for the reasons that I have given, I believe that that is too long. If we want to resolve the issue, let us tilt the balance and make it possible to be flexible. It is also possible to make life difficult for the wicked and easier for the law-abiding. That might help to avoid some of the horrors that we have seen in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I do not say this with any spirit of nastiness or pettiness, but we in the Ulster Unionist party have been making a case for 30 years. At the end of next month I will have been a Member of this place for 24 years. In that time, I have seen many major initiatives taken to deal with Northern Ireland. I have to tell the Committee that when we have opposed them, our stance has been proven by the consequences of bad legislation.
<P>
The Bill before us is bad legislation; and what has happened this week is partly the consequence of earlier foolish Government initiatives. I make no apology for saying it: it is true. The 28 days' notice provision is particularly bad and foolish, which is why I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I do not share the Minister's earlier view that we are in for an exciting time: I can think of more suitable ways of prolonging my time [Interruption.]
<H4><center>[Mr. Andrew Welsh in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Hello and goodbye, Mr. Maxton! I welcome you back, Mr. Welsh.
<P>
I wish to speak to probing amendment No. 85. I have carefully considered the Government's proposals and studied the North report and its arguments, particularly with reference to the giving of advance notice. It is difficult to find much logic in the Government's proposals.
<P>
Under current legislation, article 3 of the 1987 order requires organisers of processions to give seven days' notice to the police. The Minister spoke about how that works presently. Another view is that seven days is insufficient in areas where parades are particularly disputatious. It is argued that that period will not allow enough time to arrange local accommodation where there is considerable opposition to parades.
<P>
It has also been argued that where parades are disputatious, the giving of adequate notice beyond seven days will help the police to deploy their forces, consider rostering and ensure that sufficient resources are on hand. That can save money, as the Minister, who now has responsibility for the RUC, knows. Responding over short time scales can give the police quite a headache. They have to provide the personnel and make overtime payments, which are necessary for short-term redeployments. So there is merit in considering a longer period than seven days. It can also be helpful logistically to other public service which may need to be on hand when severe disruption is expected.
[Mr. Malcolm Moss]
<P>
I return to the North survey, which provided some interesting statistics. For example, 85 per cent. of all respondents supported the giving of three months' notice. Out in the public domain, then, is an acknowledgement of the problems associated with parades and the difficulties that those who wish to make a valid protest experience in entering into discussions with parade organisers.
<P>
The survey also emphasised the need for the Bill to provide for a formal period in which a protest could be conveyed. People should have two weeks in which to prepare their arguments and at least meet the commission or the parade organisers. In the survey, 82 per cent. of respondents believed that a provision in the Bill for a two-week period of notice was necessary and would be helpful.
<P>
The North report concluded in chapter 12:
"we recommend that the period for the submission to the police of notice of a parade should be extended from not less than 7 days to not less than 21 days."<P>

<P>
The reasoning was that it would take a week for the notice to go through the police station to the commission, and for the commission to take a view and contact local groups that might wish to protest. That would leave a clear two weeks for discussions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to extend his argument? One point in the proposal for 28 days is hard to understand. As the hon. Member for East Londonderry reminded us, the overwhelming majority of marches take place on the same route. Only the day and time are unknown factors. Therefore, the work of the commission and the RUC on previous marches along the route could be pulled off the shelf. The proposal for 28 days does not make sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall shortly develop that argument. In the light of the North suggestions and my hon. Friend's comments, I do not see the logic of the proposal.
<P>
The North report recommends the extension of the period from seven days to 21 days. However, paragraph 1.3 of the introduction to the procedural rules emphasises my hon. Friend's point. It states:
"In most areas a pattern has emerged of parades held on a regular cycle. Where these are contentious, a corresponding pattern of protest activity has developed. The Parades Commission will therefore examine the situation in those areas in which experience of previous years suggests that disputes are most likely and decide which parades will be considered. By taking into account the factors in the Guidelines, the Commission will aim to express an early informal view on a pattern of parades for the year ahead."<P>

<P>
The procedural rules go on to describe the way in which the commissioners would achieve that. The document states that early and constructive debate on parades will, hopefully, defuse tensions. That is consistent with the North report.
<P>
Chapter 12, paragraph 64 of the North report details the power of the commission to invite interested parties for discussions long before a parade takes place, and long before the submission of the 11/1 form. There is no proposal to change that form; the one that is used currently for seven days' notice will be used for the 28 days' notice required in the Bill.
<P>
The North report states that early discussions between the interested parties
"may well prove to be the most likely way by which the Parades Commission considers parade disputes. The Parades Commission might choose to initiate consideration of a parade, or parades, for example, in the autumn following a `marching season', or in the winter and early spring preceding the next. There would be no need for the Parades Commission to wait for the submission of 11/1 forms in cases in which it has a particular interest. This would seem to us" <P>

<P>
this is the most important line in the paragraph 
"to avoid any necessity for a radically lengthened period of notice to the police."<P>

<P>
North concludes that that is the future role of the Parades Commission. The commission knows which parades will take place and when, and, as there are few new parades, it knows their historic pattern. It knows which parades have been disputatious in the past and can bring the interested parties together long before any notice of seven, 21, or 28 days is required.
<P>
The North report recommended 21 days' notice of a parade. Will the Minister tell the Committee why the Government want to extend that notice to 28 days? Why not 30 days, or 60 days? What is the logic behind their decision, given that North also states, in powerful language, that the commission should anticipate problems and talk to people well in advance? That would ensure that all the issues are fully discussed in order to defuse the tensions that have occurred in the past.
<P>
The Minister might reply that, as the Bill will introduce the opportunity for people to register protests when they did not do so before, we are now legitimising protest movements, which would ensure that every parade, or most parades, would be disputed in ways that were not foreseen by the North report, or by the previous Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Clause 6(2)(a), as it stands, is dangerous. I note the extent to which it departs from the North report. Several times during our sittings the Government have justified the inclusion in the Bill of some matter disputed by Opposition Members by saying, "It is in the report." That is inconsistent in this case, as something that is in the report has been deliberately altered, or excluded from the Bill. Amendments Nos. 39 and 85 address that issue. They differ in degree, although not in kind. They both contain the proposition that the Government are mistaken to demand a period of not less than 28 days unless reasonably practicable.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I rather regret that I did not table an amendment because I would have gone for 14 days in the hope of persuading my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for East Londonderry to find common ground.
<P>
The experience of the 1987 order is that in certain circumstances seven days has been demonstrably insufficient. It is important that the Government demonstrate first, why they are so sure that 28 is the right figure and, secondly, that they have not fixed it arbitrarily. We should accept it unless they can do that, and convince us of their reasonableness.
<P>
I doubt whether the Government can argue that the police require 28 days to prepare whatever is necessary to maintain public order during a procession, or a few hours after it. Nor can they plead lack of experience because 3,000 parades take place each year, many along well-established routes. The number of parades has increased in recent years; nevertheless, the RUC has a wealth of collective experience, so that argument does not hold water. The Government can scarcely plead lack of familiarity with routes and in any case, 28 days would not be required to rectify that. It cannot be claimed either that preparations cannot begin until the commission has reported. That is not so: contingency planning is the very essence of policing and the police have done it hundreds of times.
<P>
Another argument for 28 days might be that the commission would need an appreciate amount of time. I do not accept that. Twenty-eight days would encourage the wheels of bureaucracy to turn too slowly. I appreciate that the commission will receive perhaps 3,000 notices of processions each year but the vast majority are uncontentious, and there is much repetition. Although circumstances of processions will vary, there may occasionally be unique factors for the commission to consider. The overwhelming majority of applications will offer a broad outline of well-established themes and issues with which the commission will become increasingly familiar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> In sending all this to the commission we are giving it quite unnecessary work and enabling it to build up its empire and its staff at immense cost to everyone. It sounds a crazy structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I agree. This is one of many reasons that the Bill is essentially mistaken. The number of contentious parades is minimal; the overwhelming majority can be dealt with in the ordinary way by the local constabulary. There is no need for a commission.
<P>
The heart of the argument against 28 days came from my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire: there is a great danger that this amount of time will play into the hands of those who wish to orchestrate confrontation, or even conflict, and there is evidence that there are still many such people. It is extremely short-sighted to establish a commission to resolve the parades issue and then impose on it conditions and terms that will defeat that purpose. The period of 28 days may have that effect. It should not take the commission even the greater part of 28 days to do its job with the few parades that are contentious. Every extra day is a bonus for those who want to obstruct and cause trouble. The 28 days will give the paramilitaries, mainly the Provisional IRA, more time to infiltrate an area deeply and establish residents' groups. Those groups will have more time to extend their influence and hardliners will have more time to orchestrate confrontation to create the conditions that the Government want the Bill to eliminate.
<P>
The amendments challenge the wisdom of the Government's choice of a period of 28 days. I hope that they will think again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Unionist amendment would establish a notice period of seven clear days, rather than 21 or 28. As a good Unionist, I like parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. As the corresponding period is six days in England and Wales and seven in Scotland we see no reason for its being any longer in Northern Ireland. No doubt the Minister will bring up the old argument about some things being different in Northern Ireland. There is nothing different about Northern Ireland. The people there are no different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom. The problem is that the Government consider it different and try to make a difference. That gives solace and confidence to those who want to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. The sooner the Government realise that that is the problem, and treat Northern Ireland exactly as the rest of the United Kingdom, the sooner there will be fewer problems.
<P>
I notice, with respect to the amendment that would bring in a period of 21 days, that the Opposition have a problem with the Bill, because it is an embarrassment to them. They instigated the North report and now feel bound to accept its findings. Had they still been in government they would have been making the same stupid arguments as the Minister. Now that the Conservatives are in opposition they do not like the Bill. They are speaking for many of the amendments but voting against them when the Whip cracks the whip. That seems rather peculiar, and an embarrassment for the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Some of us have long, public record of opposing the intention and recommendations of the North report. I take exception to being dismissed in the matter used by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I make an exception of the hon. Gentleman. I agree that he has been a good supporter of the Unionist cause in Northern Ireland. For that we are most thankful. However, while he supports us, when the whip is cracked, he must often vote contrary to his feelings.
<P>
I am surprised that the Opposition do not realise that a 21-day period applies at present and that, if my memory is correct, a Conservative Government introduced the order to effect that. They did so to comply with the report. They thought 21 days was enough. Why have this Government increased the time from 21 to 28 days? The previous Government studied the report and noted all the extra requirements and the other stupid nonsense, but they agreed to its recommendation of 21 days. Why does this Government think that that is not enough?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before calling the Minister, I ask the hon. Member for Basingstoke to address the Chair when he intervenes. The acoustics in the Room are poor and some hon. Members did not hear his intervention earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a fairly long debate and I do not proposed to extend it much further as the arguments for the amendment have little substance. The hon. Member for West Tyrone is right: the current position is 21 days. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was wrong when he spoke about seven days. I ask him to judge his comments in the light of his misunderstanding of the current position.
<P>
The Lord Commissioner to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd)[Mr. Ingram]
has told me that if I accepted both amendments and added the time proposed in each together, it would come to 28 days. We took the decision not on that basis but after careful consideration and consultation with a range of people. The North report is a helpful document; it is the basis on which the Bill was drafted. However, that does not mean that everything in the report should automatically be translated into law. We must consider other ways of dealing with these issues.
<P>
The need for police deployment has been raised. A period of time is needed to ensure that the RUC can get their act together in the light of changing circumstances. Whether the period is seven, 21 or 28 days, the circumstances that apply at the beginning of the period might change completely the closer it gets to the parade. However, a reasonable time scale allows the RUC time to make plans to deploy their forces on the ground, if that is what will be needed.
<P>
An important reason for specifying 28 days is that the commission wants to make its determination known five days before the procession is due to take place. Effectively, it has a number of days to consult, and for its authorised officers to mediate. The commission must then make its determination known and express a clear view about what should happen in a procession; there must be transparency in that decision.
<P>
The measure is not about giving the IRA time to organise and put bombs in buildings. Such statements are clearly unhelpful in trying to achieve normality within Northern Ireland. There are clearly good grounds for communities to dispute a parade going through their area. It is not only people who want to march in parades who have rights: those living in areas where parades are held have rights, too. Residents, as well as parade organisers, should be allowed to participate with the Parades Commission and make their views known.
<P>
It is important to state that it is the commission's wish to issue its determination five days before the procession takes place. We gave consideration to all these matters in deciding whether to keep the present 21-day period. We had to consider the new circumstances which will apply the establishment of a Parades Commission, for example and the different relationships on the grounds. It is not just a matter of what the RUC will be doing about a disputed parade but the work that the Parades Commission will have to do and how it will try to resolve matters when there is a disputed parade. Due largely to the commission's view of what is a reasonable period in which to carry out its work, we decided that 28 days was more appropriate than 21 days. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): The Minister berated my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone and me during the previous debate when he said that we were not able to give examples of times when we had gone to the police station and the sergeant was not available. We do not note these things down. I defy him to tell us where he has been in the last month. He is managed now so he probably could, but I defy an ordinary member of the Committee to tell us where he was unless he had made a note in his diary.
<P>
The Minister was simply using the old ploy of asking, "Where were you on 28 April 1995?" Without looking at a diary, one just could not answer off the top of one's head. He has however told us that these changes have been made after consultation with a wide range of people. Perhaps he will give us the list. He must have that list of people: his life is managed. He knew that this issue was coming up. He has a whole Department to give him the names of the folk he has consulted and doubtless he can give them to us.
<P>
The theory underlying the measure is that it will make life easier for the police. The Minister thinks that it will make it easier for them to arrange their deployments and so on but that it will not make life easier for the wicked. I cannot agree: the police do not need that extra time but the IRA do. I use the term IRA purely and simply because that is who we are dealing with very often.
<P>
The police know that on a given day there may be a dozen, 15 or 20 parades at various times and places in Northern Ireland. The commission steps in, gets in the notices and sorts them out and contacts all the groups in the community. In other words, it goes out into the community and practically invites objections. It immediately creates conditions in which people become aware of what is going on and someone will say, "Here is your chance boys, let's get on with it." A concerned residents' group is consulted and its objections are invited and the possibility of friction is increased. Friction and confrontation are invited. If the Minister does not know that, then God help him because he will have a steep learning curve.
<P>
It is already known where the major confrontations will be, and seven or eight others will be created so that the police force is dissipated quite unnecessarily in various parts of the country. That is the situation being created here. The Minister should start thinking a bit more deeply about the consequences of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): The hon. Gentleman talks about the extension of the notice period. Why is that entirely negative in the light of the dramatic incidents and possibilities articulated by the hon. Member for Basingstoke? Surely he would wish the commission, in those few cases where it was necessary, to have the time to do a meaningful job. He must admit that seven days from the date of notice to the police would not give the commission the opportunity to perform. Secondly, he seemed to be saying that people should not be made aware of what is going on, which they would if they got more than seven days' notice. Surely that is what it is all about. People should know what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> There are many places whre people know what is going on. They are aware that a procession is about to take place and, in future, they will be made even more aware. That knowledge will not be put to good use by those who oppose the procession and, particularly, by the IRA. They will use the time to plot and plan the disposition of their forces to ensure that confrontation takes place. Far from being negative, my approach is positive. I am trying to prevent evils occurring.
<P>
We are totally opposed to the concept of a commission, which is the wrong way to approach the issue. Parades are a matter for the police and not for a self-appointed quango that is building a massive, costly empire.
<P>
What benefit has accrused from the increase from seven to 21 days? I am not aware of any. If there have been real, measurable advantages, perhaps we could be told. If we are going to weigh these issues, we need to know what is on each side of the scales. At present, the scales are heavily weighted on one side. However, if people want to know what is happening, it will become known within seven days. Lists of Orange processions are often published in the local press.
<P>
Let us consider what the IRA does when it decides to impose its will on a community. I shall leave aside the events of this week, but consider the most recent reports from Families Against Intimidation and Terror and other organisations that deal with that problem. They tell us that in the past year or so more than 900 acts of violent intimidation have been reported to the police.
<P>
It is simple to carry out intimidation. One can take a chunk of timber, hammer a six-inch nail into it and then beat someone up with the pointed end; one can put a bullet through someone's leg; one can drop a few breeze bocks or something heavier on to someone's legs to break them; or one can beat someone up most viciously. That is what happens.
<P>
In addition to the reported acts of intimidations, Families Against Intimidation and Terror believes that up to 1,000 more have taken place. The police hear about only half the acts of intimidation, because half the people who are beaten up are so terrified of the consequences of reporting the incident to the police that they go nowhere near them. Yet we are proposing to give a full month's notice of a procession to the perpetrators of such acts. At present, they find it hard to tie together their opposition to a procession. However, give them a month's notice of processions in Enniskillen, Ballymena, Dunloy, Rasharkin, Kilrea and Tobermore that are taking place on the same day at the same time and they will have the opportunity to make their preparations and set out their dispositions.
<P>
The Bill is extremely foolish. I see no good flowing from it. There will always be excuses for giving shorter notice and there is no way that the Government can legitimately limit those processions. I would not want them to. There may be genuine reasons why notice is not given, and the police and the commission will accept them. However, far from doing good, the provisions in this clause will make life much easier for the ungodly and much more difficult for the law abiding and, in the long run, for the police and security forces. The clause will simply keep the busy-body commission in a job at high cost to the entire community.
<P>
I do not intend to withdraw the amendment. As the two amendments in the group are slightly different, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire might wish to put his amendment to a vote as well. I hope that there will be two separate Divisions on the two separate issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for East Londonderry has tabled the lead amendment, which is the one that will be put to a vote if he so wishes. Is he withdrawing the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> No, Mr. Welsh. I have no intention of withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I should like to return to amendment No. 85, which I am minded to withdraw. Having heard the Minister's reply, I can see some logic in the extension of the period of notice to 28 days. However, I would like to ask him two questions. First, when he consulted the RUC about the period of advance notice, what recommendation did it make? Secondly, the procedural rules state that the commission wishes to leave five working days between its determination and the date of a proposed parade. What is the purpose of giving five working days' notice on a determination? Are there rights of appeal? I suspect not. Why does the commission need that notice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> On the first point, the hon. Member for East Londonderry asked the same question about who had been consulted. Clearly the Parades Commission and the RUC were the main bodies that were consulted. I explained the commission's views and the reasons for our conclusion that the period of advance notice should be 28 days. The RUC would also find it helpful if the period was extended from 21 to 28 days.
 <P>
It is easy for politicians to think that we have all the answers. The Parades Commission has been appointed to take on a difficult task on behalf of the Government and of the people of Northern Ireland. It is also important to recognise that the RUC has many years of practical experience in dealing with difficult situations.
<P>
The second point related to the commission's view that it would issue its determinations five days in advance of a parade date. There are provisions in the Bill that would allow the Chief Constable to review decisions and refer them to the Secretary of State if he is not happy about them. That is one good reason for leaving a gap between the commission's final determination and the date of a given procession. That allows the RUC to consider the commission's determination, and to refer it to the Secretary of State if necessary. It also gives the Secretary of State time to come to a conclusion about the matter. There are reasonable grounds for the five-day period and the decision about it was taken on the advice of the Parades Commission. The commission has practical responsibility for the matter and felt that it was an appropriate period, given the provisions for review included in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that after that explanation the hon. Member for East Londonderry will reconsider the position and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> We have just been told that the two main groups that are most concerned in the matter are the RUC and the Parades Commission. Who else is involved? We have not been told. The Minister suggested that there might be others. Will he tell the Committee who they are?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to press the amendment to a vote?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Yes, Mr. Welsh, I do, if the Minister is not prepared to give me the information that I sought.

<P>

<B>Mr. Godman:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. Will you confirm, please, that hon. Members have two minutes in which to return to the Room when a Division is called?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is the usual practice, but sufficient time was given, and it was indicated to hon. Members that all was in preparation so that the vote could commence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 3, leave out lines 18 and 19.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendment: No. 87, in page 3, leave out lines 33 to 35.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Both amendments in my name are probing measures. I seek simply clarification, and some justification from the Minister. Both relate to deletions, first, of subsection (20)(b) and, consequently, of subsection (4)(g): notice under the 28 days' requirement should be given where reasonably practicable, and if not practicable, people are allowed to write later to state why they were unable to meet the deadline. I am worried that the proposal might invite abuse. I am not a lawyer, and it may be something that has been built in legally to allow people who missed a deadline by a few hours, or days, some form of defence. But, given the weight and thrust of these legislative proposals, and the reasons for them and given that we have just debated the deemed importance of 28 days it seems slightly illogical to allow people to be let off the hook simply by claiming that this or that happened. I merely ask the Minister for clarification of why those subsections were included. I also seek reassurance that he does not consider them a sort of loophole for people who wish to be obstructive and non-compliant in observing the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This could be the shortest debate of the Committee, although we must wait awhile because there may be even shorter debates later.
<P>
The reasons for the proposals are straightforward. On earlier amendments we gave examples of difficulties if RUC offices were not open on time, or if the sergeant was not there, and a parade organiser went along with form 11/1 and experienced difficulty submitting it through due process. Therefore, there would be reasonable grounds in those circumstances.
<P>
There are many other parades apart from the contentious parades in Northern Ireland. For example, there are parades to celebrate sporting triumphs. Northern Ireland may win the World cup, and the whole of Northern Ireland may come together to celebrate with a procession. No one would know about such a parade 28 days in advance. There may be parades to celebrate election victories. The party of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire recently suffered an election defeat, but if the Conservative party gets an opportunity to celebrate a victory, the hon. Gentleman will understand that people sometimes wish to do that with a procession. People do not know about such victories until the day of the event. Therefore, good, reasonable grounds for flexibility exist. There are many occasions on which people wish to show their happiness by parading. People may also wish to protest on an issue about which there was no notice. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am happy with the Minister's explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> As you can see, Mr. Welsh, a large number of amendments have been grouped with amendment No. 221. Some amendments would achieve the same objective as amendment No. 221 in a slightly different way.
<P>
I have long experience of processions and I know what happens on the day. There are real problems in organising processions and counting the participants. Amendment No. 113 would insert the word "approximate" in line 26 of page 3. There are many reasons for a procession being unable to start on time. People may arrive half an hour early, transport difficulties can arise, and so on. I appreciate that the police want to know the exact time of a procession, but such information can never be more than approximate. Processors may turn up at 11 o'clock and not be able to begin until 11.30 because the bus has run into difficulties. There are many problems in travelling from Belfast to Londonderry in the morning. There are often huge traffic jams on the road into Londonderry. Therefore, the Bill should be more flexible.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 would insert the words, "and any return procession" in line 26 of page 3. Return processions are often especially difficult. The Twelfth processions are large and it is sometimes difficult to extricate traffic from venues at the end of the day. That is also true of 17 March and 15 August processions. Participants may be travelling 20, 30 or 40 miles back to their home towns or areas. When they arrive they often process back to the hall from the outskirts of the village. A situation is envisaged in which the police demand that the procession should determine the exact time of its return to the hall and dispersal to the home village. There could be intermediate processions too. It would therefore be difficult to tie people to an exact time. That is why we want to introduce the word "approximate". It would give people some leeway. The police would expect them and have an idea of their arrival time. However, if the arrangements were too precise people could, I suppose break the law and be prosecuted, through no fault of their own. I do not think that the Government, despite their foolishness, really intend that.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 would insert the phrase "their estimate of" at the beginning of clause 6(4)(c) which deals with giving notice of the number of persons likely to take part in a procession. The organisers could have no idea of what might happen. A certain number of bands and lodges would be expected to attend. One has not a snowball's chance of working out how many people will be at some of the more informal gatherings. Past experience might suggest 1,000, 500, 200 or 10,000 but it is impossible to know. Therefore I should have thought it sensible to accept an estimate. A person acting in good faith can give an estimate but not an exact number, yet it appears that that will be required. It is very reasonable to ask for a rough estimate. The organisers may say, "We think there will be 500 at the procession, but of course if it rains there might be only 200 and if it is a wonderful day we might have 5,000." We want some flexibility to protect organisers from unforeseen circumstances. We should avoid like the plague a requirement for an exact number.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 115 and 116 deal with the requirement in clause 6(1)(d) to give, with respect to a procession,
"the names of any bands which are to take part in it".<P>

<P>
I should like the requirement to be for the organiser to provide the names of any bands that have been invited. That is a different matter from the names of bands that will take part, and it is all that the organiser can do. Problems have occurred in the past when undesirable people have turned up and tagged on to the end of a loyalist parade. In the light of the behaviour of some of the fellows that turn up, it is perhaps not possible for participants, or even the police, to stop them. However, if the police have lists of the bands that have been invited, they know who should be there. If others turn up, the police can take action against them later.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must not forget that the organisers of a procession can invite a band, but another band might come along and say, "We are coming along to join the procession on that day and here is our application". The police have a list of 20, 30, 40, 50, perhaps even 100 bands, and it is a big job to wade through the lot. The police may be being wise after the event, I know, but they will watch the bands going down the street, note their names as they pass and observe that two extra bands cannot be accounted for. They will wonder whether they received an application from them. They will go away and check, and say, "Yes, we have found applications for those two bands, but they were not on the invited list." In other words, the procession has been infiltrated and hijacked, which can be dangerous for those who are organising the procession.
<P>
If the police want to take action against those bands in future, they can do so. If, on the other hand, they have the good wit to check the invited list against all the bands that made applications, I suspect that they will find double the number of forms. Some bands live many miles away, process through their own villages to the main procession and then return. That can lead to a mix-up of forms. So if the police have a list of invited bands, when other applications to march are received, they can compare one list with the other. That should give them a clear idea of whether there is one procession being organised by Willie Ross or whoever or whether others are taking place at the same time in the same placing involving other bands that might be taking part to use the old terms in loyalist, republican or nationalist marches.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to what I am saying on this vital issue. It is crucial to help organisers of processions to keep control. Two processions on the same day at the same time in the same place could have been organised by different people. If they fall in the same general category, the police might treat them as if they were one and the same when they are not. If the Minister does carefully consider what I am saying, he will recognise that using the term "invited" rather than
"which are to take part in it"
<P>
will incease the capacity to control those who are taking part in processions.
<P>
I shall speak to the amendments tabled by hon. Member for South Down when I have heard what he[Mr. Ross]
has to say. That being so, we can move on to amendment No. 117 which falls within our general concept that the commission is unnecessary and that the RUC should take decisions about processions. I have stated time and again in Committee the reasons underlying our viewpoint and I do not intend to repeat them at great length this morning although they are as valid now as when I first made them. The Government will eventually learn that what we have said about the Bill and the entire process of controlling processions is absolutely correct. Removing the words
"necessary for, or appropriate for facilitating, the exercise by the Commission, the Secretary of State or members of"<P>

<P>
from paragraph (h) would make it a much simpler and straightforward requirement which could be easily met.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 is an attempt to rewrite in a rather more comprehensive way roughly what I said earlier. An approximate time should be what is required. A notice about the procession to and from should be for one procession because in truth what takes place on a particular day is one procession from start to finish and is considered by the organisers as such. It might make it easier for all concerned if the entire day's events involving a particular band, on say, 12 July, Black Saturday, 17 March and 15 August were available to the police in one fell swoop. All those taking part in those processions would submit their own notice.
<P>
I have some difficulty in understanding how that which is proposed will work in practice. I suspect that the individual who is organising the 12 July or 12 August parades will have to send out the invitations to the various clubs and lodges throughout the country. He will have to tell the police that the procession is going to take place and that a huge list of people have been invited. I suspect that all the various bands, clubs, lodges or chapters which are attending will also complete their forms and send them in.
<P>
There will be a mass of paper and I am not too sure how things will work and what implications the proposed changes have for all the organisers. There will be the organiser of the main procession and the organiser of all the various feeder processions to it. This will cause an immense amount of mayhem and difficulty for all concerned. The present arrangements appear to have worked.
<P>
That said, it would simplify matters to treat the whole thing as one procession. For example, a band leaves Limavady and is going to process through the town and then go by bus to Londonderry for the 12 August procession. It will process through Londonderry and leave at the end of the procession, get on the bus to return to Limavady and then process back to the hall and other dispersal points. The police in Limavady know roughly when the processors are leaving and returning. They know also when they will reach Londonderry. They know the route in Londonderry, and the police in Londonderry will have the input from the general committee about the Apprentice Boys in the city and will be able to build up a comprehensive picture of all that happens. If the Government took on board the need to regard the procession to and from the venue as one procession, with the procession round the city as the third part, it might make life easier for all concerned.
<P>
I suggest also that it should be the proposed route. The route could be changed for some reason. It is wrong to refer to the route. It should be the proposed route. The estimated number of processions and the participants mentioned in paragraph (c) merely state in a different language what is in amendment No. 118. My proposal arose as a result of conversations with people involved in the issue and the advice that they gave me. Clause 6(4)(d) requires
"the names of any bands"
<P>
to be specified. I am not sure whether we should go further; the clause states bands, but, as the Minister knows, lodges, clubs and so on are associated with those bands, which come from certain venues. Whether the Minister will want to know who is coming, or which bands have been invited, is another matter. Perhaps "bands" is sufficient to cover the matter; if so, no doubt he will tell us.
<P>
My final point about amendment No. 221 is the number of stewards that the organisers propose to engage. In the existing legislation, people are asked to provide stewards. The police want to know how many stewards there are, and who they are. In most major processions they know exactly who these people are; they are clearly identified. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment because Clause 6(4)(c) is an alternative to paragraph 6(4)(e) in line 30, which states:
"the arrangements for its control being made by the person proposing to organise it" 
<P>
that is, the steward. The clause raises some practical matters that should be considered very carefully so as to make life easier for everyone, including the police. The central feature is the estimates, especially of the number of bands invited to take part in a procession, which will give very great control. In the past, as the police know, there have been difficulties in the loyalist organisations with some bands and it would be easier to deal with any problems if the word "invited" was used, rather than "taking part". I hope that if he cannot accept the amendment, the Minister will consider the proposals very carefully and return with suggestions on Report.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> My amendments in the group are Nos. 60, 61 and 62 on the subject of the information required in an application for a parade or procession.
<P>
The first amendment is to clause 6(4), and would insert in paragraph (f) on page 3, line 32, after
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the name and address of that person"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contact telephone and fax numbers and the position of responsibility held".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some may think that asking for telephone and fax numbers is going into too much detail; but the words "position of responsibility held" are important from the point of view of the commission, the public, the police and anyone who has to consider the application and the person who submits and signs it. It is not so extraordinary to ask that the applicant, in addition to giving his or her name and address, should also state his position so that the commission and the police know that he holds a position of responsibility and is not a man or woman of straw who might casually or maliciously submit an application that has no merit or meaning in itself. That might help to identify more clearly the source of the application for a parade which could be a counter-parade and the responsibility that that person was willing to adopt. That is a logical extension of paragraph (f) it will establish more clearly who the person is by providing more than just a name and address, which does not give much away. I hope that the amendment will be accepted.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 61 and 62, which will add two paragraphs to clause 6(4), will ensure that more information is given in an application, which will help in the assessment of its validity. Amendment No. 61, which would insert paragraph (i), reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the names and numbers of any institutions and organisations, or constituent parts of any institution or organisation, which are to take part".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a logical proposal because it is possible to make an application with an encompassing name, as it were, at its head. To consider an application properly, it is essential to know what groups, bodies, institutions or organisations come under the umbrella of the encompassing name. That could affect or flavour the decision on the application, which may be taken by the commission, the police constable, the Chief Constable or the Secretary of State. The amendment simply involves the provision of additional information early on, so that an application can be assessed properly.
<P>
Amendment No. 62, which would insert paragraph (j), reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the name of any individual, not part of a band, who is to take part in it for the purpose of playing or sounding, or engage in the playing or sounding of musical or other instrument."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision involves considerable minutiae. However, the definition of a band is already contained in clause 16, which is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a group of two or more persons who carry for the purpose of playing or sounding, or engage in the playing or sounding of, musical or other instruments".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We really descend into minutiae when a band is said to involve more than two people. However, whimsical though this may appear, a serious point is involved. Even I can conceive of a situation in which individuals could create as much havoc as a band through the manner of their performance, their attitude, by the tunes that they play and by the gestures that they make, although they would not legally be a band. However bizarre it may sound, a band could march in a procession in single file, like modern-day pied pipers of Hamelin, but it would not be a band from a legal point of view and it would not be covered by the legislation.
<P>
It may sound bizarre to discuss such minutiae but it is in keeping with the terms of an application to give as much information as possible. It is logical to be all-embracing in the definition. That will enable a better judgment to be made based on the facts of the application itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman was saying about amendment No. 62. I wonder whether one of those characters who can dress up and play six instruments at the same time might become a one-man band. I have never actually seen such a person in a procession, but I daresay that it might happen. I have seen a lone piper, which is something that you, Mr. Welsh, and the Minister will be familiar with as Scots. I have occasionally seen a lambeg drummer, but he would usually have a piper, and would therefore qualify as a band. Apart from those examples, will the hon. Gentleman give me a concrete example of what he has in mind? I realise that there are unusual circumstances in which an individual might qualify, but I would like to clarify exactly what he means.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked me to give an example of what I am speaking about. He gave many examples of what might be possible in the course of his intervention. Many people will try to drive a proverbial coach and horses through this legislation, in order to ensure that it has no meaning in reality. Many groups and organisations will try to frustrate the legislation, and the good effects that it should have. It is not beyond the ingenuity of man or woman, especially during the parade season in Northern Ireland, to circumvent the definition of "band" appearing in clause 16. If further information is not added to the Bill's definition, there will be a transgression and infringement of its application. The absence of such information from the Bill, once it is enacted, would be seen as a method of circumventing one of the Bill's primary provisions concerning bands and music-making.
<P>
I ask the Committee to consider the three amendments in my name, and the seriousness with which I have put them forward. Committee members might regard the detail of the amendments as minutiae, but that is the nature of detail. The detail is there to enable the commission, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State or whoever has to make an assessment to have a fuller range of data for their deliberations as to whether a parade should take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have listened to the debate with interest, but I have some difficulty in understanding why the amendments have been tabled. The hon. Member for East Londonderry clearly has some difficulty with at least one of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Down.
<P>
The RUC's form 11/1, on which notice is given of an intention to hold a parade, already asks for much of the information that we are discussing under these amendments. That form is prescribed under the Public Order (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order, which was brought into effect last year, and which the Bill will replace. The order was introduced by negative resolution and consultation on the order took place at the time. There was also an opportunity for debate. None of the points currently being made, however, was made at that time. I do not mean to imply that there is no validity in these arguments, but we have already been through a process of consultation. If these points had been raised, I would be able to see more merit in advancing them now. I am not suggesting that the honourable Gentlemen are merely raising these issues for the sake of having an argument or a debate, but some people might draw that conclusion.
<P>
As the hon. Member for East Londonderry said, amendment No. 221 brings together his individual amendments Nos. 113, 118, 116 and 115, as well as seeking to introduce an additional element to the Bill.[Mr. Ingram]
Before I deal with the individual amendments, I should like to turn to the new point that the hon. Gentleman raises under paragraph (e) of amendment No. 221, which asks for the number of stewards proposed to be engaged by the organisers to be included. Form 11/1 already asks for the names and addresses of the marshalls or stewards. There is therefore already a duty to provide that information. That particular part of amendment No. 221 is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 asks for the date and approximate start time of the parade. The prescribed form asks for the start time of the parade; the question is whether the time given should be approximate or precise.
<P>
The police already have enough difficulty getting parades to start on time, for a variety of reasons. If a parade is delayed for any reason, it can have a major, disruptive effect on traffic and other aspects of normal civil life. The reason that the precise time is asked for is to hold the parade organisers to that. If the approximate time only were demanded, it would give too much leeway to the organisers of the parade what would be the end point of that approximate time?
<P>
Amendment No. 112 would require the times of the outward and return journeys of the parade. Amendment No. 114 would have the form specify the return route. That information is already asked for on form 11/1. The amendments are therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 asks for the parade organiser's estimate of the number of participants. The form as it stands asks for the anticipated number of participants. There is nothing to choose between those two words. It is not necessary to amend the wording of the Bill from "anticipated" to "estimated".
<P>
Amendment Nos. 116 and 115, taken together, would require the names of invited bands only. The Bill as it stands specifically asks for the names of bands to be included on the form. Although I listened to the reasoned argument presented by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, I could not see the difference between asking for the names of bands and asking for invited bands.
<P>
I shall give ther matter further thought because of the hon. Gentleman heavy emphasis on it, but I would not want him to think that that automatically means that we will return to it on Report. However, as he gave it particular emphasis, I will give it further consideration in case there is a point that I may have missed in my assessment. It is the parade organisers' responsibility to ensure that they know which bands are coming and that no uninvited bands attend or participate in the parade.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 was tabled by the hon. Member for South Down, who has perhaps similar experience to that of the hon. Member for East Londonderry in organising parades he is indicating that he does not, but that does not detract from his point. The hon. Member for South Down did not, however, present much of a case as he admitted to justify the requirement to provide contact telephone and fax numbers and the position of responsibility held. Telephone numbers are already required on the existing form. I doubt whether providing a fax number would be much more useful, and I do not think that it is worth so amending the Bill. Similarly, providing the position of responsibility held within the parading organisation would add little value to the information gathered.
<P>
In clause 6, along with the prescribed form, we are attempting to strike a balance in gathering information necessary for the Parades Commission and the police to do their jobs effectively. There comes a point when asking for too much information becomes a burden on those organising a parade. What do we gain from seeking that additional information? The hon. Gentleman may have a strong view on that. I do not think that it would achieve much.
<P>
Amendment No. 117 is defective: it would remove any reference to the powers of the commission or those of the Secretary of State. They are granted powers throughout the Bill. Removing them from subsection 4(h) would create the need for many other consequential amendments. Clearly, the commission and the Secretary of State are required to have powers vested in them.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 61 requests the names and numbers of parts of organisations or of whole organisations that participate in a parade. Section 2 of form 11/1 requests the nature of the parade and the name of the organising body. We are again trying to strike a balance. Asking for too much detail would inflict an unacceptable burden on those who are organising parades.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down spoke about minutiae. Minutiae would make the form impossible and mistakes might be made. Would a mistake on a less important aspect of the form give cause for people to object to the parade? We would end up with a difficult situation. The same argument applies to amendment No. 62, which the hon. Member for South Down favoured. The hon. Member for East Londonderry asked for specific details on its meaning. He asked whether it referred to an individual piper, drummer or fife player. We come down to how a band is defined in the Bill. How far do we go to achieve a balance? We have tried to ensure that the definition relates to what is normally considered to be a band. By discussing individuals or lone players of any instrument, we are once again getting into the problem of minutiae. The arguments and principles that have been raised do not convince me that it is necessary to amend the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I have considered withdrawing the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member for South Down will not press his amendments. A number of interesting and serious points have been made. We are discussing what can happen on the day of a procession. Amendments Nos. 115 and 116 were not tabled lightly. They reflect certain events. As for amendments No. 118, I appreciate that the form will address the issue of exact time.
<P>
So long as common sense is applied when an exact time is stated, I am happy with what is in the Bill. There is, however, the problem of things going wrong. Organisers of processions always have the devil of a job of trying to get folk there on time. Drawing together a large number of feeder processions from the extremities of the branches and marching them to the main trunk of the procession and back out is a horrendous task. We will have to depend on people moving on time, or nearly on time.
<P>
Many years ago we had difficulty with an Orange procession. The chap who was organising it told one of the main feeder parades that it was an hour and a half late. The organiser agreed that it could complete the procession in its own time. When that feeder march came back in four year's time, it was an hour late and everyone else was long gone. It had to march by itself, and four years after that it was there on time.
<P>
I am not averse to a strict timetable. I wish that all parades would move on time so as to be over and done with and to make things easier for everybody. However, I do not want to hear some smart alec saying, "They were supposed to be here at one o'clock and they will not be here until quarter past, so they are breaking the law", regardless of the problems they had in getting there, or that if everything goes smoothly and, as can easily happen, the participants are sitting on the footpath for half an hour, I do not want them to be told that they are breaking the law and asked to disperse. We should try to avoid the chance that some smart alec gets it into his head to use the degree of difficulties that can occur to take folk to court. If the Minister tells me that there will be a certain amount of give and take, I shall be happy enough.
<P>
I understand why the Minister wants me to withdraw amendment No. 117. No doubt it will be withdrawn. I tabled it to make sure that he is reminded of our objection to the whole Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down raised some interesting matters that have sparked a series of thoughts in my head. Like me, he will be convinced that the information required by amendment No. 60 is there. Not everyone has a fax machine; even in this day and age, some do not have telephones. I am very happy for them.
<P>
I should have thought that responsibility lay with the organisers of processions in these cases. The point is of great interest in regard to amendment No. 61. Much of the information is covered by amendments Nos. 115 and 116, but other aspects are worth further examination. I will read carefully what the hon. Gentleman has said because the ramifications of his contribution are of interest to everyone involved in processing. I would be at one with the hon. Gentleman in regard to some of the organisations and individuals that might fall within the sample. I would object to them on whatever side of the political fence they happen to stand.
<P>
The Minister should not think that this matter will just go away. As the hon. Member for South Down said, people in Northern Ireland are infinitely ingenious in finding ways round things. The Minister and his officials even the Chief Constable may have missed something here, and that is worthy of further examination.
<P>
On amendment No. 62, there could be problems. Until the hon. Member for South Down raised the matter I had not thought of the inherent possibilities for a single piper or one-man band or a single lambeg drum. At one time, in my constituency, there was a tradition that folk went out on the 11th night for a bonfire and so on, and that led to a lot of trouble. It became a major issue when it pulled in hangers-on from a 35-mile radius and led to several unsavoury incidents. The Orange Institution eventually took it over a few years ago. It runs the 11th night itself, taking everyone off to the Orange field for a bonfire, which gets people out of the town centre.
<P>
That procession arose from a makeshift band of whoever turned up with a drum or an accordion on the night. They came as individuals and whether they could have been called a band is difficult to decide. The hon. Gentleman may be thinking about similar occasions and I want to examine carefully what he said. I shall do so and perhaps return to the matter on Report. There is a field, or perhaps only a corner of a field, but it is worth exploring because there may be a deep bog in it, and I would not want us to fall in.
<P>
The Minister has shown some willingness to consider the extremely serious points that we have raised, and if he will undertake to consider sympathetically any points we may make between now and Report, specifically on amendments Nos. 115 and 116, we could profitably withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for his response to my amendments, but I was surprised at some of his comments because he declined to take cognisance of amendment No. 60, which would require someone's position of responsibility to be noted, because that information is provided on an existing form. Clause 6(4) refers to the form prescribed. If it is important that someone's position of responsibility is stated on an existing form, why is it not important for that information to be on a proposed form? That is illogical.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 was tabled because at present a person can make an application under an umbrella name with an encompassing description of who or what is organising a parade. The amendment simply requires the hidden factors in that umbrella description to be more explicit on the form. I did not use the word minutiae in relation to amendment No. 61 because there are no minutiae in terms of needing to know the component parts of an organisation which is organising a parade. It is important that we should know that.
<P>
I used the word minutiae in relation to amendment No. 62. It does not mean trivia. Trivia are things that should not be considered because they are unimportant; minutiae are details that have not been carefully examined. That was my intended meaning of minutiae.
<P>
There was some humour in the suggestion that someone could cause a disturbance by playing an instrument alone, but I am sure that the Minister has not had the experience of being within 100 yd of a lambeg drummer who continues to drum at all hours of the night and day until blood exudes from his wrists and hands. That is not only annoying, it can be terrifying. It may not be as innocent as it appears and its involvement[Mr. McGrady]
in parades may have a dramatic effect on whether the parade is peaceful or not.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider our arguments. Subsection (4)(h) refers to
"such other matters as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary for",<P>

<P>
and so on. I beg to think that when considering "such other matters" the Secretary of State will take on board some of our comments on amendments Nos. 60 to 62.
<P>
