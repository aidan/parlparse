<H2><center>Standing Committee C</center></H2>
<H4><center>Wednesday 4 February 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Edward O'Hara in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/007/1997007.htm">Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill</A></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [21 January]: No. 46, in page 1, line 6, after the word "mammal" to insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except foxes, mink, deer or hares". [Mr. Bennett.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 59, in page 1, line 9, after "mammal", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except foxes, hares, mink and deer".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and No. 74, in page 1, line 13, after "mammal", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except foxes, hares, mink or deer".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones </B>(Clwyd, South): I think that the case for opposing amendment No. 46 was made last week. As I said, the amendment should not be made. However, it should have been debated to give the Bill's opponents the opportunity to debate whether certain classes of animal should be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Opik </B>(Montgomeryshire): Before the hon. Gentleman finishes, I should like to check whether foxes are, to use his phrase, at the apex of the food chain. Is he aware that in Finland wolverines and lynx hunt and kill foxes, as do golden eagles and badgers in the United Kingdom and coyotes in the United States? Surely that information fatally undermines his assumption that in the natural world, the fox has no predators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I do not think that that undermines my point. In the United Kingdom context, the fox is an apex predator, which reinforces my point. Moreover, I do not think that foxes constitute a significant part of wolves' diets. The hon. Gentleman gestures at his papers; I do not know what those say. I cannot imagine that predators such as wolves, which hunt in packs, have foxes as a major part of their diet. Wolves hunt in packs specifically to get larger prey, such as deer. Deer would feed a pack, whereas a fox would be a very small meal for a pack of wolves. I therefore ask the Committee to oppose amendment No. 46.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. There has been much discussion of clause 1. I should like to return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) at a previous sitting. Does my hon. Friend have any comments about the competency of the clause?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Government remain neutral and made provision for a free vote on Second Reading. Labour Members have been free to decide whether to support the Bill.
<P>
As I said, the advice that I have received is that clause 1 is indeed defective and that if it were to proceed in its present form, the Bill would not be in a reasonable state to go on to the statute book. That said, the Government accept that we have a responsibility to ensure that the Bill is in good order before it leaves the House of Commons. I shall therefore advise my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), the Bill's promoter, and its sponsors, of how we believe the Bill is defective and how any defects may be remedied. I cannot do that today, but shall endeavour to do so as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it not a fact that the Minister has been sitting in Committee since we began to debate the clause and always knew that the clause would be examined first, since it is clause 1? And is it not amazing that we are now told, at this late stage, that the clause is flawed? How do we know that this situation will not arise again during our consideration of the Bill, if the Home Office is so hopelessly behind? Does the hon. Gentleman accept that since the change of Minister at the Home Office on May 1, things have become pretty slack?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair, but a question for the Minister, to which he may or may not wish to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I find all this mind-boggling. As the Committee and the House will know, I am an even-tempered sort of guy, but most of us are doing two or three jobs at present, as many of us are members of Select Committees at the same time as being members of this Committee. We have been considering the Bill week after week. At the first sitting, the Minister, quite properly, made clear the Government's position in relation to the Bill and said that they were neutral, but I believe he said we can check by looking at the Hansard report of the first sitting that if he wanted to make any amendments, he would offer them to the Bill's sponsors.
<P>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), I am boggle-minded as to what Home Office officials have been doing between then and now. When did the Minister instruct parliamentary draftsmen to redraft this clause? We may have to take this to the Speaker and the House, because how can this Standing Committee proceed if, after spending weeks and weeks considering the Bill, we still only on line 2, and are now told that the Government consider all the work done to date to be defective? That is not an issue for the Bill's promoter, it is an issue for the Home Office. All the work that we have done to date is otiose and I suggest that the[Mr. Tony Baldry]
 Committee adjourns until the Home Office gets a grip on matters, tells us which clauses are defective and offers appropriate amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made his point well. If he wishes to move further proceedings in Committee, he is free to do so at the appropriate time, but his point of order has been well made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I should like to propose a further sittings motion to enable the Committee to adjourn today, but to make up for the time lost.
<P>
I beg to move,
That during further proceedings on the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I do not think that anyone will challenge that sittings motion, but it is difficult to see what further progress we can make. This is all rather confusing. It is extraordinary that a Government Back Bencher has had to move what was clearly an orchestrated point of order on the competence of the clause. What has been happening since the Committee first met? I suggest that the Committee should adjourn this morning, so that all of us can reach an understanding, along with Ministers, of what in the Bill is competent and what is incompetent. If amendments are to be tabled, we should know what those amendments are to be. Otherwise, there will be considerable anger during our further proceedings, and I would not want to be in the shoes of the hon. Member for Worcester. If a great number of amendments are tabled on Report, it will be a tricky time for him.
<P>
I suggest that the Committee adjourns 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member may suggest an adjournment but may not move it. The question before the Committee is an amended sittings motion. It is important to decide that before moving an adjournment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): The Committee should not be left in limbo; neither should the public, some of whom may face criminal penalties if the Bill is enacted. The public should be allowed to see that some order has been introduced into our deliberations. The Minister has already been criticised, so I shall not add to his pain and embarrassment, but it is fair to say that the conduct of the Bill has been a total shambles. That is not a criticism of you, Mr. O'Hara, or of the Chairman at our previous sitting. It is a legitimate criticism of the sponsors of the Bill.
 <P>
I suggest that instead of the Committee adjourned today 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We do not have a motion for adjournment before the Committee. We are discussing a sittings motion, and it might be as well if I put the question. There will be a further opportunity for debate when we discuss the adjournment motion if one is forthcoming.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My use of language was incorrect and I did not strictly mean an adjournment. I meant that in the light of the shambolic state of affairs the hon. Member for Worcester might care to reconsider his sittings motion, so that we do not sit until the House has given leave for us to sit again or the Government assure the Committee that what is left of his Bill when the Home Office has been through it is in order and capable of being enacted. At the moment we are in a state of total ignorance about the legitimacy of the proposed clauses and amendments to the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the Committee agrees to adjourn after the sittings motion, it could adjourn again when it reconvenes, so there will be an opportunity to deal with the eventualities that the hon. Gentleman foresees as possibly being necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): It is unfortunate that we have got into this situation. I firmly support the sittings motion because we must get on with the Bill. Procedurally, we must deal with the sittings motion before we can adjourn, so I understand why we must discuss the sittings motion before the possibility of adjourning. We are considering whether we should sit next Wednesday afternoon to make up for this morning. The Home Office has been pressed since before Christmas to ensure that any amendments that are necessary to ensure that the Bill will become good law are forthcoming. The Committee should make it clear now that any such amendments must be available early on Monday so that we may examine their implications and perhaps table further amendments if we disagree with the Home Office's amendments and make orderly progress. I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking that not only any proposed changes to clause 1, but any proposed changes to the whole of the Bill will be available by Monday for the Committee's scrutiny. On that basis, it seems that the sittings motion is reasonable and that it would make sense to adjourn following the motion.

<P>

<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I support the sittings motion, which is the only possible response to the situation in which we find ourselves. The reasons for the sittings motion, however, are utterly unacceptable. We are considering clause 1; the Home Office should have examined clause 1 a long time ago. It is wholly inappropriate for the Minister to come to the Committee to say after the Committee has debated the clause over several weeks that the Home Office has at last got round to examining the clause and has discovered that it is defective.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is my right hon. Friend aware that, as a consequence of what has happened today and on previous Wednesday mornings, other private Member's Bills for example, the Road Traffic Reduction (UK Targets) Bill and other Bills supported by charities and even by the Government, have been denied access to this Committee and therefore to the statute book?
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I regret that my usual hon. and learned Friend's point is not well made. First, the established practice is that Bills queue, and on all the previous Wednesday mornings our discussions were perfectly legitimate. Other Bills must take their chances in the queue. Secondly, it is incorrect to say that other Bills cannot get into Committee just because this Bill is being considered; I know that from having been involved in private Member's Bills that were further down in the queue. My usual hon. and learned Friend is therefore wrong on both points.
<P>
To return to the main point of the sittings motion, I find the Home Office's conduct extraordinary. I do not know when the Home Office finally decided to start examining the Bill; perhaps the Minister will enlighten us. I do not know why we have only now been made aware that there is a deficiency in the Bill. I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury, with whom I have disagreed on other issues, in saying that we must be certain that this problem will not arise again in the course of considering the Bill. We must be certain of that for the sake of good order.
<P>
I would therefore welcome a clear assurance from the Minister that Home Office official will now do what they should already have done. They must go through the Bill properly so that we are told before we sit again whether it has any other flaws. This has been a complete shambles. I speak as someone who was once responsible for 22 private Member's Bills and we did not have this kind of mess.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall try to spread some light rather than heat.
<P>
To answer the point made by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald and my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) about any future changes that the Bill might need, I can assure them that by Monday next week my advice on the defects of clause 1 will be available to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. There are also defects in other parts of the Bill and similar advice on those will be made available at an appropriate time.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald and the hon. Member for Banbury, who have both served in government, are a little confused about this Bill's status in comparison to Bills they have previously been involved in. This is not a Government hand-out Bill but, strictly-speaking, a private Member's Bill that was drafted by hon. Friend the Member for Worcester and those who were assisting him.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Mr. Anthony Scrivener QC, former chairman of the Bar Council, who drafted the Bill, has made a bit of a mess of it? Will he give us the firm undertaking that the redrafting and corrections will be carried out by Government lawyers and that Mr. Scrivener will take no part in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have no knowledge of what involvement Mr. Scrivener had in drafting the Bill. It is not for me to comment on his competence, tempting though it is to follow that path.
<P>
The Bill was never a Government hand-out Bill. The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, and possibly the hon. Member for Banbury, may have been involved with Bills that the Government wished to promote. By persuading a private Member to take the Bill on board it was, de facto, a Government Bill, because it had the backing of Government policy. The Government were neutral on this Bill from the beginning. I made that clear on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe</b> <i>rose </i><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
Our manifesto commitment on this issue was for a free vote, which is as close as anyone can get to a neutral stand. As that is the case I expect the Committee to accept in good faith that we have a case it has been difficult to provide a set of amendments to a Bill on which the Government are neutral.
<P>
I received advice on defects in the Bill from officials from an early stage and it is unfair to criticise the Home Office. When I have been asked for advice, I have been willing to give it. Indeed, on 17 December my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish asked where I thought problems lay. As for providing specific amendments, the difficulty has been one of policy. If the Government are neutral, it is difficult to commission and table amendments to a Bill 
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry</b><i> rose </i><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will give way in a minute.
<P>
To commission and propose amendments to a Bill might be taken as a breach of Government neutrality. That said, we are convinced that the only way to ensure that the Bill is in good order before it leaves the House of Commons is to provide precisely that help. That is what we plan to do. We have not been negligent. We are in an unprecedented situation a Bill with defects, which received the support of the House on Second Reading while the Government remained neutral, has to be brought into reasonable order. That is a genuine difficulty and one which, with a bit of patience, I have been able to overcome.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am very grateful to my hon. and temporary Friend he is a nice chap and it hurts to have to argue with him. Nevertheless, his defence is unconvincing. Does he not accept that all Governments have an interest in the integrity of legislation that leaves the House? That is why Ministers sit on Committees that debate private Member's Bills. Their role is to comment and ensure that the House does not produce incoherent legislation.
<P>
If my hon. Friend has that responsibility, and if his officials have a responsibility to serve him in that respect, they have the like responsibility to do it in good time. That has not been done. The Government cannot plead that they have a responsibility to ensure that legislation is coherent without producing the means, which is the provision of quick and effective information.
<P>
Of course, there is a distinction between hand-out Bills and purely private Member's Bills, but in all my experience of knotty, tricky and highly controversial private Member's Bills, I have never known such cirumstances to be defended instead of apologised for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will come to the right hon. Lady's point after I have given way to the hon. Member for Banbury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am genuinely confused. At our first sitting, the Minister said:
"I understand clearly what he means, but it would not be appropriate for me formally to table amendments, because the Government hold a neutral position. However, I have undertaken privately to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester that any concerns that the Government have about the technical competence or the wording of the Bill will be communicated through the usual channels." [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December 1997; c. 14.]<P>

<P>
We all heard that on 17 December and understood what it meant. We understood that the Minister and the Home Office would advise the proposer of the Bill how it could be put in order. There is no mystery about that. After all, the Bill was introduced in November and it is now February.
<P>
The only reasonable inference that can be taken from those words was that the Minister had given an undertaking to the whole Committee that he would ensure that the Bill was in order. Will he explain what he is saying now and square it with the advice that he gave the Committee on 17 December?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I advised the Committee on 17 December in good faith. I said this morning that the situation is slightly unprecedented, as the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald and the hon. Member for Banbury must admit. I cannot find any recent precedent in which the Government have had to provide advice, even to the extent of providing drafted amendments, on legislation on which they were neutral.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> The Abortion Amendment Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That was in 1967.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> No, it was in 1989.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sorry. The right hon. Lady has raised that example, but there is no very recent experience of such a matter.
<P>
I have had to overcome the difficulty of squaring the Government's neutral position irrespective of what I said on 17 December, and I accept that I said it with commissioning parliamentary counsel to draft amendments that would make the Bill competent. It was not a matter of getting advice from officials at the Home Office. I have not resolved that difficulty and can fulfil the obligation that I gave to the Committee on 17 December.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I should like to return to an earlier point. My hon. Friend promised us that any changes that were necessary for clause 1 would be available on Monday. Should he not have told us on Monday about any changes to the rest of the Bill? It was clear from our discussions that there is a substantial interrelationship between clause 1 and clause 5. It will be difficult for the Committee to make progress unless members can see how the whole structure fits together. I realise that time is a problem, but I plead with my hon. Friend to let us know about changes to the whole Bill by Tuesday if it is not possible by Monday so that when we meet on Wednesday morning we can see the whole reconstructed edifice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Opik:</B> I am listening hard, but I simply do not understand why if the Minister thinks that the Government's neutrality has been compromised in the past by taking such initiatives, it is not compromised now. Why is it not the responsibility of the Bill's proposer to resolve such issues? Why do the Government feel that it is a neutral action to intervene at this stage? Will the Minister explain that, in simple terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Perhaps he would repeat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Opik:</B> Why does the Minister regard this initiative as not compromising the neutrality of the Government with regard to the Bill? I cannot say it more simply than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot give my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish an assurance that I can provide advice about defects and possible improvements of the whole Bill by next Monday. I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester and his supporters the advice that is available. I will provide advice about the rest of the Bill as quickly as possible after that.
<P>
If I understood him correctly, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Opik) said that the Government were compromising their neutral position by providing such advice. That, in a nutshell, was precisely my difficulty in the recent past, which I have now overcome. Although the Government hold a neutral position on the Bill, we have a responsibility to ensure that it is in good order before it leaves the House of Commons. As the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald said, such a thing has happened before. On that principle, I decided to commission advice about the changes that may be necessary in the Bill. It is not the tidiest operation that I have been involved in, and I have been involved in some pretty untidy operations in my time, but having said that, there were no recent precedents to guide us and various matters had to be worked out.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Lady, with whom I share, I hope, great affection, understands how the Home Office works. It is an efficient, well-organised Department, but certain decisions had to be taken and parliamentary counsel consulted. We patiently worked our way through those processes and can now, with confidence, give good advice on improving the Bill and correcting the defective passages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the Official Report on 17 December the hon. Member for Reading, West, said:
"If there are concerns about the legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said I doubt that there are, because I know the trouble he took to find expert advice before drafting the legislation".<P>

<P>
Later in the proceedings, the hon. Member for Basildon said:
"The Bill is not long and it is not difficult." [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December; c. 6-18.]<P>

<P>
Will the Minister help the Committee by telling us what subjects in clause 1 he finds troubling? He will not be able to go further than that. What is wrong with clause 1 that could bring our proceedings to a halt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman would be advised to wait for good advice before entering into a debate on the matter. However, at a previous sitting my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish asked for advice on a specific amendment, which I gave him. I said that it would improve the Bill if the amendment were accepted, but the Committee, in its wisdom or otherwise, decided not to support it. The Official Report states that I gave advice on the deficiencies of clause 1 at the time. The hon. and learned Gentleman is capable of doing his own research; I am sure he does not want me to do it for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is that the amendment for which the hon. Gentleman voted, which was co-signed by the hon. Member for Worcester, who voted against it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is capable of doing his own research. If he wishes to do so, he can check the Official Report of our proceedings to discover who voted for which proposal. My recollection is not particularly good, but I remember voting for the amendment. I felt obliged to do so, having been asked for advice on the effect of the amendment on clause 1.
<P>
For understandable reasons, those who opposed the Bill will want to have some fun out of it. The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, with the best possible motives, will want to make trouble out of it. I ask the Committee to bear in mind that throughout our proceedings I have had to act in circumstances that are without recent precedent. I have had to exercise patience in trying to find a solution to the problems confronting the Committee. I have acted in good faith. If hon. Members who oppose the Bill are not happy with that, I apologise, but it was the only way in which we could work through the problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Opik:</B> Just to reassure the Minister, I do not intend, to poke fun neither do any of my hon. Friends, and I am simply trying to clarify what is going on. Let me check that my understanding is correct. The Minister is now describing the process that the Government and he, as the Minister, want to adopt to make the Bill workable, despite past assurances that it is workable in its current state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not know how I can put it any more clearly. The advice that I have received is that clause 1 and some of the subsequent clauses are defective. I intend to provide advice to my hon. Friends and to the sponsors of the Bill on where the Bill could be improved to remove any existing defects. I shall do so not because the Government have ceased to be neutral on the Bill, but because we believe that it is in the best interests of the general public, and indeed theHouse, that the Bill is put in as good order as possible before it completes all its stages. That is the position in a nutshell. I shall provide advice by Monday on any changes that need to be made to clause 1 and, as regards the rest of the Bill, I shall provide similar advice in as reasonable a time as possible. However, I do not believe that I will be able to do that by Monday.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the ashes of previous proceedings of the Committee have been well raked over. The Minister has given explanations in various forms, but the same explanations several times, and it would be for the benefit of the Committee if I now put the question on the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am a new boy in this place, so you will forgive me if what I am about to say is wrong. I have observed the proceedings of the Committee over the past four or five sittings, culminating in this appalling shambles today, and it seems to me that the way in which a private Member's Bill is considered in Committee is being brought into disrepute in a worrying way. That feeling was echoed in Madam Speaker's remarks in answer to the point of order raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough last Wednesday.
<P>
Is there not an argument that the Government now need to redraft the Bill in the way that the Minister describes? Given that the Minister cannot produce all the amendments on Monday, is there not a risk that this stop-start procedure will go on for a number of weeks while the Government lawyers puzzle over it? Therefore, is there not a strong argument that, instead of the proposed sittings motion 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that that is a point of order; it is an expression of opinion. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) is wrong in his interpretation of Madam Speaker's comments. I made a point of meeting her to discuss the point of order raised by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough in the Chamber last week. However, the hon. Gentleman is entitled to his views.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
