<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000297"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: that schedule 31 be the Thirty-first schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061678000298"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): I begin by
welcoming you back to the Chair for this afternoon&#146;s sitting,
Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="09061678000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are in the middle of a set of clauses that relate to anti-avoidance,
with another three to go. Clause 62 and schedule 31 are anti-avoidance
measures, designed to prevent the creation of leases that only ever
make
losses.</div><a name="09061678000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anti-avoidance
provisions were introduced in schedule 10 to the Finance Act
2006 in relation to changes in the ownership of companies carrying on a
leasing business. Before that legislation was passed, a tax advantage
could arise when a lessor company was sold to a group that expected to
have tax losses available for surrender by way of group relief. The
2006 Act made provision to target changes in the economic ownership of
a plant or machinery leasing business carried on by a company on its
own or in partnership. That legislation applies to simple sales of
shares in a leasing company and to changes in partnership sharing
arrangements, in addition to any other route by which the economic
ownership of a business could be
changed.</div><a name="09061678000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation aims to prevent an unacceptable permanent deferral of tax.
It was previously possible for a leasing company to generate losses in
the early years of a long leasing contract as a consequence of the
availability of capital allowances, with such losses being available
for group relief. In the later years of the lease, the capital
allowances would be reduced and the company would become profitable. If
the leasing company was sold in the interim to a loss-making company or
group, the leasing company&#146;s profits would be covered by the new
owner&#146;s losses. Thus, an acceptable temporary deferral of tax
became a permanent deferral of
tax.</div><a name="09061678000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
tax advantage arose because the tax relief available via capital
allowances normally exceeds the commercial depreciation at the outset
of a lease. The timing advantage reverses later in the lease period.
The effect of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>accelerated capital allowances is that a lessor company will often
realise tax losses to begin with, which will be available for surrender
by way of group relief. Therefore, the sale of lease-tails, when a
lessor company is sold to a group with tax losses, had the effect that
no tax was payable on the profits arising in later periods on the
reversal of the capital
allowances.</div><a name="09061678000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2006 Act tried to counter that practice by ensuring that an accounting
period ends on the sale of a lessor company. The company is treated as
receiving income in the accounting period ending on the change of
ownership, to the extent that the tax written down value of the assets
is less than the account&#146;s value. A deduction of the same amount
arises in the next accounting period of the lessee
company.</div><a name="09061678000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
31 includes Government proposals to change the 2006 Act, most of which
should ensure that the legislation works as intended in all
circumstances, including in complex transactions. Schedule 10 to the
2006 Act introduced a charge for lessor companies when sold to recover
the tax timing advantage they received from capital allowance claims.
That charge was an amount of income introduced by reference to the
difference between the balance sheet value of assets owned by the
lessor company and their tax written down value&#151;that is, the
amount still eligible for capital allowances. Clearly, if the lessor
company did not own the assets, the balance sheet value of assets would
be
zero.</div><a name="09061678000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lessor
companies had been trying to avoid the consequences of schedule 10 to
the 2006 Act by entering into sale and leaseback arrangements so that
they no longer owned the asset subject to the lease, but could still
claim capital allowances. I understand that schedule 31
removes the requirement for the lessor company to own the asset and
makes provisions for ascertaining the value of an asset that may not be
on the company&#146;s balance sheet. The changes apply to all
accounting periods that end on or after 22 April 2009, and we support
the changes
proposed.</div><a name="09061678000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000299"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I, too, bid you a warm welcome to the Chair for
our deliberations this afternoon, Mr. Hood. I am grateful to
the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham for setting out what the
clause does, but let me add a little to what he has said.</div>
<a name="09061678000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sale of
lessor companies legislation, which was introduced Finance Act 2006,
prevents a potential loss of tax when a lessor company is sold. It does
that by bringing into charge an amount that reflects the difference
between the value for capital allowances purposes and the commercial
accounting value of assets that the company owns. Where the lessor
company is an intermediate lessor&#151;one that leases an asset in
from one party and leases the same asset out to another party&#151;it
may be able to claim capital allowances even though it does not own the
assets that it leases out. It therefore benefits from the capital
allowances in the same way as a lessor company that owns the assets,
but because it does not own the asset, the legislation fails to bring
the appropriate amount into charge when the company is sold.</div>
<a name="09061678000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We gather
from disclosures under the tax avoidance scheme disclosure rules that
groups have entered into sale and leaseback arrangements that turned
what was a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>head lessor&#151;a company that owned the leased asset&#151;into an
intermediate lessor before selling the lessor company. The arrangements
made it possible to sell a lessor company without incurring a schedule
10 charge, but the changes we propose will ensure that the legislation
captures an appropriate charge even when the lessor company does not
own the asset it leases.</div>
<a name="09061678000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation was first published in draft on 13 November
2008, and has been effective from that date. I am pleased to say that
HMRC has received no negative representations about it.</div>

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000300"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: that schedule 32 be the Thirty-second schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000301"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause and schedule relate to long funding
leases of plant and machinery and to anti-avoidance. Long funding
leases are a special type of lease that, following the Finance Act
2006, break with the traditional rule that the owner of the asset is
the person entitled to any capital allowances available in respect of
it. Instead, under a long funding lease, the lessee&#151;the person
to whom the asset is being leased&#151;has the right to claim
allowances.</div>
<a name="09061678000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measures in schedule 32 were announced on 13 November 2008,
just before the pre-Budget report, and seek to address the following
problems, most of which look to us like genuine loophole avoidance and
ought to be blocked. The explanatory notes to the clause, particularly
the &#147;Background Note&#148; from paragraph 38 onward, indicate
that the measures arise out of disclosure, but give only a broad
indication of the problems with key definitions such as that of sale
and leaseback.</div>
<a name="09061678000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is thought
that the offending schemes worked along the following lines. First,
before 13 November 2008, it was possible for the owner of an asset to
sell the right to future rentals from the asset, then grant a long
funding finance lease of the asset to a third party&#151;again,
usually a connected party; perhaps another group company&#151;and
then take the asset back from that third party on a long funding
operating lease under the Finance Act 2006. The combined accounting
treatment lead to the owner receiving capital allowances equal to the
market value of the asset that he was still using under the operating
lease. The mechanics of the scheme seemed to turn on the fact that, by
selling the rentals first, the net investment that has to be recognised
for accounting purposes at step 2&#151;on the grant of the finance
lease&#151;is greatly and artificially devalued. However, on taking
the asset back under the operating lease, the owner is deemed to incur
expenditure equal to the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>current market value of the assets&#151;on the one hand, the value is
being depreciated and, on the other hand, the current market value is
being used.</div>
<a name="09061678000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
where an asset had appreciated in value, it could be advantageously
sold and leased back under a long funding lease because the sale
proceeds could be limited to the unappreciated value. However, the
capital allowances under the lease back would accrue to the former
owner at the current market value, thereby giving an uplift. Thirdly,
before 13 November 2008, at the end of a lease, the asset owner could
avoid bringing any disposal value into account if a residual value
guarantee agreement was in place. Fourthly, a leasing company that is
part of a group could avoid the charge imposed under schedule 10 to the
2006 Act if it wished to leave the group by selling its assets and
leasing them back, so that it ceased to own them in that sense for tax
purposes. The book value of such a company for schedule 10 purposes was
thereby
depressed.</div><a name="09061678000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
32 will operate as follows. Paragraphs 1 to 5 prescribe the current
market value of the asset to be the disposal value on the grant of a
long funding finance lease, thereby targeting steps 1 and 2 of the
first scheme that I outlined, as well as the second scheme. The concept
of net investment is abolished. Paragraphs 6 to 8 effectively prescribe
the disposal value on lease termination for the purposes of calculating
the balancing charge, so that a disposal value has to be brought into
account regardless of any guarantee arrangement. That will put a stop
to the third
scheme.</div><a name="09061678000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
8 to 11 provide that if the capital payment made on the grant of a long
funding lease is brought into account as a disposal value, to the
extent that it is so brought into account, it will not bear income tax
under section 785C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. That
appears to be a tidying up exercise that will assist taxpayers.
Paragraphs 12 to 14 will prevent the annual investment allowance and
first year allowance being claimed by the lessees. Paragraphs 15 to 17
deal with leases made in favour of connected persons&#151;providing a
further impediment to the first scheme&#151;but they are principally
aimed at ensuring that market value is used for schedule 10 purposes
where the owner has become lessee of his own assets.
Paragraphs 18 and following repeat the exercise for plant
and machinery taken on hire purchase agreements. All in all, there is
nothing here of great controversy and I can see nothing that the
Opposition would
oppose.</div><a name="09061678000048"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000302"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
explanation and support for the clause. As he said, the schedule
introduces legislation to counter avoidance involving the leasing of
plant or machinery&#151;avoidance that was disclosed to HMRC under
the disclosure rules. The schedule also deals with a technical defect
in the Capital Allowances Act 2001 that could lead to a loss of tax
when a long funding lease ends.</div>
<a name="09061678000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The disclosed
schemes involve sale or lease and leaseback that is designed to provide
tax relief by way of capital allowances in excess of the net capital
cost of the asset to the person entering into the arrangements. As the
hon. Gentleman described, arrangements are used that result in the
disposal value brought into account for capital allowance purposes
being less than the capital allowance relief that can be claimed on
reacquisition of the asset under the leaseback. The measure deals
with that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div><a name="09061678000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
technical defect, under the long funding lease rules, a lessee is
entitled to claim tax relief for the leased plant or machinery. When
the lease ends, an adjustment may be needed to ensure that the total
relief is limited to the lessee&#146;s costs. It became apparent last
autumn that if the lease is structured in certain ways, the lessee
might obtain relief in excess of their expenditure. The measure ensures
that at the end of a long-funding lease, a lessee obtains relief for no
more and no less than the amount they paid.</div>
<a name="09061678000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
also corrects a minor flaw in the definition of sale and leaseback
transactions. It makes small changes that ensure that initial payments
under a lease are taxed in full and that ensure consistency with the
taxation of chargeable
gains.</div><a name="09061678000251"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09061678000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000303"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister might already have explained this but
what is the flaw that has been
corrected?</div><a name="09061678000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000304"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am glad to do so. As the law stands, the sale of
plant or machinery followed by a leaseback to someone connected to the
other seller who was already leasing the asset does not fall within the
existing definitions. This arrangement, although not common, could be
used to take sale and leaseback transactions outside the scope of the
existing anti-avoidance rules.</div>
<a name="09061678000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman referred to the fact that draft legislation was published on
13 November last year. As is normal with anti-avoidance rules, the main
provisions will have effect from the date of publication. The amended
definitions, the change to the taxation of an initial payment and the
amendments to the taxation of chargeable gains rules will apply from 22
April 2009, in line with the Budget date. As well as protecting the
Exchequer, early publication allowed time for comments from businesses
and their advisers. There has, however, been little comment on the
measure; no concerns about any unintended effects have been expressed
by businesses. I am grateful for hon. Members&#146; support and I ask
that the clause and schedule stand part of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000305"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: that schedule 33 be the Thirty-third schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000306"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause and schedule are the last in the series
of anti-avoidance measures. The provisions relate to long funding
leases of films and are designed to target a specific avoidance scheme.
The scheme is apparently being used by film-makers who have already
claimed capital allowances for the cost of making a film
under  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>section 42 of the Finance Act 1992, or section 48 of the Finance (No. 2)
Act 1997, or sections 138 to 140 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other
Income) Act 2005.</div>
<a name="09061678000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence,
the scheme, the success of which is disputed by HMRC, appears to have
been used in the case of films on existing leases for long periods of,
it is generally said, 15 years, at rents which are subject to tax. By
terminating the existing lease and replacing it with a long funding
finance lease, the tax treatment of the rents is greatly mitigated. Not
only that, but there is no recapture by the Revenue of the capital
allowances already given. In effect, a film-maker could recover the
cost of a film through capital allowances and still enjoy a low tax
income.</div>
<a name="09061678000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions of schedule 33 remove that treatment in respect of all long
funding finance leases granted after 13 November 2008. There is a
degree of retrospection, inasmuch as in the case of a long funding
lease granted before that date, the rentals accruing due will receive
the new tax treatment, but only for rents falling due after the 13
November cut-off.</div>
<a name="09061678000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs 1
to 3 of the schedule exclude the income tax and corporation tax
provisions normally applicable to long funding leases, when the subject
of the lease is a film and the lease is granted after 13 November 2008.
Paragraphs 4 and following exclude those treatments in the case of
pre-existing leases that continue to subsist, but only in respect of
rents falling due in periods of account commencing on or after 13
November 2008. They include transitional provisions based on time
apportionment, where a rental period straddles two periods of
account.</div><a name="09061678000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have studied the schedule and find nothing to oppose, but I look
forward to hearing whether the Minister agrees with my
explanation.</div><a name="09061678000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000307"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that the clause
introduces schedule 33, which counters avoidance involving the leasing
of films. It was introduced in response to information received by HMRC
and was announced on 13 November 2008, with draft legislation published
at the pre-Budget report. The schedule prevents avoidance that, if
unchecked, would have led to a substantial loss of tax&#151;perhaps
as much as &#163;1.5 billion over 10 or so
years.</div><a name="09061678000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000308"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This intervention is similar to the one I made this
morning. HMRC is rightly trying to recover money that should have been
paid. However, the Minister gave some annual figures for two different
schemes, then he cited, I think, prospective moneys to be recouped over
two or three years, and he has just now given us a figure for a 10-year
period&#151;the significant sum of &#163;1.5 billion.
How much of that is likely to be recouped in year 1 of those 10
years?</div><a name="09061678000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000309"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Governments have supported the film industry for a
long time. One way in which they have done so is through special
reliefs, which have allowed the acquisition costs of a qualifying
British film to be written off more quickly by the acquirers for tax
purposes. The cost of the film was often recouped by investors through
leasing out the film, so that over time the initial tax relief should
have been recovered by taxing the rental received under the leases. In
practice, most such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>investment took place via partnerships of wealthy individuals who were
able to reduce their taxable income by using the losses generated by
the write-off of the cost of the film. The investors received a timing
advantage which they would share with the film producers, giving a
benefit to the
industry.</div><a name="09061678000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
rules were abolished, and in 2007 they were replaced by a relief
focused more directly at film producers but&#151;this is the point
that the hon. Gentleman has asked about&#151;many film partnerships
remain. They can last for up to 15 years, so the clause tackles the
long-term impact of the avoidance. We estimate the tax at risk to be
&#163;90 million for 2009-10, &#163;110 million for next year,
&#163;120 million for the following year and &#163;140 million for
the year after that. It all adds up, as I have said, to about
&#163;1.5 billion over 10
years.</div><a name="09061678000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
November, HMRC became aware of a scheme that was intended to turn the
taxable lease rental income into largely untaxed rental income. That
would have been achieved by converting the leases into long funding
leases&#151;the hon. Gentleman mentioned that&#151;the income from
which, as a general rule, is largely not brought into account for tax
purposes.</div><a name="09061678000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000310"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The film industry is extremely important in my
constituency: Hammersmith is one of the bases of the UK film industry.
The film industry has told me that probably the most important thing is
certainty in the tax system. That &#163;1.5 billion seems an awful
lot of money to be recouped from anti-avoidance action on film schemes.
Has the Minister assessed the likely impact on the UK film industry?
How prevalent is the practice with which schedule 33
deals?</div><a name="09061678000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000311"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The
special reliefs that gave the initial losses were abolished in 2006.
They were replaced by a new relief, which has been in place since
January 2007. The measure that we are debating now will therefore have
no impact on the new relief, as it relates only to arrangements made
before 2006. I reassure the hon. Gentleman on the important point about
investment in the British film industry this year and in future years.
The measure will have no effect either on previous investments, other
than to ensure that the tax that should become payable over time does
indeed remain payable. I do not think that there is a problem for the
industry, although I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
benefit of certainty.</div>
<a name="09061678000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad
that the hon. Gentleman sees nothing to object to, although it may be
of interest to the Committee that HMRC has been advised informally that
the announcement of the measure last November killed the scheme
&#147;stone dead&#148; before it could be promoted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000312"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: that schedule 34 be the Thirty-fourth schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061678000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr.
Hood.</div>
<a name="09061678000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 65 and
schedule 34 deal with real estate investment trusts&#151;REITs. Those
of us who served on the Committee that considered the Bill that became
the Finance Act 2006&#151;I do not know how many here
today had the that pleasure, other than myself and my hon. Friend the
Member for Fareham&#151;will recall the legislation that introduced
REITs, which came into force in January 2007. REITs were
introduced with the intention of allowing investors to make indirect
liquid and diversified investments in real estate in a way that
attracted a similar tax treatment to direct investment. REITs were
important in that they avoided the double taxation experienced by
investors in other listed property
companies.</div><a name="09061678000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
34 contains provisions relating to the REIT regime, and I have one or
two questions for the Minister. If I may, Mr. Hood, I shall
take the opportunity to ask about certain aspects of the reform of the
REITs regime not included in the schedule, although I appreciate that
that issue will be considered in the other place and, indeed, we may
return to the REITs regime on Report.</div>
<a name="09061678000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the schedule, REITs can offer convertible,
non-voting preference shares in addition to the current categories of
permitted investments, such as ordinary share, non-voting preference
shares and convertible loan stock. It might help if the Minister were
to explain the reasons for that extension.</div>
<a name="09061678000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government announced last year that they would stop property-rich
groups such as operators of hotels, pubs and retail businesses
restructuring and converting to REITs. I understand why the Government
did that, but it is clear that the Government are not using schedule 34
to prevent conversion of landlords that let property to pubs, rather
than operate them as tied houses. Rent from pubs is to be treated as
rental income and not trading income. We have no objection to that
liberalisation, but it would be helpful if the Minister explained what
representations were made for the change, how many businesses the
Government believe will be affected, and why the change has been made,
given their steps to prevent property-rich groups from restructuring
and converting to
REITs.</div><a name="09061678000252"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
<a name="09061678000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main point
is an issue on which the Government have received
representations&#151;the requirement for REITS to distribute at least
90 per cent. of their property income annually&#151;and I know that
the British Property Federation raised it. Given the current state of
the economy, the housing market and the real estate market more widely,
and at a time when credit is not easily available through banks, is it
good stewardship to distribute 90 per cent. or more of property income
annually, as REITS are required to do? Property companies need cash at
the moment, first to strengthen their balance sheets, and secondly
because, in the event of an upturn in the property market, which may or
may not be imminent&#151;I do not want to speculate&#151;REITs will
want to buy new properties and retaining cash would be helpful to them.
In addition, the rental market is weakening, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>cash flows are under pressure, and REITs may need to build up cash
reserves to persuade lenders of their ability to sustain
borrowings.</div><a name="09061678000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such circumstances, the Government could take steps, which they have
not taken in schedule 34, to provide greater flexibility in the REIT
regime. The British Property Federation has suggested three ways in
which that could be done. First, distributions paid by a firm could be
paid in the form of new shares&#151;stock dividends&#151;and they
could count towards the mandatory distribution requirement. Secondly,
the mandatory distribution could be deferred by, for example, three
years from one year to four years. That would provide REITS with some
current flexibility. Thirdly, and perhaps less radical, because breach
of the 90 per cent. requirement results in a tax charge and the risk of
expulsion from the regime&#151;that is not automatic, but a REIT
would be vulnerable&#151;perhaps it would be possible, as a short
term measure, to consider whether breach of the 90 per cent.
requirement could simply result in a tax charge without the risk of
expulsion from the regime. The Government have received representations
on that, and perhaps the Minister will help by giving the reason for
not going down that route. We will consider returning to the matter on
Report.</div><a name="09061678000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to raise a second technical point about REITs&#151;the
anti-avoidance provisions relating to interest payments. Property
income distributions may be liable to a withholding tax, depending on
the recipient, but interest payments tend not to be liable to tax. For
that reason, which is a perfectly good one, the PFCR&#151;profit
financing cost ratio&#151;rule, which is an anti-avoidance provision,
prevents REITS from restructuring their arrangements in such a way that
distributions are made through interest. We fully understand the need
for that, but two points have been raised by the BPF in the context of
how that rule may act in a way that was not
intended.</div><a name="09061678000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
a REIT might hedge market value movements in debt with a derivative
contract. There are perfectly good commercial reasons for doing so: so
that a profit or loss involved in repaying debt is matched by a loss or
profit in a derivative contract. However, the PFCR does not take
account of any profit on debt, but does take account of matching loss
on the derivative. Consequently, the loss is counted as a financing
cost which may be considerable and cause the REIT to be in breach of
the
PFCR.</div><a name="09061678000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second circumstance in which the same thing may happen is when market
value movements in the debt and the derivatives used to hedge the debt
are deferred&#151;the costs involved are deferred until the debt or
derivative is repaid or closed out. That can have a distorting effect
because all the cost then occurs in one year. It could be that over a
period of time a derivative is entered into but the cost all
crystallises in one year, which may have a distorting effect in that
year. The effect of such distortion is that the REIT may have a penalty
charge as a consequence of entering into perfectly sensible hedging
arrangements, or of market values moving in a particular
way.</div><a name="09061678000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful to know whether the Government have looked at the
definition of financing costs and whether they would consider amending
it to address those issues. I appreciate that the Minister has not had
notice of all those points, but any light that he can shed on them
would be of benefit to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div><a name="09061678000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more general
question is about the Government&#146;s strategic vision for REITs.
When they were introduced, there were great hopes that they would take
off as a product. That they have not is not to do with failures in the
original drafting of the REIT legislation, which schedule 34 seeks to
address. These nagging concerns are perfectly reasonable, but there is
a concern that the Government are simply not addressing the REITs
regime, that it is sitting on the back burner and has not received the
focus that it might
have.</div><a name="09061678000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">REITs
have clearly worked in encouraging conversion of existing listed
commercial property companies. That has happened, but REITs have not
attracted new entrants, as was once hoped would happen. I appreciate
that this is a difficult time for the property market, but it is also
an opportunity. For example, perhaps the best way of addressing
banks&#146; holdings of unwanted exposure to properties and of
finding equity investment would be to create REITs. Indeed, there is
some evidence that in the period following a recession, which hopefully
we will be in shortly, the equivalent of REITs in countries such as
France and Japan tended to prosper. I ask whether we are prepared for
that, and whether the Government are showing sufficient flexibility in
respect of the REIT regime to benefit from what may be a considerable
opportunity.</div><a name="09061678000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point that has been made whenever we have debated REITs, certainly in
2006 and subsequently in various orders where we have amended the
regime, is that there is a great opportunity for them to become
significant players in the private residential rented sector, and that
they could provide professional management that is not always available
otherwise. There is an opportunity for greater liquidity for people who
want to invest in the private rented market rather than go down the
buy-to-let route, particularly given that the reputation of buy to let
may well have taken significant damage in recent months. There is an
opportunity there for REITs, but it may be necessary to take a more
proactive view of the
regime.</div><a name="09061678000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not a criticism of the original regime. However, organisations such
as the British Property Federation feel that more could be done to
ensure that we have an active and thriving REIT sector in the
UK.</div><a name="09061678000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061678000314"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire reminds us of 2006 when the REIT regime was introduced.
He will also remember the very strict criteria for the creation of the
real estate investment trust. There was a residential criterion, a
minimum profit distribution criterion and a criterion that the REIT had
to have a full stock exchange listing. The trust could not be a company
traded on the alternative investment market or the off-exchange market,
and it could not be a private company.</div>
<a name="09061678000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section
136A(3)(a) states that the regulations
may</div><a name="09061678000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;treat
a specified person, or a person in specified circumstances, as forming
part of a REIT
group&#148;.</div><a name="09061678000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 136A(3)(b) states that the regulations
may</div><a name="09061678000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
for a specified provision which applies in respect of members of a REIT
group also to
apply&#148;</div><a name="09061678000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
others. I want to ask the Minister whether those others, who have been
deemed to form part of a REIT group, would also be obliged to follow
the same conditions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>that have been set up for a REIT proper? I am talking about the size of
the company, the stock exchange listing, and so on and so forth. I just
want to understand for myself how someone can be deemed to be a REIT or
part of a REIT if they do not meet the other conditions that were set
out in
2006.</div><a name="09061678000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me go a little wider and ask the Minister the same question that the
hon. Gentleman just asked about the strategic vision for REITs. It was
clear at the time, I think, that because there was a requirement for
REITs to have a full listing on the stock exchange, they would tend to
buy high-yield residential and commercial property and there was less
incentive, or almost no incentive, for the small-scale investment
trusts to build in the for-profit sector rented accommodation in local
areas, which is something that I was very keen to see. I know that the
Minister at the time said that that was an issue that would be kept
under review.</div>
<a name="09061678000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister tell us whether there is an intention to remove some of the
restrictions, particularly the full stock exchange listing criterion,
to allow smaller entrants into the REIT field? The reason for that
would be to provide the core profit for housing in the private rented
sector which is so desperately needed. Moreover, it will be very
helpful if he can answer my specific question on paragraph 7 on
connected persons so I can understand how someone connected to a REIT
can be defined as part of a REIT group if they do not meet the original
criteria.</div><a name="09061678000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000315"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The origins of the UK real estate investment trust
model go back to Kate Barker&#146;s review of the housing market,
which recommended that there was merit in considering a vehicle that
was based on the US REIT model. Such a model has been introduced
elsewhere, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire rightly
mentioned, to encourage increased institutional investment in housing.
We implemented that proposal and extended its scope to include
commercial property. The main objectives of the model, which was
launched at the beginning of 2007, was to promote greater efficiency in
property investment and to provide smaller-scale investors with access
to commercial property returns.</div>
<a name="09061678000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen
that the model works well. Some 21 companies so far have announced that
they have become UK REITs, including most of the big listed UK property
companies. The scheme is still less than three years old, and we expect
other companies to join in the future, as investors become more
confident in the UK REIT
market.</div><a name="09061678000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Effectively,
the regime removes the tax distortion between investing in property
directly and investing in property indirectly by exempting both income
and gains made on property from corporation tax provided that the
company or the group meets some specified conditions.</div>
<a name="09061678000253"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="09061678000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
announced in the pre-Budget report that the Bill would amend the
conditions to be met by a company or group in the UK real estate
investment trust regime to ensure that those conditions could not be
circumvented by the artificial creation of new group structures. The
conditions include the requirement that at least 75 per cent. of total
profits must come from the rental of property to tenants. We confirmed
our intention to legislate in the Budget.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="09061678000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 34,
which is introduced by clause 65, amends part 4 of the Finance Act 2006
to introduce a power for the Treasury to make regulations concerning
the use of artificial structures to circumvent the existing UK REITs
legislation. The regulations, which are available in draft form
alongside the clause, are to be made by the affirmative procedure.
Regulations to exclude owner-occupied properties from the REITs regime
have also been made using existing powers under schedule 6 to the 2006
Act.</div><a name="09061678000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
34 also amends the 2006 Act so that section 98 of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 is disqualified for companies or groups
of companies seeking to join the REITs regime. That will allow a
business with tied premises&#151;a pub business, for
example&#151;to treat the rental income from those premises as part
of the property rental business of a REIT. Tied premises are those
where a company supplies goods to a third party for sale on a premise
that the company rents to the third party. Before the amendment, such
income would not have been treated as rental income. That created an
arbitrary barrier to the REITs regime, which schedule 34
removes.</div><a name="09061678000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, following discussions with the industry, schedule 34 makes
minor amendments to UK REITs legislation that will have effect on and
after 22 April 2009. They address some of the points raised by the
British Property Federation, although there are other points that it
wishes to promote, a number of which have been mentioned by the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire. The minor amendments allow UK
REITs to issue an additional type of share; provide a consistent
definition of asset; clarify how apportionment of funds between the
tax-exempt and non-tax-exempt part of the business should operate; and
ensure that the regime&#146;s requirements do not create unnecessary
barriers to
entry.</div><a name="09061678000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the extension to convertible preference
shares. The extension allows REITs to use such shares where they
previously could not, and is made in response to a consultation with
the industry. On the general question whether we can do more to help
REITs, it is certainly true that UK REITs, along with other parts of
the economy, are struggling in the current economic climate. We have
announced a wide range of policies to support businesses through what
is a difficult period for them and, indeed, for households. The
measures will provide help to all parts of the UK economy, and I expect
UK REITs to benefit as well. I am less certain that there is a need for
very targeted help for UK REITs beyond what we have done to support
businesses in general, but we are very happy to listen to
representations that people may wish to make to
us.</div><a name="09061678000107"></a>

revenue. The Government may therefore be able to address the issue
without a cost, so I urge the Minister to look at the matter very

Timms:</b> We will certainly be happy to look at those
representations. No amendments have been tabled, but we will, of
course, look at
proposals.</div><a name="09061678000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked why we had not relaxed the profit financing
cost ratio restriction. The restriction on gearing helps to ensure that
profits are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>available to be distributed in the first place, which helps to protect
both the Exchequer and the investor, but we will continue to talk to
the BPF on the detail of the profit financing cost ratio. He made the
point that stock dividends do not cost anything and asked whether there
had not, therefore, been an opportunity for the Government to act.
Allowing REITs to issue stock dividends as part of their mandatory
income distribution could harm some investors. For instance, any
investor who elected to receive cash would see their percentage stake
in the company reduced by those electing to receive stock. There is a
debate to be had on that proposition.</div>
<a name="09061678000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000318"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I acknowledge the Financial Secretary&#146;s
point, but does he not accept that REITs will have their own incentives
to keep investors happy and that the management of a REIT would be
careful about pursuing a route that could cause them disadvantage with
an investor, because of commercial pressures if nothing else? I
acknowledge his concern, but that flexibility would probably not result
in the management of a REIT acting recklessly, as far as the interests
of investors are concerned.</div>
<a name="09061678000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000319"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. My point
was simply that there are issues to be weighed when considering a
change of that kind, and the effect on investors is one of them. It is
not necessarily a showstopper, but it needs to be taken into
account.</div> <a name="09061678000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why the Government had not allowed deferral of part of
the distribution requirement. It is important to note that each of the
conditions of the regime is in place for good reasons. The requirement
to distribute 90 per cent. of the profits from the property rental
business within 12 months of the end of each accounting period helps to
ensure that profits are distributed to shareholders who then pay tax on
them, and it also helps to ensure that the investor gets a good
deal.</div>
<a name="09061678000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched on
the use of REITs for residential property investment, but there are
difficulties with that in the current economic environment. Doing much
about that problem would require significant changes to the regime, and
we could then run into some EU state aid difficulties, which is another
factor to be borne in
mind.</div><a name="09061678000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000320"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> All of the criteria for being a real estate
investment trust, such as the profit distribution and the residential
qualification, are met, so what EU state aid barrier could there be
that would be different for residential property than exists for
commercial
REITs?</div><a name="09061678000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000321"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The current difficulty is the cost of setting up a
REIT for investment in residential property. The model currently works
fine for commercial REITs, but there is a cost problem for setting up a
REIT for residential investment, and changing that so that is was more
attractive for residential investment could lead us into difficulties
with EU state aid. The barrier is a cost barrier, but fixing it could
cause problems with state aid. Certainly, there would have to be some
work to address that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div><a name="09061678000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Dundee, East asked whether other connected persons would be
obliged to follow the REITs conditions. We want the connected person to
be part of the existing REIT, rather than a separate REIT, so they
would not need to meet all the conditions of the regime. The purpose of
that legislation is to prevent a group artificially meeting the
requirements of the regime by bringing into the REIT any part of the
group that has been artificially removed. I hope that that is helpful

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000322"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have one brief question on clause 66. It has
something in common with clause 67, and our debate will focus on that
clause. Both clauses relate to anti-avoidance provisions. The test that
is inserted for arrangements that fall foul of those provisions is
that</div>
<a name="09061678000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the main
purpose... is the avoidance of
tax&#148;.</div><a name="09061678000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
new avoidance legislation seems to include in its main purpose test the
phrase &#147;obtaining a tax advantage&#148; or something similar.
What is the reason for the change in terminology? Is this the
terminology that we can expect to see in future in these anti-avoidance
provisions and is there not a danger of some complexity or confusion
here? The phrase &#147;the avoidance of tax&#148; seems narrower. I
do not know whether that is the
intention.</div><a name="09061678000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000323"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Clauses 66 and 67 are an interesting case. Early in
the new year, HMRC received information about a particularly abusive
avoidance scheme, which relied on deliberate default to generate
artificial liabilities, which are then set against the otherwise
taxable income of the individual concerned at a potential cost to the
Exchequer of about &#163;200 million in the first instance. So on 12
January, to head off this threat to the public finances, I issued a
ministerial statement announcing the closure of this scheme with effect
from that date.</div>
<a name="09061678000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
that announcement, HMRC received further information that a variant of
the scheme&#151;this time involving the legislation on
employment-related losses&#151;was being used to similar effect at a
potential loss to the public purse of at least &#163;200 million in
the first instance. So I took further action on 1 April, but also
effective from 12 January, to close this down. We will come to that in
the debate on the next clause.</div>
<a name="09061678000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 66
gives effect to the original 12 January statement. It works by amending
sections 346 and 555 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act
2003. As they stand, these sections allow relief to employees where
either they, or their employer on their behalf, meet the costs of
insuring against employment-related liabilities, or the actual cost of
those liabilities, such as damages relating to their jobs or legal
costs to defend against such damages.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div><a name="09061678000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The particular
scheme that clause 66 addresses took a rather tortuous route to exploit
these provisions and make sure there was no real loss to the scheme
users. The arrangements would have involved the use of a number of both
companies and trusts, some of them offshore. A key element was the
creation of a contrived employment, the duties of which included
entering into financial arrangements with another party. During the
course of the contrived employment, the individual would deliberately
default on some aspects of the financial arrangements. Under the terms
of the arrangement, this would trigger automatic damages payable by the
individual. The individual would borrow the money to pay the damages,
through a loan made by another entity in this rather complex structure,
and in reality the individual would not need to repay the
loan.</div><a name="09061678000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have gone into that in detail so the Committee has a sense of what we
are dealing with and of the degree of contrivance and
artificiality.</div><a name="09061678000254"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30pm</div><a name="09061678000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a highly abusive, completely contrived arrangement, with the sole
aim of avoiding paying the tax due to the Exchequer. We are providing
that that relief be allowed only where there are not arrangements in
place designed to avoid tax. Any real employment-related liabilities
will still be eligible for relief in the normal way.</div>
<a name="09061678000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked why the main purpose test in
the clause uses the
phrase</div><a name="09061678000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
main purpose...of which is the avoidance of
tax.&#148;</div><a name="09061678000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
most new avoidance legislation uses the tax advantage test, as he
rightly said. The main goal is to ensure that all wording is effective
in achieving its primary purpose, which we are satisfied that the
wording achieves. The words used are in keeping with those used
elsewhere, such as the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions)
Act 2003, so they are not novel.</div>
<a name="09061678000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">By taking
swift action, we are preventing exploitation of the tax system by the
schemes of a small number of wealthy people. Honest taxpayers rightly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000326"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Financial Secretary for setting out
details of the arrangements. He describes them as particularly abusive,
which is perfectly accurate given that it is a deliberate default in
relation to arrangements entered into during employment to create
employment income offsets that can reduce tax on personal income. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>It is highly contrived. I want to make it clear that we fully support
his statement that such loopholes and such contrived and artificial
arrangements should be identified quickly and blocked effectively, so
we support clauses 66 and 67 in their attempt to do that. We are
concerned about the potential retrospective element&#151;I wish to
stress that that is a narrow concern&#151;which is the purpose behind
tabling these amendments. I know that we will debate the extent to
which it is retrospective
later.</div><a name="09061678000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not the first time that the some of us have debated retrospective
taxation. On 22 May last year, I debated the issue with the Financial
Secretary&#146;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)&#151;may I say on behalf of the Opposition
that we hope that she is safe and well? A similar point was raised in
the context of double taxation treaties and retrospective provisions on
Isle of Man partnerships. It would be fair to say that the case against
the Government then was stronger than it is today, because then we
looked at retrospection going back 21 years for something that HMRC had
known about for a long time and not sought to address. One could argue
that the arrangements that we debated last year were less abusive then
the arrangements that we have today. None the less, there is a
principle to do with the nature of retrospective legislation in this
field. Last year, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree
said:</div><a name="09061678000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government understand some of the concerns about retrospectivity. It is
right to be concerned about the use of that, and it is right for the
Government to justify every
case.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Finance Public
Bill Committee, </i>22 May 2008; c.
371-372.]</div><a name="09061678000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore make no apology for raising this issue, notwithstanding the
aggressive and abusive nature of the loophole that the Government are
closing. The point is whether the announcement of 12 January 2009 to
which the Financial Secretary referred was sufficient to close the
loophole or whether this matter was not addressed effectively until 1
April
2009.</div><a name="09061678000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
debating the retrospective nature of taxation, it is customary to refer
to the Rees rules, which date back to the Finance Act 1978. The shadow
Chief Secretary of the time stated that it is important that clear and
specific warning is given prior to a Finance Act implementing any such
legislation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood
(Mr. Dorrell) went on in the early 1990s to argue that in
addition to those clear and specific warnings being given in advance,
there must be exceptional circumstances for legislation to be
retrospective. It may well be that the abusive nature of these
arrangements and the considerable potential cost to the Exchequer are
exceptional
circumstances.</div><a name="09061678000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will turn to what the Government said in considering whether the Rees
rule was met. In the press release of 12 January 2009, HMRC
stated:</div><a name="09061678000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
specific avoidance arrangements of which the government is aware aim to
exploit the provisions of sections 346 to 348 and 555 to 559 Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003,
(ITEPA).&#148;</div><a name="09061678000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
references are picked up in clause 66, which we debated earlier.
Paragraph 9 of the press release
states:</div><a name="09061678000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
specific avoidance arrangements being countered are outlined above but
the government is aware that it might be possible to use different
structures to achieve a similar outcome. As a result the proposed
legislation will deny any deduction under section 346 or section 555
ITEPA where the liability in respect of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>which the deduction would otherwise be due has been paid in connection
with arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of
which is the avoidance of
tax.&#148;</div><a name="09061678000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
press release, which reflects the Financial Secretary&#146;s written
statement, highlights certain specific arrangements and broadens it
further. However, it does not broaden the identification of the scheme
used in the loophole as widely as the subsequent press release and
technical note of 1 April 2009, to which the Minister
referred.</div><a name="09061678000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
press release announced further action and was entitled
&#147;Government taking further action to prevent artificial
avoidance schemes&#148;. Having outlined the contents of the January
provisions, in paragraph 5 the technical note goes on to
state:</div><a name="09061678000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is aware of a similar scheme or schemes that seek to exploit
S11 ITEPA 2003 and S128 ITA
2007.&#148;</div><a name="09061678000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essential point is that we are concerned about backdating those
anti-avoidance provisions to 12 January, when that announcement
addressed certain specific arrangements; indeed it slightly broadened
it out to beyond the arrangements of which it was aware, but was not as
broad as the 1 April arrangements. We consider that the risks of
retrospective legislation are very considerable. That is important as
it damages stability and certainty in the UK tax system. If we have a
tax system that is unpredictable, it undermines confidence. We are
therefore concerned that by backdating the effect of clause 67 to 12
January as opposed to 1 April, the Government are going beyond what we
accept as allowable under the Rees rules, the Dorrell doctrine and,
indeed, by the statement made by the former Paymaster General, the
right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo). In December
2004, she referred to remuneration planning, an area where there has
been retrospective legislation for some time. This would appear to be
broader than that and my attention has been drawn to comments made by
the right hon. Lady on 6 June 2006. I interpret her remarks
to mean that the approach to remuneration planning applied merely to
the extraction from a company of income otherwise taxable in the form
that was rendered free of national insurance, PAYE and income tax. I do
not think that this is quite what we have here, so we are concerned
about these provisions.</div>
<a name="09061678000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
take this opportunity to ask the Minister where the Government stand on
retrospectivity in general. In what circumstances do the Government
consider that a retrospective provision is justified? Does the Minister
recognise that there is a risk that HMRC may use this as a fallback
against its mistakes? That was very much the nature of our case last
year on partnership income and Isle of Man partnerships. HMRC should
have addressed that matter much earlier and it sought to address it
through retrospective legislation. What constraints are there on the
use of retrospective legislation and do the Government recognise that
there are problems caused to the UK tax system if it is overused? It
may well be that the Minister&#146;s remarks today can provide some
reassurance, but it would be a damaging attribute to our tax system if
there was frequent use of retrospective legislation in this
area.</div>
<a name="09061678000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
specifically, on clause 67 and amendments 73 and 74, may I ask the
Minister why the announcement on 12 January was thought to cover more
than that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>which is specifically mentioned in that announcement? I suppose the
question that should be asked is why section 11 was not mentioned in
it. How does the Minister justify including section 11 in something
that was not mentioned for another two and a half months or so? With
those questions&#151;I have tried to present this case in a probing
manner&#151;I have to warn the Financial Secretary that we may well
seek to divide the Committee. We are concerned about this use of
retrospective legislation. We are not convinced by what we have heard
so far that the Government are fully justified in dating the provisions
back to 12 January rather than 1 April, notwithstanding the fact that
the Government are absolutely right to seek to close that
loophole.</div>

Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): May I say what a
pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood? I
am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on the clause, and I
congratulate my Front Bench colleagues on emphasising its importance.
It seems to me to be one of the most disturbing clauses in the Bill,
not least for the wider reasons. My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire made the point that an announcement on certain
issues was made on 12 January 2009&#151;indeed, I am told
that it was made clear that the rules would not apply to payments made
after the date of the announcement&#151;and the industry ceased to
use the scheme. That is the information that I have received.</div>
<a name="09061678000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The crime
comes when we consider the announcement of 1 April 2009, when the
Government widened the scope of the provision, and did so respectively
and without notice. It is said that the measure will impact upon only
600 people, but retrospective legislation that impacts upon one person,
particularly in such an activity, is not good enough. For 600 people,
of course it is not good enough. However, it is the wider questions of
perception and the breaking of what many businesses see as a genuine
understanding between business and the Department that is the real
danger inherent in the provisions.</div>
<a name="09061678000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the hard-working people of the Treasury are keen to protect the
interests of the Government and the nation by stopping tax avoidance.
To most people, tax avoidance is unacceptable. I would love to get
certain people who live on certain islands and then, through their own
newspaper organs, make their own moral judgments, and many Members of
the House would agree. In this instance, however, we are not talking
about the normal practice of announcing a measure and giving people due
warning. We are talking about the Department making an announcement,
with no warning, of a measure that would be used retrospectively.
Therein lies our concern.</div>
<a name="09061678000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">To date, it
has been generally accepted practice to apply retrospective tax
legislation only when HMRC has announced that it will do so. It is that
element that has been broken in the clause. I do not need to tell the
Committee that retrospective legislation is bad legislation, no matter
what the issue, as it is a fundamental requirement that legal
frameworks should provide certainty for individual behaviour at the
point when that behaviour takes place and not retrospectively. That is
generally accepted as good, fair and proper government. It is the
undermining of that concept that is so damaging in the wider
sense.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div><a name="09061678000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
question of perspective that concerns me immensely. I come from a world
where certainty is vital&#151;the business world. I come from a world
that believes that treatment between business and the Department is
fair and proper. Action of this sort undermines that concept. If it
happens more and more, business will begin to think that it cannot
trust the Department, and therein lies the real danger. The perception
of HMRC itself is under threat when the Government decide to act
retrospectively in such a fashion. I recognise that accountants rarely
take perception into account, but business men do, because the
perception of their business is vital to the well-being of their
customers. That is the point that I fear the Treasury is unable to
grasp, and which I would particularly like the Minister to
address.</div><a name="09061678000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government tell us that the measure will prevent a loss to the economy
of some &#163;200 million. That is pure accountancy talk; it fails to
take into account the image of this country doing good and fair
business. It is another little brick in that wall that will prevent
more and more people from wanting to do business here. What assessment
has there been of the impact on people who might want to come to the UK
to do business, but might be put off by the thought that they could be
taxed retrospectively without their knowledge? That also needs to be
taken into
account.</div><a name="09061678000154"></a>

to end contrived avoidance schemes. The scheme to which clause 68 is
addressed is seriously contrived, and I am sure that when the Minister
gets to his feet later, he will have a similar description of the
scheme relevant to clause 67. However, I also share the general
concerns about retrospectivity. I could have made this argument under
any number of the clauses, but I am doing it here because it allows me
to raise another matter. I hope that I am not out of order,

thing that we need to do to avoid retrospective taxation&#151;the

and advisers tell them is within the law, but which ends up being
subject to retrospective legislation days, weeks or even a few months
after the commencement of the scheme. That is the point that I wanted
to raise in relation to clause 67. Instead of giving post-commencement
notification to HMRC, would it not be far better if those engaged in
tax and financial planning and management could have pre-commencement
approval 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>of schemes, so that they knew that everything they were doing was on the
straight and narrow and that they would not then be subject to a large
amount of retrospective legislation? Most important, people wishing to
use the services of those providing tax and financial planning and
advice would then be able to do so with the confidence that they would
not fall into schemes that were legal when they handed over the cash,
but which ended up being illegal very soon thereafter due to
retrospective
taxation.</div><a name="09061678000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that I was well wide of the mark, Mr. Hood, but
there was no other way I could go. I hope that the Minister will tell
us why we do not have pre-commencement approval and why we only have
post-commencement
notification.</div><a name="09061678000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000331"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> As I said, following the action we took in January,
we discovered that a highly similar scheme was set up by the same
provider, using the same approach and aimed at exactly the same people.
The scheme used a loss like that referred to in the clause 66 scheme,
which is created by an act of deliberate default during the course of a
contrived employment, to exploit the provisions of section 128 of the
Income Tax Act 2007. That allows employees to claim loss relief in
certain circumstances where that loss arises from the conditions of
their employment.</div>
<a name="09061678000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will run
through the measure again. Some of what I say will seem familiar
because of the close similarity between the arrangements that clause 66
addresses and the arrangements that clause 67
tackles.</div><a name="09061678000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scheme that clause 67 addresses used a number of
entities&#151;companies and trusts, some of which may be offshore. A
key element is the creation, again, of a contrived employment, the
duties of which cover financial arrangements with another party. During
the course of the employment, the individual would deliberately default
with regard to one or more aspects of the financial arrangements. Under
the terms of the arrangement, that would trigger automatic damages
payable by the employer that the individual was obliged to share by
virtue of their contract of employment. The individual would borrow the
money to pay the damages, not through a normal commercial loan from a
high street bank or some other lender, but from another entity in the
structure. The individual would not in reality repay the loan and, as a
result, they would suffer no genuine loss in paying the sum designated
as damages&#151;indeed, the only real cost the individual would
suffer is the cost of buying entry to the
scheme.</div><a name="09061678000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000332"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I recognise that there is a clear similarity
between the section 11 schemes and those schemes identified on 12
January. Does the Financial Secretary also accept that clause 67 will
apply to any arrangement that uses section 11 of the Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, whether it is in relation to an
employment loss that arises from a deliberate default or otherwise? I
accept that a particular scheme caused HMRC, or the Minister, to make
an announcement on 1 April, but the clause is somewhat broader than
that and has a retrospective effect. I do not know whether any schemes
are caught up as a consequence, but the similarity point is not a
clinching argument because the application of clause 67 is broader and
applies to schemes that are not quite so
similar.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div><a name="09061678000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000333"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think the similarity is striking. In a moment, I
will explain how that affects the argument. I am confident that clause
67 will not damage proper and appropriate uses of the provisions
already in legislation. Let me just go a little further.</div>
<a name="09061678000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
arrangements that I have described, the individual would claim that
they are entitled to deduct the amount of the damages from their
income, because the damages rank as a liability that was incurred when
acting in the capacity of an
employee.</div><a name="09061678000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
general theme of artificial loss creation has been a common feature of
tax avoidance for some years, with people wanting to shelter income and
gains from tax. A number of previous arrangements around that general
theme, but using different parts of tax legislation, have already been
closed down. The avoidance that the Government are moving to close down
with clause 67 is the individual seeking tax relief against genuine
income for a contrived loss that the individual never actually
suffered. I acted on 1 April to do that. Because it is a variant on the
loophole we closed on 12 January and featured the same individuals, we
made it effective from 12
January.</div><a name="09061678000256"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09061678000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked how targeted clause 67
is. I do not think that it is broadly drawn. The intention is to ensure
that it will not be necessary to seek further legislation if more
schemes involving claims for loss relief under the 2007 Act are
devised. It will also remove any doubt about our view of loss relief
claims that are contrived in that
way.</div><a name="09061678000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000334"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Perhaps I am approaching the matter from a
different angle, but if the Minister is arguing that there was great
similarity, why were section 11 arrangements not picked up on 12
January? Was any consideration given to doing so, or did it come as a
surprise to HMRC that there was a way, as the Minister sees it, of
achieving the same aim through the other provisions to which we
referred?</div><a name="09061678000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000335"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We did not know on 12 January about the device to
which the statement of 1 April refers. Information about that
arrangement emerged later through a disclosure. I accept that the fine
detail of the second scheme is somewhat different from that of the
first, but the underlying approach is the same. Both schemes depend on
the use of deliberate default to trigger artificial liabilities or
losses for which relief would be claimed under legislation intended to
provide relief for exceptional circumstances of genuine employment
liabilities or losses. The people subscribing to the scheme would have
known exactly what they were entering into when they decided to do
so.</div><a name="09061678000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061678000336"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): The Minister is giving a
helpful explanation. What is his estimate of the potential cost to the
Exchequer were the Government to be defeated on any vote on the clause
or the amendments to
it?</div><a name="09061678000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000337"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It would be &#163;200 million&#151;precisely
the same as if clause 66 was not included in the Bill, because it deals
with the same kind of avoidance targeted at precisely the same people
by the same promoter who,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>having been thwarted by the announcement of 12 January, would, if
allowed to do so, have simply switched all their customers into the
device that clause 67
addresses.</div><a name="09061678000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000338"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I assume that the &#163;200 million is an annual
figure. If that is the case, is there any expectation that the figure
would in time come down, or would others see the opportunity to exploit
the same loopholes and, for example, make the aggregate figure over the
lifetime of the next Parliament more than &#163;1 billion, rather
than just &#163;200 million multiplied by
five?</div><a name="09061678000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000339"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We are getting into speculation, but if all those
people got away with avoiding &#163;200 million-worth of tax, it is
entirely possible that the promoter would find that other people were
attracted to use the same device and that the loss would
increase.</div><a name="09061678000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000340"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We are talking about the period from 12
January to 1 April, so we are not talking about ongoing costs. Surely
this is a one-off hit. I understand that the Government rightly believe
that the scheme was a fraud arrangement anyway and want to avoid the
uncertainty.</div><a name="09061678000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000341"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I was asked what would be the cost if clause 67 did
not appear in the legislation, and that is the question I answered. A
separate question is what would be the loss to the Exchequer if
amendments 73 and 74 were agreed. The answer to that is &#163;200
million. That would be a one-off
loss.</div><a name="09061678000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
73 and 74 would ensure that clause 67 did not take effect until 1
April. The backdating of the clause was essential to preserve the
intent and effect of the January announcement. The scheme, unlike the
first, came to our notice through the disclosure regime. It was
sufficiently advanced at that point that, had we not backdated the
clause, we would have put at risk the entire &#163;200 million
protected by the clause and the announcement of 12 January, because all
those individuals who had moved to the new variant scheme prior to
1 April would have been able to crystallise the artificial
losses to claim against their real taxable
income.</div>
<a name="09061678000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000342"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will the Financial Secretary give
way?</div><a name="09061678000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000343"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will. I was just about to come to the point the
hon. Gentleman made in his
speech.</div><a name="09061678000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000344"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Financial Secretary has just used the phrase
&#147;would have put at risk&#148;, but what does that actually
mean? Does it mean that he is not sure whether it is &#163;200
million at risk or
not?</div><a name="09061678000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000345"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> There is of course a degree of uncertainty about
that, depending upon precisely who had taken advantage of the scheme
and made a claim accordingly, but &#163;200 million is our best
estimate, soundly based, of the loss to the Exchequer if the backdating
had not occurred. The hon. Gentleman said that was disturbing and that
about 600 people were involved&#151;a figure I had not heard, but he
might well have information to which I do not have access on how many
are affected. I hope that, on reflection, he would find it far more
disturbing if those 600 people, having had their large-scale 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>tax avoidance thwarted by my announcement of 12 January, were
able simply to switch across to that other, equally contrived and
similar scam and obtain their &#163;200 million between them as a
result. That would be much more disturbing than the measure we have
announced. I have seen correspondence from the promoters of the scheme
rather echoing his points and suggesting that it really was not cricket
for the Government to act in that way. I must tell the Committee that,
where abusive tax avoidance is being promoted, we will take action to
block it and will do so time and
again.</div><a name="09061678000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000346"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> There is nothing at all in the amendment that
stops the avoidance process of the scheme the Financial Secretary is
talking about. It is simply the concept of the provision being a
retrospective reaction to the matter, which has much wider implications
than the scheme he is talking about. There are many examples of
circumstances in which people in this country feel that others are
avoiding tax unfairly&#151;I alluded to one, but there are many
others. There is a bigger principle, and that is that HMRC is seen to
be acting fairly and decently and not retrospectively, which is not
seen as fair and decent in the main. One could still stop the scheme
but keep one&#146;s honour, and that, too, has
relevance.</div><a name="09061678000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000347"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I can certainly reassure the hon. Gentleman that
HMRC&#146;s action has been fair. He is arguing for bolting the
stable door after the horse has bolted, but that would indeed have led
to a loss in revenue of &#163;200 million. Had there been
no retrospection when closing down the scheme, those 600 people, if
that figure is correct, would have been able to make off with that sum.
That is unfair. That is what honest taxpayers are worried about. They
are worried that people who know exactly what they are doing and are
who employ the services of highly paid advisers to devise those
ingenious schemes are, by that route, avoiding paying tax like the rest
of us.</div>
<a name="09061678000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061678000348"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I am struggling with a
couple of questions for my right hon. Friend. First, what sort of fees
must have been payable to those who devised such a contrivance? We must
be wondering whether those people deserve our sympathies as widows and
orphans seeking relief from the taxpayer. Secondly, does he believe
that that type of activity bears any resemblance to the honest business
activity referred to by the hon. Member for Northampton,
South?</div><a name="09061678000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000349"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We are talking
about a scam. The people who promoted it know exactly what they are
doing and the people who wished to use the scam knew exactly what they
were doing. I am sure that he is right and that substantial fees were
paid or were due to be paid&#151;I do not know how far the payments
had gone. One can only surmise that it would have been some proportion
of the &#163;200 million. I would suggest that between 5 and 10 per
cent. would have been the likely fee, so the promoters stood to gain
perhaps &#163;10 million to &#163;20 million from having
facilitated a very substantial tax avoidance
scam.</div><a name="09061678000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000350"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Although I share the Minister&#146;s view
that the scheme is a scam and I would much prefer that the Treasury had
the &#163;200 million of additional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>revenue, particularly in these straitened times for the public finances,
would he not agree that the hon. Member for Northampton, South holds
his view with great integrity? He should not feel inhibited, and nor
should his colleagues, about voting for these amendments merely because
Labour Back Benchers choose to describe them in those unfavourable
terms.</div><a name="09061678000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000351"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> That is a matter for judgment by Opposition
Members. We will wait with
interest&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div><a name="09061678000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000352"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sure we are all interested in
hearing what the Minister has to say, not what each other is
saying.</div><a name="09061678000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000353"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood. We shall certainly
wait with interest to see what Opposition Members
decide.</div><a name="09061678000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northampton, South said that he wants certainty. He can
be absolutely certain that when we find out about an abusive scam we
will shut it down. Anyone who is interested in participating in such an
arrangement can be certain of that. My hon. Friend the Member for South
Derbyshire is right such arrangements have nothing whatever to do with
the provision of a good and fair business environment in the UK. We are
committed to that and everybody knows that we take a very dim view of
tax
avoidance.</div><a name="09061678000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acted on 1 April to make it clear that the second version of the scheme
covered by clause 66 was equally unacceptable. Just like the scheme we
closed on 12 January, it relies on abusive and contrived
actions over a short period which ignore fiduciary duty to get a tax
advantage. It would have been deeply unfair to have allowed that scam
to proceed. The Government&#146;s response to the second scheme is
reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. There is a degree of
retrospection here&#151;that is perfectly correct. I hope that the
Committee will accept that that retrospection was justified in the
circumstances.</div>
<a name="09061678000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ensured
that all the relevant legal considerations were taken into account,
including the Rees rules, the similarities between both schemes, the
need to protect the human rights of potential users and previous
announcements. In that respect we took account of the announcement on
12 January and the ministerial statement made the following day, as
well as the statement made by the then Paymaster General, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Bristol, South, on 2 December 2004, which was
referred to by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="09061678000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000354"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will the Minister give way
again?</div><a name="09061678000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000355"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me just say a couple of words about that
statement. My right hon. Friend&#146;s statement in 2004 warned that
where we became aware of arrangements that attempt to frustrate our
intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of
tax, we would introduce legislation to close them down, where necessary
from 2 December 2004. It therefore remains the Government&#146;s view
that in rare cases like this it is appropriate for us to act
retrospectively to make sure that abusive schemes are closed down
rapidly and effectively. That takes account of the doctrine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>named after the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who recognised that
retrospective legislation should be introduced only in exceptional
circumstances and only where the Government consider such action to be
necessary to protect the general body of taxpayers. I agree with that
view, and this measure is certainly consistent with those criteria. We
have met the Rees rules, the Dorrell doctrine and perhaps what we
should refer to as the Primarolo doctrine as
well.</div>
<a name="09061678000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000356"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Try to be more
alliterative.</div><a name="09061678000257"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09061678000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000357"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I shall now try to create the Binley doctrine,
with your permission, Mr. Hood. We have a situation in which
the Government, rightly and properly, are intent on cutting back on
those people who act outside the rules of decency by avoiding tax. The
Minister calls such behaviour a scam, which is a bit subjective,
bearing in mind that it must have been legal or there would not have
been a need for this particular piece of legislation. Can I assume,
therefore, that we need many more retrospective pieces of action should
similar so-called scams turn up in the
future?</div><a name="09061678000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000358"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
accuses me of failing to achieve consistent alliteration. He is right;
I should have referred to the Primarolo principles. I did not entirely
understand the question that the hon. Member for Northampton, South
asked. If his question is whether we would act similarly again in
similar circumstances, the answer is most certainly yes. Anyone who
thinks of promoting or taking part in such arrangements needs to
understand very clearly that the Government take an extremely dim view
of those arrangements and are determined to close them down, as we
successfully did in this case.</div>
<a name="09061678000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Dundee, East asked me about pre-commencement approval. There
is provision for that in code of practice 10. Taxpayers can ask about
the HMRC view of arrangements before they decide to go ahead with
implementing them. That alerts taxpayers to note that HMRC may take
action against their proposal. If anyone is in doubt, they can seek
clarification.</div>
<a name="09061678000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000359"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The Minister said earlier that the scheme that he
was talking about had been disclosed. Now he talks about taxpayers
being able to check out schemes that they may enter into, and that is
all good and well, but can I confirm that promoters are able to seek
confirmation of the schemes in advance, or is it only in
post-commencement notification that some of the difficulty may
arise?</div><a name="09061678000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000360"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Promoters can seek that clearance as well. They are
required to disclose, but they can seek clearance if they
wish.</div><a name="09061678000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000361"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Can the Minister tell the Committee the date on
which the promoters first started to market the scheme? It appears from
what he says, or we can surmise, that it was after 12 January, in the
sense that it was an innovation to the scheme that was outlawed on
12 January. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>At what point was it notified to HMRC? We know that HMRC took action on
1 April, but it might be helpful to the Committee if we knew the other
dates.</div><a name="09061678000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000362"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s surmise is
correct. It must have been after 12 January and before 1 April. I do
not have the precise date in front of me. I am not sure whether we know
it. As far as I am aware, the disclosure took place properly, in
accordance with the requirements of the rules.</div>
<a name="09061678000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, this was
a completely artificial and contrived arrangement. It was clear to both
the promoters and to anyone who was considering taking advantage of the
scheme that it was open to abuse. It was essential to backdate the
effectiveness of this measure to 12 January. Otherwise, people could
have taken advantage of this very big tax avoidance opportunity. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendments and that
the Committee will agree that clause 67 stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061678000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000363"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Financial Secretary defended the
Government&#146;s position with much vigour, as we would expect, but
I am slightly disappointed in his response. I shall look in general at
retrospective legislation in this area before turning to the specific
case in front of us, because a balance needs to be achieved between
creating certainty within the tax system and the desire that the
Minister rightly expresses to close down scams as quickly as possible.
As I said earlier, we enthusiastically support the Government&#146;s
attempts to close down these scams. There is a balance to be achieved;
there is a tension.</div>
<a name="09061678000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
argument, as the Minister knows, as to whether this scheme falls within
the scope of the Primarolo principles. It can be argued, as I did
earlier, that that is too narrow to encompass this particular scheme,
although I appreciate that there is an alternative view. He is right to
say that this scheme is very similar to that identified on 12 January,
although as I understand it the 1 April provisions could capture some
schemes that are quite dissimilar from those identified on 12 January.
He is also right to say, as I acknowledged from the beginning, that
this is a particularly abusive scheme, and that there is clearly a
substantial cost to the Exchequer.</div>
<a name="09061678000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed that we did not get an answer on the Government&#146;s
general approach to retrospective legislation. As I said earlier, I
thought that the legislation that we had in front of us last year was
stronger ground to make the case against retrospective legislation than
the scheme that we are debating today. In those circumstances, with
some concern at the failure of the Government to address the wider
issue of retrospectivity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000364"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have a couple of questions about
clause 69, which takes us into the rather arcane and
complicated world of the taxation of goodwill and intellectual
property. The clause seeks to deny tax relief for deductions derived
from the amortisation of goodwill arising and recognised for accounting
on the purchase of a business from an unrelated
party.</div><a name="09061678000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I
am wrong&#151;the perceived mischief that these new provisions aim to
thwart is transactions involving the sale of businesses between related
parties, with the recognition of goodwill on acquisition by the
purchaser. The purchaser would then no doubt claim deductible
amortisation for tax purposes by writing down the purchased goodwill. I
know that there is a view that the clause is unnecessary because the
goodwill would not exist in the accounts or for tax purposes prior to
the acquisition; that internally generated goodwill is prohibited by
accounting standards and therefore the clause is not
necessary.</div><a name="09061678000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister could say why the clause is
necessary. It has a particular effect where the transaction involves a
purchaser and the seller that are related. Are there concerns that the
same mischief could occur between unrelated parties? To reiterate, is
the clause really necessary at all? I think that this is one of those
cases where the provision is there for the avoidance of doubt. However,
if the Minister will elaborate on that point, we shall be
grateful.</div>
<a name="09061678000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000365"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Clause 69 introduces legislation to confirm the tax
treatment of goodwill by the corporate intangible fixed asset regime.
The rules for the taxation of corporate intangible assets were
introduced in the Finance Act 2002 after widespread
consultation and they were widely welcomed by businesses. However, some
companies acquiring a business carried on prior to 1 April 2002 by a
related party have been incorrectly claiming relief for goodwill where
none is
available.</div><a name="09061678000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman was suggesting, that is the reason for changing the
rules. The legislation is being clarified to put what HMRC believes to
be the correct interpretation of the law beyond doubt, because some
people have doubted it. HMRC does not accept that such relief as has
been claimed is, in fact, available. The regime treats goodwill of a
business carried on by a related party prior to 1 April 2002 as a
pre-existing asset. It is brought into the regime only if and when the
business is acquired by an unrelated third party.</div>
<a name="09061678000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC will
continue to challenge past claims that some companies have tried to
make for relief, if necessary through the courts. To complement
HMRC&#146;s operational response to the problem, the clause confirms
that the corporate intangible asset rules function as intended and it
aims to put beyond doubt the correct interpretation.</div>
<a name="09061678000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69
should safeguard up to &#163;2 billion worth of future tax revenue
spread over the next 20 years, and I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000366"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I beg to move amendment 213, in
clause 70, page 34, line 24, leave
out &#145;section 105A&#146; and insert &#145;sections 105A and
105B&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div><a name="09061678000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000367"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this, it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 214 to
216.</div><a name="09061678000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000368"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The amendments are required to ensure that the full
amount of a lease premium, payable in respect of a lease term up to a
maximum of 10 years, is spread evenly across the term of the lease for
the purposes of calculating the living accommodation benefit in kind
charge.</div><a name="09061678000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the Budget, we announced our intention to change the rules for taxing
the benefit in kind charge, where employees are provided with living
accommodation as a result of their employment, to stop attempts to
avoid tax through payment of a lease premium rather than the full
market rent for the use of the accommodation.</div>
<a name="09061678000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70
introduces a rule that means that the value of a lease premium, payable
in respect of a lease of 10 years or less, will be taken
into account when calculating the benefit in kind charge. The clause
contains an anti-avoidance provision to prevent manipulation of the new
rules by entering into a lease with an artificial term of more than 10
years and inserting an earlier break
clause.</div><a name="09061678000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in cases involving leases with a break clause that is not exercised,
the legislation will not spread the value of the lease premium across
the term of the lease. In certain cases, it may not operate to bring
the full value of the lease premium into charge in any taxable
period.</div><a name="09061678000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments ensure that the new rules for taxing the living
accommodation benefit in kind charge operate as intended to bring into
charge the full value of a lease premium and to spread it evenly across
the term of the lease. Without the amendments, it would be
straightforward to structure a lease premium arrangement in such a way
that only a small proportion of the lease premium payable would fall to
be taxed under the new
rules.</div><a name="09061678000258"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000369"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We fully appreciate the thinking behind clause 70
and the amendments that the Financial Secretary explained. We agree
that, but for the amendments, it would be relatively easy to avoid the
purpose of the clause, but I have a couple of questions. First, what is
the cost to the Exchequer of the existing loophole historically and in
future? Secondly, will the Financial Secretary explain the reason for
10 years? I realise that there must be a limit, but I would be grateful
to know what the thinking was that caused the Government to settle on
10 years as the necessary
test.</div><a name="09061678000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Living
accommodation is a significant cost in bringing internationally mobile
employees to the UK, and that goes back to the point that I raised
about the saving that will arise from the clause and the amendments. I
do not have many comments to make, and I can pick them up on stand part
if you are happy with that, Mr. Hood, but if the amount of
revenue from additional tax on mainly internationally mobile employees
is likely to be substantial in the context of a rise in higher rate
income tax, has the Treasury or HMRC assessed what it is likely to be?
That raises questions about the overall ability of the UK and
specifically the City to attract internationally mobile employees, and
whether there is any concern that in some small way the tax burden on
them will increase, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>thus making the UK less attractive to those employees and damaging the
competitiveness of the UK and specifically the City. I do not want to
make an issue of that, but I would be interested to know whether any
assessment has been
made.</div><a name="09061678000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000370"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The estimate is that the clause will protect
&#163;45 million of revenue in the current
year.</div><a name="09061678000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000371"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am sorry to intervene before the Financial
Secretary has got going. Within that &#163;45 million, does he have
any idea of how many individuals will be affected so that we can have
an assessment per person?</div>
<a name="09061678000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000372"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> HMRC may well have an estimate, but I do not have
it in front of me. If the matter is drawn to my attention, I will
certainly let the hon. Gentleman know what it is. He is right about the
sort of people about whom we are talking. The truth is that everyone
knows what the rules are, and that tax should be paid, but it has
become apparent that arrangements are entered into involving a front
payment lease premium and a small rent to reduce tax. That arrangement
is artificial, and I do not believe that closing the loophole will have
a material impact on UK
competitiveness.</div><a name="09061678000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think I understood correctly that the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire asked about leases of different lengths. When a lease is
less than 10 years with a break clause, the same rules apply. When it
contains a relevant break clause that is not exercised, the new rules
in the amendments will deem that, for the purposes of the legislation,
a separate, notional lease had started immediately after the time at
which the original lease would have ended had the break clause been
exercised. The lease premium payment will be spread across the full
terms of the original and notional leases, which would not have been
the case under the Bill as drafted. Without the amendments, the total
lease premium payment for the full original term of the lease would be
spread across the shorter period to the date of the break clause
whether or not it was exercised. That is unintended, and the amendments
ensure that the new rules apply as
intended.</div><a name="09061678000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the numbers affected. I cannot give the full
number, but the costing was based on 47 cases of individuals employed
by 19 companies using those arrangements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000373"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for that information, but it suggests
a sum of about &#163;1 million per person, which seems
extraordinarily high, and I cannot believe that it is right. I do not
know whether that is a sample from which the figures were extrapolated,
but if we are talking about &#163;1 million per person, it is quite a
consideration.</div><a name="09061678000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061678000374"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My advice is that the costings are based on 47
cases of 19 trusts gaining a tax advantage. They are based on actual
cases in which employers have used the lease premium arrangements, and
the estimate that I gave does not involve extrapolating from those
cases to assume higher levels of tax avoidance. We are indeed
