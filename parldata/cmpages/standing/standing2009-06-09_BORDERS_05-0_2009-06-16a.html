<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000279"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Anyway, I welcome you all and I am sure we shall
continue to make progress. Before we begin, however, I inform the
Committee that Officers of the House, printers, Ministers and Members
of Parliament are not infallible. There was a printing mistake on the
amendment paper before the Committee at its first sitting. The
resolution agreed by the Programming Sub-Committee, which I chaired,
stated that the Committee should meet at 4.00 pm this afternoon, rather
than 4.30 pm. Unfortunately, the motion before the Committee
at its first meeting stated 4.30 pm. I am, however, very much of the
view that although we have strict procedures in this place, flexibility
when agreed across the Floor by the usual channels and Back-Bench
Members can prevail. I understand that there is an agreement between
the usual channels that they would like to return to the
4.00 pm start time this afternoon. To get things utterly
correct, therefore, I invite the Minister to move a motion amending the
Programme Order
accordingly.</div><a name="09061647000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">Ordered&#151;</div><a name="09061647000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">That

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000280"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is extremely satisfactory. We can now
proceed with the Bill. We have reached clause 48, and I have selected
amendment 56 in the name of the hon. Gentleman from that
famous constituency of Ashford.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div><a name="09061647000010"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
48</h4><a name="09061647000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Good
character
requirement</div><a name="09061647000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000281"></a><b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): I beg to move
amendment 56, in clause 48, page 39, line 3, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) In this
section a person is not considered of good character if they have been
convicted of any offence that is triable on
indictment.&#146;.</div><a name="09061647000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to explore one of the slightly unclear
notions on the face of the Bill by inserting a new subsection (4A). I
wish to explore what the Minister means, and what the legislation
purports to mean, by &#147;of good character,&#148; because that
underlies one of the key points of this part of the Bill on
citizenship. I think it would clearly be uncontroversial across the
Committee that people who are to be granted British citizenship should
be of good character, so it is worth while for us to have a debate on
what constitutes being of good
character.</div><a name="09061647000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background illustrates why the debate is so important: over the past 12
years under the Government, the number of grants of citizenship is at
an all-time high. The number has more or less quadrupled since 1997;
indeed, in 2007, the last year for which figures are available, the
annual increase was itself 7 per cent. and the number was 164,635. By
comparison, only 37,010 people were granted citizenship in
1997.</div>
<a name="09061647000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not for
the Committee, while debating the amendment, to discuss whether that is
a good or bad thing. However, from the tone of everything the Minister
has said during our Committee debates and, indeed, since he became the
Minister for Borders and Immigration, I imagine that he thinks that
percentage is too much and that he is trying to slow down the flow.
Indeed, this part of the Bill makes the process more difficult, as
evinced by many of the protests that we are getting from people who
will find it so.</div>
<a name="09061647000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some
extent, we can regard this part of the Bill as the Government slightly
belatedly addressing the fact that the current test and regulations may
not have fulfilled all the criteria that the Minister would
want&#151;or, indeed, that many others would want. The specific
purpose of our amendment is to cover anyone who has been convicted of a
serious offence, to ensure that they cannot be defined as being of good
character and, therefore, eligible for a grant of
citizenship.</div>
<a name="09061647000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">A new British
passport is granted every five minutes these days&#151;that is what
those figures mean in time terms&#151;so we need to be absolutely
sure that every one of those new passports goes to someone who will
play a positive role in the life of this country. I assume that the
Minister agrees that anyone convicted of a serious crime would not be
covered under any definition of good character, so our amendment has
the wording,</div>
<a name="09061647000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any offence
that is triable on
indictment&#148;,</div><a name="09061647000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
covers crimes that are triable either in court and indictable, or
triable only in a Crown court. It is quite deliberately set at that
level so that we exclude summary offences, such as motoring offences.
There is always a balance to be struck in such definitions; we are not
simply trying to exclude everyone who may have committed what most
people would regard as minor offences, but we do particularly want to
stop violent criminals.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="09061647000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Violent crime
is growing alarmingly fast in this country, and one of the areas of
particular resentment is when people discover that a violent crime has
been committed by someone who may not have leave to remain here. That
has knock-on effects on public confidence not just in the criminal
justice system but also in the immigration system, so any move to
clarify the position in respect of the commission of a violent crime by
anyone who intends to settle in this country and gain citizenship will
be an important step forward. To a large extent, I imagine that the
Minister would agree. I am not trying to open up any particular
controversy with the amendment, I am just seeking clarification about
what the Government
mean.</div>
<a name="09061647000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000282"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): If I understand
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment correctly, he is seeking to
ensure that applications will not be considered if applicants have been
convicted
of,</div><a name="09061647000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
offence that is triable on indictment&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061647000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could he clarify
whether that is the same as anyone guilty of committing a criminal
offence?</div><a name="09061647000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000283"></a>Damian
Green:</b> Not quite, because, as I have just explained,
certain minor offences are not covered by being triable on indictment.
I suspect that the whole Committee would agree that they might not wish
such things as parking fines, or even minor motoring offences, to be
covered. We might not wish automatically to exclude people for ever
from obtaining British citizenship for that kind of offence; equally,
there will be no controversy about the fact that anyone who has
committed a serious offence should not be considered as of good
character and, therefore, should not be eligible for citizenship.
&#147;Triable on indictment&#148; is the term of art that one can
use to say, in essence, that it would catch most people who have
committed criminal offences, apart from the most trivial ones. As I
said, it is an exploratory amendment and I hope the Minister will agree
with
it.</div><a name="09061647000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000284"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Ashford for tabling
amendment 56 and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington for
tabling amendment 54. It gives me the opportunity to
explain&#151;</div><a name="09061647000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000285"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I advise the Minister that I have
selected separately amendment 54, which he has just mentioned? There
will be a separate debate on that
amendment.</div><a name="09061647000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000286"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I was premature in my
thanks to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I was simply
trying to recognise what I believe to be the good intent behind the
amendments, which seek to explore the Government&#146;s
intentions.</div><a name="09061647000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you will allow me, Sir Nicholas, I refer the Committee to page 35 of
the explanatory notes, which provides the context for clause 48. With
the clause, we are moving the existing law on the requirement of good
character from the Immigration Act 1971 into nationality law. As I
mentioned in our opening sitting, this is part of the jigsaw puzzle
that is trying to prepare the way for the simplification Bill. The
clause shows the beautiful symmetry of our legislation and I hope that
the Committee will support
it.</div><a name="09061647000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
56, which was proposed by the hon. Member for Ashford, addresses the
understanding and definition of good character. There has been a good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>character requirement for naturalisation&#151;not indefinite leave to
remain&#151;since the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into
force on 1 January 1983. That requirement was subsequently added to by
other registration provisions, particularly those in section 58 of the
Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The requirement applies
to adults and minors over the age of 10. We chose 10 as it is the age
of criminal responsibility in England and Wales&#151;it is not the
same in overseas dependencies or Scotland, but we thought it was
consistent with common sense. There is no definition of good character
in the 1981 Act. Thus, there is no statutory guidance as to how the
requirement should be interpreted or tested. The amendment is extremely
helpful in teasing that
out.</div><a name="09061647000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain why we prefer that approach. In considering whether the good
character requirement is met, we have taken into account a range of
criteria. We would not expect to naturalise a person if they did not
respect or were not prepared to abide by the law, if their financial
affairs were not in order, if their activities were notorious and cast
serious doubt about their standing in the community, if they had
practised deceit in their dealings with the Home Office, the Department
for Work and Pensions or Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, or
if they had assisted in the evasion of immigration control. All
applicants over the age of 10 are subject to criminal
records checks; the exceptions are applications from British nationals
to register as British citizens and applications from certain stateless
persons. Results from checks against the police national computer are
considered, as are Interpol notices. Where applicants are identified as
subject to international arrest warrants, the police are advised and
extradition is
considered.</div><a name="09061647000248"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09061647000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy on criminal convictions has recently been tightened. Until 31
December 2007, the agency applied &#147;clear periods&#148;, as we
call them&#151;a set time after which they will be prepared to
disregard a person&#146;s conviction. These were generally shorter
than the rehabilitation periods set out in the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act 1974. On 5 December 2007, however, the then
Home Secretary announced a new policy which came into force
on 1 January 2008. Any applications for citizenship received on
or after that date are normally refused if the applicant has a
conviction that has not become spent under the 1974 Act. It is that
read-across that answers the question put by the hon. Member for
Ashford.</div><a name="09061647000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would not normally expect to grant citizenship to a person with a
conviction that he has not spent under that Act. That includes people
who have been to prison and those with non-custodial sentences. There
is discretion to grant citizenship to an individual with a single
unspent conviction resulting in a bind-over, conditional discharge or
relatively small fine or compensation order where the applicant is of
good character in all other respects. Typically, it is used for
regulatory offences such as a speeding
offence.</div><a name="09061647000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to bar from citizenship anyone who has a conviction for
an offence that can be tried on an indictment. In my view, the
amendment does not consider the purpose and effects of the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which meets the point the hon.
Member for Ashford is making. The Act provides for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>person&#146;s conviction not to be held against them&#151;for it to
become spent&#151;after a specified period, except in relation to
certain sentences, including custodial convictions of more than 30
months. As worded, the amendment would catch only indictable offences
and also offences that are triable either way&#151;in a magistrates
court or a Crown court&#151;because an indictable offence can be
heard, in some cases, in either. That does not, therefore, parallel the
1974
Act.</div><a name="09061647000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, either-way offences range from unlawful wounding to
shoplifting and it is likely that many people convicted of such
offences will not receive custodial sentences. Even for offences
triable only on indictment, it is entirely possible that a sentence of
30 months or less could be set down by the court. The amendment has the
effect of proposing that we disregard the fact that the 1974 Act would
currently class such a conviction as having become spent.</div>
<a name="09061647000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what
hon. Members, including the hon. Gentleman, have said, they would not
wish to include those whose convictions were spent under that
legislation as that would be contrary to the principles of the British
justice system. The amendment would preclude many people who have spent
offences from acquiring British citizenship and therefore could be
described as too punitive. However, I reiterate the point
that a person who has a conviction that will never become
spent, meaning that they have received a sentence of 30
months or more for their crimes, is not normally regarded as satisfying
the good character requirement. It was the intention of my noble
Friends in the other place to ensure that people who commit serious
crimes do not have an avenue to acquire British citizenship. I can
reassure the Committee that that is already Government
policy.</div>
<a name="09061647000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the
associated question that arises from the amendment&#151;should the
requirements of good character be established in primary legislation,
rather than be at the discretion of the Secretary of State?&#151;we
take the view that it is prudent to continue to apply the
character test in its current form via the
discretion rather than by establishing specific requirements in primary
legislation. The reason is that it enables the Secretary of State of
the day to continue to exercise discretion in exceptional cases. For
example, there might be an applicant for citizenship who had not had
criminal convictions but it might be that information held by the
police would nevertheless mean that the Home Secretary could not be
satisfied that he or she was of good character. Conversely, there might
be exceptional circumstances in which the Home Secretary might want to
grant citizenship to someone with an unspent conviction. Applying the
good character test by way of the existing discretionary powers also
gives the Home Secretary the option to overlook minor regulatory
offences, such as
speeding.</div><a name="09061647000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000287"></a>Damian
Green:</b> To put this part of the Minister&#146;s
explanation in context, can he give us any idea&#151;I appreciate
that it will be rough&#151;of the number of times that the
Home Secretary&#146;s discretion has been exercised in the past few
years? In particular, how has it been exercised? Is it more
likely that the Home Secretary will bar someone who would otherwise be
disqualified, or let in someone who would otherwise not be qualified?
That information would be helpful to the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div><a name="09061647000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000288"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It is a difficult question. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intent on citizenship&#151;I take what he said as
a compliment. I can give him some overall statistics. In the period
2003-08, 9,732 applications were refused on good character grounds.
Those are total refusals, which does not answer the specific point that
he
made.</div><a name="09061647000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman gave figures about the increase in citizenships. Some of
that is as a result of our doing things more quickly and better, so the
number will flatten out&#151;one should not take the steepness of the
slope as a trajectory for the future; it reflects, in part, better
processing and is something that, presentationally, we suffer from. On
the specific question of how many people are in the former category and
how many in the latter, I will have to come back to the hon. Gentleman.
It is a very interesting question. If we were to put that rigid
criterion, particularly on the former category, in immigration law, it
would take away that discretion. There could be a situation whereby a
person the authorities had good reason to believe might not be of good
character, but who did not have a conviction as described under the
1974 Act, could not be excluded on those grounds, and we would be
challenged, in practice, in the courts, including, I suspect, in
foreign courts. I do not have official figures on the two examples I
have given, I am afraid. I will have to investigate and come back to
the hon. Gentleman on
that.</div><a name="09061647000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
certainly agree with the intent; indeed, I go a bit further. I think
that the specific problem&#151;I am not trying to score points on the
indictable element&#151;is the twin court approach; it could be a
magistrates court or a jury court. Having said that, we believe it is
right to define what we mean by good character, using the legislation
that is about that&#151;the 1974 Act&#151;and apply that to
immigration and allow that discretion. I hope that helps in providing
the information that the amendment seeks to draw

Green:</b> I am grateful for that explanation, which is half
satisfactory. I appreciate everything the Minister said about the
read-across from the 1974 Act and how it is important to maintain
consistency there. That is a valid point and I can see why he might
regard that as superior to the formulation we have come up with. I note
en passant, however, that this may be one of the few times since the
Minister took office when he has found something that we have suggested
more draconian than what he is prepared to support. There is a small
historic footnote to be made
here.</div><a name="09061647000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000290"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It depends how you use the
discretion.</div><a name="09061647000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000291"></a>Damian
Green:</b><b class="B"> </b>Indeed so. I was going to come on to the
discretion which the Minister has just talked about from a sedentary
position, because that is where I am less satisfied. The second part of
the explanation he has just given was explaining the legislative basis,
which anyone applying for citizenship could look at, could find out
about, particularly in the wake of this debate, as a result of which
they would know whether they had committed an offence that meant they
were not of good character and would not be eligible for British
citizenship. It seems that if we are passing laws in this place, that
kind of clarity is something to which we should aspire, so that part of
the speech was fine. In the first part, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>however, the Minister said there were a number of
other considerations that&#151;as he put it&#151;&#147;we take
into account&#148;. They were all fairly vague: whether there were
financial offences or financial difficulties, and so on.</div>
<a name="09061647000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That led in
to the Minister&#146;s final point about the Secretary of
State&#146;s discretion, which can be applied both ways. The
Committee ought to be slightly worried about that. Allowing the Home
Secretary and Home Office of the day so much discretion to decide on
something as important as whether people are of good character or not,
makes me uneasy&#151;particularly as Committee members are seeing no
hard and fast rules and criteria that the Home Secretary is obliged to
apply. One can imagine periods where Home Secretaries might be
encouraged either to be unnecessarily draconian, or unnecessarily lax,
for certain groups of people that might have engaged the public
imagination. It might go either way, with people saying, &#147;These
people must be granted citizenship&#148;, or &#147;These people
must not, under any circumstances, be granted citizenship.&#148; The
principle of the Home Secretary&#146;s having that degree of
discretion about issues as important as not only granting citizenship,
but also the formal decision about whether somebody is of good
character or not, concerns me. That sort of thing ought to be set down
in legislation.</div>
<a name="09061647000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
Minister&#146;s explanation of the objective criteria that had been
used since the 1981 Act, and why those may be superior to the objective
criteria in our amendment. However, the less objective parts of his
explanation should give the Committee some pause for thought because
they allow too much discretion to the Home Secretary of the day. I
will, with the Committee&#146;s permission, withdraw the amendment,
but the debate has been useful because it has given rise to that
unease, and I would hope the Minister will consider that for future
stages of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061647000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000292"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I think the question I was unable to answer is
important. The numbers will give us a better idea. I will return to
that
point.</div><a name="09061647000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000293"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I am very grateful, and my question was asked
partly to elucidate the practical effects of the uncertainty around the
edges. However, whatever the numbers are, there is a principle at stake
about what kind of discretion Ministers should have in that area, when
it is perfectly possible to find objective criteria. There could be
criteria that people either pass or fail&#151;that could be discussed
openly by the House, be passed into legislation and then be known to
everyone involved in the sector&#151;or there could be this pattern
of discretion around the edge. Perhaps, as a principle in this kind of
decision making, the less discretion, the better. However, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061647000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000294"></a>Tom

clause 48, page 39, leave out lines 6 to
11.</div><a name="09061653000054"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">This amendment removes
Hong Kong war wives and widows from the list of those who must satisfy
a good character requirement to register as
British.</i></div><a name="09061647000216"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">This
is a simple amendment, the effect of which is to remove the requirement
of a good character test for those Hong Kong war wives and widows
eligible to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>register as British citizens. That would apply to
very few women. In the House of Lords, Lord Brett stated that only 53
women had ever been eligible to apply under the provision, and that
there had been no applications for the past eight years. The amendment
would support the Government&#146;s intention to simplify the law as
it relates to British citizenship.</div>
<a name="09061647000217"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I hope
other Members would agree that the circumstances where the Government
are retaining a legal requirement that will never be used in practice
can hardly be considered sensible. I understand the Government have
argued that to remove that character test would set a precedent for
others but I, certainly, support the view expressed by the Immigration
Law Practitioners&#146; Association; the only precedent it sets is in
applying the good character test where it is silly to do so, because we
know that it will never be used in practice.</div>
<a name="09061647000218"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I hope
that the Minister will be able to provide some sort of detailed
explanation of why the Government think it necessary to retain such a
good character test for a group of women who are very unlikely at all
ever to need to pass it because, as there have been no applications for
the past eight years and they are, clearly, getting older, the
likelihood of anyone seeking British citizenship by this route is quite
remote. I await the Minister&#146;s response with
interest.</div>
<a name="09061647000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000295"></a>Damian
Green:</b><b class="B"> </b>I simply want to draw the Minister&#146;s
attention to the debate on the same amendment when it was moved in
another place, because I thought that the Minister&#146;s response in
another place was completely admirable. Lord Brett said,</div>
<a name="09061647000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I shall keep my
response short, if not slow. A powerful case has been made. I have the
brief. The sensible thing is for the Government to reconsider the
issue, and I give that commitment&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords, </i>4 March 2009; Vol. 708, c.
751.]</div><a name="09061647000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
Government Minister in another place looks at his brief and decides
that it is such rubbish that he cannot even bring himself to read it
out, I suggest that the Minister should pay heed. I commend the
openness and honesty of Lord Brett; while he did not quite put it in
the way that I have just done, that is clearly what he meant.</div>
<a name="09061647000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, as
the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has just said, in
practical terms there is an extremely powerful case to be made, and I
dare say that the Minister will want to address the issue of precedent.
That is clearly the genuine issue that the Committee needs to
assess&#151;whether this would actually be a way to open the
floodgates to large numbers of others of whom the Committee might not
take the same view. Certainly, as now drawn, the amendment will affect
a small and diminishing number of wholly admirable women and it would,
on the surface, appear slightly churlish behaviour by this country to
insist on their meeting these tests.</div>
<a name="09061647000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000296"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Committee awaits the Minister&#146;s reply
with very considerable interest.</div>
<a name="09061647000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000297"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Member for Ashford has my brief spot on,
because the arguments in it about the specifics of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment run to several pages and the argument on
the crucial point runs to two paragraphs. He has predicted my response
with uncanny accuracy. My noble friend Lord Brett,
who brings to the Dispatch Box years of pragmatic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>trade union negotiation experience, can spot a good argument when there
is one, and it is his privilege to pass the buck in this
regard.</div>
<a name="09061647000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have looked at this and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
is right; his argument is, within itself, powerful. I come to our
analysis of it. The two words&#151;or the acronym plus
word&#151;&#147;ILPA precedent&#148; set alarm bells ringing in
the mind of any self-respecting immigration Minister. We fight, if that
is the right word, a constant ongoing legal battle over precedents in
immigration law. I shall put the background to this on the record, then
ask the Committee to consider the way forward.</div>
<a name="09061647000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Hong Kong
(War Wives and Widows) Act 1996, which formed part of the arrangements
for the handover of Hong Kong to China, came into force on 18 July
1996. It provides for the discretionary registration as British
citizens of the wives, widows and divorcees of men who fought in the
defence of Hong Kong during the second world war. A woman would be
eligible for registration if she was a resident of Hong Kong, and a
recipient of a letter from the Home Secretary confirming
that she could settle in the UK on the basis of the man&#146;s
wartime service, and if she was no longer married to the man concerned,
had not remarried&#151;to avoid the transfer of rights to the new
husband, or subsequent
husbands.</div><a name="09061647000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
1996 Act is unusual in that it applies only to a very small and finite
number of people. It only ever affected, as the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington rightly said, a maximum of 53 women. That is
the number of woman, for the record, who were actually issued with a
letter. A further unique feature of this provision was that, unlike
most other applications for citizenship, there was no fee for
registration, such was the generosity of the Home Secretary. So those
qualifying are treated favourably compared with other
applicants.</div>
<a name="09061647000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
said, the subject was debated in another place, and in recognition of
the particular circumstances of these women, the then Home Secretary
indicated that she would be prepared to consider exercising discretion
on the application in respect of the good character requirement, should
any of these women apply in the future and this issue arose. That
statement has force, not just policy intent; so if one of these women
wished to apply, and had committed an offence that would prevent her
from meeting the good character requirement in normal
circumstances&#151;the guidance on the website on those criteria is
quite specific&#151;the Home Secretary would be willing to consider
overlooking
it.</div><a name="09061647000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Home Secretary also indicated that she would be prepared to consider,
in exercising that discretion, the caveat that, while we are prepared
to exercise that discretion if necessary in these particular
circumstances, we do not think it wise to amend the law in this
respect. To remove the legal requirement in this case would, we are
advised, set a precedent for removing it from other sections, and we
think this is an important requirement for potential citizens to
fulfil. It is indeed that point that we are concerned
about.</div>
<a name="09061647000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000298"></a>Tom

come on to what other sections he thought this was going to set a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000299"></a>Mr.

inspiration. The advice one generally receives is that, to mention

It is a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000301"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am very grateful for the nodding of the head.
The hon. Gentleman is at least recognising the point I am making; he is
not necessarily agreeing with it. Very helpfully and sensibly, Lord
Brett, who has negotiated more agreements than the United Nations in
his time&#151;they have stood better as well, in most
instances&#151;also had a caveat to the passage that the hon. Member
for Ashford read out. He added in column 1095 that the discretion of
the Home Secretary would resolve the problem behind the amendment. So
he recognised that the problem was there, in his common-sense statement
that the hon. Gentleman read out, but he also said the discretion
provision would meet the objectives. I hope I have convinced the hon.
Gentleman that we support the intent regarding Hong Kong; the
discretion is there&#151;the Home Secretary said she would use it,
and that is the policy of the Government&#151;without setting a
precedent that we fear the amendment could
set.</div><a name="09061647000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000302"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I did hear the Minister&#146;s explanation. Other
members will perhaps also have been entertained by the
Minister&#146;s confirmation that making this change might set a
precedent that would be relevant to other clauses. He cannot mention
those other clauses as mentioning them would set a precedent. The
Minister has not entirely elucidated the matter, although I understand
his point. It is regrettable that this minor change has not been made;
it would have been doing the right thing for a small number of women.
However, I understand the Minister&#146;s explanation and therefore I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000303"></a>Mr.

jigsaw puzzle. The clause title is a phrase that occurs in various
parts of nationality legislation and, like the good character
requirement in clause 48, is not a new requirement, as is explained in
the explanatory notes. We are moving it into the 1981 British
Nationality Act so that it sits alongside the provisions to which it
relates. It does not change policy or the law in its
application; it moves the piece of legislation from nationality law to
immigration law. As such, it is part of the simplification process to
achieve greater consistency within our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000305"></a>Mr.

believe is helpful to our understanding of this
clause.</div><a name="09061647000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain what we are doing here. As it stands, clause 51 concerns the
common travel area of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and
the smaller islands&#151;the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and so
on. We have moved new clause 3 to replace clause 51; I will be asking
the Committee to reject the stand part motion. The common travel area
derives from section 1(3) of the Immigration Act 1971, which relates to
a person arriving in the United Kingdom from any of the islands or the
Republic of Ireland. That has governed travel between these two
countries since that time and, indeed, before it. Amendments 34 and 37
are consequential on new clause 3. I should also draw attention to the
fact that amendment 31 would be opposed, although I think that has not
actually been selected.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000307"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I would have opposed it,
had it been, for consistency reasons.</div>
<a name="09061647000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The world is
very different from the place it was when the common travel area came
into existence. There is much more travel, and it is faster and
relatively cheaper for those who make journeys. Because that is the
case for legal journeys, it is also true for illegal journeys, whether
they involve illegal migrants and/or those who are engaged in criminal
activity. The common travel area that defines the border controls or
lack thereof, is by its nature presenting a risk to border control. It
is being exploited by illegal immigrants and serious organised crime to
assist their criminal activity. We saw that in the press very recently,
when an investigation by the French immigration forces exposed a
criminal gang that was bringing people in club class from Paris to the
United Kingdom, via Ireland. That took advantage of the common travel
area. Our evidence is that there are some 8,000 immigration offenders
travelling each year between the Republic of Ireland and the UK on air
and sea routes alone.</div>
<a name="09061647000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000308"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): Could the Minister explain
to the Committee how many immigration offenders are in the United

context.</div><a name="09061647000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000309"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We apprehended 28,000 clandestine entries last
year. That is not visa abuse but, in layperson&#146;s terms, people
who have got in on the back of a lorry. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>Overall, in terms of people here illegally&#151;I am picking this
phrase very carefully&#151;I think the hon. Gentleman knows that
nobody knows. By definition, one does not
know.</div>
<a name="09061647000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000310"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> The point I wanted to make is that when the
Minister says 8,000 immigration offenders, it could be drawn from a
category of over 1 million people resident in the United
Kingdom.</div>
<a name="09061647000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000311"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The figure of 8,000 is our estimate of the
clandestine and organised illegal routes. To compare like with like,
you would have to look at the following. Basically, we believe the
criminal gangs try to organise routes through our ports, particularly
through Calais to Dover, through the tunnel and on the ferries. The
more effective we have been at closing those routes off, the more
alternative routes have come into play&#151;particularly
Ireland.</div>
<a name="09061647000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me answer
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question more specifically. To give a like
for like comparison, the number of illegal immigrants detected in Kent
was 14,600 in 2001, and it was 1,800 last year. My hon. Friend the
Member for Dover has raised this issue in the House on many occasions
and I would argue that this figure shows the success of the border
controls there. The number of detections through visa fingerprinting in
2008 was around 4,000. That refers to cases identified for the whole of
the system where the detection has been based exclusively on
fingerprints. I hope that gives the hon. Gentleman some comparison for
the scale of the problem we are dealing
with.</div><a name="09061647000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000312"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): On the Minister&#146;s figure of
8,000, the Republic of Ireland operates a border system, so if someone
is going from Calais to Dublin, are they not apprehended by the Irish
authorities, or are they not operating a border
system?</div><a name="09061647000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000313"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is a very good point. The Republic of Ireland
has indeed introduced an electronic borders system similar to ours. We
are responsible for the United Kingdom, however, and of course the
Republic of Ireland&#146;s visa arrangements are up to them. It is
also true, of course, that the European Union non-Schengen countries
include the Republic of Ireland as well as the UK, so we do have common
cause with Ireland, but the problem goes both ways. The argument that
the hon. Gentleman has put is put very forcibly the other way round in
Dublin, because of the number of transits and because the Republic of
Ireland is an EU country. The powers that we are asking for in the new
clause and the amendments, in rejecting the proposed clause as it
stands, do exist in similar terms in Ireland, including at the land
border, as I will go on to
argue.</div><a name="09061647000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Reigate, in asking about the 8,000, raises an important
point. Our particular concern is about organised crime. The claim has
been made that our proposed clause abolishes the common travel area. It
is not our policy, nor our intent, nor the practical impact of our
proposals to abolish the common travel area. We have reconfirmed our
commitment to that, because of the social and economic benefits that it
brings. It is the third-country nationals who are illegal who are of
concern to us. Our changes will not prevent British citizens or Irish
nationals entering freely, as they do now, and we do not anticipate
that there will be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>noticeable impact on the journey for the vast
majority of passengers. The CTA is based on the principle that, once a
person has been granted leave to enter one part of the CTA, they will
not normally require leave to enter the UK. That point does not change.
Those who enter the UK from another part of the CTA will be able to
enter freely, unless they fall within an excepted category&#151;for
example, those who are subject to an outstanding deportation
order.</div><a name="09061647000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order to preserve its benefits, we need a proportionate response to the
risks we now face. We remain committed to working with Ireland to
further secure the external CTA border&#151;the point the hon. Member
for Rochdale makes&#151;but we must also act to protect our borders
by allowing for immigration controls on those travelling on intra-CTA
routes. The concept of immigration control within the CTA is not new.
The Irish Government do not believe such controls are inimical to the
CTA; as I have said, they have applied an immigration control on
third-country nationals arriving directly from the UK for more than a
decade.</div><a name="09061647000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK does not currently have the clear legislative power to control
non-European economic area/third-country nationals entering the UK from
elsewhere in the CTA. The Government believe that that is simply not
acceptable, especially as we need to tighten our borders in order to
face up to the risks that the modern world faces and the increase in
global movement of people. That is why we are seeking to reinstate the
Government's original clause, which is new clause 3, which was taken
out in the other place, to enable controls on air and sea routes for
people travelling within the common travel area and an ability by Order
in Council to control the land border, subject to parliamentary
approval, under section 10.</div>
<a name="09061647000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the power will be used proportionately on all routes. Those
travelling by air and sea between the Republic of Ireland and the UK
will be required to carry a passport or national identity card. We will
also use the e-Borders system to increase our ability to respond
proportionately to threat. We propose a very modest use of the power in
relation to journeys from the Crown dependencies, the islands, because
we know that the risk is much lower, although I must guard against
displacement&#151;the possibility that the tougher a control is made,
the more displacement can occur to other areas. There are examples of
small air and sea craft being used to get round our border controls,
for purposes of illegal migration and illegal entry of goods.</div>
<a name="09061647000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000314"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The logic of the Minister&#146;s argument is that
there are weaknesses in the Irish Government&#146;s border controls.
Does he think that Irish border controls are better or worse than UK
border
controls?</div><a name="09061647000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000315"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy of opposing
e-Borders, or the bits of them with relevance to the question, would,
if applied to the Republic of Ireland, create an open back door into
the United Kingdom. That is the practical answer, and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s policy needs to change. As he knows, and as I said
on Second Reading, I am not responsible for border control in the
Republic of Ireland, and I imagine that if I suggested I were there
would be severe political implications, for which I should not want to
be held responsible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="09061647000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes a good point, however, in that there is a challenge for
us all&#151;I think that the question was raised on Second
Reading&#151;with respect to the benefits of travel by Irish
nationals and UK citizens between our two countries; the island
dependencies are relevant as well. How do we keep the advantage and not
disrupt the travel experience, and yet have effective control of the
border? The powers that we are taking are powers to require the
carrying of identification. They are not powers&#151;except with
respect to third-country nationals, for whom we would want to take
those powers&#151;to stop travel. We cannot, under the powers,
restrict freedom of movement for Irish nationals and UK citizens; this
is about the third-country
nationals.</div><a name="09061647000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
51 as it stands prevents any form of immigration control on those who
have arrived in the UK over the land border between the Republic of
Ireland and Northern Ireland. I want to make it clear that both
political and practical considerations mean that fixed or routine
controls on the land border are not a viable option; but that does not
mean that we, or the Republic of Ireland, should do nothing. Tightening
controls on air and sea routes without making provision for any
activity on the land border would increase the risk of displacement and
at the same time reduce our ability to tackle it. We would push the
criminal gangs on to the land route&#151;those that are not already
using it. That would clearly undermine our intention of strengthening
the border and, indeed, reforming the
CTA.</div><a name="09061647000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
propose, on the land border, the capacity to mount targeted,
intelligence-led operations in response to the level of threat. There
will be no routine presence at the border. We will not require persons
crossing the land border to carry a passport or national identity
document.</div>
<a name="09061647000219"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000316"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Given the past history of the troubles in Northern
Ireland, surely we already have powers to stop anyone moving between
the borders, without the need for the present imposition. If not, what
did we do during the
troubles?</div><a name="09061647000251"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09061647000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000317"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks the question that I asked
when being briefed on the debate in the other place. We do not
currently have the clear power to control persons entering the UK by
that route. As it stands, clause 51 would prevent us from having it. In
relation to immigration&#151;not in relation to other powers for
which the Bill is not responsible&#151;if we have reason to believe
that illegal migration is taking place across that border, we do not
have the power to deal with it. I ask the Committee to give us that
power.</div><a name="09061647000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000318"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I hear what the Minister says but he talked about
criminal activity. There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the
Home Office about the use of the powers.</div>
<a name="09061647000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000319"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> There is no confusion in the Home Office. There is
an urgent request to Parliament to grant us the power that we need. I
agree that there has been confusion over the interpretation of what is
being proposed, for good and perhaps not such good reasons. The hon.
Gentleman will be aware of the potential misrepresentation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>of the policy in parts of the United Kingdom and in Ireland. Again we
come to the crux of the powers we are seeking. To stop immigration and
customs abuse, we believe that our officials need those powers.
Currently, we have to deal with those activities that may be related to
criminal activity after they have taken place. With the powers, we will
be able to deal with them at that border, as we do at airports and
other
borders.</div><a name="09061647000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000320"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am listening very carefully to the
Minister&#146;s explanation. He quoted a figure of 8,000 illegal
immigrants. Page 8 of the summary table in the impact assessment, which
refers to the 10-year cost or benefit, includes the reduction in
imported asylum cases, and abuse of the
immigration system, as not quantified; increased border security as not
quantified; the reduction in the number of illegal migrants and
potential reduction in illegal working as not quantified; and the
reduction in cross-border crime, including serious organised crime, as
not quantified. If the Minister is seriously asking us to accept his
amendment, he needs to do a lot better than the other place and what he
has provided in the information before
us.</div><a name="09061647000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000321"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his perceptive
comments and for reading the impact assessment. The matter he raises
relates to displacement. In border control, one continually deals with
displacement: displacement of routes through Europe and from other
parts of the world into Europe, and displacement of criminal activity
in relation to drug smuggling. For example, because of the success of
our forces in the Caribbean, cocaine smuggling from South America is
now often displaced to western Africa. He will have seen reports of the
operations to stop cocaine smuggling via the Republic of Ireland. I
refer him to the case last year where we tracked across the Atlantic a
yacht bound for Ireland. In terms of the overall impact, there is no
figure, as he rightly points out. There are other factors to bear on
that. Estimates and impact assessments have to be justifiable. They are
not based on the whim of the Minister. My figure of 8,000 relates to
the number of people who we estimate, through our intelligence and
security forces, have been able to abuse that border&#151;not just
the land border, but the air and sea routes as well.</div>
<a name="09061647000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one knows
exactly how much abuse there has been. We use intelligence from, for
example, country of origin, those who have been involved in
people-trafficking routes and the underground. It is not a scientific
process, therefore. I can assert, however, with absolute certainty that
there is an Achilles heel in our border control. The measures on the
common travel area are designed to address
that.</div><a name="09061647000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000322"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> May I follow on from my hon. Friend&#146;s point?
If I understand correctly, the Minister said that we cannot make an
estimate simply because there will be displacement, but surely if the
Government are ratcheting up safeguards, that displacement will,
logically, be smaller. I am surprised that the Minister and his
officials cannot estimate what reductions might be
achieved.</div><a name="09061647000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000323"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Clearly,
we believe that although strengthening the border will displace
activity, the effect of that will be diminished by putting that
protection around us. It is not normal for an impact assessment to
quantify the social benefits, which was one point that was made. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>When considering clamping down, we have not looked just at the impact of
the Bill. In my view, the electronic borders will be the biggest
beneficiary of strengthening that border, along with finger-printed
visas.</div>
<a name="09061647000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to my point about displacement, it would be misleading to consider the
specific impact of the Bill in isolation and divorced from our other
measures, and that it might be said&#151;not by you, Sir Nicholas,
because you would be impartial, as ever&#151;that my claims were
unfounded, exaggerated, under-exaggerated, or whatever. I have had
recent experience in the House of making specific claims on
numbers&#151;I think hon. Members know what I am talking
about&#151;so I decided on a different approach. I congratulate the
hon. Member for Rochdale on spotting that. I did not think that anyone
would, but they
did.</div><a name="09061647000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000324"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I admire the Minister for reading his brief with a
straight face. He said that immigration controls are an important part
of the legislation that he is trying to reintroduce into this part of
Bill, and that there will be no routine human checks at the border
between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. I gently suggest
that if he told the hon. Member for Dover, whom he praised for his work
on the matter, that there would be intelligence-led operations at
Dover, but that there would be no routine immigration presence to stop
illegal immigration there, the hon. Gentleman would have a word with
him because he would think that that was inadequate. As there will not
a routine presence at the border, for sensible reasons, to claim that
it will make a serious difference to illegal immigration across that
border does not
wash.</div><a name="09061647000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000325"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful again, because the hon. Gentleman
has given me the opportunity to try to convince him of the folly of his
own policy. The land border between the Republic of Ireland and
Northern Ireland is as I have said, and I do not believe that any hon.
Member would seriously propose the sort of control of the land border
that we have in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover
and nearby&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>. The juxtaposed
border in Calais is directly relevant, as my hon. Friend
said.</div><a name="09061647000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position of third country nationals is captured by the e-borders
passenger records&#151;the hon. Gentleman quoted what I said about
the land border&#151;intelligence-based operations and risk
assessment. We have that weapon at our disposal on air and sea routes,
and we also have the passenger records from the e-borders arrangements,
both for those coming into the United Kingdom from the Republic of
Ireland and for those going to the Republic of Ireland or to the Crown
dependencies. We are developing memorandums of understanding, because
there is a displacement point relating to small ships. When I say that
we are not taking those powers and not abolishing the common travel
area, that is in the context of the new information that we have. We
already have that intelligence when a passenger gets on a plane or
boat, just as we do when someone arrives at Calais, to which we have
effectively exported the border, or when someone gets on a plane in
Lagos or New York. That is the great advantage. The e-borders system
requires information on passengers and crew relating to their
identity&#151;name and passport number, just to reassure the
libertarians&#151;and we obtain that information from carriers
operating to and from the UK.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div><a name="09061647000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Irish are developing their own version of that proposal. The total
e-borders data to be collected from carriers operating air and sea
routes between the UK and Ireland have that information, as with all
other routes to and from the UK. In that way, my proposition that the
passenger experience will not be noticeably disrupted stands. In fact,
the vast majority of passengers already carry their passports or
identity cards, but we have, of course, had conversations with the
carriers on
that.</div><a name="09061647000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
fear with clause 51 as it stands is that in attempting to maintain the
common travel area as was, it is not fit for purpose for the modern
world. I refer the Committee to an article in the <i class="I">Daily Express
</i>of 14 May 2008 headed &#147;Now migrants are smuggled in club
class&#148;, in which an investigative journalist exposed an illegal
route into the UK through the Republic of Ireland. It reports the
exposure and capture by French forces of people-traffickers using a
route from Paris, organised from a small flat just opposite the Gare du
Nord, to the UK via the Republic of Ireland through the loophole I
described. The people-traffickers were charging up to &#163;10,000
for each person to be smuggled in, booking them on club class on the
airlines from Dublin to the UK and making &#163;500,000 in just nine
months. The French immigration authorities said that the migrants were
corralled in safe houses before being taken to small regional airports
in France for flights to Ireland, bound for Britain. They said that
they had worked closely with the UK Border Agency to expose a highly
sophisticated
route.</div><a name="09061647000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ashford, having been approached by the <i class="I">Daily
Express</i> journalist for his comments on that successful operation,
said:</div><a name="09061647000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
should be worried that smugglers are confident that they can bypass our
passport and visa systems. These should be the strongest part of our
defences against illegal immigration, certainly not a weak
spot.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061647000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">If he wants to close
down the weak spots, he should support new clause 3 and reject the
advice of his noble Friends in the other place who harked back through
rose-tinted spectacles to days that I suspect never existed. We should
put into place a modern border control that gives us the advantage of
the common free travel area but makes real the words of the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000328"></a>Damian

keeping abreast of not only the classics, but all my quotes in the
<i class="I">Daily Express. </i>He said specifically that he will rely on
intelligence-led operations. I invite him to commit himself now to
support our new clause 2, which would set up a proper border
police force so that precisely the weaknesses that I criticised can be
addressed by a specialist police force that will be much more effective
at intelligence-led operations than the current system. That is the way
to resolve weakness at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000329"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that I am relying
specifically on intelligence-led operations, but I am not relying only
on them. I repeat that the e-Borders 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>system that counts people in and out of this country is the first
introduction of border control since its abolition in 1994. The hon.
Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) pointed out that that is the first
reintroduction of border control. I am teasing the hon. Member for
Ashford is because he cannot, on the one hand, come into this House
with a libertarian approach towards border control and support the
general thrust of the philosophy of his party, with which I disagree
but respect, and, on the other hand, regularly give quotes to tabloid
journalists to show how tough his party is. His party has to make its
mind up. I suspect that the vote on new clause 3 will separate the two
parties.</div>
<a name="09061647000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000330"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister has already admitted that he has
problems with figures. He has just said that 1994 was when border
controls were removed, but he will know that it was actually 1998 when
border controls within the European Union were removed. Furthermore,
since we are discussing Britain and the Republic of Ireland, he might
note that the two countries are members of the EU, so it was actually
his Government that removed border controls between those two
countries.</div><a name="09061647000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000331"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The abolition of border controls started in
1994.</div><a name="09061647000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000332"></a>Damian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000333"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My Government, as I have said before, continued
that process, but we are now reintroducing those border controls and I
am appealing for consensus on
that.</div><a name="09061647000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the comment about the EU, we rightly did not sign up to the
Schengen agreement and nor did the Republic of Ireland. To address the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about travel movements between the two
countries, we have the benefits of the common travel area and we now
require the powers to control illegal or potentially illegal third
country non-European economic area activities. The e-Borders system and
the powers in the new clause give us the opportunity to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061647000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Nicholas,
I am straying off the subject of new clause 3, so I will draw my
remarks to a close.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000334"></a>The

clause stand part debate and it is my understanding that the Government

discussing Government amendments 34 and 37 and Government new clause 3,
but of course we will be dealing with those measures formally, as and
when we reach them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000335"></a>Mr.

counter-terrorism in our home affairs team, which is why I am leading
on the subject for the Opposition.</div>
<a name="09061647000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may have to
apologise, Sir Nicholas, for the fact that my arguments are not cast in
the emollient manner shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. It
is difficult to share that manner, given the pasting that the
Government&#146;s arguments have already taken. The best that the
Minister has been able to do is to adduce a misleading quote from the
<i class="I">Daily Express</i> in support of his arguments. That gives a sense of
the quality of the case that is being presented to the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div><a name="09061647000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light
of everything that has happened to the Government and to the Minister
over the past few months, it is astonishing that they have returned to
a measure that was so roundly defeated in another place. Their actions
have all the hallmarks of their wearingly repetitive inability to
listen and learn from their experience. One wonders if they are now so
punch-drunk, because of everything that has overtaken them, that they
cannot change direction, even if common sense dictates that they should
and even if the margin of a vote by 193 to 107 in the other place
suggests that there are one or two problems with their
proposals.</div>
<a name="09061647000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Typically,
the measure began life in a consultation called &#147;Strengthening
the Common Travel Area&#148;&#151;an example of the Orwellian
doublespeak that is another of the hallmarks of new Labour, as it will
plainly weaken the common travel area and, some people argue,
effectively abolish it altogether. Although the arguments adduced for
the measure have changed since the beginning of the consultation, they
are largely based on unsupported statement and instinct. As we heard in
the interventions from the hon. Member for Rochdale, they are also
based on unquantified assumptions.</div>
<a name="09061647000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
are offensive in principle to many of our fellow citizens. They are
careless of the constitutional implications for Britain&#146;s
relations with her dependencies, and their effectiveness will be
undermined by a gaping hole in the practical applications of the
measures&#151;namely, the UK-Ireland land border. Furthermore, they
will be expensive and damaging to the tourist industry; and, even
according to the Government&#146;s figures, they will entail a
significant cost. A much more sensible alternative strategy is
available to achieve the objectives that the Government have set
themselves.</div><a name="09061647000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall address the so-called strengthening of the common travel area.
The Minister insisted, as did Lord West in another place, that neither
the original Bill, nor the amendments before us, will undermine the
common travel area. I am afraid that I fail to see how that can be.
Government new clause 3 will amend the following words in section 1(3)
of the Immigration Act
1971:</div><a name="09061647000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Arrival
in and departure from the United Kingdom on a local journey from or to
any of the Islands (that is to say, the Channel Islands and Isle of
Man) or the Republic of Ireland shall not be subject to control under
this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="09061647000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that wording is to be struck out, will it not now be the case that
those persons entering the United Kingdom from the Channel Islands,
Isle of Man or from the Republic of Ireland are subject to control?
Have I misunderstood the common travel area as a concept altogether?
Was the free passage of individuals without the need to present
identification or submit themselves to immigration controls never its
true
purpose?</div><a name="09061647000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Minister seeks to amend the 1971 Act explicitly to
exclude the common travel area when defining embarkation and
disembarkation. The new clause will, if passed, strike from the Act the
lines:</div><a name="09061647000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
elsewhere in the common travel
area&#148;,</div><a name="09061647000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that embarking for a local journey or disembarking after a local
journey applies only within the United Kingdom. If striking the common
travel area from the exemption in terminology is not altering the very
nature of the common travel area, I do not know what
is.</div><a name="09061647000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
brief trawl through the Government&#146;s previous utterances on this
matter reveals their true intentions. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>The original consultation document makes it clear that
the Minister&#146;s predecessor at the Home Office
intended the legislation on the common travel area to go further. The
consultation states that the Government intended
to</div><a name="09061647000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;carry
out checks on passengers and their documents on sea and air routes
arriving and departing from the UK to the Republic of Ireland for
border control purposes. The nature of the examination by an
immigration officer will depend upon a passenger&#146;s status as a
CTA national or a non-CTA

the workability of that was roundly rejected in the responses to the
Government&#146;s consultation paper, the Government scaled back
their ambitions for the plan. The rather more conciliatory ministerial
response to the consultation was that</div>

has listened... In light of your feedback we are clear that we
will not replicate other international routes by introducing
traditional fixed immigration controls on all air and sea routes
between the Republic of

is perfectly clear, therefore, that the intention was always to remove
the common travel area, despite the title of the consultation document,
&#147;Strengthening the Common Travel
Area&#148;.</div><a name="09061647000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now come to the delicious irony of clause 51, which was inserted by
their lordships to limit the use of Orders in Council. That sits
alongside the Prime Minister&#146;s presentation, shortly after he
became Prime Minister, on constitutional reform and reducing the
ability of Orders in Council to, in effect, legislate for the United
Kingdom. Now, their lordships are insisting on removing the ability of
Orders in Council to be used in that way. That irony should not be lost
on the Committee when considering whether the clause should stand part
of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061647000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the shadow
Minister for counter-terrorism and security, it is my responsibility to
listen carefully to the arguments advanced for the measure,
particularly on security and counter-terrorist grounds. However, we
should consider that the common travel area has served the peoples of
our islands since the 1920s. It is a remarkable testament to the cool
heads that prevailed immediately after the partition of the island of
Ireland that all parties sought to maintain a common travel area. The
CTA was maintained throughout the period of the
troubles.</div><a name="09061647000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that at present we face a very real terrorist threat in the
United Kingdom, but it has not yet led to attacks on the scale or
frequency of those we faced from the IRA. At a time when the IRA had
bases in the Irish Republic and was planning attacks on the British
mainland, we continued to allow the principle that travel between the
Irish Republic and Northern Ireland and travel from both to the British
mainland should be unfettered&#151;that passports and other documents
would not be required. Why then today does the minister think the CTA
must be fundamentally
altered?</div><a name="09061647000145"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000336"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making very important
points, I acknowledge; however, his argument is based on a
misunderstanding of what the CTA is. It is based on the principle that
once a person has been granted leave to enter one part of the CTA, they
will not normally require leave to enter another part. Our proposals
protect that principle, but requiring documentation can address the
problem of third-country nationals, which is not what he is talking
about at the moment. Does he accept the intent behind the
policy?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000337"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I accept the intent but not the practicality. The
perfectly obvious alternative is to ensure that the CTA works. It is
around the boundaries of the CTA that one wants to achieve control. One
does not want to start setting up double systems of control, at
considerable inconvenience and expense to all
concerned.</div><a name="09061647000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000338"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Hamilton</b> (Midlothian) (Lab): I have always
understood that when any flight comes in from Ireland to any part of
the United Kingdom, special treatment is given to that flight. That has
always been the case. If a flight comes into Edinburgh from Dublin, the
passengers do not go through the same system as everyone else. They
never have done. There has been a special lane for Irish flights,

<a name="09061647000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
carefully examined the arguments made by Lord West in another place and
I listened to the Minister this morning in the hope of hearing
convincing arguments on why we should override the constitutional,
emotional, practical and financial objections to the measure, but I am
afraid that none of the arguments stack up on examination. As part of
the standard pattern of the Government scratching around for
third-party endorsement for supposed security measures, SOCA suddenly
produced new arguments about trafficking in Northern Ireland two days
before Report in another place. The figure of 8,000 was introduced at a
rather late stage.</div>
<a name="09061647000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord West

</div><a name="09061647000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does
that mean? The Government have to make a better case for making
substantial changes in this area than a statement as bland and as
undetailed as that. Lord West used the following metaphor:</div>
<a name="09061647000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
believe that this is happening because we are tightening up our borders
by a raft of means. Rather like water finding an opening in a ship when
it is sinking, those who have been thwarted are pushing at every single
door. I have no doubt whatsoever that something has got to be done to
block this breach in our defences.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

1111.]</div><a name="09061647000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
concede to Lord West in expertise on sinking ships. He was a
distinguished commander in the Falklands when HMS Ardent had the
misfortune to sink after being attacked by the Argentine air force when
it was under his command. However, the gaping hole blown in the
Government&#146;s argument is the UK-Ireland land border. That hole
remains because it is impractical to address it. I will return shortly
to how one could police that border and explain why it is
impractical.</div><a name="09061647000253"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09061647000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one is going to come forward with measures such as this, one should
understand what they mean to the people who will be subject to them. I
turn to the arguments put forward by Lord Glentoran in another place.
In the debate on Report that led to this measure being so roundly
rejected, he
said:</div><a name="09061647000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
occasionally gets forgotten that Northern Ireland is as integral a part
of the United Kingdom as Yorkshire or Lancashire. I do not know what
the Yorkshireman and the Lancashire folk would feel if they had to
provide identification in the form of passports to travel from one
county to the other. That is effectively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>what this Bill is doing for the Northern Ireland folk. Over the years we
have had free travel, which has worked wonderfully. The reason that it
was necessary and still is necessary is that those who benefit from it
are, largely, the poorest in our society. A large number of people from
both Ireland and Northern Ireland earn their living in England and
Scotland&#151;not so much in Wales. They need to be able to travel
freely, easily and without hassle to see their families from time to
time when they
can.&#148;</div><a name="09061647000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend went on to say of Lord
West:</div><a name="09061647000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
explained to the Minister this morning that the people of Northern
Ireland will see this part of this Bill as another way of getting rid
of them out of the United Kingdom. I am afraid that, whether you shake
your heads or not, that is how it is perceived. I could talk to you
very civilly and say that maybe it is not like that, but that is how
the people in Belfast, Armagh and Londonderry will see it&#151;as
another imposition and another move one step away from the unity with
this nation and this Parliament for which most of those in Northern
Ireland have been fighting for the past 40
years.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 April

are emotive and important
matters.</div><a name="09061647000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
support of that argument, Lord Kilclooney
said:</div><a name="09061647000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran: it is offensive if it is
suggested that the people of Northern Ireland are to be treated
differently from people elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Is that
because there is water between Northern Ireland and England? If so, why
are the people of the Isle of Wight not treated
differently?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1
April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1107.]</div><a name="09061647000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">A sense
of identity and nationality are important to people. Therefore, the bar
that one has to jump in introducing such measures should be
correspondingly
high.</div><a name="09061647000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure is also careless of the constitutional relationship between the
United Kingdom and our Crown dependencies, particularly the Channel
Islands. The Minister will be familiar with the arguments put forward
by Lord Goodlad, who sits on the cross-party Constitution Committee in
the other place that was quite devastating about the consultation,
particularly with regard to the Channel Islands. He
reported:</div><a name="09061647000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
found that such consultation as did take place gave the impression of
being muddled and tardy, showing little appreciation of the
constitutional relationship between the United Kingdom and the Crown
dependencies. The Chief Minister of Jersey told your Lordships&#146;
Select Committee that there is a mismatch between the policy intent and
the possible effects of the legislative
change.&#148;</div><a name="09061647000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
then quoted Senator Le Sueur, who said that
that</div><a name="09061647000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;opens
the way, at any time of the UK Government&#146;s choosing, for the
significant change of practice that they say they do not presently
envisage&#148;.</div><a name="09061647000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Senator
Le Sueur
added:</div><a name="09061647000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are absolutely no safeguards to prevent such controls being implemented
or to protect the long-standing rights of Channel Islanders to travel
freely to the United Kingdom, in accordance with their constitutional
relationship as set out in numerous Royal
Charters&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
1 April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1101-1102.]</div><a name="09061647000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee of the other place concluded that it was</div>
<a name="09061647000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;difficult to
reconcile the modest policy aims stated by the Government (of
occasionally, on the basis of intelligence, stopping and questioning
people arriving from or departing to the Crown dependencies) with the
far-reaching legal powers claimed by the proposed amendment to section
1 of the Immigration Act 1971 (which would enable fixed and routine
border controls). This mismatch is in and of itself constitutionally
inappropriate: Parliament should not grant to Government wide legal
authority in excess of the powers properly needed to implement a
proposed policy.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div><a name="09061647000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those senses relate to
what this means for the people of Northern Ireland and the
people of the Crown dependencies. Also, as the Government are having
some difficulty agreeing a memorandum of understanding with the states
of Jersey, I should be grateful if the Minister tells us whether things
have improved since the failure to get the states of Jersey to sign up
to this before report of the Bill in the other
place.</div><a name="09061647000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now discuss the practicality of the measure. The gaping hole in
this is the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The
noble Lord West said he was familiar with that land border. I am too: I
had brief familiarity with it in an earlier incarnation, and as a
spokesman for the Conservative party on Northern Ireland, visiting
there in 2002, to examine what was then the significant problem of
gasolene smuggling over the border. It is easy to get lost between one
side of that border and the other, and to be unsure of exactly which
side one is on. Therefore, the practical policing of it is immensely
difficult and produced a series of embarrassments to British soldiers
trying to track the IRA during the troubles. You, Sir Nicholas, and
other ex-soldiers such as I, will be more than familiar with that. I do
not understand the practicalities of policing that border&#151;of
trying to differentiate between nationalities of the common travel area
and non-CTA nationals. In this, happily, post-troubles environment,
people who live in that area and travel around the border will not be
anticipating carrying identity documents.</div>
<a name="09061647000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has led
the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which has carefully
examined a number of these details, to be concerned about the basis on
which identification will take place. Its concern is that racial
profiling will occur. It referred to the Republic of Ireland&#146;s
taking measures because of its concern about entry to the Republic from
the UK&#151;some of the gardai&#146;s actions have bordered on
racial profiling. The Minister will be aware that our authorities in
Belfast have not been entirely immune from that; there was a
substantial payout to a UK citizen of Nigerian origin who was
improperly detained in that city.</div>
<a name="09061647000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
argument advanced was that the measures would help address the source
of organised crime. As the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
says in its evidence to the
Committee,</div><a name="09061647000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is unclear why, if agendas unconnected with immigration control are
part of the CTA reforms, Government overlooked mentioning this in the
CTA consultation documents, it is also unclear how the proposed routine
immigration control activity on the land border &#145;targeting
non-CTA nationals&#146;, could in any way address crime or security
issues that are, on experience, much more likely to involve British and
Irish
citizens.&#148;</div><a name="09061647000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
my experience&#151;a little dated now&#151;of seeing the nature of
serious organised crime, particularly that of petrol smuggling across
the border, either United Kingdom or Irish citizens were certainly the
commissioners and executors of that scale of
crime.</div><a name="09061647000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the land border is to be policed properly, the Northern Ireland Human
Rights Commission also raised concerns about the implications and
whether the powers would be reminiscent of emergency-type powers that
could act contrary to the normalisation of security arrangements under
the Belfast agreement. Conservative Members oppose such a move. The
scrapping of the common travel area and the placing of new burdens on
those travelling between different parts of the United 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>Kingdom, and between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands, and the
Isle of Man and, above all, the Irish Republic would be bad for
business and an inconvenience to passengers and would, in any case,
prove unworkable.</div>
<a name="09061647000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government say that such a provision will help fight crime. We do not
believe that it would do so to a significant degree, nor do we believe
that its impact would justify the measure. We believe strongly that,
whatever potential benefits the amendment might bring, the Government
have signally failed to explain their case, either on the record or by
any other means. If there are to be distinctions between means of entry
under the Bill, by which I mean if legislation bringing in increased
controls is to apply exclusively to arrival by sea and air, that will
surely encourage travellers to favour land routes between the Irish
Republic and Northern Ireland. It must be the case that would-be
terrorists or members of criminal gangs who already favour the land
route would continue to do so, and it calls into question the logic of
scrapping a CTA for air and sea travel. Furthermore, the impact on
those carriers who operate between the north and the south would be
substantial. Any additional burden placed on travellers will again
drive them to use the land route, which, in effect, could not be
policed.</div>
<a name="09061647000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither the
noble Lord West in another place nor the Minister here has made a clear
enough case for such a change in the law to persuade us to accept the
Government&#146;s amendments. Do they have evidence that is more
substantial than the line used by Lord West that there are some people
of interest in international counter-terrorism? If so, we really need
to do better than that and to know and understand matters. We can then
get a proper handle on why the measure is being brought forward. If the
issue is so important, why is the measure being rushed through now
rather than being brought forward under another Bill that will permit
more time for consideration and allow it to find its place with the
other measures that have been postponed for examination?</div>
<a name="09061647000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale alluded to expense. The benefits are unquantified
and unquantifiable, but some of the costs have been identified. The
wide-ranging estimate of border control staff costs is between
&#163;2.5 million to &#163;4.5 million each year. If
there was to be an attempt to make the measure work by policing a land
border properly, the figures would rocket upwards. The reduced output
to tourism over the medium term due to reduced travel is estimated at
approximately &#163;43.5 million over 10 years. If the measure
resulted in queues and inconvenience at airports and seaports, in
particular for the Channel Islands where tourism is such a vital part
of their industry, the scale of that damage could be significantly
understated in the impact
assessment.</div><a name="09061647000254"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09061647000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister stressed that his proposed changes do not affect leave to
remain but simply add an element of control. The Government have
consistently taken opportunities to increase control and to accrue
powers to the state. The Minister underestimates the distaste that our
citizens now have for the constant demands for further paperwork and
further forms of identity as they go about their business within their
own borders. That should apply no less to our citizens&#151;fellow
subjects&#151;from Northern Ireland than to those from anywhere else
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>the United Kingdom. As expressed in the debates in another place,
Northern Ireland is as much part of the United Kingdom as Surrey or
Lancashire. There may well be benefits to the police or to customs
officials if they could insist on seeing paperwork from travellers
between those counties, but it would be the most enormous affront to
their residence. The same applies to those in Northern Ireland, who
face the prospect of an age-old travel regime being ripped up without
satisfactory
justification.</div><a name="09061647000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers of search that apply at our ports and airports are not
inconsequential, as I am sure the Minister knows from closely following
the debate when the new code of practice for examining officers was
recently revised and approved by statutory instrument. The power for
further passport checks adds to feelings among ordinary passengers that
they are going about their business under a cloud of suspicion. Also,
with this Government, when new laws bringing in new controls are
introduced, there is a tendency for them to be extended, for their
scope to be enlarged and for the powers to be abused. Mission creep is
endemic to the Government&#146;s approach to law and order and
counter-terrorism. The Opposition Benches are properly sceptical, and
sadly we must be no less sceptical when organised crime and terrorism
are cited as the reasons for a new measure without satisfactory
evidence. The Government have lost the benefit of the doubt in this
area. That is, by the way, another reason why we need a new Government
with a new
mandate.</div><a name="09061647000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have considered the financial aspects of the measures, but we have to
present an alternative to meet the concerns expressed by the
Government. Obviously, that would be improving the external boundaries
of the common travel area in co-operation with the authorities of the
Irish Republic and of the Crown dependencies. Why can we not follow
that alternative route? Should it not be possible to put in place
controls in the Republic of Ireland? They could be satisfactory, so
that fraud such as the one that the Minister adduced from the <i class="I">Daily
Express</i> can be properly identified&#151;accepting that that one
was properly identified.</div>
<a name="09061647000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely there
is no lack of willingness on the part of the Irish authorities to
co-operate in that area. The Minister has already told the Committee
that they are concerned about illegal immigration into the Republic of
Ireland from the United Kingdom. Surely that is an area of obvious
common interest. Setting up the proper e-Borders scheme for both the
United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland would achieve the objectives
set out by the Government. That is an obvious alternative strategy for
us to
pursue.</div><a name="09061647000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to conclude by asking the Minister to tell us why he sees the
steps in the measures as so critical. Are there reasons that he has not
yet been prepared to share with the Committee? The amendment
effectively scraps the common travel area, discriminates between
different British subjects and burdens the residents of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man, as well as citizens of the Irish Republic
and Northern Ireland. It would end the long-established principle of
the common travel area and it would do so at significant cost, for the
Government and the travel industry. Now is hardly the time to be
undermining tourist operators embraced by the common travel area across
the United Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland and the Channel
Islands.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000340"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I start by reassuring the Minister that although in
an earlier exchange he referred to Liberal Democrat party policy on
immigration being libertarian, I know that he actually knows it is
nothing of the sort: it is firm, fair and effective. I would not want
his suggestion to stay on the record without my challenging it. That is
why we have long campaigned to reimpose the exit controls to which the
Minister referred earlier.</div>
<a name="09061647000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Reigate, who gave a passionate
defence of the common travel area. It was only slightly marred,
perhaps, by his original reference to sinking ships in the Falklands,
although he recovered his position slightly in his latter reference to
that. He had many valid points that I shall not seek to go over again.
However, the Minister, opening the debate on this clause, underlined
the close</div>
<a name="09061647000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social,
economic and cultural
ties&#148;</div><a name="09061647000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
exist between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. He
recognised that, but regrettably the measures that he proposes do not
seem to take those ties into consideration&#151;or, certainly, the
considerable social and economic impact that these proposals will have.
That is even though those impacts have been carefully identified; the
cost to tourism, for instance, is clearly listed, as are the staffing
costs. There is recognition, then, that these proposals have an impact,
which is documented; yet the Government are seeking to proceed with
them in any case.</div>
<a name="09061647000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
clearly will impact significantly on ethnic minority communities, and I
believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale will also seek to
take part in the debate on this clause, perhaps with a more personal
angle on the matter that we are discussing, the common travel area.
However, we have concerns on, for instance, the proposals for a very
restrictive list of documents that would be acceptable&#151;notably,
just a passport or identity card. We are also concerned about the
potential for a criminal offence to be created or made if someone
travelling refuses to produce documents.</div>
<a name="09061647000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
the fact that the Government have given some assurances over there
being no fixed checkpoints on the land border, but like the hon. Member
for Reigate, I should like further clarification on precisely what sort
of targeted operations it will be possible to mount in a border area
that the hon. Gentleman knows much better than I, but which is clearly
fluid. There is a lot of travel, but the precise location of the border
is not necessarily known and many participants in criminal activities
are, indeed, British or Irish citizens, so some clarity from the
Government of precisely how they think these targeted operations will
be able to deliver might provide some reassurance. The costs, as the
hon. Gentleman has outlined, of the infrastructure that might be
required to implement this may well have been significantly
underestimated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="09061647000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
further point to which I hope the Minister might be able to respond. As
he knows, we have our differences on some aspects of the e-Borders
system but if the Republic of Ireland develops its system alongside the
developments in ours, does that create the potential for reducing
checks at any point in future? Our position is that the Minister has
said and done nothing in his opening remarks that leads us to believe
that the clause should be removed in the way that he wishes. Unless he
can provide clarification of an outstanding nature, I suspect that we
will join the Conservatives in a Division, should the matter be pressed
to a vote.</div>
<a name="09061647000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061647000341"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Anderson</b> (Blaydon) (Lab): I want to talk
specifically about the situation of the land bordering Northern
Ireland. As someone who has spent much of the last 20 years working in
Northern Ireland, I am pleased by the progress that is being made. One
of the great experiences of the last 10 years has been the fact that
every time someone travels from Northern Ireland to the Republic, they
no longer have to go through the checkpoints and controls that were
once there. Despite the fact that the CTA was in place, it was routine
for people to be stopped and searched. That was not because there was
immigration control down that side; it was because it was our soldiers
who had to do that. One of the great things is that that no longer
happens. However, even with those things in place, there was clearly an
easily accessible border, particularly for those who committed acts of
terrorism. People were going backwards and forwards across the border
with relative ease, even under those circumstances.</div>
<a name="09061647000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the last
four years, until January, I served on the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee. Two years ago, we produced a report into serious organised
crime, working with the security forces from north and south of the
border, and from this side of the Irish sea. The difference between the
Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, and the Republic and Northern
Ireland, is the very porous border. It is not only fuel that comes over
the border, although illegal fuel smuggling has reduced. That is mainly
because there is no longer the financial incentive, due to the coming
together of the price of fuel in the Republic and in Northern Ireland,
which is now much closer than it was two, three or four years
ago.</div>
<a name="09061647000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Along with
fuel, there were massive amounts of cigarettes, both real and
counterfeit, and huge amounts of alcohol, particularly alcohol that had
been laundered and was dangerous&#151;even more dangerous than the
alcohol most of us partake in. There were surprising things such as
washing powder, huge amounts of which were being brought across the
border and being sold on the cheap. It was not genuine. The boxes said
what it was, but there were dubious articles inside. There was a huge
traffic. There were also serious concerns about the amount of people
who were being brought across the border due to people trafficking and,
although not listed in the figures, there was a worry about illegal
immigration.</div>
<a name="09061647000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
real issues that must be looked into. Those activities are happening
despite the fact that we have probably the best co-operation anywhere
in the world between the police force in Northern Ireland and the
people in the Garda. Bodies work together at every level. Security
bodies work together but this is still going on. The situation is very
different from that in the rest of the country, and it must be looked
at.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div><a name="09061647000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
that have been raised are real, and we must look at the practicality of
what is being proposed. The Minister has been talking about specific
intelligence, but the response given in the House of Lords when the
Minister in the other place was pressed on what he meant and what would
happen in practice, was that we would</div>
<a name="09061647000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;target the odd
bus, minibus or taxi, because our experience has shown that those are
much more likely to be a threat&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 1 April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1100.]</div><a name="09061647000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
might work a little, but will it really get to grips with the problem?
If the border is as porous as many of us believe, how will we make a
real impact in practice? Unless the Minister intends to do this
seriously&#151;and nobody is suggesting that we have total control of
the border&#151;the reality is that we will waste our time. We need
to look at that.</div>
<a name="09061647000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">An issue has
been raised by the hon. Member for Reigate about the possibility of
racial profiling. That causes real concern to those of us in the House
who are interested in human rights. The experience from Northern
Ireland, where ad hoc checks have been going on for some time, has seen
human rights bodies, from both sides of the border, raise concerns
about the fact that people are being profiled, stopped and asked
questions simply on the basis of the colour of their skin. That is
something that I hope this Administration will never support.</div>
<a name="09061647000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
real need to do this and to do it right. However, in doing so, we must
ensure that we respect the fact that there are practicality issues and
that we get the balance right. However, we also have to be clear that
we do not want to undermine the confidence that we have built up during
the past decade among the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.
Not everyone who lives in Northern Ireland wants to be part of the
United Kingdom. A significant minority in that part of the world do not
want to be part of the United Kingdom and we have to respect that, as
well as respecting the views of the other
side.</div><a name="09061647000255"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000342"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> In considering new legislation, it is incumbent on
all of us to weigh up the advantages and to consider how the proposals
presented in the Bill deliver on their stated purpose. From this
morning&#146;s debate and the debate in the other place, it is clear
that the Government have patently failed to explain to us the benefits
of the changes to the common travel area.</div>
<a name="09061647000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The costs
have been clearly quantified&#151;between &#163;2.5
million and &#163;4.5 million in increased staffing costs on border
controls and &#163;43.5 million in loss of tourism&#151;but the
Minister has patently failed to give us any quantifiable measure of the
reduction in reported asylum cases, illegal migrants or cross-border
crime. If the Minister cannot quantify what the benefits will be,
perhaps he would be good enough to give us the figures for the past ten
years in terms of asylum seekers who have travelled via Ireland or the
Channel Islands to the UK.</div>
<a name="09061647000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000343"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is the
point.</div><a name="09061647000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000344"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The point is that such figures cannot be
given.</div><a name="09061647000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000345"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is precisely because we cannot give the
hon. Gentleman that figure that we want the powers to be able to give
it to him in future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="09061647000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000346"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> When we are considering legislation that will lead
to increased costs to the Government and losses in terms of employment
and tourism, that is simply not good enough. There must be some sort of
figure. Both Ireland and the UK operate within the common travel area
and are outside the Schengen agreement. Indeed, as has been said, the
common travel area predates the Schengen agreement. We operate a common
border, so we rely on existing border controls in Ireland and the
Channel Islands to stop illegal migrants.</div>
<a name="09061647000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are seriously saying that those border controls are
inadequate and do not stop illegal immigrants and asylum seekers, what
has the Minister been doing for the past few years in terms of working
with our Irish counterparts or the Governments in Guernsey and Jersey
to ensure that those borders are secure? That is clearly not the point.
This measure is a total overreaction to a problem. The Government are
trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer and unless the Minister can
quantify the size of the nut, such measures are clearly
unacceptable.</div>
<a name="09061647000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak as
someone who is half Irish and who spent most of my early years
travelling between Ireland and England every year. As the hon. Member
for Reigate said, the sorts of control on which the Minister is
insisting will completely destroy the common travel area. If he
seriously wants to do something about stopping illegal immigrants and
obtaining more information on the matter, there is a way around the
problem, which was outlined in the other place in an answer that Lord
West
gave:</div><a name="09061647000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Outside
the CTA reforms we are also considering other changes. Under Section 14
of the Police and Justice Act 2006, the police have the power to
require carriers to provide passenger data on specified domestic air
and sea routes. That power could be extended to cover routes between
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 4 March 2009; Vol. 708, c.
768-9)</div><a name="09061647000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to the Minister that at far less cost to the travel industry and
to the convenience of travellers between Ireland, the Channel Islands
and Northern Ireland, the Government could implement section 14 of the
Police and Justice Act 2006. That, coupled with the establishment of a
unified border police, which is our party&#146;s policy, as well as
Conservative policy, would provide the Government with the intelligence
they need to prevent people from entering this country if there is
reason to suggest that such people are doing so illegally. The controls
already exist in the common travel area, operated by the Irish
Government and the Channel Island Governments, to prevent illegal
immigrants. Those controls, and working with our partners in Ireland
and the Channel Islands and using the Criminal Justice Acts, would give
all the powers the Government need to resolve what is so far an
unquantifiable problem. If they cannot quantify it, one is tempted to
ask whether it really exists.</div>
<a name="09061647000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000347"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Member for Ashford said in his opening
remarks in our first sitting that we would deal with the consensual
sections of the Bill first, and move to the more contentious ones next
week&#151;that is, today. His prophesy has proved correct.</div>
<a name="09061647000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Reigate said that I failed to produce a convincing argument.
I put it to you, Sir Nicholas, that the hon. Gentleman has failed to
listen to a convincing argument. He has come here with a predetermined
view, so I shall try to repeat the main points of the
argument.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="09061647000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that either he had and the other place had
misunderstood, or the Government had failed to put forward an argument.
My contention, quite genuine and heartfelt, is that the arguments being
put against our proposals are not fair because they address proposals
that we have not put. They are based on a misunderstanding, as Lord
West outlined in his closing remarks, in column 1111 of <i class="I">Hansard
</i>in the other
place.</div><a name="09061647000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall dissect the main arguments. The accusation is made that we are
abolishing the common travel area. The CTA is about freedom of movement
for Irish nationals and British and UK citizens between those two
countries and the dependencies&#151;the islands. The CTA remains in
place; that freedom of movement continues to exist. The power we are
seeking from the Houses of Parliament is the power to require
documentation for the purposes of proof of legitimacy of leave of entry
to Ireland or the UK, in order that we can identify third-country
nationals who do not have leave to remain. The power does not entitle
my officials to stop a legitimate person travelling. It requires the
person to produce identification; it does not give officials the power
to stop that freedom of movement if the person has leave to enter the
UK or the Republic of Ireland. The central principle of the CTA, which
has existed since 1920, remains. That is the first
point.</div><a name="09061647000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the hon. Member for Reigate says that there is a gaping hole in our UK
border&#151;the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic
of Ireland. His solution to that gaping hole is to fill it with
nothing, and instead to say that the problem I am trying to solve does
not actually exist. It is incumbent on me to show that it
does.</div><a name="09061647000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the hon. Gentleman says that the solution to the problem is to work
with the Republic of Ireland to ensure that the external border of the
CTA is protected by the electronic borders system. Yet his party
opposes that system&#151;it is okay to have it in the Republic of
Ireland, but not to have it in the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="09061647000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000348"></a>Damian
Green:</b> That is one of the many things the Minister
misquotes. He ignores the fact that his Government removed controls
between Britain and other EU countries in 1998. He also wilfully
misstates the position when he says that we oppose the e-borders
system. We oppose the fact that it is being implemented in the most
intrusive way possible on innocent British tourists, but we do not
oppose the principle of checking people in and
out.</div><a name="09061647000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000349"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Once again, we see the Conservative party trying
to reconcile its authoritarian instinct with its liberal appeal. The
hon. Gentleman said, although he was not prepared to put it in these
words, that he supports the electronic borders system. He then went on
to say that he opposes intrusion on the innocent. How am I to identify
the innocent? How am I to do that in practice, without the very limited
pieces of information that he calls on the Republic of Ireland to have,
but not the citizens of the United Kingdom? In attempting to square the
circle, the Conservative policy has become preposterous. The hon.
Gentleman requires the protection of the United Kingdom border to be
incumbent on an electronic borders system that contains information on
individuals travelling to the Republic of Ireland, when he is not
prepared to have that system for our own country. I cannot go to
Parliament with that proposition. It is not feasible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="09061647000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further, the
hon. Member for Reigate says that the proposal failed to be justified
in the other place. He misses out a central fact that Lord West put on
the record in summing up that debate, and which I used in my opening
remarks. That fact has been completely ignored in the speeches opposing
the proposals. I suspect that Members wrote those speeches before they
had heard the argument, which is that what we propose for our side of
the common travel area has been in place in the Republic of Ireland for
10 years. Lord West
stated:</div><a name="09061647000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Republic of Ireland introduced border controls in 1997 so that third
country nationals travelling from within the common travel
area&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061647000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
United
Kingdom&#151;</div><a name="09061647000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
the republic, by air or sea, must present a passport or ID
card.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 April
2009; Vol. 709, c.
1111.]</div><a name="09061647000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
measure has existed in the Republic of Ireland for third country
nationals for 10 years. The hon. Member for Rochdale says, &#147;Oh,
I like to travel to Ireland&#148;, and whips up the sentiment that
somehow the proposals will affect cultural and economic links between
the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom; they will not. The
Republic has been using those provisions for 10 years. The hon.
Gentleman calls for the protection of the United Kingdom borders to be
given over to the Republic of Ireland, but will not allow me to do what
the Republic of Ireland has been doing within the common travel area
since 1997.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000350"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but will
he also confirm that the Irish Government do not require British
citizens to present a British passport when they enter Ireland? That is
where the big difference
lies.</div><a name="09061647000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061647000351"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The requirement is that British citizens must
prove that they are British. That is usually done with a passport, but
other documents are accepted, and that is what I propose. The fact that
the hon. Gentleman does not notice anything as he moves in and out of
the Republic of Ireland shows that my proposals would not cause the
practical disruption to the travelling public that other people fear.
In the real world, the carriers&#151;the airlines and the sea
routes&#151;want to have passports or another form of ID, precisely
so that people cannot bulk-buy cheap tickets and flog them down the
pub. That is what happens in the real
world.</div><a name="09061647000214"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061653000058"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I suspect that you would agree with me, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="09061653000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
read-across. Let us be clear, we are talking about immigration. I will
come to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon in a moment, as I wish to
agree strongly with what he has said.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="09061653000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, if the Northern Ireland police force, the UK Border Agency,
the Garda, the French and the south American authorities have knowledge
of a route that has opened up into the UK through the Republic of
Ireland, we do not have the power under immigration law to stop at our
border a third-country national who has come into the Republic of
Ireland illegally. That means that we have to take that burden, even
when we know or have strong reason to believe that the person is acting
illegally under immigration law. We would have to watch them. The hon.
Member for Ashford looks puzzled, but it goes on every week of the
year. At the moment, if we are aware of some operation going on across
the land border, we do not have the power to stop people at the border,
although we do in other areas, as he
said.</div><a name="09061653000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon is right. When the Home
Affairs Committee looked at gasoline smuggling, it called for powers to
stop people at the border based on specific intelligence-led
operations. That is exactly the point that I am making in relation
to immigration, but of course sentiment is being
whipped
up.</div><a name="09061653000007"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061653000060"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Member for Blaydon
intervenes, I feel that I must put on the record that, whatever
personal views I hold, in the Chair I am scrupulously impartial and
will always be
so.</div><a name="09061653000009"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061653000061"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> I want to confirm what the Minister said with
regard to travelling not just to the Republic of Ireland, where people
have to travel with a passport. When we were travelling from Newcastle
to Belfast, we were advised to take our passports with us, even though
Northern Ireland is within the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="09061653000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that the Minister reminded me about the Home Affairs Committee.
During our discussions in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee about
the size of the problems across the border faced by the Serious
Organised Crime Agency, a suggestion was advanced by Northern Ireland
Members that we bring the rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland
down to that in the Republic. That was supported by Conservative
members of the Committee, which shows how big the issue
is.</div><a name="09061653000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061653000062"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point and brings
pragmatic experience to
bear.</div><a name="09061653000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall turn quickly to the various examples I was asked about. This is
not some academic debate. We have not put up some patsy because we want
to have a controversial debate; it is an attempt to strengthen our
border.</div><a name="09061653000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must be fair to Committee members. A number of questions were asked, so
I shall try to answer them. It is already an offence under the 1971 Act
to refuse to provide documents without reasonable excuse. We have made
it clear that we will not require documents on the land border or from
Crown dependencies, so there would be reasonable excuse in such
cases.</div><a name="09061653000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Reigate asked about the progress made with Jersey. We
have ongoing discussions on the memorandum of understanding with the
other islands. There was a meeting yesterday. We are inviting Jersey to
take part in those discussions, so that the memorandum
of understanding on the practices and practical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>arrangements can be agreed, and we hope that Jersey
responds, but the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about the current
position.</div><a name="09061653000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was made about people trafficking. There are a number of
instances when, with the limited powers we have already, we have
apprehended people, which backs up the points I am making. I will give
Committee members some intelligence and information. To refer to a
question put earlier, there are approximately 15.4 million
passenger movements between the Republic of Ireland and the United
Kingdom and the Crown dependencies by air and sea. I acknowledge that
it is a huge
issue.</div><a name="09061653000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the exploitation of illegal immigration, we have been carrying out
pilot studies on the powers. Just to give Committee members some
snapshots, in one week in January 2007, 158 offenders who did not
qualify for entry to the UK were identified at Belfast, Londonderry,
Dublin, Holyhead, Liverpool airport and Rosslare port. The north-west
port team refused eight passengers further leave to enter on one day,
in the operation we conducted in Holyhead in April 2009. Those are
examples of the daily bread and butter work of the UKBA, in identifying
third party nationals who are abusing that route.</div>
<a name="09061653000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
assurances have been sought about the application of equal rights,
about discrimination and so on. Of course, we are committed to the
application of equal rights and we are banned by law from
discriminating. That approach is adopted across the ports and airports
of the UK and indeed across our juxtaposed controls in France and
Belgium.</div>
<a name="09061653000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
have answered the questions about the Crown dependencies in relation to
Jersey. We are seeking to get memorandums of understanding. Of course,
our main concern is the Republic of Ireland, and I hope that I have put
forward convincing arguments that the CTA is being maintained. I
believe that the strength of feeling on the issue reflects a
misunderstanding and that is the point that the change to the CTA is
addressing. The change is not addressing the right of movement of
people with legitimate right to be in the Republic of Ireland or the
UK, but of third-country non-EEA nationals who do not have that
right.</div>
<a name="09061653000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
contention, as Lord West outlined in the other place, is that there is
a loophole in our border controls. There is a suggestion that we should
rely exclusively on co-operation with the Republic of Ireland, but if I
were to suggest that in relation to, say, France, a country with which
we also have good relationships, I suspect that I would not remain the
Minister for Borders and Immigration much longer. I certainly will not
do so for much longer if I do not draw my remarks to a conclusion,
because the Government Whip, my hon. Friend to my right, is urging me
to allow the Committee to make its decision.</div>
<a name="09061653000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have put my
argument, I have answered the questions and I hope that the Committee
supports
me.</div><a name="09061653000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061653000079"></a>Damian
Green:</b> These are fast-moving times and later in my remarks
I shall come to what the new Further Education Minister said to the
Select Committee on Home Affairs this morning, as I have been apprised
of that. I am delighted that the Government are thinking along the same
lines as one of our amendments&#151;as they should be, of course,
with all our amendments. The issue of student visas is clearly hugely
important, as the Minister has acknowledged. There have been several
scandals in recent years. In a sense it is hardly surprising.</div>
<a name="09061653000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
amendments and a new clause in the group, and I shall divide the group
in two: amendment 57 deals with one issue, and amendment 58
and new clause 10 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>deal with another. However, they have a common background, which is
worth setting out, as it concerns numbers, and the sheer scale of
potential abuse of the
system.</div><a name="09061653000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Between
2004 and 2008 nearly 825,000 student visas were issued, and in 2007
alone 358,000 non-EEA students were admitted to the UK. That is an
increase of 16 per cent. on the previous year. Student cases were the
largest group of after-entry visa decisions in 2007, accounting for 37
per cent. of the total number of about 145,000 people. In that context
it is interesting to see what percentage were successful, and the
answer for 2006 was 66 per cent. of applicants for student visas. An
estimate from Universities UK&#151;the Minister may have better
figures at his disposal&#151;is that 25 per cent. of appeals against
the initial decision are successful. That suggests that there are
significant problems in the entry clearance
system.</div><a name="09061653000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that there will be any division in the Committee about the
idea that we are all supportive of foreign students; certainly UK
universities are, not least because of the revenue that those students
bring, but we are also supportive of them as a country. Conservative
MPs often make the point that one purpose&#151;perhaps the main
one&#151;of the immigration system should be to enable Britain to
attract its fair share, or perhaps more than its fair share, of the
brightest and best from around the world, to support and promote our
economic growth.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div><a name="09061653000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
universities play an extremely large part in that, by introducing some
of the brightest students from around the world to this country, a
proportion of whom will inevitably want to make their life here. Even
without that longer-term advantage, the Home Office estimates that in
2007 international students contributed &#163;8.5 billion to the UK
economy each year. That is a very positive background against which the
many serious problems that emerge need to be addressed.</div>
<a name="09061653000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has described the student visa system as the Achilles heel of the
immigration system. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> He says that
he was talking about the old system. He is in the throes of introducing
a new one, which may or may not improve it, but he and I would
certainly agree that the system that he describes as the old
one&#151;which is of course the one he and his predecessors have
operated for the past 12 years&#151;is the Achilles heel of the
immigration
system.</div><a name="09061653000050"></a>
