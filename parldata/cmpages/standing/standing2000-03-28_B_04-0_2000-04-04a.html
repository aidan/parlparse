</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Good morning, Mr. Stevenson, and welcome back to the Chair. In your absence, your fellow Chairman, Mr. O'Hara got us through a little more business on Thursday.
<P>
We come now to local access forums. The Opposition are puzzled. It was mentioned several times on Second Reading that the Bill makes no mention of local access forums, yet they played a significant part in the Government's consultation proposals. Indeed, the Minister for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton, said on Second Reading that they were not included in the Bill. The purpose of the Opposition amendments is to probe the Minister on the Government's intentions and to ask why local access forums are not mentioned in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 would insert the definition of a local access forum. Amendments Nos. 93 to 96 relate to the role of those bodies, including forbidding access to land until it is declared access land and until the measures are in place. Amendment No. 96 would give the forum control over whether access land is needed.
<P>
The question arises of who should be members of local access forums. The Minister said clearly on Second Reading—at column 723—that farmers and landowners would be represented. In his reply to the debate, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions stressed the importance of local access forums. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is important not to push such matters through in the teeth of local opposition, but to ensure that all local interests are properly represented. Some hon. Members asked who would be on the forums. The people whose rights will be affected must of course be represented.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c.814.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We entirely concur with the Under-Secretary, but we are puzzled by the absence of any mention of that in the Bill. I would not wish to be branded as a cynic, although I might sometimes brand myself as such, but, as we all know, there is a great deal of difference between what Ministers say and what happens in real life.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Not under New Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary will need to have been in Government for a little longer before being rash enough to make such statements.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): He will need to join new Labour first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Yes, when he joins new Labour. He is all for telling the banks what to do, so he clearly has yet to make that progression.
<P>
In any Administration, Ministers may make comments and statements in debate, but what results is often dissimilar to what was said and to the commitments given. That is why it is important that local access forums should be included in the Bill. Amendment No. 88 suggests that membership of the forums should include representatives of farmers and landowners—and of walkers—in the area of the access land. That seems a fair balance. It does not go into the narrow detail of how many people should be on the body, or how it should be funded. Those issues are important, but secondary to the principle. Will the Minister explain why the Government have decided not to mention the details to which I have referred? If he cannot do so does he accept that they should be included and properly explained?
<P>
I should like to quote the words of two or three outside organisations that have commented on the fact that local access forums are not mentioned in the Bill. The Country Landowners Association, which worked closely with the Government on the matter, has expressed support for amendments Nos. 88 and 93 to 96. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Amendment 88 will prompt a debate on the composition of local access forums, not mentioned in the Bill as drafted, and raises the valid point that such forums should contain representatives of farmers, landowners and walkers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state that amendments Nos. 94 to 96
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have considerable merit, because they would require that the necessary steps to make access workable should be put in place before the right of access is brought into effect in a particular area, and would require the Countryside Agency to introduce access in accordance with the strength of demand for access in that area. In effect, the amendments would require the Agency to prioritise implementation of the Bill in line with demand.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a sensible way to proceed.
<P>
The British Association for Shooting and Conservation has also expressed support for amendment No. 88, which, in its words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>raises the important issue of proper representation on local access forums.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The National Farmers Union states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The NFU believes that Local Access Forums could be a useful vehicle for resolving local difficulty and we therefore in principle support amendments 88 and 153.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also expresses the concern about local access forums to which I referred. It points out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government's Framework for Action paper said that they should comprise representatives of ``users, landowners and managers, local authorities, local businesses, trade unions and conservation interests''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As that statement shows, the National Farmers Union shares the Opposition's puzzlement about why the Bill does not mention local access forums. It notes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the issues raised by Amendment 95 are very important. The Government has put much emphasis on the new burden on occupiers of land being balanced by dudes on users. But there is a serious prospect of unnecessary difficulties arising for occupiers if the public are not properly signed to the access land, there are byelaws in place to ensure tbat good behaviour can be enforced<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—at least in some areas—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and that there are enough wardens in place to provide advice, to troubleshoot, and if necessary enforce the law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A substantial body of opinion representing countryside interests shares our concern about the absence of any mention of local access forums in the Bill. I shall conclude my remarks, as I do not want to detain the Committee for longer than is necessary. The amendments are intended simply to try to get to the bottom of that absence and to ask why the Minister thinks it wise not to deal with the matter in primary legislation. I reserve my judgment on the conclusion of the debate, but I hope that the Minister will assure us of the Government's good intentions and accept the amendments or explain why he believes that they are unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): I want only to endorse the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). I was going to pray in aid the organisations to which he referred, which have responded to the proposals responsibly and sensibly, as I hope that the Government will agree. I hope that Ministers understand the importance of allowing those responsible for ensuring the viability and sound management of the uplands to have confidence in the regime. I hope that I am right in believing that the Minister, when meeting several delegations, has made it plain that the Bill is intended to provide a balance between the rights granted to walkers and the protection and restrictions that will be necessary to ensure effective management. I have no reason to disbelieve his good faith in the matter.
<P>
The regime will work only if there is confidence in the way in which the rules and regulations are enforced. It was a mistake for the Government to have introduced the Bill without clearly spelling out the necessary arrangements for the organisation and running of the forums. I hope that, in his reply, the Under-Secretary will not only give the detailed make-up and shape of the committees, but say how it is intended to incorporate them in the Bill. We might wish to return to the subject and examine it in greater detail.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I shall speak to amendments Nos. 167, 187, 191, 199 and new clause 2, which stand in my name.
<P>
We all recognise that local access fora are crucial to the operation of the Bill. Incidentally, we must establish what the plural of forum is, so that we all use the same word. Authorities that already have responsibility for public access to open land recognise the necessity of providing an opportunity to get representatives of landowners, agriculture, recreational interests and conservationists into a room where they can discuss matters and come to a modus vivendi. It is therefore surprising that there is no mention in the Bill of such an integral part of the process.
<P>
If I have a quarrel with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, it is that it also does not place a duty on anyone to create the fora—it simply states what they shall be, if they exist. It is essential that each access authority has a duty to create a local access forum in which such matters might be considered. New clause 2 would place a specific duty on the access authority—the highway authority or the national park authority—to create a local access forum. My other amendments would require local access fora to be consulted.
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's reply on what was clearly a clearly deliberate act of omission. It is not by happenstance that there is no reference to local access fora, given the importance that has been attached to them. Clearly, there has been advice that they should not be referred to in the Bill and we need to know why. In the absence of any explicit reference in the Bill, what will happen in areas where the access authority chooses not to establish a forum and decides to do what it pleases on the basis that its knowledge of the countryside under its control is superior to that of everybody else? There is no sanction and nothing to require an authority to take into account other views or to attempt to find an accommodation between conflicting land uses other than a requirement to establish a forum.
<P>
The other amendments in the group take us back to the issue of resources. Key to the successful application of the Bill is whether there will be adequate signage, whether sufficient effort will be put in to make the arrangements work and the extent to which local authorities will be prepared to invest in wardens. In that respect, the experience of previous rights of way is not a happy one. In many parts of the country, local authorities do not take seriously their duties in respect of rights of way and they do not make substantial investments in providing signs and access, and patrolling and policing rights of way. That is a constant problem for people who want to exercise their right to walk along such paths.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Unless we are explicit about what we expect access authorities to do, and unless the Government provide the resources to enable them to carry out their responsibilities, the Bill will not work. My quarrel with amendment No. 95 is that it disbars access in the absence of the necessary certifications from the appropriate body. That is not the right approach, which is why I do not support the amendment in its present form. I hope that the Minister will clearly state what resources will be provided and what measures will be introduced to ensure that resources are used effectively to provide the signage, wardens and byelaws that will make the Bill effective and prevent the sort of casual dispute that many of us are concerned will be engendered by the lacunae in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> First, I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said on the importance of local access forums—it is an English word and should have an ``s'' at the end, but there is some debate on the matter—as well as the remarks of the Minister and Under-Secretary on the same issue. Therefore, I endorse hon. Members' puzzlement about why such forums should not be mentioned in the Bill.
<P>
In that context, it might be helpful if I give the Committee some insight into how an embryonic forum is operating in Wiltshire, where the Wiltshire access pilot scheme working group has been set up—not an attractive title, but the notion of a pilot scheme is a good one. The forum has met three times. It has been attended by the CLA, NFU, Ramblers Association and, I am pleased to say, by the Countryside Agency, which is considering the group as an exemplar that other counties might follow, and which might develop into the type of forum that we have been discussing this morning.
<P>
The CLA says that the group is working extremely well and that the Ramblers Association, the NFU and the CLA are working well together and setting an example of good practice. However, the CLA makes it plain that it simply does not see how such a forum can be established elsewhere, except by legislation. There must be legislation to require such forums to be set up, which can bring together disparate organisations, bang their heads together and tell them to work together to produce a reasonable programme of access to land.
<P>
The CLA also raises an important point about Wiltshire county council's rights of way forum. It describes it as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A body which was good in principle but had no teeth—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
mainly because of a lack of cash. Ministers have made no comment so far about who should pay for local access forums. Two lessons can be learned from Wiltshire—which, as in so many other areas, leads the country—because the Countryside Agency believes that it presents a good example of what can be done.
<P>
First, the local access forums must be established in legislation, otherwise they will not work. Secondly, if the rights of way forums are anything to go by, they must be given teeth, and the only way to do that is by giving them cash and some means of carrying out their function. Therefore, it is incumbent on Ministers to explain why there is no mention of local access forums in the Bill when, on Second Reading and elsewhere, they have given them such importance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): With regard to these fora—[Interruption.] I was taught Latin at school, though not to a high level. These particular meetings of people are a key area of the Bill and without repeating earlier thoughts, I think that they must be set up with adequate representation of all interested parties in order to preserve, or rather, perhaps, to achieve, the all important balance upon which the success or otherwise of the Bill will turn.
<P>
On Second Reading I said that in my former life as a lawyer I brokered agreements between local farmers on the Aran mountains in my constituency and ramblers. To do that, we all had to sit down around a table together, discuss the issue reasonably and exchange views. I am pleased to report that those agreements have stood the test of time and are still in place today, 20 years later. If we take the views of all concerned into account on an equal basis, the Bill will work, so this is an important area.
<P>
If the Bill is to stand the test of time, there must be fora for reasonable and reasoned debate. I understand that at present the role of the fora is the subject of research being carried out by the Countryside Agency. As the Bill has been a long time in development—it was not first thought of last year—I should have required that it would at least contain a reference to the precise nature of fora. As has been said, it is amazing that there is no more details on the fora on the face of the Bill given that they are the key to the Bill's success.
<P>
In the copious—although not altogether helpful—notes prepared by the Government, there is precious little, if any, reference to the fora. What will be their composition, their purpose, their duties, their obligations, and so on. I hope that they will not be a sop to those who might be aggrieved, merely providing them with an opportunity to let off steam without having any real powers. If the Bill is to make sense, it is important that these fora have teeth and adequately represent all interests. As much as any other, the local voice must be an integral part of the mapping process, the negotiation procedure and, in the event, dispute resolution as well.
<P>
If the fora are perceived as unrepresentative they will not work. For example, if farming interests are represented by union officials parachuted in from afar, or if the walkers are represented by officials from the Ramblers Association, the fora will not work because they will be considered as bodies that have been imposed on the local area. Imposition from the centre is not a good idea. Perhaps, I need not dwell on that, bearing in mind the former First Secretary's rapid departure from the Welsh Assembly. Perhaps the Government understand now that parachuting officials in is not always the answer. The point is that the fora must be local and must reflect all the local expertise. Consent and agreement should have primacy. National criteria can then be added to that vital foundation.
<P>
I hope that groups such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds are well represented on the fora. Otherwise, the Bill may pose a grave threat to ground-nesting birds such as stone curlews, ordinary curlews, merlins, golden plover and other birds about which we shall hear a lot more later during our discussion of the Bill. The matter is of vital importance: no Committee member or anyone else in Britain would like those species to disappear, but they will be endangered unless we are very careful. I am no expert, but others, including the RSPB, are experts on these matters and we should listen to their comments on local fora. I should refer also to the delicate matter of flora—not fora—on the uplands. Relevant sites will have to be mapped out expertly, and expert advice on them will also be needed on local fora.
<P>
It is a tall order to ensure that the forums contain the necessary balance of conservation expertise and local knowledge, but as I pointed out, it is vital to achieve such balance for the Bill to work. I am sure that the Government will take those remarks on board. As I said, I am surprised that so little is known about the composition, duties, functions and obligations of these all-important bodies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall do what I can to resolve the general puzzlement. I think, however, that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) has already done something to help us. He pointed out that a successful body is being established in his own area, and I am sure that it will become an example for others to follow.
<P>
The Countryside Agency has issued draft guidance on the role, representation and geographical coverage of the forums, in consultation with the National Access Forum. The first draft, which was published on 21 February, suggests that membership of the forums should be drawn in roughly equal numbers from four broad groups, one of which is landowners and managers. We accept that all the main interests should be represented on the forums for them to work. It would be daft not to ensure such representation. Walkers' interests, preferably at a local level, will be represented, and linked interests such as those of people involved in nature conservation will also be involved. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned the RSPB, and we cam all think of other such bodies. Independent members will also be included.
<P>
That is our general thinking. We envisage that the first access forums will be established in autumn this year. The Countryside Council for Wales is preparing guidance for local forums in Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The Under-Secretary has hit on the particular point that justified an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The amendment, which was considered last week, suggested that the matter should be devolved. So far, nobody in Wales knows anything about the composition of the fora. The Countryside Council's writ does not run in Wales, so hon. Members representing Welsh constituencies are at a distinct disadvantage in the Committee. The matter should be dealt with by the Welsh Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We shall not retread that old road; the Committee dealt with the matter last week, but I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> No, I was not here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I understand that there was a good reason for the hon. Gentleman's absence and I do not seek to take advantage of it. I refer him to the Hansard record of the debate.
<P>
The Countryside Agency's draft guidance is displayed on its internet site. I am sorry to say that I do not have a copy with me, but I shall arrange for its circulation to all hon. Members, as they might find it helpful. As was the case with dedicated access points, I suspect that there is not much difference between the two arguments being advanced.
<P>
The Government are as keen as Opposition Members for the forums to work and to represent all relevant interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that, as he said, the forums will consist of a diverse body of people, including independent members, who will be asked to sit around a table and reach conclusions? What will constitute an independent member for that purpose?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Someone who is not a representative of one of the direct interest groups—neither a landowner nor a walker—and someone who is capable of exercising common-sense judgments. There is no shortage of such people in all walks of life. I have even noticed one or two in Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionmydd Nant Conwy mentioned that he had brokered agreements in the Aran mountains. Such non-statutory agreements, have stood the test of time for more than 20 years, so we should not get hooked up on the idea that everything must be statutory in order to work. Many laws passed by Parliament end up not being taken seriously. The hon. Gentleman provides part of the answer to the problem, but there are other examples of deals that have been done to the satisfaction of all concerned. The agreements in which the hon. Gentleman was involved are an example to us all, which would repay study.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary has just made the point that many of us have been making for years. There is no need for legislation on rights of access and the right to roam, which work perfectly well by voluntary agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That is another road, down which we will not travel. Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen were generous enough to say last week that they accepted that the decision had been taken in principle, and that we are now discussing how to make it work properly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will participate in that discussion.
<P>
We expect local access forums to play an important role in advising on the operation of the new right of access. However, they will have an advisory, rather than a decision-making, role. The countryside bodies will be responsible for advising on their membership, role and operation. The Countryside Agency has already issued the draft guidance and consulted the National Access Forum for England and for Wales on the issue. We want to allow local access forums sufficient flexibility to take account of local circumstances and to meet changing needs over time.
<P>
Flexibility is important. It is unnecessary to lay down a central politically correct formula. In some cases, it might not even be necessary to have a forum, but many areas will urgently require such a body, especially where it is likely that many people will want to take up access rights. In addition, local interests will vary, so we do not want to lay down a centrally determined ideal. We want to encourage flexibility to take account of local circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> None of the amendments tries to prescribe the precise form of local forums, but I still do not understand what requirement there will be on to establish a local access forum. If a body chooses not to, who will intervene to make it happen? The Bill is silent on that issue and relies on good will. That is fine where good will exists, but it might not exist everywhere in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am prepared to go into a little more detail, but it is for the Countryside Agency to insist on the establishment of such bodies where they are thought to be desirable, which, I suspect, will be almost everywhere. Merely introducing a law that requires such bodies to be created will not make them happen. As the hon. Gentleman says, good will is required. Good will was present in the Aran mountains when the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) negotiated the agreements that have worked so well there, and I am sure that it will be present in just about every other place too, provided that everyone makes the appropriate effort.
<P>
We are keen to see proper weight given to local access forums' advice. We expect relevant decision-making authorities to have proper regard to their views in making decisions on issues such as voluntary access points, local publicity and proposals for long-term closures of access land, as well as on wider access issues, including new rights of way. In providing their views, forums will need to consider relevant national codes and guidelines issued by countryside bodies.
<P>
With regard to amendments No. 94 and 95, the countryside body should not be required to declare that land is accessible and that wardens and byelaws are in place before the new right may come into force. I am unpersuaded by the arguments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for giving forums a veto over whether the right should come into effect. I wholeheartedly endorse the case for promoting local discussion about how best to manage access on the ground, but that is entirely different from unelected representatives of a limited number of interests having the potential to frustrate the Bill's clear intention. Opposition Members frequently speak in favour in reducing the burden of regulation; we have thought it right not to increase the burden in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary correctly used the word ``unelected'' to describe the members of the access forum, but I would like to challenge him on the involvement of elected persons in making such decisions. The Countryside Agency will be responsible for mapping and sorting out what is access land, but it is no more elected than the forums will be. He is understandably and rightly concerned about non-elected people having a veto, but does an elected person have such a role anywhere in the system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As I am sure the hon. Gentleman has noticed, some elected people are taking the key decisions in relation to the right of access here in Parliament, which is the appropriate place. [Interruption.] We are talking about the detail, and it is for local interests to sort that out for themselves; we will encourage them to do that. Local authorities, on which there are many elected people, also have a part to play.
<P>
We have done everything that we can to ensure that the legislation has a light touch, of which, as I say, Opposition Members are usually in favour. We do not want to impose extra or, in some cases, unnecessary burdens on landowners, users, public agencies or local authorities. We do not envisage byelaws or wardens being needed everywhere, but recognise that they will be useful in some areas and in some circumstances. For example, they might help to promote responsible access in areas subject to most demand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary explained his reasonable expectation that local access fora will be consulted and that bodies will have regard to what they say. I can understand that there is a reasonable expectation that countryside bodies will do that in the context of clauses 10 and 11, but will he address amendment No. 199 to clause 17 on the establishment of byelaws? That would require consultation with the local access forum not by countryside bodies but by access authorities. It must be right that an access authority, before creating byelaws, should have regard to the views of the local access forum. The Bill is silent on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sure that sensible access authorities will do that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Sensible ones, yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not assume that there is so much ill will towards the arrangement. As I have said a couple of times, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has given us a good example of something that might have proved controversial but which, because of astute negotiations and common sense on the part of all the interests concerned, has led to an arrangement that has stood the test of time for more than 20 years. I have no doubt that there are others. I do not foresee some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman anticipates.
<P>
I was asked about resources. The Government have made available extra resources to local authorities and to the Countryside Agency for precisely the purpose of implementing some of the measures in the Bill. We are not suggesting that all resources for signage need come from the taxpayer. Money could be raised from other sources. People interested in opening up a particular area of land and ensuring that it is properly signposted could devise their own way of organising the signage. That could be done through the local access forums. We are anxious not to be too prescriptive as it is not necessary to lay everything out in detail. However, it is necessary to have a forum where such problems can be discussed and resolved. 
<P>
To accept the amendments would inevitably delay the introduction of the new right and risk tying the legislation up in red tape, and we are not prepared to permit that. On the desirability of the forums, the Committee is agreed. We, the Countryside Agency and the other appropriate bodies will do everything that we can to encourage the setting up of forums. However, we will not allow the introduction of the right of access to be delayed. Statutory requirements would not necessarily be any more effective. We should not get hooked on the idea that only that which is set out in detail on the statute book will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Before the Under-Secretary finishes, will he give the Committee more information on how funding will operate? The brief that I have been sent by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors on the access forums and the other countryside bodies and national parks administering the Bill says that one national park authority has had its funding cut back by 6 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. The question is perfectly legitimate, but we should restrict ourselves to the access forums.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If the access forums are to be established on a voluntary basis, how will they be funded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are discussing the best way of funding them with the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales. The Countryside Agency already has plans for establishing forums in the two areas where it will be carrying out pilot mapping exercises. These are due to start later this year. Extra money has been made available to the Countryside Agency and to local authorities for carrying out some of the tasks. The Countryside Agency can chose to act independently of local authorities if they refuse to co-operate, as sometimes happens. In the event that the Countryside Agency declines to act—unlikely though that may be—the Government can give directions.
<P>
I must ask that the amendments be withdrawn. I do not think that Opposition Members intend to bog down the Bill with unnecessary red tape. We can reassure them of the seriousness of our intention to set up the forums, and I will arrange for the draft guidelines to be circulated, which will answer many of the reasonable points that they have raised in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his response. I said at the outset that the amendments were probing, although I reserved my position for this moment. The Under-Secretary has given us more information on how local access fora—I am afraid I did not get O-level Latin for nothing; I still believe it is fora. It took me three goes and I shall make the most of it. The Under-Secretary told us how the fora would work. He is right that there is nothing between us in terms of that or of their value, purpose or structure. Our concern was that they were not mentioned in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary has had a crack at explaining that lack. I do not agree with all that he said. It is amazing to sit on the Opposition Front Bench and listen to new Labour Ministers saying things that do not sit well with remarks that they made only a short time ago. For instance, they now say that some things do not need legislation and that the Government do not have to legislate for every conceivable example. I remember that when I sat on the Government Benches, Labour Members were telling us constantly that that must be included and that this must be covered. None the less, the Under-Secretary has assured us that access forums will exist and that they will commence setting them up this autumn.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) made an important intervention on the question of independence. We wonder whether those appointed to fora will be nominees of various representative organisations such as the CLA, the NFU, the local authority, the Ramblers Association and so on, or whether they will come together under some other operation. The Under-Secretary mentioned landowners, managers and walkers, but it is difficult to see how someone who was wholly independent could be found who was not at least a walker, even if not a farmer or a manager. I give way to the Under-Secretary, so that he can explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Government have no problem with local branches—I stress the word ``local''—of the Country Landowners Association or the Ramblers Association nominating someone to represent their interest group on the fora.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to hear the Under-Secretary say that the Government have no problem with it, but that does not answer the question of how those people will be selected. When the agency sets up the local fora, will it ask each local forum for two local nominees, or will it look for local people regardless of whether they belong to an organisation? What procedure will the agency follow in deciding which individuals—rather than organisations—should sit on the local fora?
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): The wider point about asking organisations to nominate members is that, over time, the organisations that purport to represent particular interests may not continue to represent all those interests. I dare say that some CLA members are unhappy with it and that they might break away from it. I know that some ramblers are unhappy with the leadership of the Ramblers Association because, day by day, I receive letters from them saying so. Has my hon. Friend considered that, although certain organisations may be set in stone as being the appropriate bodies to be represented on local access fora, they may not continue to be the appropriate bodies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend makes a crucial point. I may have been tiptoeing round the issue more delicately than he thought necessary. It is true that those bodies will not necessarily represent the interests of all the landowners or tenant farmers in an area, or even the walkers in that area. That is why it is important to know whether fora will consist of nominees of organisations or whether people will be appointed on their individual merits and regardless of whether they belong to a recognised organisation. It is a crucial point. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary wishes to intervene or whether I should sit down and let him make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Perhaps the best thing is for me to provide clarification to the hon. Gentleman in writing. The draft guidelines will set out how appointment decisions should be made. I stress that the guidelines are currently only draft versions and that it is open to anybody to make suggestions to the Countryside Agency. The guidelines will not be too prescriptive, as the way in which members are chosen will vary from one area to another and according to different circumstances. Such interests are already balanced in a wide variety of countryside bodies whose activities relate to national parks and so on, and all the interests to which I referred are represented on such bodies without great difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary is right that a similar approach is adopted for other bodies, but they are larger in scale. For localised areas—we have not addressed how local the term ``local'' is in this context—that may consist of only one valley and the surrounding mountains, individual personality issues will come to the fore much more than they would in organisations whose responsibilities relate to the whole of the lake district or the peak district.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the growing concern in places such as Snowdonia national park about the imposition of the so-called independent nominees? One wonders who nominated them and what expertise they have, as they often do not do a good job in planning for the national park area. The hon. Gentleman is pursuing a vital point, and I hope that we will find out who makes appointments and on what criteria. The matter is of great importance; the Bill is not universally popular and the debate is polarised, so it is vital to obtain a clear answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. I am glad to see that he is back with us and has recovered from the malady that kept him away last week.
<P>
We do not have any national parks in the Fens and I do not pretend to be an expert on them, but I recognise the problems that the hon. Gentleman described. The people appointed and the extent of their independence are fundamental issues. The Food Standards Agency represents consumers—I hope that I can digress for a moment, Mr. Stevenson—but who in goodness' name is a consumer? We are all consumers, and it is sometimes difficult to see how people can be appointed as independent parties when they have no interest in the activity about which they are supposed to be independent.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the other amendments, which suggest that access should not occur until the arrangements are in order, proposed a device to delay. As I said last week, we are not seeking to introduce a device to delay—the term suggests an ulterior motive—but a device to get the Bill right. As many people who advocated the legislation have been waiting for it for decades, a few more months to get it right will not matter too much. If the legislation goes off half cock, before everything is in place, it would perhaps cause physical damage, and would certainly cause immense damage to the good will of the people involved. That is why I would rather be sure that the Bill is right than allow access to occur before the arrangements are in order.
<P>
I do not wish to delay the Committee any further. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, the amendment deals with a crucial issue. We may return to that issue later and it may be raised in another place. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his remarks on the amendment, which have been helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ``open air recreation'' means recreational activities usually carried out in the open air'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 76, in clause 2, page 2, line 23, leave out `remain on' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`walk over'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 155, in clause 2, page 2, line 23, leave out `remain on' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`use'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 123, in clause 2, page 2, line 23, after `recreation', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on foot'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Three of the four amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and I; the other was tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. All the amendments seek to improve the definitions in the clause by adding to them. The Committee will know that the clause lays down the basic foundations of the new access regime by defining access authorities, accepted land, mountains, open country and registered common land. The Government should attempt to define open-air recreation rather than simply assume that we all know what it is. I agree that the amendment seems to express a simple truism by stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``open air recreation'' means recreational activities usually carried out in the open air,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it hides deeper currents. An alternative definition could hold open-air recreation to mean any recreational activity that is carried out in the open air, apart from activities that are specifically excluded by schedule 2. A firmer and more specific definition would be useful for the completeness of the clause and for the practicability of the Bill as a whole.
<P>
The Government have produced a long list of exclusions that they presumably do not regard as proper open-air recreation under the terms of the Bill—Opposition Members have made a few more suggestions about proper activities—but those exclusions should be a point of the second order. The principal point should be that we know what we mean by open-air recreation, which is the basis of all of the Committee's discussions. I shall be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's definition of open-air recreation. Will he tell us why such a definition was not included in the Bill at, as it were, its first pass? Such a definition is at least as important as the others contained in the clause.
<P>
Similarly, amendments Nos. 76 and 123 attempt to improve the definitions contained in clause 2, which are basic parts of the Committee's deliberations. Amendment No. 76 would substitute the words ``walk over'' for ``remain on'' in respect of entitlement to visit access land, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree that it is entirely reasonable. The Bill's purpose is to provide more access land for walkers. Specifying that visitors are walking over the land rather than remaining on it will tighten up the Bill and make the clause's definition clearer in relation to the Bill's aims. The Government should have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 would insert into clause 2 the words ``on foot'' after the word ``recreation''. It goes to the heart of what the Government are seeking to achieve, as it would make it clear that the Bill is about access on foot to the newly defined access land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): May I take the hon. Gentleman back a stage? Am I right in thinking that, under amendment No. 76, it would be an offence for someone to sit down on access land?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is not the normal definition of ``remain on'', but it would certainly be illegal under the amendment for someone to pitch camp on land and decide to stay there for days on end, but that is not what the Bill is about. The Bill's purpose is to enable people to walk over land, and the hon. Gentleman has a long-standing record of involvement with that issue. We want to approve a decent practical Bill that achieves that purpose; inserting the words ``walk over'' should not be controversial.
<P>
To return to amendment No. 123, inserting the words ``on foot'' makes it clear that the Bill is intended to give people more rights to walk over land. I expect that the Under-Secretary will say that we can assume that everything that is not excluded is included. Bills are introduced once every 20 years or so to improve wildlife, but none of us knows what sorts of new recreations will occur to the entrepreneurial spirits in this country, some of which might not be acceptable to those at whom the Bill is aimed. If this part of the Bill had been introduced at the same time as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, various activities that might be relevant now such as quad-biking, would not have been included. Looking ahead 20 years, it seems likely that the same sort of thing will happen, so a positive definition of openair recreation, in both new clause 1 and clause 2, would be a useful addition to the armoury contained in schedule 2.
<P>
On amendment No. 155, tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, we have had various discussions about which of us has suggested the best definition. Having read the hon. Gentleman's amendment again, I still believe that ours is better. Indeed, I regret to tell him that amendment No. 155 is probably worse than the Government's formulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There is no greater insult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I merely leave the Under-Secretary's words hanging in the air for the Committee to consider. The term ``use'' the land is even more vague than ``remain on'' the land, and amendment No. 155 would take the Bill even further away from its central purpose of encouraging people to walk over the land. I wait eagerly to be convinced by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The amendments would provide a positive definition of the Bill's central purpose so that the House did not have to reconsider the legislation as new and potentially irritating forms of recreation were invented. A decent definition should be included to explain what is meant by openair recreation and walking over land. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to produce a better definition. However, the principle is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I heard some sedentary comments of ``split'', but I have never had the slightest problem with splitting from the Conservative party on all sorts of issues. On this matter, we both wish to improve the wording of the Bill, but in different ways. The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) does not like the word ``use'', but I fear that he has not read it in the context of the clause because it would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to use for the purposes of openair recreation<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, if his other amendment was accepted, ``on foot''. He will agree with me that using those words together will create a more accurate description of the Bill's intention. The problem here is simple. It is whether the phrase ``remain on'' has the wrong connotations in the context of the Bill and the intended use of the land. I have some concerns over this. Without reducing my argument to a reductio ad absurdum, if we define ourselves too accurately there is the danger of a clever lawyer using the definition for improper purposes in a court of law. I wonder whether ``walking over'' comprises those actions that are ancillary to walking over land, as the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) says, such as sitting down and eating your sandwiches, which I would not wish to make a criminal offence in the context of the Bill.
<P>
My intention is to improve the wording of the Bill and I hope that Under-Secretary will give the amendment some consideration. ``Remain on'' seems to me an unfortunate phrase. There may be others that define the terms better. The hon. Member for Ashford is right that on first reading his amendment, it appears that he has simply re-arranged the words so that it means the same thing though expressed in a different way. However, the word ``usually'' is important, although the long list of restrictions that occurs elsewhere in the Bill qualifies what is meant by openair recreation. It is a matter of consideration whether we need to define the Bill's purpose explicitly at the start or whether we can have the more open definition that the Government propose, which is then heavily qualified by restrictions. This is not a matter of principle. The question of which option best expresses the intentions of the Bill to those who read it and to those who wish to take advantage of its provisions is an issue for Government drafting. I shall be very interested to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I would like to add a word about amendment No. 76, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford and probe the Under-Secretary as to the meaning of the phrase ``remain on''. The spirit of the Bill is to give greater access to genuine walkers. We accept that principle and wish only to improve its application in the Bill. A list of activities outlined in schedules 1 and 2 are specifically excluded. Inserting the words ``remain on'' into the Bill implies that the Bill envisages activities other than walking over land. I recall from my training the famous case of Harrison v. the Duke of Rutland in the 19th century. The case centred around a walker who was using a public footpath with a red flag during a grouse driving session in an attempt to divert the grouse. The judge in the case ruled that he was not exercising genuine rights to ramble, but was using his rights to interrupt a lawful activity. I am not sure how that case would be judged today, but it illustrates the potential conflict if people engage in activities that are not specifically envisaged by the Bill. I hope that the Minister will look at this carefully and inform us as to what he means by the phrase ``remain on''. The issue would become crystal clear if my hon. Friend's phrase ``walk over'' were substituted for ``remain on''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I support what has been said, in particular about amendment No. 123, which would insert ``on foot'' after ``recreation'' after line 23. It clarifies the matter. Clarity is important and I see no real objection to including those words. The Under-Secretary will say that they are not necessary—the parliamentary word is ``otiose''—but I disagree. This is an important amendment which we should consider.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The matter need not detain us long because, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, we are arguing about drafting. The Bill broadly follows the model of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. If ever a piece of legislation has stood the test of time, that one has. It lists excluded activities, and that list has been updated to reflect modern recreational pursuits.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle suggested, amendments Nos. 76 and 123 risk ruling out innocuous activities such as taking photographs, bird watching, eating a sandwich or even sitting to admire the view. I appreciate that that example must seem ridiculous to hon. Members, but the Member for Somerton and Frome mused aloud as to what a clever lawyer might do with such a provision. We have one or two clever lawyers in this place; indeed, one is about to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> My question is simple. How would inserting the words ``on foot'', as proposed in amendment No. 123, prevent a person from using a camera? I do not see the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That would not be the effect, of course. The hon. Gentleman answered his own question in his earlier remarks—the insertion is unnecessary. We chose the 1949 formula, which has withstood the test of time. The argument is only about drafting and the difference between us is not great. We are all attempting to get to the same place, but the Government have chosen the route of listing excluded activities. That route was chosen in the past and it worked. Amendments Nos. 76 and 123 would also discriminate against people in wheelchairs or pushchairs, which I am sure was not the intention of hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> How on earth would the substitution of ``use'' for ``remain on'' under amendment No. 155 discriminate against disabled people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> One or two clever lawyers advise me that activities that might seem innocuous to hon. Members might be ruled out were we to proceed as the amendments suggest. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, for those of us who are not clever lawyers, there often seems to be no great problem in approaching the matter from any of the directions suggested by hon. Members. However, there is a danger of trying to be prescriptive and finding ourselves in a muddle. We are trying to allow everything that is not specifically excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> One would have to be an extremely clever and devious lawyer to construe ``use'' as excepting innocuous activities. That could not possibly exclude walking or anything associated with walking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The words ``on foot'' would exclude the use of a wheelchair or pushchair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Every time that we have an argument on one amendment, the answer refers to another amendment. We are having a rather confused debate on the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That is because help does not necessarily arrive in the order in which the questions are asked. I return to the central point—we are dealing with a formula that has stood the test of time and which is not complicated. There is no need for us to get bogged down in a long complex debate. Everybody has suggestions for dealing with the matter and we propose to follow the 1949 example, suitably updated to take account of modern recreational pursuits.
<P>
Amendment No. 155 would not change the extent of the new right of access because activities excluded under schedule 2 would continue to be excluded. It is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Another piece of help has arrived—it is rather unhelpful actually. It opens up a little pit into which I do not propose to climb.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Since we are discussing the Freedom of Information Bill on the Floor of the House today, will the Minister outline what the note says?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful for everybody's assistance. It is part of my responsibility to ensure that neither I nor hon. Members are confused, so we should keep to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That is a good idea.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary. We have a formula that has worked, so why mess with it? I respectfully suggest that they should be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Seldom have I heard a Minister be less convincing in asking for a group of amendments to be withdrawn, having just received a key piece of information which he decided not to share with the Committee in case it did not help his case. I commend the Under-Secretary for his commitment to at least partial openness—he revealed that he was being passed profoundly unhelpful information—although, sadly, we could not persuade him to share it with us.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's central point is that the Bill is based on the 1949 Act, whose exclusions have been updated. He has made one of my arguments for me. We know that legislation on the subject does not come round often. It would therefore be better to have a robust definition here, than have a list of exclusions that we know, and which experience from the 1949 Act tells us, will become out of date. We could attempt to improve on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should have dealt with that point at greater length. There is a power to amend the list of restrictions by regulation because we obviously cannot predict what recreations will be popular in 20 years' time. Schedule 2, paragraph 3, is the relevant paragraph.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> As I said earlier, on the basis that it is better not to have too many regulations changing legislation, it would be preferable for the House not to have to make new regulations regularly. Each action might be relatively controversial, no doubt having a small number of enthusiasts, with a larger number of people objecting to change. Points of principle might arise that would make dealing with a situation through legislation inappropriate. I am not desperately convinced by the Under-Secretary's point.
<P>
I assure the Under-Secretary that I do not speak as a clever lawyer, either, but it is hard to imagine that the current formulation will necessarily be robust in the hands of the legal profession. ``Remain on'' seems more vague than ``walk over'', and vagueness in legislation gives the legal profession the opportunity to enjoy itself and to attempt to change the original intention of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend not think that, if a Minister says that he has had legal advice that something would not happen, he should be able to tell the Committee what the advice was and why a particular amendment should not be accepted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a correct point in an ingenious way. If the Committee is to be taken seriously, it is important that its members receive the detailed information that is made available to Ministers. That is a matter for the Under-Secretary and his conscience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Hang on!
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The piece of paper that I joked about does not refer to legal advice, which is simple. Amendments Nos. 76 and 123 risk ruling out innocuous activities, which I listed, and amendment No. 155 would not change the extent of the new right of access and is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I can see that the best ingenuity will not tease out what that now notorious piece of paper said.
<P>
The point at issue is whether the Bill is robust enough to withstand legal stretching. The words ``remain on'' cover a multitude of activities. The hon. Member for Pendle took that to a deliberate and slightly foolish extreme. It would also be extreme to argue that people could decide to stay on land for days, weeks or months while praying in aid this clause. The Under-Secretary would not want that to happen, but the Bill as drafted will fall into the trap against which he is warning me.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he does not intend to prevent people in wheelchairs or with pushchairs from having access?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed—the Under-Secretary was right about that. When we debated what amendment No. 16 the most general amendment in the group—meant by open air recreation, I invited him to produce a better formulation. The legal pitfalls that he sees in the amendments exist in the Bill. We are trying to help the Government to produce a more robust piece of legislation that will not leave people in the courts for years to come. However, it is clear that the Under-Secretary is sitting on advice and is not inclined to accept amendments. Given that we might want to return to this matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 2, line 16, leave out from `(a)' to `of' in line 17 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`consists'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 19, in page 2, line 17, leave out `wholly or predominantly'.
<P>
No. 209, in page 2, line 17, leave out `predominantly' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`almost entirely'.<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Unusually, we are trying to determine where the Bill differs from the original consultation document. The Government initially referred to mountain, moor, heath and down, but the Bill's definition of ``open country'' is what appears
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to consist wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor, heath or down.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a significant distinction. The amendments try to extract how the Government define ``predominantly''. I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but I am not aware that that word is regularly used and has a standard legal interpretation. We are worried that its use will depend on a subjective judgment of whether land should be classified as open land.
<P>
A range of options is available. We have proposed two separate menu items. The first is to remove ``wholly or predominantly'', which would return the Bill to the Government's original definition. The second option is for ``predominantly'', which is not defined in the Bill, to mean 75 per cent. or more of an area, although we could choose any percentage. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggests using the phrase ``almost entirely''. I do not dissent from that alternative. The key point is to determine what the Government mean by ``predominantly''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd West): Many of us on the Labour Benches would be interested to know whether the amendments are serious or probing. If they are not probing, they are the height of misguided nit-picking and do not represent the constructive scrutiny in which Opposition Members are entitled to engage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> When the hon. Gentleman has been in the House a little longer, he will understand that the content of legislation matters because the courts have to interpret it. That is why it is critical for us to get the meaning of words clear. The amendments have the serious aim of discovering what the Government mean by the word ``predominantly'', which can be used to establish clear legal precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but would it not be wrong to be too prescriptive and tie the hands of the countryside bodies that are charged with implementing the provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I have made it clear that a range of options is available. I am not wedded to one. They all have merits and demerits, and we could choose other phraseology or percentages. The key aim is to gain a proper understanding. My layman's interpretation of the word ``predominantly'' is anything that is more than 50 per cent. We need to establish what the Government envisage describing as open land. It is important to do that not just for legal reasons, but so that those who walk on the land, who map the land or who have an interest in it have a day-to-day understanding of the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It goes further than that. We need to have a clearer perspective of what is meant by ``predominantly'' because that will affect the more productive land that is latched on to mountain, moor, heath or down at a lower level. It is important to discuss that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has shown a clear knowledge and understanding of the Bill's implications. The use of the word ``predominantly'' raises the question of what other land might be affected. Most Committee members have experience of the open countryside and know that what may be perceived as mountain, moor, heath or down includes areas that are not obviously mountain, moor, heath or down. For example, there may be grass instead of heather on a heath or on an overgrazed area of a mountain. Those critical points need to be clarified.
<P>
The word ``predominantly'' has been taken from other agreements, including the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, to which the Under-Secretary referred. But in those contexts, it applied to voluntary agreements. We are establishing a statutory right for a regime that will cover 4 million acres. That is why we need to be more precise.
<P>
Other legislation does not use the word ``predominantly'' to define the extent of land designation. For example, it is not used in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 with respect to sites of special scientific interest. Therefore, we need to understand clearly what is meant by the term.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24, which would remove moor, heath and down from the clause and retain heath only, are probing amendments, also aimed at establishing the Governments's meaning. Why are they included in the definition of open country, and what do they mean? We may today deal with the issue of exceptions for cultivated land, but it is clear to anyone whose life has been spent in the country that quite a lot of former moor, heath or down is now cultivated. Perhaps, given the changes in agriculture, some of it may revert to moor, heath or down. Some downland has also, in my view unwisely, been ploughed up for crops. That land, arguably, would be cultivatable. The present wording of the Bill seems to encourage anyone who owns downland or moorland to go out and cultivate it, because that is the only way to have it exempted.
<P>
My key question is what the Under-Secretary means by the phrases that have mentioned. How will it be possible to exclude what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned—the grassland, often known in England as ``in-bye'' land, close to the farmstead but perhaps on the lower slopes of a mountain?
<P>
Such definitions must be clearly established and I hope to hear all those terms, but particularly the word ``predominantly'', explained by the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 209 and 210, which I tabled. Having heard the heartfelt clarion call for imprecision in legislation from the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) I am a little surprised that we are bothering with the Committee stage at all. We all know what we mean, after all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that one of the basic principles of the Bill is that the details of its implementation are left to others. There is a substantial element of discretion in the hands of the countryside bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> From the reaction of hon. Members around me, I think that my understanding of the Bill is perhaps better than the hon. Gentleman's. Even if what he said were right, when devolving powers to define, one should do so with precision. Legislation should always be precise. That is why the subsection is slightly odd. An impressionistic view has been taken of its defining role. The word ``appears'' is qualified by the words ``wholly or predominantly'' and the categories of mountain, moor, heath or down are not defined. Imprecision is piled on imprecision like Pelion on Ossa.
<P>
We should have something more accurate. That is not because there will eventually be any doubt about what is in the map. At the end of the process we shall have defined areas of open country with reference to the Bill. The problem is arriving at that point from here. A mapping process is described in the Bill's later clauses, as well as an appeal against that, under which landowners and others may appeal on precise definitions. That matter will be in the hands of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, whose decisions will be open to judicial review.
<P>
Some concern has been conveyed to me about the meaning of the word ``predominantly''. As far as I know, it is not defined in statute. It could mean more than 50 per cent., but it might not. Other formulations have been suggested, one of which was ``overwhelmingly''. Given that the terms that we are dealing with in the first instance—``moor'', ``heath'' and ``down''—are imprecise, it should be possible for most of the land in question to be definable in those terms. It is hard to imagine genuine open country that would not be definable in those already vague terms. The word ``predominantly'' adds to the imprecision of the provision, which could be used by those who wish the Bill ill, for example to slow down procedures and introduce a longer appeal process. That is why it is important to amend the subsection to provide a clearer definition.
<P>
Although I have not tabled amendments to this effect, the Under-Secretary would greatly help the Committee if he explained his definitions of the relevant categories of open land. Moor, heath and down are different things in different parts of the country. In my part of the world moors are not high land at all; they are the levels. The Glastonbury moor is below sea level. Similarly, a vast range of different terrain is described as downs. Without clarification there will be challenge, delay and imprecision—headaches for the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales, which they could do without, in getting the Bill on to the statute book and making it work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> There has been a bizarre element to the debate this morning, both on this group of amendments and in the earlier debate about forums. On that matter, hon. Members will recall Madam Speaker's ruling that the plural of the word referendum is referendums.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> One is a noun and the other is a gerund.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am one of the few non-lawyers in the House of Commons and I am conscious of the fact that, if we are not careful, we shall gather more legal opinions than is good for us. Perhaps we can return to the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Indeed, Mr. Stevenson. I shall not deviate along that track.
<P>
The bizarre feeling to this morning's debate has had something to do with the Government's stated desire to be as unprescriptive, open-handed and laid back as possible, and their accusation about us being nitpicking. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West, in an ill-thought-through intervention, said that we were excessively concerned with detail, and other hon. Members said that we wanted to tie the matter down too much. Indeed, we do not want to tie things down too much. We want to leave them as open as possible as they have been for the past 20 years. In places such as the Templars estate just outside my constituency we have gone to great lengths to find ways of allowing access without tying things down too much, by voluntary agreement between the landowner and the ramblers. That is working pretty well in large parts of Wiltshire.
<P>
As we have said on Second Reading and at other times, we regret the existence of the part of the Bill that we are considering because there is no need for it. None the less, the Government in their wisdom have decided that it is necessary to legislate for a prescriptive right to roam. Therefore, the details in the Bill should be extraordinarily clear. It is an abdication of responsibility to take the view that there are a few votes in the Bill, but that it should be left as wide open, vague and ill-defined as possible. So it is right that we should consider carefully the precise definition of the word ``predominantly'' and consider how mountain, moor and heath may be accurately defined. We must know those things in precise and legally-binding detail, so that when they are examined in court, the Committee's deliberations may be used to justify access or the preclusion of it.
<P>
The word ``predominantly'' is central to the definition. It was used in the 1949 legislation, but things were rather different in those days. Now, moorland—I am thinking in particular of Salisbury plain—is dotted with woodland, water and other bits of land. If one has right of access to the moor, does one also have right of access to the woodland within the moor, although that is precluded by the Bill? Perhaps the word ``predominantly'' implies that one does. Salisbury plain is predominantly moorland, but it also has substantial parts of woodland. The Under-Secretary should be prepared to be specific about the matter. He needs to say to the nation, ``We are prepared to allow you to have access to this sort of land, but not that sort of land.'' It is quite wrong for the Government to say that that approach is too prescriptive, interventionist and Stalinist—they have not used that word yet, but that is what they have implied. If we are to introduce this unreasonable right of access to open land, let the Government produce precise definitions of what they want to offer the walker.

<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support the views of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and maintain that he genuinely wants to ensure that the Bill does the right thing. I do not doubt the Government's good faith, but unless some clarity is introduced into the Bill, there will be a muddle. That will lead to bad feeling, which will mean that the Bill will not work, and we will all be the poorer for it, because that will lead to the sort of confrontation that occurs when a few people abuse their extensive existing rights. I was astonished to hear the hon. Member for Clwyd, West criticise my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire for wishing to deal with the point in detail. Indeed, it is a theme that runs through the debate. The Ramblers Association has accommodated people in my constituency to write to me and allege that I am part of a conspiracy to delay the Bill's progress. We are used to the rotten and unethical behaviour of the Ramblers Association—[Interruption.] but I draw the line at the right of the Opposition and, indeed, of Government Members, if they were not so craven, to hold the Government to account for an entirely inadequate piece of legislation.
<P>
The Bill lacks clarity, consistency and certainty, which we cannot take on trust without further detailed explanation of the Government's intentions. I hope that mountain, moor, heath and down will mean what it says, but my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire rightly emphasised that there is ambiguity about what lies between and before the mountain, moor, heath and down. My hon. Friend rightly says that it is impossible to compare the sort of land in his constituency to the uplands in Yorkshire, for example, and land further north. I urge the Minister not to brush the amendments aside as if they were meaningless delaying tactics, because they are not. There is an essential requirement for clarity when something is given and taken from other people. The principle of the Bill is already conceded because the Government have an enormous majority in Parliament and it will be passed. What is not conceded is the detail. We must have greater clarity and consistency of explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I agree entirely with that. We need to tease out as much detail as possible. I am astonished at the remarks of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West. As a practising lawyer, he must know that, if we do not clarify matters in this place, lawyers such as he will have a field day. I will not say clever lawyers; if we were clever lawyers, we would be out there making money. The serious point is that this is the opportunity to discuss these vital matters. This is a contentious Bill. If we are to do our job, we need to iron out the contentious issues, eliminate the potential pitfalls and ensure that there is as much clarity as possible.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to definitions of land. In each locality, the four definitions will be well known. There is no need for the word ``predominately''. We should not create that grey area, because that will give rise to litigation. If that is what we leave behind, we are not doing our duties as parliamentarians. We need a clear law, especially where we have a polarised situation such as this. We need to tease out every response. To leave it to others, as the hon. Gentleman suggested earlier, is nonsense.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If anyone accuses the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex of being party to a conspiracy to sabotage the Bill, I will gladly send him a reference should he need one. I welcome the spirit in which Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen have approached the matter so far. They made it clear at the outset that, though they were not happy with the Bill, they recognised—as the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex just said—that it has received its Second Reading. Their amendments so far have sought to improve the Bill and to ensure it works effectively, and I welcome that. The only possible exception is the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, who every so often lets the cat out of the bag and tells us that the Bill is useless and must be stopped under all circumstances. I am always a little more suspicious of his contributions than those of his hon. Friends, but even in his case, I am prepared to assume good will for the purposes of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> May I set the record straight? We did not vote against the Bill on Second Reading. We proposed a reasonable amendment on the right to roam. Conservative Members have made it plain throughout that we are opposed on principle to the right to roam. But, like my Front-Bench colleagues, I accept that the Bill is the will of the Government and will become law, and therefore I seek to improve it as best I can. The Under-Secretary is wrong to impugn my motives in this way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As I said, I am prepared to assume the best until we have a demonstration of the worst, and we have not yet had that. There has been the occasional moment when it has skated a little close to the worst, but so far the proceedings have gone sensibly.
<P>
I have sometimes said in answer to some of the points raised by the Opposition that there is not much difference between us; that we are dealing with only a matter of opinion or drafting. Here the difference is slightly greater. We take the view that we should have as much local flexibility as possible. The Opposition take the view that we should be as prescriptive as possible. That is a genuine difference between us. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, while demanding that we provide tight definitions, also said that moor, heath and down mean different things in different areas. If I were to provide tighter definitions as he and his colleagues demand, we would open up endless scope for argument. We acknowledge that there are differences in different parts of the country, and it is not our intention to lay down a prescription that applies as much in Somerset as it does in the highlands. We want to allow common sense and local flexibility. I do not apologise for any difference between us on this matter, which will have arisen because we have a different approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Four categories of land may have slightly different meanings in different areas of the United Kingdom, but surely that does not justify the inclusion of the word ``predominantly''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am coming to the use of the word ``predominantly''. We all have our own words, and whichever word was substituted, there would always be scope for local argument about its interpretation. I see that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is nodding generously. Whatever word was substituted, there would still be scope for the same arguments. The basic argument between the Government and Opposition Members is about the extent to which the Bill allows local flexibility.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked about my definition of the word ``predominant''. It is probably the same as his definition, as it is based on the ordinary meaning, which is usually covered by the words ``prevailing'' or ``mostly''. As I said, the word is intended to give some flexibility to the countryside bodies, as the precise detail of most of the relevant matters must be resolved locally. That process should involve proper consultation of all the interests.
<P>
We recognise from the outset that it is impossible to be prescriptive in deciding whether land falls into a category mentioned in the Bill. Percentages would be entirely inappropriate and the countryside bodies' assessments are bound to involve an element of judgment. Clause 6 provides scope for appeal, which can be used if a body's judgments are wrong or if its views are controversial. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked me for one or two definitions in respect of cultivated land, in-bye land and so on, but such matters should be addressed during debate on schedule 1.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire asked about Salisbury plain, but I do not want to risk becoming bogged down by definitions of features of the landscape in his area, which will be different from those elsewhere. The circumstances that apply on Salisbury plain are precisely of the sort about which local discretion is needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I was not asking for clarification of the circumstances of Salisbury plain, which are special anyway as it is owned by the Ministry of Defence. I was using it as an example of land that is mixed heath and woodland, examples of which can be found throughout the nation. I am sorry that the Under-Secretary has chosen to pick up on Salisbury plain specifically, as I was trying to suggest that if woodland is situated in the middle of any area that is otherwise defined as predominantly heath or moorland, access to the woodland will be affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There will be argument about that at a local level, and it is to be hoped that a consensus will be reached. If it is concluded that the Countryside Agency came to the wrong initial judgment, an appeal could be made. Such a recourse would allow independent people—lawyers, no less—to give their views. The Government have gone as far as we can go; we see flexibility as a merit, not as a disadvantage.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The grounds for appeal contained in clause 6 are based precisely on the definitions contained in clause 1. Appeal may be brought on the ground that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the land does not consist wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor, heath or down.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will the lawyers advise the Secretary of State in determining the appeal when the criteria are so vaguely worded that they allow for almost any inclusion or exception?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have offered a definition of ``predominant'', which means prevalent or mostly; other people will have their own definitions. There will have to be local discretion, which may involve argument and controversy. Such controversy will undoubtedly arise and we do not see it as a necessarily bad thing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I accept the Under-Secretary's argument that there should be local discretion. However, when there is a dispute and an appeal is made, the Secretary of State will have to make a judgment on whether discretion should be applied. The provisions are so loose that they put the Secretary of State in an almost impossible position. He is able to interpret the grounds for appeal and the decision of the local body in almost any way that he chooses, which must make him open to further challenge in the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, he may have his own views, but he will know that he can be subject to challenge of the sort that the hon. Gentleman describes. I know from my own limited experience that such factors can concentrate the mind wonderfully.
<P>
We want to provide as much certainty as possible to all concerned about the land to which the new right of access will apply. That is why we decided that all affected land should be mapped, with the exception of that which is more than 600m above sea level and registered common land, whose boundaries should already be clear. Maps must be prepared, consulted on and issued in conclusive form before the right comes into effect. As well as providing desirable clarity for the benefit of landowners and walkers, the mapping process will give everyone an opportunity to say why particular areas do or do not qualify as open country.
<P>
The terms ``moor'', ``heath'' and ``down'' were first used in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. It is right and sensible to rely on the relevant countryside bodies—the Countryside Agency in respect of England and the Countryside Council for Wales—to identify these areas. The bodies will be responsible for drawing up criteria and preparing maps of open country, and they will consult publicly.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 18 to 20 and 119 seek to reduce or remove altogether the flexibility necessary for the countryside bodies to make sensible decisions on whether land falls within the meaning of moor, heath or down. The Government consider it important and desirable for bodies charged with mapping open countryside to assess whether land is wholly or predominantly mountain, moor, heath or down. For example, as hon. Members have pointed out, heaths will often contain scattered trees or small clumps of trees. To attempt to exclude such sites would make little sense either in mapping terms or on the ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I should like to obtain some clarification, as I suspect that we may not have a clause stand part debate. Will improved grassland—that is, grassland that has been subject to some form of cultivation—be excluded from the definitions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That matter will be addressed during consideration of schedule 1, which will occur shortly, so I advise the hon. Gentleman to sit tight.
<P>
Without provision for reasonable discretion, some would argue that, unless every square inch of every acre fell within the definition of moor, heath or down, the land should not qualify as open country. I appreciate that Opposition Members are not necessarily arguing that, but amendments Nos. 209 and 210 are presumably also intended to reduce the discretion granted to countryside bodies. Whether the phrase ``almost entirely'' differs from ``predominantly'' is probably a matter for lawyers. The Government firmly believe that countryside bodies should be able to use their judgment and common sense on whether particular areas qualify as open country. Amendments Nos. 22 to 24 seek respectively to remove more heath and down from open country. However, those are precisely the types of land to which people should be given a right of access. They are uncultivated and open in character, and people have campaigned long and hard for the right to walk responsibly across such land.
<P>
In the Government consultation paper published in February 1998 and in our ``Framework for Action'' document, which was published in March last year, we have repeatedly made it clear that greater access should apply to moor, heath and down, as well as to mountain and registered common land. If we accepted the amendments—I refer also to amendment No. 21, which was considered earlier—people would be left with no right of access to open country. I know that that is not the intention of Opposition Members; as they said, amendment No. 18 is a probing amendment. However, they have assured the Government that they wish to focus on the detail and not to challenge the principle. I therefore ask the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I have listened extremely carefully to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. I still think that there is a lack of clarity about the word ``predominantly''. He has not persuaded me that it means anything, except in the vaguest possible terms. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman intends to withdraw his amendment, but if I had the opportunity to do so, I would wish to test the opinion of the Committee on amendment No. 209.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman's definition of ``predominantly''?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I do not believe that a satisfactory definition of the word exists. It is too open to dispute and further litigation, and it would be appropriate to tighten up the definition.
<P>
The criticism of my formulation by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is perfectly valid; he says that it replaces one imprecisely defined term with another. However, a closer definition would reduce the scope for legal challenge. We do not have a difference of principle. We suggest two ways of achieving the same end. Should the opportunity arise, Mr. Stevenson, I would like to seek the Committee's opinion on amendment No. 209.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for what he said about the Opposition's motives. I, too, was rather annoyed at the accusation that we were setting out to destroy or to wreck the Bill. The Under-Secretary was in opposition for a number of years, as were some of his hon. Friends, and they know that the Government get their way. The concept of wrecking or delaying legislation is one of theory, not practice. I appreciate his acceptance of our bona fides in trying to improve the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, if the Bill is not clear, it will be bad legislation, and that will damage everyone's interests. If we must have the legislation, it should be successful for everybody.
<P>
I am perfectly prepared to accept the Under-Secretary's comment that we cannot dictate every detail, and that we must allow local discretion. Of course we must, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire suggested; we cannot consider every piece of moor with a wood in it. I realise that we must have local flexibility, but parameters must be set within which that local flexibility can operate. I do not want to return to a previous debate, but I am not sure how local that flexibility will be, given that the Countryside Agency, a national body, will be given the responsibility for drafting the maps.
<P>
One of the Under-Secretary's comments slightly worried me. When I pressed him for the interpretation of the word ``predominantly'', he said that he thought that it was similar to my own. I specifically said that I thought that it meant anything over 50 per cent. That may be the Under-Secretary's view, but I remind him of the Pepper v. Hart decision. It worries me that such ministerial comments can be used in courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No. I had overlooked the fact that the hon. Gentleman had suggested that it was anything over 50 per cent. My definition of that word is ``mostly or prevailing''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Those, too, are pretty unclear terms. To me, ``prevailing'' means the majority—that is, more than 50 per cent. I accept that the wording of our amendments is not always right, and I happily accept that a percentage figure would be too specific. On reflection, the wording suggested by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is probably more effective. By referring to ``almost entirely'', he has considerably narrowed the parameters within which one could consider land to be mountain, moor, heath or down, but he has not fixed a percentage to it. He allows a degree of flexibility, but without the extreme flexibility suggested by the word ``predominantly''—that is, anything more than 50 per cent.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and others asked about the definitions of moor, heath, and down. Although it was unnecessary, the Under-Secretary was right to say that omitting those words would denude the Bill. That was not our intention. They were probing amendments to try to establish precisely what the Government meant. I have an interest in those words—various definitions exist— because although much of the area where I live is called the moor, the land is all under the plough and actively cultivated and no one can remember it not being so. Such distinctions will require local flexibility. The Under-Secretary suggested that we could deal with the problem of cultivation later this morning or this afternoon—rightly so, because much open lowland, moor and downland is cultivated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> My hon. Friend touches on a point that is important in relation to the Sussex downs where there is much cultivation, including cultivation of the grassland, in attempt to improve the downs. It may be difficult—for walkers, it will almost certainly be impossible—to tell the difference between cultivated and uncultivated downland. The Under-Secretary tried fairly and sensibly to deal with such problems, but that is another point where clarity and consistency of application are required.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that cultivated land is referred to in schedule 1, to which we shall come soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I accept that, Mr. Stevenson. I recognise the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, but we are considering the terminology of mountain, moor, heath and down, and whether such land could be reclassified. Indeed, if agriculture continues in its steep decline, it is highly likely that that land will revert to its former nature.
<P>
In a spirit of generosity, I shall happily withdraw the Opposition amendment, but I share the view of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that something more than the present wording is needed. If the hon. Gentleman decides to press his amendment to a Division, we shall support him. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> As you have just discovered, Mr. Stevenson, this is a mammoth group of amendments; what is worse is that they are all different. They do not present a series of options to deal with one issue, but relate to matters that we want to discuss under the heading of excepted land in schedule 1. The issue of clarity is again important. We want to know what is meant by the terms that are used to describe excepted land. Many are probing amendments, and I would be happy to accept the Under-Secretary's assurance that a phrase in the schedule covers our concerns. However, I shall discuss the amendments individually because each stands alone.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 is not as spurious as it may seem. It is designed to probe the relationship between highways and access land. Highways provide a right of way rather than a right to open air recreation—there is a distinction. They are a legal entity and a legal framework determines what can and cannot be done on them. Roads often go through open countryside. We need to be clear whether they are defined as being part of open country. What legal framework will apply to highways to determine rights and responsibilities? Could people who are exercising their rights of access be prosecuted for causing an obstruction to the highway? We discussed people who picnic on access land and, although it would be unwise to picnic in the middle of a road, we need to determine what framework would apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I realise that we are discussing schedule 1, but does not clause 2(3) make it clear that other enactments have priority over the rights granted by the Bill in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman may well be right, but the purpose of the amendments is to probe and elucidate the meaning of the schedule.
<P>
There is also the issue of whether the byelaws that clause 17 creates will apply to someone who is on a highway. The Under-Secretary referred to other legislation. Commons legislation excludes highways that go across commons from common land. The question must therefore be asked on that matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land within 50 metres of a dwelling-house.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the country it is commonplace for isolated homes to be closely surrounded by open land. ``Curtilage'' is used in the schedule without being clearly defined. There must be something more precise; we have suggested 50m. No hon. Member would wish personal privacy or security to be compromised by the rights given under the Bill. It seems right that people should not walk too closely to where others live, relax and do all the other things that one does in one's home and the immediate grounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the word ``curtilage'' has been the subject of many judicial decisions? It has been a source of great confusion over the years and he is right to seek a clearer definition.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing that legal perspective to the matter and for his support. It illustrates the point that we have made several times this morning—the Bill must be phrased correctly to reduce the number of court cases, such as those to which the hon. Gentleman referred, in which the meaning of words such as ``curtilage'' is disputed.
<P>
The schedule currently refers to buildings and their curtilage and to gardens. That is not sufficient. The curtilage is an area of land related to a building— commonly, the garden. However, people might have associated land, such as a small paddock for a pony, close to the house. It might not be the garden and would not be defined as curtilage, but no one would realistically say that that should be considered as open country.
<P>
At our first sitting we challenged the Government to ensure that all excepted land would be on the map. The Minister clearly said that that was not necessary and that it would not be possible to include on the map every little bit of land that might not be open country. on a map. If such information is not on the map, how close walkers may get to a residence should be clearly laid down in the Bill so that it can be included in advice or information to such people.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 34 and 45 are closely linked and deal with exceptions relating to mobile homes, caravans, marquees and tents, none of which are buildings unless they are fixed to the ground and maintained permanently. A formalised campsite is not a building, either, and certainly is not in the curtilage of a building. In planning legislation, all such activities are uses of land. The exception for buildings under schedule 1, paragraph 2, does not apply to them. However, the uses should also be considered to be excepted land. The Bill appears to give people a right of access to walk through a campsite and to weave their way between caravans or tents in a way that many people would not think reasonable. There would then be issues of security, because that would give individuals who might have some nefarious intent the opportunity to scout around a caravan site with the intention of returning later for criminal purposes. Therefore, we believe that mobile homes, caravans, marquees, tents or a caravan site should be included in the exceptions. If the Minister can persuade the Committee that that is unnecessary or that they are already covered, we will listen.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 raises similar issues in relation to land covered by hardstanding. That is land that may be used for car parking, storage of machinery or materials. That, too, needs to be excepted for the purposes of protection, to avoid damage to or theft from anything on the land and for safety reasons because vehicles such as tractors, might be moved around on an area of hardstanding. That raises safety issues in relation to walkers. Linked to that is Amendment No. 36, which covers land used for outdoor storage. Again, safety and security matters are important, not only for the walker but, if crops are stored on the land, for those who will consume those crops, be they humans or animals. There is also the issue of vehicles, machinery, construction materials and all manner of other items that could be stored on outdoor land.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 refers to land that is used or has previously been used as a cemetery or burial ground. That gives rise not to issues of safety or security but to the matter of common decency, although we do not believe that such areas should be included in the provisions relating to open country. My experience is of the Scottish highlands, which are not relevant to the Bill, but I believe that it is also the case that, in parts of England and Wales, there are many remote cemeteries and graveyards. It is a matter of common decency and respect for the dead that they should not be tramped over unnecessarily. Therefore, we believe that admission to those areas should be a matter for their keepers, whether that is a current church body or heritage organisation.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 refers to land used for a sports pitch or athletics track. The Bill excepts golf courses and race courses, but I am puzzled about why it does not also include other sports pitches or athletics tracks. I suspect that there are few athletics tracks on open country, but that is not true of sports pitches. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionmydd Nant Conwy, village football pitches are often situated at the skirt of a mountain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The rugby club in Dolgellau, of which I am vice-president, has had a devil of a job preventing people from taking dogs on to the pitch and fouling it. We have no legal way of preventing that, so the hon. Gentleman has hit on a vital point and I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> In addition to that important point there is the issue of commons. Cricket pitches are often situated on common land, and they are also used for other games. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government did not think it necessary to include those areas.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 both refer to shooting; the first to land used as a shooting range and the second to land used for clay pigeon shooting. It is probably self-evident why we wish to exclude such areas, primarily for safety purposes. There are other issues about disruption and other problems that could result from people walking on to such areas, but the issue is primarily one of public safety, and public access could compromise that safety, particularly in the case of a shooting range. Ranges can cover considerable distances and it may not be immediately obvious to casual walkers that they are crossing between the shooters and their target. Some shooting ranges can be several hundred metres long. Also, there is a problem if there is no proper barrier behind the target such as a sandbank. The gunfire disturbing dogs is another problem, although a much lesser one. The Under-Secretary may suggest that the issues raised by these two amendments are covered by the 28-day rule, but I suggest to him that many of the activities will take place on more than 28 days a year. An example is clay pigeon shooting, which can be held regularly at purpose-built sites where people have invested in constructing towers and other launch sites for the clay pigeons. These events can be held almost every weekend, so the 28-day rule does not cover them.
<P>
Amendment No. 43 refers to land use for motor car and motorcycle racing, including speed trials, and other motor sports and practising for those activities. Golf courses and race courses are excepted land, perfectly rightly in our view, although they are an odd choice, partly because of safety. I know that the hon. Member for Pendle is proposing that golf courses should not be included, but that is a matter for him. We agree with the Government that golf courses and race courses should be excepted, but it seems odd that we do not exclude land used for the various motor sports for the same reason of safety. Security is another reason to except land because obstructions may be left behind, such as safety barriers. The question of liability if someone is hurt is another issue, which will be debated later in our proceedings. The Under-Secretary may have been informed that the definition that we have used for motor sports is based on that in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 44 and 69 may have raised a few eyebrows and I can understand that, but this is again an issue of clarity and ensuring that we know what is and is not included. There is an increasing interest—though I personally do not share it—in war games. Given the desperate state of agriculture, many landowners facilitate the activity, if they have the appropriate terrain, in an attempt to generate extra income. A number of management development schools and companies use it as a development technique. This is not an issue that should be dismissed in a derisory way and I am sure the Under-Secretary did not intend to do that. The amendment seeks to include land used for the purpose under the definition of ``excepted''. War games have become a popular activity and we believe that land used for that purpose should be excepted. The definition comes from the same Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.
<P>
Amendment No. 46 refers to land used as a film or television studio. We are seeing the increased use of land for this purpose. I am not referring to the one-off situation in which a film company uses an area for one scene. We are talking about large open areas that are used regularly. I understand that a new film studio is being opened at Leavesden airfield in Hertfordshire. That is an example of a film studio being built on land that might otherwise be considered open country. Obviously, all manner of disturbances and consequences can be envisaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is not simply film studios; long-running television series that may set themselves up in open country. In my constituency, the programme the ``Darling Buds of May'', which was fictionally set in a perfect English village, was rightly set in the village of Pluckley, which is in many ways the perfect English village. That involved filming in the vicinity for long periods of time over many years. It was a semi-permanent operation.
