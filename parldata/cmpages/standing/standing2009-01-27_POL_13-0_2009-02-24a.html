<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000504"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 157 to 162, 167 to 171, 173 to 177, 179 to 181,
186 to 190, 205 to 209 and
334.</div><a name="09022459000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000505"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Amendments 156 to 162, 167 to 171, 173 to 177, 179
to 181, 186 to 190 and 205 to 209 will be to clauses 36 to 38, which
relate to confiscation under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. I explained the policy that the amendments
address at an earlier sitting so I will be reasonably
brief.</div><a name="09022459000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will expand the new powers of search and seizure of property
to include other persons holding gifts made by suspects as well as
property held by the suspect. Such property, known as tainted gifts, is
already included in the confiscation provisions of the 2002 Act. The
goal is to prevent a defendant from disposing of their property to
avoid confiscation. Law enforcement officers requested the extension of
the powers to other persons holding tainted gifts to close a
potentially fatal loophole whereby a suspect merely giving property to
family members and friends could undermine the viability of the new
powers.</div><a name="09022459000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
173 will repeal the existing seizure power in the confiscation
provisions. Section 45 of the 2002 Act and the equivalent provisions
for Scotland and Northern Ireland provide that property subject to a
restraint order may be seized only to prevent its removal from the
country. Clauses 36 to 38 provide for more extensive search and seizure
powers, which will subsume the existing powers. Their continued
existence is therefore not justified and they will be
repealed.</div><a name="09022459000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
168 to 171, 187 to 190 and 206 to 209 are minor guiding amendments. The
new powers provide for continued detention once the property has been
seized. Initially, an officer may detain seized property for 48 hours.
If there is no restraint order or if the officer decides not to apply
for one, he must apply for a detention order from the magistrates
court.</div><a name="09022459000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
169 to 171, 188 to 190 and 207 to 209 provide that any person affected
by a detention order can apply for the discharge or variation of it.
They may also appeal against any decision made on the order. The
persons affected could be the defendant, a third party or the law
enforcement officer who applied for the detention order. I know that
the hon. Member for Hornchurch, in some of the amendments that he has
tabled, is concerned by the level of judicial oversight, rather than
the principle behind the Bill. The hon. Member for Chesterfield is also
concerned about that, and we will discuss that with other amendments. I
just wanted to highlight that particular section as I will mention it
in regard to the ability to vary orders, to appeal against orders and
so on, but that is a debate for later
amendments.</div><a name="09022459000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 168, 187 and 206 explicitly provide that a magistrates court
cannot advise the continued extension of what is known and defined in
the Bill as &#147;exempt property&#148;. &#147;Exempt
property&#148; is defined in new section 47C(4) and includes items
necessary for a person&#146;s personal use in his or her business
location or employment. It also includes:</div>
<a name="09022459000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;clothing,
bedding, furniture, household equipment, provisions or other things as
are necessary for satisfying the basic domestic needs of the defendant
and the defendant&#146;s
family.&#148;</div><a name="09022459000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Upon
seizure, the officer can seize any property held by the defendant, or
by the recipient of a tainted gift from the defendant, except cash and
exempt property. Exempt property therefore, should not be seized, but
it is an important additional safeguard that the court takes account of
this issue. There is another protection to ensure that the seizure
powers are being used proportionately and correctly. It is obviously
important that seizure is not used to deprive a person of their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>ability to live. There are similar exemptions in respect to bailiffs and
insolvency law. So, there are established precedents that we have tried
to use with respect to this particular measure. The same amendment is
made for the three UK jurisdictions, which is why we get triple the
number.</div>
<a name="09022459000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 344, which is consequential to the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002, merely makes repeals to the Act consequential and necessary due
to the other amendments that I have spoken to in this
group.</div>
<a name="09022459000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022459000506"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for that explanation of the tranche of Government amendments
in this group. I hear what he says about judicial oversight and,
clearly, that is an issue that we will debate in further detail in
other parts of the
Bill.</div><a name="09022459000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
principal question for the Minister in respect to this group of
amendments regards the extension of the ambit of the search and seizure
powers by the creation of the new concept of &#147;realisable
property&#148;. Can he explain how that definition has been arrived
at, and how broad it is intended to be? I hear what he has said about
the arguments that have been put to him, by police and other law
enforcement agencies, on the need to extend those powers and on the way
this has been drawn up, but I would like to understand more clearly how
broad the definition of &#147;realisable property&#148; is, because
it seems to be very wide in its ambit. Does this provision extend the
law significantly, and how will the new clause be applied? What is the
actual basis of this provision, and how broad is the definition of
&#147;realisable property&#148;, as envisaged by the Government
amendments and their practical
application?</div><a name="09022459000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000507"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Let us re-establish what we are trying to do. We
are trying to prevent somebody who a law enforcement
officer&#151;essentially a police constable&#151;believes is trying
to get rid of property to avoid that property being restrained or
detained, so that it can be realised in the future when the
confiscation order is made.</div>
<a name="09022459000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Realisable
property&#148; is not a new concept; it is included in the Proceeds
of Crime Act. The easier way to define &#147;realisable
property&#148; is to look at what it is not realisable property, and
at what the court would say could not be used for recovering the
proceeds of crime. We have therefore tried to define exempt property
and say which things cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be
considered to be realisable property. So we are doing it the other way
round. Although the concept of &#147;realisable property&#148; is
readily understood and has been used by the courts for a number of
years, we are coming at it from the other direction by saying what sort
of property cannot be used. We have therefore tried to define exempt
property.</div><a name="09022459000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the problems of creating a list is that, as soon as it is completed,
something will arise that is not on it. We shall see this later with
some of the other amendments that the hon. Gentleman has tabled. The
amendment relating to gangs, for example, tries to define
&#147;gang-related&#148; activity. We have tried to tell the courts
what exempt property is&#151;namely, the things that we expect the
court not to treat as realisable property. We then leave it to the
court to determine what it means. Our approach has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>been to look at this completely the other way around from the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point of view. I hope that that explanation helps
him.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000512"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to an issue to which the Minister has
alluded: appropriate judicial oversight. The principal point with
regard to the significant powers set out in the Bill is which is the
right court to consider the hearings for extending the period of
seizure. There are two factors to consider. First, there is the
seriousness of the power and, therefore, the seniority of the court
that should decide&#151;a relevant factor in its own right. Secondly,
there is the complex nature of the issues at stake, and I think that
complex areas of law are likely to arise when the powers envisaged in
the Bill are
used.</div><a name="09022459000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about seriousness, cases involving other existing powers for
which a court authorisation is required are currently heard by the
Crown court, so we believe that that precedent should be adhered to in
this context. I am sure that the Minister will pray in aid the need for
speed, the availability of judges and the fact that at times it might
be necessary to use the powers set out in the Bill quickly, but I see
those as administrative requirements that do not get to the basis of
the seriousness of the powers or determine the type of court required
to provide the necessary judicial oversight.</div>
<a name="09022459000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government want to make that power available, they must do so on the
basis of appropriate judicial oversight, and if they need to organise
arrangements so that Crown court judges are available at short notice,
that is what they should do, in conjunction with the Ministry of
Justice, to reflect the nature of the powers under consideration.
Liberty, in its briefing note to the Committee, states
that</div><a name="09022459000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;under
the current provisions in relation to restraint orders (which are less
intrusive than this proposed measure) such orders must be approved by
the Crown Court. No reason is given as to why, at the very least, the
Crown Court is not involved in providing judicial
oversight.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022459000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Crown court is the
more appropriate court, given the serious interference with the right
to privacy and property that the provisions
introduce.</div><a name="09022459000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the issue of complexity, the Bar Council makes some equally
important observations that question whether Crown court judges are
suitably qualified to address the detailed points of law on trust
issues and distinctions between legal and equitable interests 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>in particular assets. There are several quite technical legal issues
involved in that regard, and the Bar Council has highlighted the
judgment in the Court of Appeal case of the Serious Fraud Office
<i class="I">v.</i> Lexi Holdings. It stated
that</div><a name="09022459000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
can be little doubt that the issues which arose in this case concerning
beneficial interests, equitable charges and tracing were far from
straightforward. They are not part of the daily work of most Crown
Court judges, and indeed this constitution of the Court of Appeal
Criminal Division was deliberately arranged so as to ensure that
appropriate expertise in matters normally falling within the
jurisdiction of the Chancery Division was available.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022459000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Bar
Council used that example to demonstrate the challenges, complexities
and issues that might arise in the use of that particular power, so
without in any way wanting to question or undermine the advice that
would be given to the Justices of the Peace on the exercise of their
powers, I think that the issues are by their nature extremely
complicated.</div>
<a name="09022459000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that case,
the Court of Appeal suggested that, because of the focus and nature of
the activities that Crown court judges would undertake, some of the
distinct issues of trust, such as ownership rights and the nature of
ownership and of particular assets, were not part and parcel of the
daily work of those courts. Indeed, if that argument is made about
Crown court judges, I am sure that the argument can by extension be
made with regard to magistrates courts.</div>
<a name="09022459000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
difficult to envisage how those powers could be used effectively with
that level of oversight, given the highly complex areas of law beyond
which a lay magistrate might be expected to make a determination, even
with the appropriate legal support that I have mentioned. Because we
think that judicial oversight at that level is appropriate for the type
of powers envisaged in the Government&#146;s proposals, we consider
the measure to be inappropriate. I urge the Government to reconsider
their stance and consider carefully what would be suitable judicial
oversight to ensure that these powers are used effectively,
proportionately and appropriately. We believe the most appropriate way
forward is to have that higher level of oversight, based on the
precedent for what is envisaged in these
provisions.</div><a name="09022459000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022459000513"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): These amendments get to the
core of the debate on clause 36. It is not the principle of what we are
seeking to achieve that is at stake but the mechanism and detail of how
we do it. In essence, clause 36 and related clauses extend the power to
search and seize property before conviction, before proceedings have
commenced and on the suspicion of reasonable cause by the police
officers involved. During the Committee&#146;s evidence sessions,
both Liberty and the Bar Council, for example, expressed concerns about
that power.</div>
<a name="09022459000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">When Paul
Evans, the director of intervention at the Serious Organised Crime
Agency, gave evidence on 27 January, he argued that these
changes were largely technical, backed up by the experience of policing
in this area since 2002, but the Bar Council argued that they were
substantial, and not technical, changes. Martin Evans of the Bar
Council
said:</div><a name="09022459000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bar Council has no objection to the principle that, in effect, personal
assets&#151;cars, jewellery or household effects, and other such
things&#151;could be detained under this power.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div><a name="09022459000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, he went on to
say that the Bar Council had particular concerns about moving to a
lower tier of oversight&#151;from the Crown court to
magistrates:</div><a name="09022459000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposal permits, on an application to the magistrates, the property to
be detained indefinitely. That is a concern because, as I said, it
introduces a lower tier.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Policing and Crime Public Bill Committee, </i>29 January 2009;
c. 86,
Q141.]</div><a name="09022459000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
has said similar things. Collectively the argument is, what is the
evidence that the current restraint system is not working properly?
Paul Evans argued that the experience of the past five to six years
indicates the system is not working adequately and requires those
changes. What is the evidence that the current powers are not adequate?
Above all, why are we moving from Crown court supervision to the lower
tier of magistrate supervision? The Minister has not explained why we
are taking that step in the Bill, yet it is a fundamental one in the
eyes of organisations such as the Bar Council and Liberty.</div>
<a name="09022459000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
question arises from the code of practice. The Minister has reassured
us at various points that the Government and the police are not seeking
to infringe human rights. They have to take into account European
declarations on human rights. When Mick Creedon, chief constable of
Derbyshire, gave evidence, he said that, of course, human rights infuse
everything they do. Much of this is going to be wrapped up in
regulations in the code of practice, which we have not yet seen.
Liberty expressed concern that such a major step should be taken based
on regulations in a code of practice that is yet to be seen, rather
than on regulations in primary legislation.</div>
<a name="09022459000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the crux
of these amendments is the question of why we should move from Crown
court supervision to a lower tier of magistrates. That raises related
questions regarding the evidence that we need to adopt these new
powers, as well as what is going to be in the code of practice and when
we are going to see it&#151;it is not sufficient just to receive
reassurances from the
Minister.</div><a name="09022459000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000514"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Chesterfield makes a
reasonable point, but he must understand&#151;and I have said this on
a number of occasions&#151;that if he were in my position or that of
the Home Secretary, he would have to wrestle with the fact that a
significant number of confiscation orders, which he knows can be passed
only by a Crown court, are unenforceable because the assets cannot be
got at. That is why he is not against the measure in principle.
Frankly, accepting that one can detain assets on arrest, and sometimes
in other circumstances, is a big step for the Government, the
Opposition and the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="09022459000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
public policy problem is about how we deal with the fact that
confiscation orders are unenforceable in many cases. The hon. Gentleman
says, &#147;Where is the evidence?&#148; The answer is that
confiscation orders involve large numbers of assets that we simply
cannot get at&#151;for want of a better way to put it. That public
policy problem is part of the issue. The hon. Members for Hornchurch
and for Chesterfield accept that fact, so we have to do something about
it. Law enforcement, including the excellent chief constable of
Derbyshire, who is very close to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s heart, and
the Serious Organised Crime Agency tell us that if we are to be
effective, quick and easy access to the courts is needed, which is why
we proposed the measure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div><a name="09022459000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me take
the hon. Member for Chesterfield through the procedure. The police, or
an accredited financial investigator, decide that they are going to
search and seize property. Normally, they would seek prior approval,
and there is such provision in the Bill. Frankly&#151;I may not be
supposed to say this&#151;I was not sure if an inspector was a senior
enough police officer. I thought that there would be an amendment on
that because it was something that I had thought about. However, I am
reassured about the rank of inspector in every other aspect of prior
approval. In most circumstances, we would expect there to be prior
approval, but if that approval cannot be accessed, there would be 48
hours to hold the property, then the authorities would obviously have
to go to a Crown court for a restraint order. I expect the more serious
things to go to a Crown court, but a magistrates court will be
acceptable for a simple detention order. Therefore, there is judicial
oversight, but the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the level of that
oversight; I have been advised that the magistrates courts are
perfectly
capable.</div><a name="09022459000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked why we are doing this and what the problem with
restraint orders is. As the Bar Council said, the property remains in
the possession of the person concerned. The fundamental difference with
these proposals is that it does not stay with that person&#151;the
property is searched, seized and detained. I hope that that answers the
specific point about why restraint orders alone are not sufficient. The
new power means that the Crown court can add detention of property to
the restraint order where appropriate, and nothing can be done with
restraint orders except by the Crown court. I imagine that it will deal
with more serious concerns and larger amounts of property and the
magistrates court will deal with other
property.</div>
<a name="09022459000471"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09022459000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
48 hours, further approval is needed to detain the property. There are
significant safeguards, about which the hon. Members for Chesterfield
and for Hornchurch asked. If somebody acts without prior approval, they
will have to report to the appointed person. The Bill also offers
another important safeguard that has to be complied with, as the
Secretary of State must publish any report received by the appointed
person and lay a copy before Parliament, as is the case with other
powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</div>
<a name="09022459000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Chesterfield said, we have not yet seen the code of
practice, but because I was concerned about safeguards, the Bill
specifically states that the code will be published in draft&#151;I
know that we have not seen it yet&#151;and that the Secretary of
State
must</div><a name="09022459000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consider
any representations made about the
draft,&#148;</div><a name="09022459000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09022459000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the Secretary of State thinks appropriate, modify the draft in the
light of any such
representations.&#148;</div><a name="09022459000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State must also lay the draft before Parliament, which
must then approve the code of practice. Therefore, even though the code
of practice has not yet been seen or published, there is a significant
effort in the Bill to try to do some of the things suggested by the
hon. Gentleman to provide the reassurance that he thinks
necessary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div><a name="09022459000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000515"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I thank the Minister for that response. Will the
code of practice be seen before or after
Report?</div><a name="09022459000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000516"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It certainly will not be seen before Report. The
best reassurance that I can give the hon. Gentleman is that Members
will have a proper opportunity to look at the code of practice before
it is debated by
Parliament.</div><a name="09022459000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
code will set out how the powers should be exercised proportionately.
Before carrying out a seizure, there must be some estimate of the
person&#146;s benefit from criminal conduct and of the value of any
property to be seized to ensure that only property up to the value of
the former is actually seized. There will also be guidelines on how to
assess the risk of dissipation, which is what we are all worried about.
The code will make clear that it should not be the default position
that any person being arrested for an acquisitive crime should have
their property seized. It will be important to assess the extent of the
person&#146;s criminality and of their unexplained income. The code
will provide that particular care should be taken with low-level
offenders against whom a confiscation order is unlikely to be made. It
will also provide guidance on the definition of exempt property that
may not be seized. That point might be of interest to the hon. Member
for Hornchurch, because it relates to an earlier discussion. The code
will provide for a periodic review by a senior officer of the
continuing detention of property under a court order. I hope that that
informs the hon. Member for Chesterfield on what we expect the code of
practice to contain. Finally, I know that this will not specifically
answer the points made by the hon. Gentlemen, but a detention order is
subject to an appeal to the Crown court. If a detention order is made
in a magistrates court, a defendant can appeal to the Crown court if
they wish to object to the
order.</div><a name="09022459000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000517"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> If, as the Minister said, he wrestled with
the concept of whether the inspector was the appropriate level of
officer to use the power in the first place, how did he arrive at the
decision that a justice of the peace in a magistrates court was the
right level for the initial scrutiny? He will recognise that appeals to
the Crown court would be at a later stage. Our argument is that the
first line of defence should be the Crown
court.</div><a name="09022459000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000518"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I took advice from law enforcement officers. As we
heard, the member of the Association of Chief Police Officers who deals
with the issue said that he felt that the magistrates court was an
appropriate level of judicial scrutiny, as did the Serious and
Organised Crime Agency. In taking those organisations&#146; judgment
into account, I felt that that level was appropriate.</div>
<a name="09022459000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not
new; many of the Bill&#146;s provisions replicate provisions in the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Given the safeguards that I have mentioned,
I am satisfied that that is the appropriate level of judicial approval.
We recognise the seriousness of the powers&#151;that is why there are
many safeguards. I take the point of the hon. Member for Hornchurch
that the initial decision is made in the magistrates court and that
although that decision is appealable to the Crown court, that is a
latter stage. However, that means that if the Crown court believes that
the magistrates court has acted disproportionately and unnecessarily,
it can vary or discharge the detention
order.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000519"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s
reassurances, but I wish to press him further. In view of what the
police have said&#151;presumably in light of their operational
experience&#151;why do we need to ratchet this down to the
magistrates court? What specific problems have the police encountered
over the past five or six years? Has there been a lack of immediate
access to the Crown court, or has the Crown court not agreed enough
with the police? What has led the police to recommend this change to
the Government, when the Bar Council, for example, is alarmed at the
implications of moving from the Crown court to a lower
tier?</div><a name="09022459000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000520"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> As I have said, we have taken the advice of the
police. The provision replicates similar powers in the 2002 Act,
particularly with regard to suspect cash. These are judgments that
people make. The magistrates court provides immediacy and speed of
action and the police or other law enforcement bodies can therefore act
speedily to ensure that assets are not dissipated. Given the
safeguards, particularly the appeal to the Crown court, this response
is appropriate and proportionate and I therefore ask the hon. Member
for Hornchurch to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="09022459000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000521"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s response to our
arguments about the appropriate level of judicial oversight is neither
compelling nor persuasive. He talked about wrestling with his
conscience over whether the inspector level was the appropriate officer
level, and we may perhaps wish to come back to that. In essence, he
said that we should take great assurance from and rely on the code of
practice, but one of the problems is that the Government&#146;s
assurance always seems to be based on something that is not published,
or is not available when we are considering significant and substantive
powers sought in a Bill. It is difficult for members of the Committee
to accept the Government&#146;s assurance when we have not seen the
document and do not know what is in it.</div>
<a name="09022459000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come back
to same issues, for example regarding the code of practice on
licensing, and I am sure that we will come to them regarding DNA
evidence&#151;the Government have tabled amendments on that as well.
We just do not know the context. The Government believe that, because
of the code of practice, the magistrates court is a more suitable
route, but how can they say that with such
assurance&#151;notwithstanding what the Bill might say about what the
code of practice may include&#151;when we have not seen the code? We
can properly assess whether what we are mandating is appropriate only
when we have seen that detail.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000523"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I will give way to the Minister, although I
think I know what point he will
make.</div><a name="09022459000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000524"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> This is precisely why we sometimes try to lay out
in great detail the process of drawing up a code of practice. Bills
often state that a code of practice will be published in due course,
and I have therefore gone out of my way, with the officials, to ensure
that there are various stages to that process, which will, in the end,
be a matter for Parliament to decide. Also, this is a similar 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>practice to that found in other codes of practice&#151;in the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, for example. However, I have tried to
respond to the points that the hon. Gentleman has made in the way that
the Bill was drawn up.</div>
<a name="09022459000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000525"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for going out
of his way, to use his phrase. However, I still do not think that that
is sufficient. Whatever may go into a code of practice or guidance on
the way in which these powers can be utilised, that code of practice
cannot get to the root of complicated and fundamental points of law and
the judgments that will have to be reached on those points of
law.</div>
<a name="09022459000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister will know, in the past I have, sadly, been a lawyer and
practised law. I can therefore tell him that issues of equity, legal
interest and tracing claims of ownership are very technical issues,
which are quite challenging. That is the fundamental point that the Bar
Council is seeking to make in the matters that it highlights. When the
Minister talked about the various groups and organisations that he had
consulted when he was determining that this level of judicial oversight
was correct, it was interesting that they all seemed to focus on the
enforcement side. There did not seem to have been any consultation
with, for example, the Magistrates Association or with the judiciary
themselves. Indeed, the Bar Council has made its views very clear,
through the note that it provided to this Committee.</div>
<a name="09022459000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the police
and the Serious Organised Crime Agency are saying that they require
scrutiny to be at this level, perhaps because of certain practical
issues such as the availability of judges or other associated issues,
that should be considered. However, I do not think that the Minister
has said that. He has said that he has consulted those agencies and
they have advised him that they believe that this is the most
appropriate level of scrutiny to be applied, but without necessarily
giving back-up information or justification for that.</div>
<a name="09022459000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was
made that the Crown court is used as the appropriate level of judicial
scrutiny for restraint orders, which, it is argued, are less intrusive
than the types of orders that we are contemplating here. Therefore,
although I understand that the Minister has said that he believes that
this level of scrutiny is appropriate in the circumstances, I do not
think that he has made his case sufficiently strongly to persuade us.
That is why I want to divide the Committee on amendment 108.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000541"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> After the Division, may I restore harmony and also
reassure the hon. Member for Hornchurch that I have not abandoned my
style and approach by saying that, with respect to this particular
group of amendments, I see a lot of merit in amendment 113? It raises
some important issues. However, I would just like to go through the
Government amendments, which I believe address the point that the hon.
Gentleman has made in amendment 113. It is important to put this on the
record.</div><a name="09022459000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confirm that our policy intention is that property may be detained
under proposed new section 47J only for as long as the appropriate
officer is satisfied that all conditions under proposed new section 47B
continue to be met and he or she continues to have reasonable grounds
for suspecting that the property might be dissipated. If the officer is
not satisfied on either count, I accept that the property must be
released. Government amendment 261 deals with that important point. I
am grateful to the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Bury St. Edmunds
for identifying the gap in the
provisions.</div><a name="09022459000472"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
<a name="09022459000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 261, 263 and 264 will add to the new sections of the 2002
Act proposed in clauses 36 to 38. Those provide powers to search and
seize property that might otherwise not satisfy a confiscation order or
might be diminished in value. We tabled the amendments in response to
amendments tabled by the Opposition and we are grateful for their
assistance in pointing out the issue. We had taken the point to be
implicit, but in response to amendment 113, we are making it
explicit.</div><a name="09022459000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments will add a further safeguard to the operation of
the powers, which I think will be welcomed by the Committee. If an
officer seizes property, he may detain it for 48 hours before obtaining
judicial approval for its continued detention. The amendments clarify
that the proposed new section 47B preconditions to exercise the power,
and the suspicion of dissipation mentioned in proposed new section
47C(1), must still exist for the continued detention of the property
during the 48 hours. That will place a much stronger obligation on the
seizing officer to continually consider the grounds on which he
operates the powers and the reasons for which the property was
seized.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div><a name="09022459000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will take
this opportunity to signal to the Committee that I will table a further
amendment on Report. In our 12 February sitting, we a had a
constructive debate on the need for the police and others to use
seizure and detention powers with care and discretion. We all accept
that seizing someone&#146;s property is a serious matter. I undertook
to consider further the matter of proportionality in the use of powers
to detain seized property, and I have done so. I see some
merit&#151;a lot of merit, if I am honest&#151;in inserting an
explicit obligation for the detaining officer to release property when
they are no longer satisfied that the conditions for its detention are
met. Necessity and proportionality will be an ongoing consideration,
but as a strong indication of the importance that I attach to the
proportionate use of the powers, I will place such an obligation
clearly in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022459000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that I disagreed with Opposition Members on the last point, but I
hope that I have given them and those who read our debates some
reassurance that we are continually considering how these necessary
powers can be used proportionately, as they are a significant extension
of
powers.</div><a name="09022459000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000542"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As the Minister said, Government amendment
261 addresses the issue we raised in tabling amendment 113, but in a
slightly different way. Clearly, our point has been taken on board. We
welcome that and the Minister&#146;s preparedness to accept our
points on the operation of clause 36. I also note his comments on
proportionality, which we debated before the recess. We look forward to
seeing his amendment on Report to address the need for these powers to
be used in a reasonable
way.</div><a name="09022459000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000545"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> A number of these amendments repeat some of
my earlier arguments about the need for proportionality, for judicial
oversight to come from the Crown court rather than the magistrates
court and for appeal rights to be to the Court of Appeal. In the light
of our previous debate I do not intend to rehearse those arguments
again. However, I ask the Minister to reflect carefully on the points
that have been made not just by me but by the Bar Council and Liberty
on the appropriate level of judicial oversight. Obviously we look
forward to seeing further Government amendments on the proportionality
of the use of these
provisions.</div><a name="09022459000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
117 makes a slightly different point. It seeks to give third parties
who have an interest in the assets that have been detained, and in
respect of which an application for further detention is sought, the
right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>to make representations to the court. As previously noted, innocent
parties may have a direct interest in the relevant assets and their
continued detention may cause them hardship. In order that convention
rights are maintained and upheld, amendment 117 provides for a specific
right to make representations to the
court.</div><a name="09022459000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting to note that Government amendment 270 adds a right for
third parties to make representations prior to the realisations of
assets. If that concept is accepted in that context why should it not
equally apply if an order is granted authorising the detention of such
assets for an extended period? While we are looking at this part of
clause 36, could the Minister tell us why proposed new section 47N(3),
on the discharge, variation and lapse of detention orders, provides
that an application must be made to the court to discharge the
detention order where proceedings for the offence mentioned have been
concluded? Why is that not automatic? Why is that court application
required? Why does the order not simply lapse in these
circumstances?</div><a name="09022459000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000546"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Let me deal with what the hon. Gentleman has said.
I think he will be pleased with one or two of the points that I shall
make, to continue with this constructive approach. He has made one or
two interesting points with his
amendments&#151;</div><a name="09022459000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022459000547"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): You&#146;ll ruin
his career at this
rate.</div><a name="09022459000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000548"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am trying to enhance his career. Constructive
debate is a way to enhance one&#146;s
career.</div><a name="09022459000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
amendments deal with when the hearing takes place, rather than the
level of judicial oversight for the prior approval that we debated
earlier. They are about which court is appropriate to deal with the
various parts of the Bill. Amendments 114, 116 and 118 to 122 are about
which court is appropriate for making an order for further detention of
the seized property and for considering appeals. As I explained
earlier, these new powers are based on similar provisions in the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 as regards detention and forfeiture of cash.
Judicial oversight as regards seized cash is provided by the
magistrates court or a justice of the peace. An appeal against
forfeiture of cash is heard in the Crown court. We will, therefore, not
create a precedent with such further detention powers and the appeals
provisions in clause
36.</div><a name="09022459000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have stressed from the outset, we expect that higher value or complex
cases would be subject to a restraint order. In those cases, the
authority for further detention of property would come from the Crown
court&#151;as I have said on numerous occasions, restraint orders can
be dealt with only by the Crown court. It is only in those cases where
there is no restraint order that application further to detain seized
property is made to the magistrates court. The magistrate must be
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the
seized property might be disposed of or hidden, or that the value of
the property might be diminished.</div>
<a name="09022459000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
hon. Member for Hornchurch raises an important point in amendments 116
and 122 and I have some sympathy with the concerns that he raises. I
want to be satisfied as to the appropriate level of judicial oversight
in such cases and whether it is right for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>single justice of the peace, rather than a magistrates court, to deal
with the hearings in relation to detention orders. I would therefore
like to consider further whether a justice of the peace would be
properly equipped to consider applications under proposed new sections
47M and 47N. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find it helpful if I
say that I will give further consideration to those amendments and will
return to those matters as the Bill progresses. On that basis, I ask
the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing his amendments, but I stress
that I will consider his points
further.</div><a name="09022459000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendment 115, I again recognise the importance of the detention period
being reasonable and proportionate. It will be for the magistrates
courts to consider what is a reasonable and proportionate period for
which the property can be detained. In addition, as I have previously
explained, any person affected by an order can apply at any time for
variation or discharge of the order. More generally, the proposed new
sections 47B(9) and 47B(10) of the Proceeds of Crime Act, set out in
clause 36, mean that the powers cannot be exercised in cases where
there is undue delay in the criminal proceedings, or the application to
reconsider the confiscation order. Furthermore, a proposed new section
47M(3) prevents undue delay creeping in as regards the continued
detention of the property. Such delay is a ground for a discharge of a
detention order.</div>
<a name="09022459000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 117
draws attention to the important issue of the rights of third parties.
Let me assure the Committee and the hon. Gentleman that we fully
recognise the need to take account of third party interests in detained
property. The defendant, or indeed any third party affected by a
detention order, can apply for the discharge or the variation of that
order. That gives third parties the opportunity to apply to the court
for the release of seized property.</div>
<a name="09022459000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions on third party rights in clause 36 mirror those in section
42(3) of the 2002 Act, as regards the rights of third parties to apply
for the variation or discharge of a restraint order. There is also a
right of appeal to the Crown court against a magistrates court&#146;s
decision. As I have said before, those are all appropriate safeguards
to ensure that the seizure and detention powers are used
proportionally. However, I accept that the rights of third parties are
important and therefore I would like to consider further the scope for
allowing third parties the opportunity, on application, to make
representations in respect of hearings under proposed new section
47N.</div>
<a name="09022459000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond that,
a code of practice will contain further details on the exercise of the
search and seizure powers, including the need to take account of third
party rights, in order to ensure that they are exercised lawfully and
proportionately. On the issue of the code of practice, I will take the
opportunity to respond to an issue raised by the Bar Council in regard
to the dissipation of assets. I confirm to the Committee that the code
will make it clear that the risk of dissipation will have to be
significant before the property is seized.</div>
<a name="09022459000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
with those remarks and explanation, the offer to consider some of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s points and to consider further the question of
the rights of third parties, the hon. Gentleman might consider
withdrawing his amendments.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the way in which the
Minister responded to this group of amendments in that he is prepared
to reflect on which is the appropriate court in respect of the
provisions in the clause. Equally, I am grateful that he will look also
at other points, for example third party rights. While he says that it
will be open to a third party to make an application, it needs to be
clear that third parties are not prejudiced and that if they have
rights in respect of the assets, they are able to make representations
at an appropriate stage. If there is an initial hearing, it should be
possible to make representations then, rather than the party being
forced subsequently to make an application to challenge or override an
order that has been granted. However, I accept the spirit in which the
Minister replied, and in light of his assurance that he will look at
the matter&#151;we will listen carefully to how he responds on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000588"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The Committee discussed Government amendments 266
to 289 on 12 February, before the recess, as part of a more general
debate on the seizure, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>detention and sale of property. I do not propose to go over all of that
again today, but will instead focus on Government amendments 319, 320
and
321.</div><a name="09022459000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
319 amends section 69(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. It is
consequential to other amendments that we have made elsewhere in the
Bill. Section 69 of POCA makes provision for England and Wales;
amendments 320 and 321 make the corresponding changes to the relevant
provisions for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Section 69 makes
provision about how the courts are to exercise their powers: for
example, it emphasises that the powers must be exercised with a view to
allowing third parties to retain or recover the value of any interest
they hold, and that the satisfaction of a confiscation order takes
precedence over other obligations of the defendant or the recipient of
a tainted gift from the defendant. It also requires that powers must be
exercised with a view to maintaining the value of the amount available
for confiscation. The amendments add the new power to the courts of
making directions about proceeds, most obviously in respect of innocent
third
parties.</div><a name="09022459000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
266 to 269, 273 to 278, 282 and 284 to 286 add to the new provisions in
POCA relating to seizing, detaining and selling property to meet the
value of an outstanding confiscation order. They merely provide that,
out of the amount paid in settlement of a confiscation order, the
police and other law enforcement agencies can claim back their
reasonable costs of having to store and sell property. It is entirely
reasonable that the additional cost that falls on the police and others
is reimbursed, much as it is at the moment under POCA in respect of
receivers. It is a matter of budgeting. Costs are reimbursed after the
event, rather than being funded up front, and they are paid out of the
settled amount, so that no additional burden of payment falls on the
defendant. I see the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Chesterfield
acknowledge the importance of that.</div>
<a name="09022459000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is simply to do with the distribution of the money that has been
collected. That it is the magistrates court and not the
&#147;enforcer&#148; that decides what the reasonable costs are
provides a safeguard by ensuring independent judicial oversight of the
costs incurred.</div>
<a name="09022459000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000589"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister has fastened on the key point
and is explaining it. To be clear, we are talking about simply an
application of proceeds rather than any additional cost&#151;an order
of priority, if I can describe it like that, in respect of which
organisation gets a particular sum of money first in the distribution
of cash that has been realised. Will he confirm that the provision does
no more than that?</div>
<a name="09022459000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000590"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is correct&#151;I hope that reassures the
hon. Gentleman. He has explained a fundamental point well.</div>
<a name="09022459000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
270, 272, 279, 281, 283, 287 and 289 add to the new provisions in the
Proceeds of Crime Act. They simply amend the provisions on distributing
sums received in consequence of payment of a confiscation order.
Notably, they provide that where a court has determined the reasonable
costs that the police or another law enforcement agency has incurred,
those costs are paid from the recovered amount. They also provide for
the court, whether a Crown court or magistrates court, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>to make directions on any payment. That means that any third party
interests in the property can also be paid back.</div>
<a name="09022459000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
271, 280 and 288 are merely technical amendments. The changes to POCA
that those amendments remove will be made in schedule 6 to the Bill.
Nothing is changing. It is just tidier to make all the consequential
amendments that flow from the changes to POCA in one place.</div>
<a name="09022459000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000591"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I wish to put on the record a few remarks that I
think are important. I will not detain the Committee long, but the
clause is important, as it goes to the heart of recovering the money to
meet the confiscation order, which essentially is what we are all
trying to do. The exchange between the hon. Member for Hornchurch and I
had goes to the nub of what could have been controversial about the
clause. Although that exchange was brief, it was very
helpful.</div>
<a name="09022459000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides an important addition to the powers to enforce outstanding
confiscation orders. It is obviously not enough for the court to make a
confiscation order against a convicted defendant. I say again to the
hon. Member for Chesterfield that confiscation orders can only be made
in a Crown court. Payment of the confiscation order must be ensured,
otherwise the order has no value. We all feel better if a confiscation
order is made, but have we denied the criminal assets to the
individual? We simply have to do better in ensuring that these orders
are
paid.</div><a name="09022459000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause provides that property that has been seized in England and Wales
by an appropriate officer under a relevant seizure power, or which has
been produced to such an officer in compliance with a production order
under the Proceeds of Crime Act, may be sold to meet a confiscation
order. That completes the set of powers of being able to retain
property seized under other powers for confiscation purposes in clauses
33 to 35, the new power to search for and seize property on or
following arrest in clauses 36 to 38, and now this important power of
sale. Those are significant new powers to aid the enforcement of
confiscation orders, which I know is something that all of us in the
Committee want to see.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div><a name="09022459000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically,
the clause provides that a magistrates court can authorise the sale of
seized property if a confiscation order has been made and the time to
pay that order has expired without its being paid. The clause does not
apply to cases where an enforcement receiver has been appointed; in
such cases, the enforcement receiver will sell the property under
existing powers.</div>
<a name="09022459000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The property
must have been seized under specified powers in the Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002 or the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, although there
is the power to add to that list by order. The listed seizure powers
are those likely to have been used in respect of defendants who are
also subject to a financial investigation. A confiscation investigation
aims to establish whether a defendant has benefited from his criminal
conduct and, if so, the extent or whereabouts of that
benefit.</div>
<a name="09022459000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who can
be authorised to sell the property are officers who perform financial
investigations under POCA, namely accredited financial investigators,
constables, officers of HMRC, SOCA officers and members of staff of the
main prosecution agencies. The money raised by the sale is to be paid
directly to the court enforcing the confiscation
order.</div>

am</div><a name="09022459000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a right of appeal against a decision either to make or not to make
an order authorising sale. The right of appeal is available to affected
third parties, but not to the defendant against whom the confiscation
order has been made. He or she has an existing right of appeal against
confiscation as part of a general right of appeal against sentence
under the Criminal Appeals Act 1968.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000592"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have two points to make in relation to the
clause, which extends the limitation period in which civil recovery
proceedings can be brought from 12 to 20 years. My first point is on
the ability to obtain a fair trial after such an extended period. The
Minister may be aware that in response to the consultation on the asset
recovery action plan the Fraud Advisory Panel voiced the concern
that</div><a name="09022459000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
problem with extending the limitation period is that it may be
considerably more difficult for a defendant to assimilate evidence
necessary to defend the case; memories may be faded and records thrown
away.&#148;</div><a name="09022459000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
panel was concerned about the impact of the clause on the ability to
obtain a fair trial. Why does the Minister consider the 20-year period
appropriate? Has he thought through the Human Rights Act implications
for the ability to obtain a fair trial after an extended period?
Although, if someone simply got away with it and the authorities have
finally worked out that assets have been received by criminal activity,
I respect and understand the need to ensure that the benefit of those
assets is not in the hands of that person, a significant period has
elapsed. There is therefore a question of proportionality and what is
appropriate to balance the private versus the public arguments and to
ensure due process.</div>
<a name="09022459000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is slightly different. A victim of an acquisitive crime, for
example, must generally commence any action against the perpetrator
within 12 years of the crime. Why should the state be in the privileged
position, as envisaged in the clause, of having a further eight years
to bring an action for civil recovery if an individual in similar
circumstances does not have that benefit? In other words, why have the
Government decided that there should not be a level playing field, and
why should civil recovery procedures not apply equally to a victim of
an acquisitive crime? It would be interesting to know why the Minister
has fastened upon that point as particularly relevant.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div><a name="09022459000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">In what
circumstances have the police and SOCA advised him that they have
identified assets that were received through unlawful activity, but
they now feel prevented from taking action? How significant a problem
is that? How many cases does the Minister expect will be revisited as a
consequence of the clause, and why does he therefore regard it as
important and necessary to the
Bill?</div><a name="09022459000338"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000593"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point&#151;on
civil recovery and how far one goes back in relation to evidence of an
acquisitive crime&#151;is interesting. I will say something about
that in a
moment.</div><a name="09022459000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
once, I am not sure whether I properly understand his point about fair
trial. It strikes me that, whether a trial is in the civil or criminal
courts, if the evidence is not of sufficient quality, it is part of a
court&#146;s fundamental process that proceedings will not be able to
be pursued in the judicial system. There will be cases where it will be
more difficult to gather evidence and collect material&#151;as the
hon. Gentleman said, memories fade&#151;but that is part of most
court processes. I understand his point that, if the amount of time is
extended, such circumstances are more likely to occur, but that will
clearly be a matter for the court to consider. The inadequacy of
memories or written material is not a reason to say that it is not
appropriate for us to legislate under the powers. I would have thought
that that is something that the court will take into
account.</div><a name="09022459000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000594"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To clarify the point that the Fraud Advisory
Panel highlighted, I am comparing the resources that might be available
to the arms of the state to launch a prosecution and to obtain all the
evidence and documents mentioned by the Minister with the ability of an
individual to defend that case in circumstances where a significant
period has elapsed. We presumably have limitation periods for a reason,
and the Minister might be able to make an argument for a period of more
than 20 years, but the issue has clearly been raised with him, Why has
20 years been decided upon and why is the period of 12 years to be
extended
now?</div><a name="09022459000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000595"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that I was
about to make. He has referred to one particular response that we
received on extending the civil recovery period from 12 to 20 years,
but a significant number of people responded by saying that there
should be no limit on the period in which we seek to recover assets.
Again, a judgment has been made. We received evidence from SOCA and law
enforcement of some cases that have been time barred, so we thought it
appropriate to extend the time period from 12 to 20
years.</div><a name="09022459000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
pm</div><a name="09022459000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to my earlier response to the hon. Gentleman, he will know
better than me the process in court, but as far as I see it, the rights
of defendants in court are always protected as far as possible by the
court. Enabling defendants to defend themselves, particularly in civil
proceedings, is one of the measures that the court adopts to ensure
that a fair trial takes place. I understand the point that the hon.
Gentleman makes about the full power of the state being used as against
the rights of an individual to protect themselves.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div><a name="09022459000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">A court is a
public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. It has to
ensure, as a matter of principle, that a fair trial can take place. I
should have thought that the fact that that is laid out will ensure
that there is a fair trial, even when we have extended the civil
recovery powers from 12 to 20 years. Although the hon. Gentleman tries
to equate the criminal law with the civil law, as I understand it they
are significantly different. Therefore the civil recovery process is a
different process from the criminal process and so the time periods
will be decided upon in the appropriate
way.</div><a name="09022459000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000596"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> While the Minister is right to say that there
is a distinction between civil and criminal law, the issues overlap to
a certain extent as we go into this sort of area. Is he prepared to
think about recovery on criminal proceedings, given that there does not
seem to be a level playing field here? It is being extended on one side
on the same or similar subject matter, yet the criminal law seems to
have an earlier limitation period which, on his line of argument, seems
less supportable
now.</div><a name="09022459000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000597"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will always consider things. I have become more
of an expert on the civil law than the criminal law and more of an
expert on all sorts of different laws since I have had this position. I
have never studied law and nor am I likely to. I understand the term is
a pupil barrister and I am very much a pupil. I will consider the point
that the hon. Gentleman has made. This is an important provision. There
have been problems with the limit and this is a sensible way
forward.</div><a name="09022459000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
43 amends the Limitation Act 1980 and its equivalents in Scotland and
Northern Ireland in order to extend the limitation period in which
civil recovery proceedings may be brought for the recovery of the
proceeds of unlawful conduct under chapter 2 of part 5 of the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2002. The clause will enable civil recovery proceedings to
be brought within 20 years from when the original property was obtained
through unlawful conduct, rather than 12 years as at present. The
limitation period applies from the date on which the cause of action of
the relevant enforcement authority, for example SOCA, accrued. The date
is the date on which the property was obtained through unlawful
conduct.</div>
<a name="09022459000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The civil
recovery scheme for the recovery of the proceeds of crime, which was
introduced in the Proceeds of Crime Act, has been running successfully
now for around six years. Not surprisingly, the new scheme got off to a
slow start as cases and the new legislation were tested in the courts,
but the Assets Recovery Agency successfully saw off the legal
challenges and we now have a robust scheme in place.</div>
<a name="09022459000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Civil
recovery is a powerful tool in attacking criminal finances. That is
why, when we merged the key functions of the Assets Recovery Agency
into SOCA, we took the opportunity in the Serious Crime Act, which the
hon. Gentleman and I also had the pleasure of debating, to give civil
recovery powers to a wider range of authorities, including the Director
of Public Prosecutions and the director of the Serious Fraud Office.
The Serious Fraud Office had an early success in the use of these
powers with the obtaining of an order of &#163;2.25 million last
October, which has been paid.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div><a name="09022459000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The experience
of civil recovery over the last few years has shown that a 12-year
limitation period for bringing proceedings has allowed some potentially
recoverable property to go untouched, as the enforcement authorities
are prohibited from taking any action. Civil recovery powers are
increasingly being used to tackle serious organised crime, which by its
very nature frequently goes back further than 12 years, and there are
career criminals whose serious criminality can last much of their adult
lives. In addition, large-scale international corruption can go back
decades, and if civil recovery is to be used to recover assets stolen
by corrupt regimes, as envisaged by the World Bank and other
international partners, we will have to go back further than 12
years.</div>
<a name="09022459000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did
consult on extending the 12-year limit in civil recovery cases as part
of a wider asset recovery action plan. A large majority of the
respondents favoured an extension of the time limit, with some calling,
as I have told the hon. Gentleman, for it to be removed altogether. The
clause seeks to address those views by extending the limit to 20 years.
Subsection (2) will apply the 20-year limit to causes of action
accruing within 12 years of commencement, which is an
important point. In other words, causes of action falling within the
existing 12-year limitation period will be subject to an additional
eight years in which they are actionable in the future. That will
capture those whose property is already liable to civil proceedings
under the current 12-year period by prolonging the time for bringing
proceedings. It will also cover future cases in which the cause of
action accrues more than 12 years after commencement, and those cases
will also have the 20-year limitation period. Those cases in which the
12-year limit has already expired will remain time-barred and will not
be reactivated. I believe that that is a proportionate measure to
recover assets acquired through unlawful
conduct.</div><a name="09022459000351"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000598"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I will raise one general point of principle
and then some more general queries. The point of principle is that
clause 46 gives a new power of what might be termed
&#147;administrative forfeiture&#148; without the need for a court
order. An important principle is being set out: in essence, the state
can order the forfeiture of assets without going to court. That might
be convenient for law enforcement and SOCA, but it will erode a
fundamental principle of the law on property rights. If it is argued
that in some way that is about cost, administrative convenience, access
to the courts and timing, those arguments have to be balanced against
the principle of the existing requirement for the state to go to court
to obtain an order to get the forfeiture of assets in those
circumstances. That concept and the need for due process to be seen to
be done&#151;a court being seen to be the body that actually uses the
power&#151;is important for the way in which we organise ourselves
and for the sort of society we want. The Minister needs to come up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>with a clear and persuasive case for why that balance should not be
adhered to and why those powers are so necessary and appropriate that
the Government have to go against the current requirement for a court
application to use powers of forfeiture and instead go through this
process of administration.</div>
<a name="09022459000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the use of
forfeiture and the performance of the relevant agencies more generally,
the Minister will know that we have had various debates and discussions
before about the historical performance of the Assets Recovery Agency
and the fact that it did not meet its targets, which in many ways was
why it was merged into SOCA. The key questions are about how SOCA is
performing, whether it is using those and other powers appropriately,
and whether its recoveries exceed its costs, because that was the big
problem with how the Assets Recovery Agency operated. That agency had
to be changed because although it had recovered &#163;23 million by
December 2006, it had cost the taxpayer &#163;65 million. The
Minister will be aware of the reports of the National Audit Office and
the Public Accounts Committee highlighting the weaknesses in the Assets
Recovery Agency and how it conducted its business. We need to know that
there will be some transparency in how SOCA uses those powers and how
it performs financially, because it is sometimes difficult to read from
SOCA&#146;s annual report how it is performing and what level of
recoveries, forfeitures and financial assets it has managed to recover
when using such powers. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that
SOCA will publish financial information on its asset recovery function
showing its net recoveries using those powers?</div>
<a name="09022459000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">The old ARA
used to provide such information, and the Minister&#146;s colleague,
the Under-Secretary, has provided me with parliamentary answers on this
subject, for which I am grateful, but it is important to know about net
recoveries&#151;costs against assets recovered&#151;if we are to
understand and scrutinise SOCA appropriately. Similar information that
was previously obtained about the ARA flagged up the problems on which
the NAO and PAC reported, so it is important to understand that SOCA is
acting appropriately and is not in the unfortunate position in which
the ARA found itself of having higher costs than recoveries from
forfeiture and recovered assets. We need that assurance not only to see
how powers are being used, but to be sure that SOCA is delivering value
for money when utilising those and other
powers.</div><a name="09022459000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000599"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Cases in which people contest these matters will
go to court. Only in uncontested cases can a forfeiture order be made.
If someone receives a notice saying, &#147;You are going to forfeit
this detained cash,&#148; all they have to do is say, &#147;I
object,&#148; and it will become a matter for the courts. One would
suppose that if someone thought, &#147;My goodness, the state is
taking money that is legally mine&#151;money that I have worked for
all these years and that I have saved for my retirement,&#148; they
would object. If the police had detained someone&#146;s money, and
they received a letter telling them that it would be forfeited unless
they objected, 99.9 per cent. of the population would say, &#147;Hang
on, that money is legally mine; I&#146;m going to object,&#148; and
it would become a matter for the courts.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div><a name="09022459000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">People do not

would not do that? That is the question is it not? Who would not say to
the court, &#147;I object to you detaining my money,&#148; if
&#163;10,000 of their money was being held and was going to be kept?
Does anyone honestly expect that that person would not ring up the
court and send them a note saying, &#147;Excuse me, I object&#148;?
Who would not do that? That question answers itself. The people who
will not do that are those who think, &#147;Hang on a minute, I
obtained this money illegally or criminally.&#148; The question the
hon. Member for Hornchurch did not answer is, if money is taken from a
person and detained and they know that it was gained honestly and
legally, why would they not tell the person who takes it that it is
legally theirs? There must then be a court hearing. Why would anybody
not reasonably do that? The vast majority of the population would be
amazed to think that anybody who has money legally would not object to
somebody taking it from them. If it was my money, there would be a
letter in the post straight
away.</div><a name="09022459000476"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000600"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says, but he is
making various assumptions in saying that a person who gains money
legally will always object. He said that the vast majority of those who
do not object will be criminals or those who know they have received
money unlawfully. However, there may be circumstances in which that is
not the case. Somebody in receipt of such a notice might not fully
appreciate its nature and ambit and that forfeiture will arise. That
could happen regardless of what is stated in the provisions on the
right to challenge such a
notice.</div><a name="09022459000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
caution the Minister about making the administrative convenience
argument. Why should there not be a simple obligation on the relevant
authorities to obtain the necessary order from a court and be done with
it? I want to understand why it is felt that the route in the clause is
better. There is a broader issue of principle because the proposal sets
certain precedents. That is why I am not just focusing on the specifics
of the
clause.</div><a name="09022459000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000601"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, I
just do not agree with it. I rarely say that I just do not agree with
people. There is a process and the clause is about speeding up that
process and not wasting the court&#146;s time, while ensuring that
the power is used in a necessary and proportionate
way.</div><a name="09022459000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I went through the Bill I ensured that it contained all sorts of
safeguards. If someone receives a forfeiture notice saying that this
mythical &#163;10,000 will be detained and held by the state, there
are 30 days in which they can object. If they do so, there will be a
court hearing. If the court decides that the forfeiture notice should
become an order, there is another 30 days in which to
object&#151;that is 60
days.</div><a name="09022459000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
exceptional circumstances, the person can go to the court and put the
case made by the hon. Gentleman. They could say, &#147;I&#146;m
sorry, I live in Spain. I come back to my place in the UK every three
months and, goodness me, when I returned I found a notice in my letter
box 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>saying that I will lose &#163;10,000.&#148; Being an honest person,
they might ring the court and say, &#147;The exceptional circumstance
is that I forfeited the money while I was in Spain. How was I supposed
to know?&#148; The Bill will give that person the right of appeal to
the court to say that there were exceptional circumstances for running
out of time. Because they were in Spain for three months, they can go
to the court and it can set aside the
order.</div><a name="09022459000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
have been many debates on this provision on real issues. I understand
the point about traditional oversight and such things. However, on this
issue, the only people with anything to worry about are those who have
obtained cash criminally, had it detained and as a consequence will
forfeit it unless they follow due process. The clause is an important
part of the Bill. I would have hoped that the judicial oversight, the
additional time available and the appeal would have been sufficient,
but I have clearly failed to convince the hon. Gentleman of that. We
have tried to build in the necessity to ensure that more cash is
forfeited with judicial
oversight.</div><a name="09022459000366"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000602"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise briefly for the last time in this
section to say that this comes down to whether one accepts, as a
starting point, that it is right for the state to have the ability to
forfeit private assets, or whether ones feels that the court should
have that ability. I recognise what the Minister says about judicial
oversight, but that depends on who has the ultimate authority. He is
setting a precedent by saying that the state rather than the court has
the right to forfeit. It is that distinction between the judiciary, and
the legislature and the Government, that I seek to underline on the
basis of fundamental principles. While I accept that he does not
understand it, that is the basis of my argument. I do not support
criminal elements or those who have acquired ill-gotten gains through
illegal
means.</div><a name="09022459000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000603"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It was unfair of me to say that I did not
understand the point&#151;I did. I suppose that I was saying that I
do not agree with it. As always, the hon. Gentleman put his point
perfectly.</div><a name="09022459000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall make one further point on judicial oversight. The hon. Gentleman
does not agree with my point and feels that I am setting a precedent,
but I have tried to balance the need to get more detained cash
forfeited with sufficient safeguards to ensure that somebody can go to
the courts to protect their money. However, there will, of course,
already have been a court order to detain the
cash.</div><a name="09022459000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000604"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is
different.</div><a name="09022459000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000605"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that it is different. The
cash is detained by a court order and is then forfeited. The point of
difference is that the hon. Gentleman wants there always to be judicial
forfeiture, but in certain circumstances there is a case for
administrative forfeiture. Administrative forfeiture is not, however,
automatic. There is judicial oversight, so someone can go back to the
court and say that the forfeiture is not fair and they wish to contest
it because the money was not criminally gained. Providing that that is
done, the measure is proportionate, particularly as in exceptional
circumstances someone can appeal if the time limit laid out in the Bill
has run out.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div><a name="09022459000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
increasing numbers of detained cash investigations and detained cash
orders, and there is the need therefore to try to forfeit the money. We
all want to ensure that more criminal assets are obtained from
criminals and that they do not gain from their criminal activity. This
is a proportionate step forward; it balances the administrative process
with some judicial
oversight.</div><a name="09022459000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise; I forgot to deal with SOCA. Hon. Members will know that I
always try to answer the questions. Whether I answer them to their
satisfaction is another matter. The hon. Gentleman raised a point about
SOCA. The easy part of the answer is that he knows that SOCA will
publish its annual report, in which it will have to outline its
progress. SOCA will publish its reports in the same way as ARA did, and
that should allow proper comparison between them with respect to assets
recovered. I know the hon. Gentleman is concerned about that. I hope
that that is helpful to
him.</div><a name="09022459000373"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000606"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 252, in
clause 48, page 62, line 1, leave
out subsection
(2).</div><a name="09022459000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come now to a separate part of the Bill that deals not with asset
recovery, but with matters relating to extradition and, in particular,
the issue of the adoption of the Schengen information system II: how it
applies to us in the UK and the interrelationship with the European
arrest warrant. It is worth noting that the UK is not a part of the
Schengen convention and does not currently have access to the existing
Schengen information system. The framework decision underlying the EAW,
though, envisages that an issuing judicial authority would transmit an
EAW directly to the receiving country&#146;s judicial authority, or
by means of issuing an alert for the request of a person through the
Schengen information system.</div>
<a name="09022459000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard
in evidence, the UK currently receives EAWs via Interpol channels, or
through the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Amendment 252 is a probing
amendment tabled in order better to understand the relationship between
a situation where an article 26 alert has been entered on the Schengen
information system, and where it has not. My understanding was that the
change to the Extradition Act 2003 was intended to facilitate the
UK&#146;s compliance with the framework decision, yet subsection (2)
appears to go further than this, enabling the transmission of an EAW by
electronic means other than an alert on the new Schengen information
system II. What do the Government envisage by that?</div>
<a name="09022459000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also explain what reciprocal arrangements exist with other
countries to enable them to receive and process EAWs issued by the UK
and transmitted in electronic form, as envisaged by the clause? Can he
confirm how EAWs are currently transmitted by the UK to other
countries? What impact does he expect this provision to have in terms
of additional requests for extradition arising from alerts through the
Schengen information system II?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div><a name="09022459000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">In evidence to
the Committee, we heard that there was an expectation that there would
be a considerable increase in the number of EAWs, which would require
processing by law enforcement in this country as a consequence of the
changes envisaged by this clause and the Bill. Does the Minister agree
with that evidence and what does he expect the cost impact will be for
police forces in processing such requests? He will well appreciate the
budget pressure on police forces at the moment and he will note the
reports today of police forces having to reduce the number of police
officers as a consequence of such budgetary pressure. What cost impact
will the additional processing, required by an increase in EAWs, have
on the police forces that will have to deal with arresting people for
matters associated with them?</div>
<a name="09022459000477"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09022459000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will recall that we were told that a significant number of EAW
requests were being received from Poland. Does he envisage that these
changes will have a bigger impact on police forces that have seen an
above-average increase in population due to migration&#151;the county
of Cambridgeshire obviously springs to mind? Previous comments have
highlighted the knock-on impact on police budgets of the cost of
translations and of addressing an increase in population of workers
coming from other accession states in the EU. What assessment has he
made of the impact of those changes, particularly on those police force
areas that have already seen challenges and issues to their budgets
arising from them? Therefore, if further EAWs are anticipated, as seems
to have been suggested in evidence, what impact does he expect this to
have on police forces generally and on specific police forces that have
seen an increase in population due to migration and accessions to the
EU? It is important to understand this in terms of the impact of the
clause the Government are proposing and what preparations have been
made, are being made and will be made to ensure that any impact is
properly assessed and calculated and taken into account by police
forces.</div><a name="09022459000382"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022459000607"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): The
amendment has been correctly put by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. I
wondered why this subsection was included and looked at the explanatory
notes, which are difficult to follow unless you are an expert on the
2003 Act and extradition in general. They specify on page 38 that the
UK</div><a name="09022459000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be
required to ensure that all current alerts relating to people wanted
for arrest for extradition purposes which have been entered on to
either SIS or SIS II by other member states have been validated. These
provisions accordingly allow for the consideration and certification of
article 26 alerts and extradition alerts transmitted under SIS (article
95
alerts).&#148;</div><a name="09022459000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably,
this subsection relates to those but it would be helpful if the
Minister could explain from where the requirement stems.</div>
<a name="09022459000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
other question about this clause, which it seems appropriate to raise
now, in relation to the date included in new subsection (6)(a). There
is an amendment that could be raised at this point, but I have two. The
Bar Council says that the reference to 12 December 2006 in new
subsection (6)(a) should read 20 December 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>2006, which it describes as the date on which the Committee of Permanent
Representatives confirmed its agreement on the draft Council decision.
Justice, while giving no explanation, argues that instead of</div>
<a name="09022459000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Council
Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second
generation Schengen Information System of 12 December
2006&#148;,</div><a name="09022459000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
should say,</div>

do not feel strongly about it except in the interests of accuracy. We
have two lawyers and two different opinions and presumably the
Government lawyer has a third opinion. It would be helpful if the
Minister put on record why he believes that the date provided is
appropriate.</div><a name="09022459000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000608"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon&#146;s comment about two lawyers with two different opinions
made me laugh. That often happens, unfortunately. As always, it depends
on which one is listened to and agreed with.</div>
<a name="09022459000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
a couple of specific remarks and finish with some general points.
Starting with the section on extradition, we all accept the need for
extradition but it should be proportionate. I will say with respect to
the later amendments on this that it is done in a proportionate way
consistent with human rights legislation. We all agree with that. I was
struck by the fact that both Liberty and the Bar Council saw nothing in
the proposed new section that they regarded as a &#147;titanic
battle&#148;&#151;I think those were the words used. The debates
around extradition and the fact that we have carefully tried to put
improvements in the Bill, including clause 48, to improve how it works
rather than to make huge changes were reflected in the fact that
neither Liberty nor the Bar Council saw huge issues in this part of the
Bill. I gently remind the hon. Gentleman of that important
fact.</div>
<a name="09022459000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch asked how many additional arrests we thought
there might be as a consequence of the measure. In 2007, 504 EAW
arrests were made in the UK. As he said, Interpol or SOCA currently
alert the UK to EAWs. It is estimated that the UK receives only about
half of all EAW alerts, which is concerning. It is understood that
alerts on the Schengen information system will have increased by 250
per cent. between 2006 and 2010, which is fairly significant. The
estimated rise of 1,200 additional arrests is based on a range of data,
including an EU paper on SIS growth. Therefore, we expect a significant
increase in arrests as a result of becoming part of the SIS II. As we
have talked about on other matters, providing it is done with due
process, it should mean that we can help to catch criminals and stop
them avoiding justice by moving across
boundaries.</div><a name="09022459000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about reciprocal arrangements. Arrangements are
reciprocal and we receive and send EAW requests by
e-mail.</div>
<a name="09022459000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000609"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Proposed new subsection (2) appears to
address electronic transmission. I hope that the Minister will come to
that in a minute, but if electronic transmission is already happening,
why is proposed new subsection (2)
necessary?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div><a name="09022459000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000610"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will come to that in a little while. I will
slightly chide the hon. Gentleman on the issue of costs to the police.
We can quote today&#146;s papers but the latest figures actually show
that police numbers have gone up in some forces. They may have gone
down in others, and I cannot remember exactly what the split is, but in
approximately 20 forces the numbers went up and in approximately 20
they went down. Before anybody says that I do not know that there are
43 forces, I do, I am simply saying that it is approximately 20. If the
Opposition were to form a Government, they would delegate budgets to
local police forces that would then determine the best use of those
resources, unless they intend to dictate exactly what numbers the
forces should have. The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting political
point but, according to the latest figures, the numbers went
up.</div>
<a name="09022459000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raises a serious point about the additional burden of an
increased number of EAWs, which the Metropolitan police also mentioned
in its evidence. Frankly, it will be for local police forces to deal
with the requests that they get under the new system. They will
prioritise and deal with them in the same way that they prioritise and
deal with all kinds of requests in the course of upholding law and
order and tackling criminality in their own area. It will not be the
case that additional resources will be provided for
that.</div><a name="09022459000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman then went on to ask what can be done about the impact
that immigrants from a particular country may have on an area. He used
the example of Poland and the impact on an area. A new fund called the
migration impact fund will be available in different areas from April.
It will come from fees paid by people coming into the country and will
be delegated to regional government offices, which will be responsible
for distributing the money. In response to the hon. Member for
Peterborough (Mr. Jackson), who asked a similar question
about some of the impacts  of migration on areas, I have
suggested to the Cambridgeshire police force, for example, that the
fund will be
available.</div><a name="09022459000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fund will not be for the police only. It will also be available to
other local service providers, so that if there is an impact in an area
from a particular country or group of migrants, they can bid for funds.
As I said, there are no plans to increase police resources, but the
migration impact fund will be available should people wish to apply for
it.</div><a name="09022459000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am looking for the answer to the question about 20 December.
I am sure that it has arrived, but I cannot see it at the moment.
Perhaps someone could help me out, as it has disappeared among the
plethora of paper that I have. I will deal with the question; I have no
doubt that the paper will
appear.</div><a name="09022459000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to remove a subsection of the clause that deals with
the Schengen information system II, which allows law enforcement
agencies in the UK to certify incoming European arrest warrants that
are transmitted to the UK electronically but outside the SIS
II. The provision that the amendment would remove mirrors a provision
already contained in the Extradition Act 2003, which enables the UK to
consider and certify a large number of European arrest warrants that
are transmitted by
e-mail.</div><a name="09022459000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the UK connects to the second-generation Schengen information system,
the vast majority of European arrest warrants will be transmitted via
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>database. This refers to the points made by the hon. Members for Oxford,
West and Abingdon and for Hornchurch on subsection (2). However,
countries that are not yet part of the SIS II network may wish to
continue sending European arrest warrants by electronic means such as
e-mail, and we may wish to do the same. Until the UK joins the SIS II,
it is vital that law enforcement agencies continue to have the ability
to certify arrest warrants that are sent electronically&#151;in other
words, by this means&#151;and that includes any requests that we
receive from countries that are not part of the SIS II and also arrest
warrants that we may wish to send. Removing the power could have an
impact on our ability to deal with criminals who move across
borders.</div><a name="09022459000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
reply to the question from the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon about new subsection (6)(a), we agree that the correction
needs to be made, but parliamentary counsel has confirmed that it can
be dealt with as a printing correction, so no amendment is needed. I
thank him for pointing that
out.</div><a name="09022459000400"></a>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div><a name="09022459000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000616"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The Extradition Act 2003 provides for the judge
presiding over an extradition hearing to defer the proceedings when the
person is being prosecuted or is serving a sentence in the UK. In most
cases, that will prove to be unproblematic, but there is a loophole in
the law because if the requested person consents to extradition, the
2003 Act provides for there to be no extradition hearing or for any
such hearing to be brought to an end. That means that if an individual
has consented to extradition, it is not possible for the extradition
proceedings to be deferred until the conclusion of domestic proceedings
or until a UK sentence has been served. In practice, it could be
possible for someone to avoid justice in the UK by consenting to
extradition.</div>
<a name="09022459000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 50
and 51 address that problem by allowing the judge to defer proceedings
on an extradition request at any point from the date of arrest until
the start of the extradition hearing. Government amendments 212 to 223
make some minor changes to ensure that the provisions are fully
effective. The Committee will note that the 12 amendments
consist of six identical amendments to each of the two parts of the
2003 Act, part 1 of which deals with extradition requests from EU
territories and part 2 of which concerns requests from non-EU
territories.</div><a name="09022459000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notably,
the amendments will ensure that when the extradition court adjourns
consideration of an extradition request until a UK sentence has been
served, it does not have to deal with a remand hearing every 28 days.
That mirrors the approach in sections 23 and 89 of the 2003 Act and
avoids the court having to schedule unnecessary hearings when someone
whose extradition has been deferred is serving a lengthy custodial
sentence in the UK. The amendments will ensure that the framework in
place to deal with deferring an extradition request is robust, fair and
effective.</div><a name="09022459000412"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment</i><i class="I">

proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09022459000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000617"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I wish to raise a point on behalf of Justice
relating to how the Bill amends to the Extradition Act in relation to
the detail of a sentence that has been served. The matter is covered by
clause 50, and I believe that the point remains relevant despite the
Government&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="09022459000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s amendments to sections of the Extradition Act would
replace the current deferral period, which is until the sentence has
been served, with:</div>
<a name="09022459000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;until the
person is released from detention pursuant to the sentence (whether on
licence or
otherwise).&#148;</div><a name="09022459000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a person is released from custody on licence, their sentence has not
been served and they are subject to recall. A licence can be made
subject to any number of conditions, and where a condition is breached
the prisoner can be recalled to prison. Furthermore, the insertion of
&#147;or otherwise&#148; is worryingly vague; in that form, it
could encompass temporary release. Is the wording as drafted
appropriate, since it gives a finite period? Will the Minister comment
on that
concern?</div><a name="09022459000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a separate point, neither the current provisions nor the
Government&#146;s proposals indicate when a judge should exercise his
or her power to defer. For example, when a person is already serving a
sentence of imprisonment, one could argue that it should not be
disrupted unless that person consents or the issuing state agrees to
the person serving their sentence in the UK. It is not clear whether
the Government are giving the court an indication of what it should do
in that
respect.</div><a name="09022459000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000618"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point is a matter
for the court to determine. The provision is not prescriptive; the hon.
Gentleman has read the Bill and the clause&#146;s wording, which is
that &#147;the judge may order&#148;. It is not a case of the judge
must do this or that; there is flexibility. Let me take the judicial
side of the argument by stating that it is a matter for the judiciary,
and judicial oversight of the clause will determine what is appropriate
in the circumstances of each individual case.</div>
<a name="09022459000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
proposed new section (8A)(3) of the Extradition Act, a judge may order
further proceedings to be deferred, but he does not have to if that
does not serve the interests of justice. It is not the judge must, but
that he may do so. Rather than letting the Government determine what is
appropriate in the circumstances of every individual case at a
particular point in proceedings, the clause gives the flexibility that
I think the hon. Gentleman is looking
for.</div><a name="09022459000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, the amended
wording is necessary to ensure that it is absolutely clear that a
decision on extradition will be deferred until someone falls to be
released from detention, rather than until the end of any licensed
period. The words &#147;or otherwise&#148; cover the position where
someone falls to be released from custody, but is not released on
licence. That is necessary to cover sentences where release from
detention is unconditional. Clause 52(10) makes it plain that temporary
release, which is properly described as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>release pursuant to an intermittent custody order, is excluded from the
scope of the provisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied
with that explanation and able to support the
clause.</div><a name="09022459000425"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022459000621"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 53 deals with the treatment of time
served outside the UK following extradition to a category 1 territory
where the person was already serving a sentence of imprisonment in this
country. It provides that extradition will count as time served against
the sentence in the UK where the person was extradited for the purposes
of being prosecuted for an offence and was held in custody.</div>
<a name="09022459000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the provisions and, indeed, existing section 59 of the Extradition Act
2003, is to provide that sentences will be served, in effect,
concurrently, rather than consecutively, should some form of custody be
required in the third-party state. Through amendment 253, which is more
a probing amendment than anything else, I seek to understand better and
to question how the provision operates in relation to the
Government&#146;s early release scheme and, more generally, the
rehabilitation of offenders and release on
licence.</div><a name="09022459000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the person extradited from the UK to an overseas territory is returned
to the UK following the determination of proceedings in the overseas
territory, what assessment is made of their suitability for early
release? Obviously, the party will have been outside the jurisdiction,
and there is a question whether normal early release provisions would
apply. Equally, what information is provided to enable judgments on the
need for release, which might need to be made almost instantaneously,
to be undertaken, to enable other protective arrangements to be put in
place, and to ensure that appropriate arrangements with probation
services and so on are likely to be adhered to
properly?</div><a name="09022459000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) talks about the person&#146;s period in custody in the overseas
territory counting. Is the intention that there should be any broad
equivalence of the type of custody involved? The Minister will accept
that there may be a difference in the nature of the custody that will
be taken into account for someone being released from a category B
prison on extradition to a third party state. If we are to try to
rehabilitate to prevent reoffending, appropriate rehabilitative systems
need to be in place. If extradition is taking place part-way through a
sentence, how does that interrelate with rehabilitative programmes and
with the Government&#146;s early release
scheme?</div><a name="09022459000441"></a>

Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman seeks, through his amendments,
to make it clear that, if a person serving a sentence in the UK is

understand why hon. Members are concerned to ensure that time spent

custody facing foreign criminal proceedings or serving an overseas
sentence fell to be deducted from the UK sentence, as this would, in
