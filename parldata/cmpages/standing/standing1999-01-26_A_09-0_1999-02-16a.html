<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 16 February 1999</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Nicholas Winterton in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/007/1999007.htm">Greater London Authority Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
(Except clauses, 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)
<P>
<H5>10.30am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall first make a couple of announcements from the Chair, not least to give the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) time to sit down and gather his thoughts, because his is the first amendment that we shall debate.
<P>
As the Committee knows, the half-term arrangements will take effect from the end of business tonight. I therefore give notice that the Committee will not sit on Thursday. In addition, although the Committee could sit in the afternoon of Tuesday 9 March, members of the Committee will be aware that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will make his Budget statement on that day. It is the normal custom and tradition of the House that all Members should be in the Chamber listening to the Chancellor, and it is therefore most unlikely that this Committee will sit in the afternoon on Tuesday 9 March.
<P>
The Business sub-committee will meet to formalise that announcement and to decide, through the usual channels, how the appropriate allocation of additional time might be made so that there is no reduction of time for debate on this important Bill.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that we shall not sit on Thursday, and it is most unlikely that we shall sit in the afternoon of Tuesday 9 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Could you tell the Committee, either now or perhaps later today, when it will be convenient for the Business Sub-Committee to meet?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It will meet when it is convenient to the Chairman and to the usual channels who represent the parties that form an important part of the Committee: the Government, the Conservative and Unionist party, and the Liberal Democratic party. I shall make myself as available as possible so that we can meet to decide how to formalise the arrangements, decided by the Government regarding half-term, that I have announced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I should like to say, on behalf of the Conservative party, that we strongly protest that we will not be able to sit on Thursday. We are prepared to come in on Thursday and to continue the discussion and analysis of the Bill. To make up the time by sitting late in the evening in subsequent weeks is not the proper way to consider legislation. We are far more likely to give decent scrutiny to the Bill in normal working hours than late at night.
<P>
My second point is that on Friday, the Government tabled a substantial number of new clauses relating to the public-private partnership involving London Underground, and other matters. I first saw the new clauses on Monday. I suspect that we shall not get to them today--although we might have reached them on Thursday, had we been sitting--and that we could get to them next week. I spoke to people in the Minister's office yesterday to ask whether we could have some explanatory memorandums, and I am pleased to say that they confirmed that those would be forthcoming in support of the new clauses. However, I think it would be helpful if I gave the Minister an opportunity to confirm that on the record so that there can be no doubt about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. The Liberal Democrats are entirely happy with the logical decision that the Committee should not sit on a day when the House is not sitting.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Obviously, the decision is to all intents and purposes one for the Government, not for the Chair, but it would be possible for the Committee to sit on Thursday. Under the new arrangements, Standing Committees can sit when the House is not sitting, but my reply to the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) is that the decision does not rest with me, and I am rather glad that it does not.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Thank you for your response to the comments of the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It is encouraging to know that the Conservative party is committed to covering business during normal working hours. That means that we are unlikely to see the empty filibustering techniques that have been used on the Floor of the House, which sometimes pointlessly delay legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South spoke to people in my office about explanatory notes on the new clauses relating to public-private partnership. I am happy to put it on the record that, as he was told then, such assistance will be furnished to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Government are acting within order in tabling a large number of new amendments and new clauses. To be entirely impartial, I have to say that such a tactic--or should I say, such a move--is not unknown under successive Governments, although I appreciate the problems created for any Opposition party when so many amendments are tabled late, after many Standing Committee sittings have taken place. However, I believe that there has been adequate notice. No doubt the Government have taken on board the views expressed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
As there are no more points of order, I welcome hon. Members to this sitting of the Standing Committee. It is a very pleasant day, and I am sure that we shall make a lot of progress.
<H4><center>Clause 122</center></H4>
<H4><center>General transport duty</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I beg to move amendment No. 383, in page 64, line 21, after "implement", insert "costed".
<P>
Mr. Winterton, I am much in your debt for reminding me, when I entered the room this morning, that I had to move the first amendment. I am not absolutely confident that, had you not done so, I would have remembered that myself, and I would then have been reduced to consternation when you called me to speak.
<P>
We have reached part IV of the Bill, and I greatly look forward to the debates that we will have on it, not least those under your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton. It was by serendipity rather than by original intent that the amendment that I tabled was to the first line of part IV. I had not deliberately intended to be the person launching part IV, but it is a privilege to do so. I am mildly impressed with myself in that, by tabling an amendment to the first line, I have protected the Committee from the prospect of the Liberal Democrats tabling an even earlier one to ensure that they would launch this part of the Bill.
<P>
When I was an undergraduate long ago, I was taught by the great moral philosopher Richard Hare, who always told his pupils--he may still do so, as he is still alive--that he did his best philosophy at 10 o'clock in the morning. His pupils always wondered how he knew that, inasmuch as he was a philosopher. However, I recognise that there are good times of day for some, and good times of day for others, and that we all have biorhythms that affect our behaviour at different times of day. I mentioned that because my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South raised the matter of the substitution of debate at half-past 10 in the morning by debate at half-past 10 at night. I realise that those on the Treasury Bench are not happy about taking the Opposition's assault when we are fresh at half-past 10 in the morning--they prefer to take us on later.
<P>
I am not impressed by the thesis that we should not sit when the House is not sitting. My understanding of the modernisation proposals on which we voted last December was that the shortening of the parliamentary year would be compensated for by Select Committees and Standing Committees being able to sit when the House is not sitting, such as in the summer recess.
<P>
I reassure ministers who do not feel at their best at half-past 10 in the morning that my amendment is of exceptional simplicity. It is an easy way in to part IV and Opposition Members' spirit of generosity is such that I give Ministers an easy task.
<P>
I do not need to explain my amendment. The last time that we met, Ministers had some difficulty deciding what the intention of at least one of my amendments had been. However, on this occasion, my intention is pellucid. My purpose is in line with the policies of my party when it was the Municipal Reform party of the old London county council, which held office year after year because of the prudence with which it managed the finances of London. My amendment would improve the Bill, so that it would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor shall develop and implement costed policies".
<P>
From the beginning, account would be taken of the economic consequences of the mayor's policies.
<P>
Perhaps I should have said more to move the amendment. If so, I would have been happy to do so.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I regret that you, Mr. Winterton, alerted the right hon. Gentleman to the fact that his was the first amendment of the day because the sight of his suffering consternation would have been unique. The Committee has been deprived of a moment of high drama that we could have related to our grandchildren.
<P>
The Government welcome all opportunities to enter into debate with the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. I am nonplussed to discover that the right hon. Gentleman, who served in Government himself, believes that Governments do not start work until 10.30 in the morning. That is certainly not the case with the present Government. I am a female member of the Government, and I know that most women are expected to start the working day even earlier.
<P>
Amendment No. 383 would add "costed" to the mayor's general transport duty. If it were accepted, the Bill would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The mayor shall develop and implement costed policies".
<P>
That is an unnecessary addition. The duty set out in clause 122(1) states that the mayor must promote and encourage
<P>
"economic transport facilities and services".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mayor, GLA and Transport friend for London are bound by all the normal local authority best value provisions. Transport for London must produce a forward capital investment plan. In addition, the mayor's budget and transport strategy will receive extensive scrutiny by the assembly. The amendment is unnecessary and I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> This has been a satisfactory opening over to the fourth test match that we are playing during our debate on part IV. I am grateful to the Minister for the manner in which she responded to my bowling. In my earlier remarks, I was not suggesting that the Government only start work at 10.30 am, but that they were not keen to have a fresh Opposition attacking them at that time.
<P>
By courtesy of the Evening Standard, I am privileged to know how many dispatch boxes that the Minister for Transport in London took home for the weekend. They travelled in her ministerial car yesterday while she was caught by that newspaper photogenically standing by a bus stop, waiting for a bus so as to share the experience of Londoners. I am entirely content to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 768, in page 64, line 21, after "policies", insert "(a)".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 769, in page 64, line 23, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the minimum adverse environmental impact, and<P>
<P></ul></font>
No. 411, in clause 123, page 65, line 1, at end insert
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"including reductions in levels of road traffic".</ul></font>
<P>
No. 770, in page 64, line 25, after "services", insert
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"and the achievement of the targets".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I welcome you to the Committee again, Mr. Winterton. We look forward to serving under your chairmanship today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty (Harrow, East):</B> Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B>  The group of amendments, as I am sure the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) will be fascinated to learn, deals with the introduction of road traffic reduction targets. The Government should not find it difficult to accept the amendments because they have shown their support for the targets in many previous statements.
<P>
The amendments seek to test the water a little to establish whether the Government's commitment to the idea, and necessity, of reducing the number of vehicles travelling in London, and into London in particular, is still as strong as it was when the Labour party was in opposition and during the passage of the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Act 1998. The Act requires the Government to produce a report within 18 months of Royal Assent, setting out specific views on the targets that should be set.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That Act is appropriately linked with a private Member's Bill that was enacted by the previous Parliament and became the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997, which introduced a similar responsibility for local authorities to produce local road traffic reduction targets. Given that the Government regard the Greater London authority as part of the family of local government, we want to be clear whether the 1997 Act will also apply to the authority. It should apply, not least because of the substantial cost incurred by society, and particularly by business in the capital, as a result of the increasing levels of congestion on our roads. There are also the health consequences of the growing volume of traffic on our roads, with which we are only too familiar, such as the increase in asthma among children.
<P>
We hope that if the Government will not accept the amendments, they will show a willingness to table their own amendments so that the Bill can include an obligation to bring the Greater London authority into line with the rest of local government and require it to set road traffic targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am following with interest what the hon. Gentleman says. Will he tell us how a Liberal Democrat mayor might achieve a reduction in road traffic?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I do not know how long the Committee would like me to detain it on that subject, but I am happy to say something about the specific things that we would want to do. Undoubtedly, at the heart of my statement would be the necessary investment in public transport that we have already talked about, and to which I am sure we will return in later clauses.
<P>
The essential elements for reducing the volume of traffic and the number of vehicles on the roads are as follows. We need to have a fully integrated public transport network, as the Bill says we should. We need to see how we can increase mobility and the accessibility and availability of public transport for those living in, working in and visiting London. We need to consider measures to make public transport safer. Later amendments relate to the need to complete the London cycle network and the need for much clearer interchanges between modes of transport in London. When the mayor is drawing up his transport strategy, he will need clear and specific targets for reducing the volume of traffic.
<P>
The mayor's ideas about the level of fares will be central. When the Committee discusses fare structure, today or at another sitting, we will make further comments. Past experience and evidence shows that fare strategies in London can have a material effect on people's decisions about whether to use public transport or to stay in private cars.
<P>
For some time, the Liberal Democrats have held the view that the mayor will need to use powers provided by the Bill to enable him or her to set road congestion charges and private parking space levies. Those charges are not just ways of generating revenue streams for the GLA; they also enable a clear signal to be sent to people about the undesirability of using private cars instead of taking the opportunities presented by public transport.
<P>
We recognise, however, that investment in the public transport infrastructure must be significantly increased. Problems of capacity on existing networks are barriers to the further expansion of public transport. I hope that I have gone some way towards answering the question asked by the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
When in opposition, the Labour party clearly supported proposals for legislation to introduce the obligation of targets. The Minister and others have made statements of their continuing commitment to such legislation since the Government took office. The Secretary of State said that he would have failed if he was unable to see a reduction in the traffic on our roads within five years. We hope, therefore, that the mayor will be given such an obligation to set road traffic reduction targets, and that either our amendments or Government amendments will be agreed to accordingly.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I found it somewhat odd that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) was anxious about funding for local authority transport. The Government have been at pains to point out that overall additional funding for the Department was &#163;1.8 billion, and that &#163;700 million of that money is specifically targeted at local authority transport.
<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman feels his amendments to be necessary. Surely his concerns are addressed by clause 33(3), which the Committee considered in earlier sittings. It requires the mayor, in setting his or her transport strategy, to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national policy".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is aware that road traffic reduction is at the heart of the Government's policies for tackling problems of congestion and pollution. The Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, places requirements on local authorities that are traffic authorities to consider the issue of traffic growth and targets for traffic reduction. In due course, we will issue revised guidance for authorities on the implementation of the Act. That will include advice on the need for the London boroughs to work with Transport for London on traffic reduction in London.
<P>
Our White Paper on the future of transport made clear the need to reduce traffic growth. We want to see an absolute reduction of traffic in places where the environmental damage is worst.
<P>
In the light of my remarks and of the Bill as currently drafted, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. I am encouraged that existing legislation appears to apply to the GLA, which is a useful clarification.
<P>
I have one question, however. Are the Government now fixing their policy objective on reducing traffic growth or on a specific real reduction in the numbers of vehicles on our roads? That important issue was explored during the passage of the Bill that became the Road Traffic Reduction Act, and we should be clear on which approach the Government are adopting. They are required to issue a policy statement on the matter within 18 months of when that Act received Royal Assent. Will they base it on the rate of growth or on absolute numbers for reduction?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am somewhat bemused by the hon. Gentleman's desperation to reprise the arguments that were covered in detail on the Floor of the House. He was unable to give a direct answer to the hon. Member for Croydon, South about a Liberal Democrat mayor's policies in this area, and went through a long list with which I have no argument--of the requirements that must be part and parcel of the creation of an effective strategy to tackle the issue of traffic growth on our roads. I find it surprising that he believes that we must take an either/or approach.
<P>
We have made it abundantly clear, through our policies and our financial support of those policies, that there must be a change of direction. If there were not to be the change of policy that the Government are introducing, the unimpeded growth of traffic on our roads that is forecast would be insupportable both economically and environmentally.
<P>
Having gone down that somewhat congested byway, I ask the hon. Gentlemen to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am surprised by how often the minister is surprised during the Committee's debates. She did not answer my question. I asked specifically about whether the aim is to reduce growth or to reduce absolute numbers. The Minister continues to fail to respond to that point, and we shall have to draw our own conclusions from that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman (Chipping Barnet) :</B> I am becoming a little concerned about the hon. Gentleman's language. He is talking about an absolute reduction in the number of vehicles. Surely the issue is not the reduction, or otherwise, of the number of vehicles, but the frequency with which they use the roads. If I were to represent a car-manufacturing constituency, I should be careful to stress that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. We are talking about the frequency of trips and reducing the absolute number of trips rather than the level of car ownership. We certainly do not wish to insist that the number of cars that people own should be reduced. I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemen for ensuring that that is clarified on the record. I hope that the Minister will now answer the question.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Perhaps one of the reasons why I am continually surprised is because the hon. Gentleman never seems to listen to my responses to his questions. As he clearly did not hear the reply that I gave to his initial query, I shall repeat it yet again. We have made it clear that we need to reduce the rate of traffic growth and wish to see an absolute reduction in traffic in the places which experience the worst environmental damage from traffic.
<P>
Mr. Burstow: I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. I am sure that the Committee will return to the issue to explore further how we are to achieve the absolute reduction of which the Minister spoke. The amendment was tabled to tease out some of the issues and, having done that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 430, in page 64, line 28, after "pedestrians", insert "and cyclists".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 772, in clause 123, page 64, line 40, after "problems", insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) shall include a programme to complete the London Cycle Network."
<P>
No. 782, in schedule 9, page 166, line 37, after "luggage", insert, "bicycles".
<P>
No. 622, in schedule 9, page 166, line 44, after "vehicles", insert "or cycles".
<P>
No 623, in schedule 9, page 166, line 46, after "vehicles", insert "or cycles".
<P>
No. 624, in schedule 9, page 167, line 21, after "parks", insert "and cycle parking facilities".
<P>
No. 786, in clause 136, page 71, line 42, after services', insert--
<P>
"including interchanges between passenger transport modes and cycling"µ
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clause 122 imposes a general duty on the mayor to develop and implement transport policies. Subsection (3), which refers to transport facilities, does not cover cyclists. We in the Conservative party wish to stand up for London's cyclists. Transport facilities that cover pedestrians should also cover cyclists.
<P>
Cycle traffic is declining in the capital. It decreased by 6 per cent. between 1996 and 1997 despite the policy of cycle lanes, which was introduced by the previous Government and has been continued by the current Government. That could have something to do with the fact that anyone who rides a bike around central London must be off his head. Nevertheless, the Conservative party believes in choice. if people want to risk life and limb twice a day, that is a matter for them, not for politicians. The choice should be available.
<P>
The expression "transport facilities and services" would not usually be held to include cyclists, who, like pedestrians, are self-transporting. Specific provision is rightly made for facilities and services for pedestrians, but no mention is made of facilities and services for cyclists.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Cycling is an environmentally friendly, healthy and, in inner London, fast means of transport. One can travel on an average long journey across London at the same speed on a bicycle as one can in a motor car.
<P>
Cycling has declined in recent years and deserves to be encouraged. The provision of facilities and services for cyclists can play a part in that. It should be made clear in the context of the general transport duty that such facilities and services must be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. As you will be aware, Mr. Winterton, cycling is of intense traditional interest to the Conservative party. Our noble Friend Lord Tebbit, the erstwhile right hon. Member for Chingford, enjoined us all to get on our bikes. That phrase became a synonym for private enterprise and for the venturesome spirit that made this country great. That was true not least in London.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, the traffic in London is dangerous. Anyone who has the courage to take his life in his hands is to be admired. For that reason, it is important that proper facilities are set aside for bicyclists. Cycling is thoroughly healthy and environmentally friendly.
<P>
While we are on the subject, the erstwhile right hon. Member for Chingford is not the only one of our noble Friends to have shown an interest in cycling. The erstwhile right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, the bicycling Baronet, has now been translated to rural Hampshire. As shadow Leader of the House of Commons, however, he is no less interested in the affairs of Greater London. I am sure that he would fully support amendment No. 430, which is in the name of my hon. Friends.
<P>
My hon. Friends make a serious point. I may be making the same point somewhat flippantly, but the purpose of an integrated strategy is surely to look after all means of transportation. We should not look after only those that take us to work; nor should we support only pedestrians, who rely on their own two legs as their means of locomotion and for whom facilities and services are provided. We should also look after bicyclists.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friends and hope that Her Majesty's Government have the magnanimity to realise that the amendment is worthy. It will cost them no political capital to agree to it and I hope that they have the good grace to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We have an amendment in the present group, which would do much the same as amendment No. 430, which hon. Member for Croydon, South moved. We are anxious to ensure that the Bill places a specific obligation on the mayor to complete the London cycle network. Substantial sums of public money have already been invested in putting the network into place. We want a guarantee that, regardless of the views of the individual candidates in this respect, public money that has already been allocated to and spent on establishing the London cycle network that the network will not be wasted and that the network will be completed. In that way, the cycle network will form part of the strategic transport network in Greater London.
<P>
In a previous life, I was a member of the environment committee of the London Boroughs Association. In that role, I paid several visits to transport Ministers to lobby for funding for the Greater London cycle network. After several years, I was pleased that we finally managed to get the then Conservative Government to accept that they should have a continuing funding commitment to secure its delivery and completion. I hope that through the Bill, the Government will ensure that the network, which has long been on the stocks and is now being implemented by individual boroughs, is completed so that the money that has already been expended has not been wasted.
<P>
The second amendment--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that mobile telephone pagers and other devices that are electronically controlled are switched off when in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I was about to say that the second of our amendments in the group is about being able to take a bicycle on to a train. The amendment would remove any ambiguity as to whether Transport for London could deny people the right to take a bicycle on to one of its modes of transport. We hope that the Government will tell us whether they are minded to accept our proposal. It would send an important signal to cyclists that they are welcome. We would be saying that they make an important contribution by using their bikes, and that we want more people to do so. I hope that the Government will accept our proposals or, if not, that they will come up with a form of wording that they find more acceptable but which achieves the same end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is not for me or for any member of the Committee to advise you on your role, Mr. Winterton, but Parliament always gains from traditional ceremonies. If you devised a ceremony in which we all went down to the Terrace and mobile phones were cast into the river, I am certain that a number of members of the Committee would follow you in leading us there.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What, into the river? [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was not suggesting that you were going into the river, Mr. Winterton. I had never thought of you as the Pied Piper of Hamelin.
<P>
I draw attention--and I emphasise that I do so in kindly tone, so there is no need for the Covernment Whip to become agitated--to the temporary absence from the Committee of the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick). I apologise for the solecism of not having warned the hon. Gentleman in advance that I was going to say this, but as he is absent, and I had expected him to be present, there was no way in which I could have warned him.
<P>
I had expected the hon. Gentleman to be present, because when cycling interests communicated with other members of the Committee about the importance of cycling in terms of part IV of the Bill, they drew attention to the fact that the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town was signed up to their propositions. I can only assume that the hon. Gentleman's absence is a diplomatic one--he knows that the Government are about to resist the amendments and it is therefore easier for him to be out of the Room than in it.
<P>
I remind the Committee of Winston Churchill's life of his great ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough. I must tell the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town, who has now come back into the Room, and in case he does not already know, that I made a passing reference to his absence from the Committee. I shall continue with my quotation from Winston Churchill's life of the Duke of Marlborough. The duke said of the Hargrave of Baden, who was one of his allies, that his military epitaph for all time must be that the two greatest captains of his age thought his absence from a crucial battle field well worth 15,000 men. Whether the Government Whip was playing the role of the Duke of Marlborough, or Prince Eugen of Savoy, it is clear that he played some part in the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town being away from the Committee when we embarked on these amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> As always, I have learnt from the right hon. Gentleman about other people from the pages of history whom I had never heard of before. I am reminded that there are many things that are slightly more rewarding than sitting on Committees such as this.
<P>
I draw no conclusion from the fact that none of the three protagonists who so far has contributed to the debate has yet said that they cycle. I do, at least every week, and often several times a week. [Hon. Members: "In your own taxi?"] No, I cycle in and around my constituency. Not only do I speak from the experience of having survived that for many years in London, the headquarters of the London Cycling Campaign happens to be in my constituency.
<P>
I support the tenor and the detail of the amendments and I hope that the Government will be positive about them. It would be sad if we referred in clause 122(3) to pedestrians but not to cyclists. That would send absolutely the wrong message.
<P>
What should result from the implementation of a cycling policy? Certainly an integrated cycle network that does not stop in the middle of nowhere, as it often currently does. Indeed, it often stops not only in the middle of nowhere but in the middle of a road in the middle of nowhere, so that people suddenly have no idea where the cycle route is meant to go.
<P>
We should also have at places of work, railway stations and elsewhere places where people can put bicycles safely--places where not only can they be locked and stored but where they are unlikely to have parts removed. One problem at railway stations at present is that if people do not want to take their bike with them, they can chain it there, but often it is not supervised, so when they return a wheel may have gone. It is not terribly convenient to walk around carrying a couple of wheels, let alone a saddle and all of the other bits and pieces, so there should be safe accommodation for bicycles at transport interchanges.
<P>
I do not know how many hon. Members have done this, but in theory it is wonderful to take your bicycle on the train. Not long ago, I took my bicycle on the train from London Bridge to Orpington. The first problem is that one cannot be sure where on the platform the carriage that will take bicycles will stop. Given that most trains are designed so as to have the carriages in the same order, it should be possible for platforms to indicate where the carriage to accommodate cycles is just as they indicate where the first-class carriages are.
<P>
Secondly, it does not help if when one gets to the carriage it is locked. One then has 30 seconds before the train pulls off, and one cannot get in--the guard or attendant is nowhere near. Thirdly, if one is lucky enough to get the bicycle in and locked up, relatively safely, when one goes to get off at Bromley, Orpington or somewhere beyond, one may discover that the carriage is no longer open to get the bicycle out. If one is not careful, one ends up in Chislehurst, deep in Kent, in Dover or, goodness knows, even further beyond. One has gone on a journey that one did not intend and for which one may receive a penalty fare. Such practical considerations militate against trying to be sensible and cycling.
<P>
I do not know, but I believe that it is currently impossible to store even fold-up bicycles in Green Line coaches or long-distance fast coaches into and out of London. If there were storage space for fold-up bicycles, many people might be willing to come in on the coach--from Oxford, for example, which costs only six quid for a single journey--and use the bicycle once they arrived at their destination.
<P>
Let us be honest, one of the disadvantages of cycling to work is that one arrives more smelly than one would had one gone by a more delicate mode of transport--
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> Like jogging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Like jogging, as the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) says. I must say that I have not yet seen the hon. Gentleman jogging to work, but no doubt he does whenever I am not looking. I must say that sometimes the sight of people jogging anywhere is not very becoming--that does not include only hon. Members.
<P>
If we are to encourage people to cycle, businesses must have facilities to make that easier--for example, showers and easily available changing facilities that people do not have to pay for.
<P>
The Local authority of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam was a pioneer--in fact, the pioneer, I believe--of giving members of staff a financial incentive if they came to work by bicycle, whereas many local authorities and others gave an allowance to employees who came to work by car. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that an employee of Sutton council receives a bicycle allowance and not a motorised vehicle allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): That is the position in Lewisham.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that his authority does the same. That is another way of providing for an integrated transport structure, in answer to the question about how we can change the balance of transport on the roads.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Sutton introduced such a scheme some years ago, but what limited it, unfortunately, was the fact that the allowance was regarded as a benefit in kind. Consequently, the positive signal that the council was trying to send to encourage cycling was undermined. Perhaps the Government will turn their attention to that issue at some point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I hope that we will receive a positive response from the Government; I have no reason to think that we will not. We must flag up cycling's place on the list of items for which integrated transport would be organised--no matter whether it be with coaches, even buses, boats and river transport, railway trains and perhaps even tube trains on the new lines. I have not thought through the latter possibility, but I know that the Jubilee line extension has disabled access throughout so, in theory, it should be possible to take a bicycle on it. I should have checked whether the authorities intend that to happen.
<P>
I hope that we are really positive. Many more people cycling, as in many other European countries, would not only be very good for them in terms of fitness, but a sufficient number doing so would encourage a cycling culture and change some people's perception of cycling as quite dangerous. Moreover, giving space to cyclists on inside lanes, at traffic lights and so on would improve the general arrangement of transport in London to everyone's advantage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. It comes as no surprise that he is a keen supporter of the cycling fraternity. Does he support the Government's proposals to fine cyclists who ride along pavements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have a tough view about that. Cycling on pavements is extremely antisocial and dangerous. In the interests of pedestrians, I have pursued the issue strongly with my local police force in Walworth. Elderly pedestrians in particular are often put at risk. The cyclists, defence, although it is not a proper defence, shows how all these issues tie together. They tell me that the roadway nearest to the pavement--including bus lanes--is often blocked by illegally parked vehicles, meaning that they do not have safe access and are forever having to pull in and out.
<P>
Walworth road has had those problems. People parked where they should not, cyclists sometimes cycled on the pavement and pedestrians were thoroughly aggrieved. However, to conclude on a positive note, when the police pay attention and make that issue a priority they can make a big difference, although resources are needed to nick people and fine them. I am absolutely in favour of that. We must also be tough in teaching young people that it is unacceptable to ride on pavements.
<P>
The slightly more complicated issue of skateboarding causes the same problems. I have seen many people inconvenienced--some have fallen over--as a result of people skateboarding helter skelter down slopes and crossroads and jumping off pavements. We need to try to manage that. What I did not know until I was in Paris a couple of weeks ago is that they accommodate skateboarders by closing many of the roads in Paris every Friday evening. There is a family skateboarding event from about 8 pm to midnight, which ends up in McDonalds or somewhere similar and is managed by the police.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are not going to have a debate on skateboarding. It is not part of the amendment and the hon. Gentleman is on very thin ice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>As you will certainly know, Mr. Winterton, skateboarding is never done on ice. It is certainly a form of transport which ought to be integrated. That links it with cycling, which is where we came in. I hope that the Minister will be positive and ensure that cycling is in the top rank of targets for integration into London transport.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am delighted that the Government's policy and philosophy on improving facilities for cyclists and on underlining the fact that cycling is a valid form of transport as well as a healthy occupation have taken such a firm and flourishing root among Opposition Members. They clearly endorse the approach that we have taken since we came into office. All local authorities are now required to prioritise the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport in the plans that they submit for Government financing.
<P>
The amendments deal mainly with the specific London cycle network. They clearly show that Opposition Members misunderstand the meaning of transport facilities. Amendment No. 430 seeks to ensure that the clause refers to cycling. I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary because the wording of the clause already subsumes facilities and services for cyclists. That is not the case for pedestrians, which is why they are specifically and explicitly mentioned in subsection (3) The Government do not perceive pedestrians' needs to be greater than those of cyclists, and do not assume any automatic prioritisation. The clause does not include the word "cyclists" because I am advised that the phrase "transport facilities and services" legally includes cyclists.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's point, but I do not understand why that phrase does not include pedestrians. Her civil servants may be skating on thin ice by telling her that it does not include pedestrians. Will she seek further advice after the debate, because it seems to me that the same argument applies logically to both pedestrians and cyclists?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am prepared to satisfy the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and I shall do as he asks. It would be extremely difficult, however, to define a pedestrian as a transport facility. I cannot see how anybody would argue that piggy-back carrying is an economic and efficient environmentally friendly means of moving ourselves and our goods around the city. A bicycle is, however, an ideal form of transport for those purposes and others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was a very clever way of protecting a potentially weak position. The Minister's example was of course correct, but I direct her to the Bill. Clause 122(1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London."
<P></ul></font>
Subsection (3) states that those facilities and services
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"include facilities and services for pedestrians".</ul></font>
<P>
The grammar and syntax of that definition work for all people who are pedestrians, cyclists and motorists. My point is valid in terms of the verbs used and the types of traveller.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall honour the undertaking that I gave to the hon. Gentleman. I revert, however, to my previous interpretation of the meaning of a transport facility. It would be extremely difficult to define Shanks's pony as such a facility. I have, however, given the hon. Gentleman an assurance, and I shall keep my word.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I want to confirm exactly what the Minister is undertaking to do for the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). Is she undertaking to give a definition of transport facilities, and to ensure that we will find out how such facilities cover cyclists? I should like her to give such an undertaking.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My understanding of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is that he was not clear about why transport facilities include cyclists to the point that pedestrians are excluded and have to be specifically named in the Bill. I do not have the relevant legal expertise to give more of an assurance than I have. I can only repeat the advice that I have been given that cyclists are defined in legal terms as a transport facility and a transport service. They are, therefore, covered by the relevant phrase in the Bill. As that explanation did not calm the fears of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I have given him my assurance that I will double-check.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am reassured by the Minister's commitment to double-check. She mentioned Shanks's pony and I immediately began to think about the rag and bone fraternity--Steptoe and Son and their ilk--which provides such an important service for Londoners. The fraternity's interests must be protected too and I hope that they will be under the Bill--notwithstanding the fact that cyclists will not be protected. In generic terms, is it correct that horses and carts count as transportation?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comments reveal a sheer desperation for votes given that the father and son to whom he referred have been pushing up the daisies for a considerable period. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are covered by clause 122(3)(b), which refers to facilities that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"required for the transportation of freight."</ul></font>
<P>
Given the hon. Gentleman's analogy, a horse and cart would be covered and his anxieties are groundless.
<P>
The concern behind amendment No. 727 is to ensure the completion of the London cycle network; indeed, it would give completion a unique position in the mayor's strategy. I am sure that hon. Members are aware that the Government have shown their commitment to the London cycle network. We made an additional &#163;l million available in the previous financial year. The total sum available for 1998-99 stands at &#163;5 million. An additional &#163;500,000 will be allocated in 1999-2000, which will bring the total to &#163;5.5 million. That will be part of a &#163;45 million programme that will eventually produce a
comprehensive London cycle network of nearly 2,900km.
<P>
As hon. Members will know, the development and implementation of the London cycle network is the responsibility of the boroughs, and the borough of Kingston is taking the lead. The Bill should not place requirements regarding the London cycle network on the mayor. Given national policy on prioritising the needs of pedestrians and cyclists, the strategies of the mayor and the boroughs will ensure that those needs are at the heart of their plans. I am sure that hon. Members agree that it must be for the mayor, in constructing and defining a transport strategy, to make such decisions. If we define everything in the finest detail in the Bill, we will limit the innovation, imagination and energy that the mayor will no doubt bring to the issuese before us.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am sure that whoever turns out to be the mayor will exhibit all those qualities. Is the Minister suggesting that, if a mayoral candidate is elected on a platform of not completing the network, the Secretary of State will not exercise the considerable powers that the Bill provides to direct that it should be completed, because substantial sums of public money have been invested? As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, it would be absolutely crazy for bits of the network to end in the middle of nowhere. Londoners would see that as a complete waste of public money.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It was precisely because the Government did not want to see bits of the London cycle network ending in the middle of nowhere that, having taken advice about the priorities of the London cycling clubs and the boroughs, the additional funding to which I referred was targeted specifically at roundabouts and junctions with trunk roads. it would be absurd to suggest that a mayor would discard the potential for the 545 546 <P>
completion of the London cycle network, which will be beneficial in terms of improving the city's transport and environment. The requirement should not be included in the Bill. If it were to be included, why would the mayor prioritise the London cycle network over the bus priority network? The hon. Gentleman is probably desperate to leap to his feet and say, "Can't we have that on the face of the Bill either?" However, the inclusion of such detailed requirements would run counter to our proposals for the mayor and the strategic transport authority.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey related, in some detail, the failure of public transport providers adequately to understand the needs of cyclists. The Government are keen to see a range of improvements in that respect. I was interested by his point about the inadequacy of facilities for storing cycles safely and for enabling cyclists to present themselves in their workplaces smelling as sweet as a rose. I am encouraged by the example that is being set by many employers around the country who are strongly engaged in green transport plans. One of their primary concerns is to ensure that adequate facilities are provided for cyclists. I am happy to say that my Department, among others, also ensures the provision of those facilities.
<P>
I point out to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the amendments would require Transport for London to have regard to the carrying of cycles as well as luggage and other goods. Amendment No. 624 would give Transport for London the power to provide cycle parking facilities at stations and other places. Amendment No. 786 would impose a duty on Transport for London and the franchising director to co-operate over the co-ordination of interchanges between transport modes and cycling. However, schedule 9(2) of the Bill already gives TFL powers with regard to the carrying of cycles under its general powers of carriage. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the schedule cover the provision of incidental amenities and facilities such as cycle parking. Amendments Nos. 782 and 624 are therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 622 and 623 are based on the principle of enabling TFL to enter into agreement with persons offering cycles for hire, and amendment No. 786 is intended to facilitate better integration between cycling and other transport modes. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would allow the Committee to return to those two points at a later stage in its deliberations.
<P>
I trust that in the light of my remarks the hon. Member for Croydon, South, will see fit to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is remarkable that the simple insertion of the word "cyclists" into the clause has led to such an interesting debate. We have learned that the Duke of Marlborough's absence from the battlefield was worth 15,000 men.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It was the Margrave of Baden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I stand corrected. The amusing aspect was that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster told the story 30 seconds after the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) had left the Committee.
<P>
We have also discovered that the constituency of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is so flat that he is able to cycle around it. Speaking as someone who has six hills, all very steep, in his constituency, I can assure him that there are no cycle tracks there at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> A fact of nearly equal importance to that provided by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster is that the highest road in my constituency is the Bricklayers Arms flyover, which does not win many prizes for height.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps we should all adjourn to the upstairs bar of the Bricklayers Arms to ascertain the situation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) brought up the question of equestrian facilities. It may be a little known fact that there is a hunt within the boundaries of the Greater London area--the Old Surrey and Burstow, which still hunts over Bromley and Orpington way, and has been known to enter Croydon. It is still actively pursuing a free sport in a way for which the law provides--and, I hope, will continue to provide.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate about precisely what is meant by the expression "transport facilities". I accept the assurance of the Minister for Transport in London that it includes cyclists. She has undertaken to consider the matter, and I hope that she will confirm that if there is a scintilla of doubt left, we will revisit it on Report--although she appears confident that that will not be necessary. Will she be so good as to give us a similar undertaking for equestrian activity?
<P>
I may be wrong, but I believe that there is a duty on Surrey county council to consult equestrian organisations before implementing any transport changes in Surrey. Given the level of equestrian activity within the Greater London area, that is important--I do not seek to make a party-political point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Yes, I shall certainly consider the hon. Gentleman's point. I, too, have no desire to make a party-political point, but I am sure that he would not expect me to ensure that the ability to hunt within central London was a responsibility of Transport for London, opposed as I am--and have always been--to the hunting of wild animals by supposed adults on horses. However, I will certainly examine the point that he has raised, because I can conceive of a requirement to cover what I would call supportable equestrian activities. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I remind the Minister that she has a duty to everybody who engages in lawful activities, even if she disapproves of those activities. None the less, I accept the spirit in which she gave her undertaking, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The amendment is about cycling and, bearing in mind that we are keen to make progress, I hope that there will be no back-pedalling.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 431, in page 64, line 29, after "in", insert "or travelling through".
<P>
Very briefly, the mayor will be obliged to consider the transport requirements of those who live within London; we appear to have missed out those who travel through London. Given that London is an important transit hub for people travelling in this country, I would be grateful for the Minister's reassurance that that will be covered in the mayor's responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The mayor's transport duty is intentionally wide-ranging. It extends the mayor's influence--which is particularly important--to all forms of transport, including those outside his or her direct control. The duty encompasses the needs of pedestrians, the movement of goods and the needs of users of London's transport who live outside the capital. The amendments are therefore unnecessary. The duty already covers journeys within Greater London and the needs of people visiting Greater London. That subsumes journeys across and persons travelling through Greater London. We want all those who travel in London to know who is responsible for their journey. The duty achieves that by placing the responsibility firmly on the mayor. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw this unnecessary amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The amendment is more important than it might at first appear. I remind the Committee of an interesting exchange that took place some 15 years ago about helicopter services from Heathrow airport--which most certainly is in London--to Gatwick. The late Nicholas Ridley, whom we much lament, insisted that there was no need for such a service because the M25 would always cope, and the journey could be done in something like three quarters of an hour.
<P>
There can be a need to interline from one airport to another. Gatwick is outside London, but Heathrow is not. I presume that surface transport facilities are within the remit of the mayor. The Minister said in her reply to the interesting and important amendment tabled by hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South that the mayor had responsibility for all transport. Air transport is, ipso facto, outside his remit, I presume, even though there are flights in and out of City airport, Heathrow airport and Royal Air Force Northolt in my constituency, to some degree. Can the Minister give an assurance that the mayor's duty will encompass the provision of good transport services from one airport to another across London, but would not impinge on civil air transport which I presume remains the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is entirely correct in the last part of his contribution. However, the mayor most definitely does have duties with regard to the environment of London. The movement of aircraft and the development of airports is a vital part of considering how the environment of the city is improved.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right that there are no specific powers with regard to airports--certainly the designated airports of Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick--but there will still be a requirement for the mayor to be consulted about any environmental impact.
<P>
The mayor will also have a key responsibility for the development of a spatial development strategy. I know of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed in another forum about the airport in his constituency and the genuine concerns that his constituents have expressed to me about what they perceive as the airport's improper expansion.
<P>
The mayor's spatial development strategy will provide a context for the London boroughs' unitary development plans. They will have to consult the mayor on these, and will have to conform with the mayor's spatial development strategy. Although the boroughs will retain responsibility for planning applications, they will have to conform with the mayor's spatial development strategy. The mayor can direct a refusal of planning application if it is believed that it would raise issues of overall interest for London and would affect the strategic policy. That will be defined within a statutory instrument.
<P>
I hope that what I have said has reassured the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Croydon, South, and that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> In the previous debate, we focused on the definition of transport facilities. When debating this clause, we really do need to pay attention to definitions.
<P>
In reply to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, the Minister said that the word "visiting" subsumed people who were travelling through London. Could the hon. Lady be a little clearer, and give us the legal background? Someone who arrives at a channel tunnel link terminal at Waterloo, or at Kings Cross in the future, comes off one train, goes on to another platform and then catches a train straight out of London cannot be counted as visiting London. That counts as transit, and a transitory visit to London is not the same as visiting London--it is just passing through. I am not convinced by the Minister's comments that the provision covers that type of traveller.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am somewhat confused about the hon. Gentleman's precise definition of "passing through". Does he conceive of passing through 6ft above the ground? Somebody comes in to Waterloo and receives the information that is disseminated--I have little doubt that it will be part of the mayoral strategy to ensure that there is good, easily understandable and accessible information highlighting the various methods of transport by which visitors might reach their desired destinations. The hon. Gentleman, however, has given us the scenario that millions of people use every year as part of their daily ingress to and exit from London. I am not clear where he feels that facilities have not been provided, because he has not been clear as to how he would define "passing through".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am persuaded by the Minister's point of view and I accept her assurances. It is easier to define cyclists and horses as an equestrian activity than to explain the deep significance of visiting as opposed to transiting somewhere. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 425, in page 64, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) In discharging his duty under subsection (1) above, the Mayor shall give priority to consideration of safety.".

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In discharging his duty under clause 122 the mayor must consider several things. We have tabled these probing amendments to ascertain whether the Minister thinks that the mayor should consider issues of safety, integration, efficiency and economy. All those matters are important, and one would expect the mayor to take them into account. I hope that the Minister will assure me that they are already mentioned elsewhere in the Bill. We want to probe the context in which they are set in the mayor's discharge of his duty.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The whole purpose of what I am reliably informed is the accepted definition of fanfare duty in clause 122 is to set the statutory context for the mayor's transport role. One of the major aims of the Bill is to end the current fragmentation of responsibility for London's transport. The clause achieves that aim by giving the mayor a broad duty to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport to, from and within London, thus putting the responsibility clearly and firmly on him or her.
<P>
The duty is intentionally wide ranging. It extends the mayor's influence to all forms of transport, including those outside his or her direct control. It encompasses the needs of pedestrians, the movement of goods and the needs of users of London's transport who live outside the capital. The duty also falls under the overarching duty of the authority as set out in clause 25, and will therefore be informed by the mayor's need to promote economic and social development in Greater London.
<P>
The proposed arrangements will be a great improvement on the current situation. The mayor will provide the vision and leadership needed to get to grips with the capital's transport problems and he or she will have a strong mandate from Londoners. The mayor's influence over all forms of transport will allow him or her to develop truly integrated solutions and responses to these problems.
<P>
I am not, therefore, persuaded of the necessity of making pre-eminent any one element of the fanfare duty, as amendments Nos. 425 to 428 would do. I do not believe that that is the hon. Gentleman's aim, either. In the light of what I have said, I trust that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I am a member of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee. When we heard evidence on the Government's integrated transport White Paper, it was mentioned several times that an aspect that was missing--which was felt to be a serious omission--was due reference to road safety. Although this may not be an appropriate place to mention that matter, it is an important aspect of any integrated transport policy that due attention is paid to safety, and in particular to road safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) has reminded me of the recent publication resulting from an inquiry into rail safety carried out by the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee, on which he sits. That inquiry has recently been the subject of an Adjournment debate.
<P>
In the context of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, I should like to raise the question of prioritising safety. I accept the Minister's point that, within the set of general duties or powers, it is not appropriate to pick out individual matters and set them above the rest. However, it is essential that the mayor should attach great importance to issues of safety, both the safety of transport facilities and the safety of people travelling on them.
<P>
I hope that, through the provisions of the clause, the mayor will be able to take an interest in the safety of those facilities. The safety of the older rolling stock, including the mark 1 rolling stock, on our railway lines across London has been a cause for concern for some years. Mark 1 rolling stock was the subject of a major inquiry following the Clapham rail disaster. The inquiry concluded that serious and urgent research was needed into ways in which those rather dubious carriages could be made safer.
<P>
I look forward to receiving additional information from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to explain why the Health and Safety Executive appeared to drop the ball, over the 10 years in which it was promoting the upgrading and replacement of those old carriages. I hope that a high profile mayor would make it one of his or her priorities to ask the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising what it will do to ensure that such ancient rolling stock is replaced in current and subsequent franchising rounds.
<P>
The second issue relates to passengers. Many of my constituents are increasingly concerned--as, I am sure, are hon. Members--about the safety of people travelling on trains. Staff reductions have been necessitated partly by the privatisation of the railway network and partly by the continuing pressure faced by the operators of rail franchises--although I accept that they entered into the franchises freely. However, those staff reductions may result in passengers' safety being put at risk as fewer staff are available to monitor and assure safety on stations and trains.
<P>
I hope that the mayor will be able to raise such issues when exercising his power to advise the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising. I support amendment No. 425, moved by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, because it raises important issues that need to be 551 552 
<P>
considered by the mayor. They should certainly be the subject of manifestos if not of detailed words on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall respond to points made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge about road safety and by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who took the discussion into a wider area of transport infrastructure.
<P>
The first word in the description of the transport facilities that the mayor is required to encourage is "safe". Furthermore, I repeat that the mayoral strategy may not be outwith the national integrated transport strategy, and road safety is central to our national strategy. We have announced an inquiry into the issue of speed, both in urban and rural environments. We have also announced our intention to introduce targets for the reduction of accidents and deaths on our roads. The mayor will clearly have to be part and parcel of that national strategy.
<P>
I sent a letter to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, responding to the detailed queries that he put to me in an Adjournment debate. I suppose that he has received it but, given the vagaries of the post, perhaps it has been forwarded elsewhere.
<P>
However, in the light of what the hon. Gentleman knows are the requirements of the HSE, I found some of his remarks on the safety of rolling stock unnecessarily alarmist. He knows perfectly well that the HSE has already given a report to the Government regarding that rolling stock, and that the second test that the HSE is engaged in will not take place until 17 February. He is aware that it is the HSE that decides what rolling stock appears on our railways, and that the HSE validates any safety case. The mayor will clearly have a major part to play in improving surface rail services. I repeat yet again that "safe" is the first word in the description of the transport facilities that the mayor is required to encourage.
<P>
I thought it was unnecessary scaremongering by the hon. Gentleman for him to raise the issue of people being afraid to travel on our railways, which are by far the safest form of transport. I know that he is attempting to make a point about people travelling on trains that they perceive to be empty, or waiting on stations that appear to be deserted. I am sure that he is aware that the train operating companies have entered the secure stations scheme, whereby individual stations are dealing with the central underlying issue--the problem is not so much the actual experience of crime when travelling on our railways but the equally potent perception and fear of crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I take the Minister's point about the balance between being alarmist and raising legitimate concerns. I accept that, all too often, it is the fear of crime rather than its actuality that is the obstacle. However, I hope that the Minister accepts that the Committee is an appropriate place to raise those issues, and that it was appropriate for me to ask the question--a question to which she gave a generous and helpful response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it had not been an appropriate place, I would have intervened.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton. Whether the question was appropriate was, as you rightly say, a decision for the Chair. The hon. Gentleman was attempting a somewhat disingenuous approach to issues about which he knows a great deal, and that was what I was criticising.
<P>
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that the amendment should be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the Liberal Democrats were so concerned about safety, they might have tabled an amendment. Nevertheless, the Conservative party is always pleased to have their support for its proposals. When the railways were privatised in the previous Parliament, safety played an equally important part in the regime and the regulatory structure. I did not see much support from the Liberal Democrats for that at the time. However, their belated conversion is welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain briefly why, in the passage of the rail privatisation legislation during the early 1990s, the HSE dropped the ball as to the upgrading and safety of mark 1 rolling stock, as it admitted in recent evidence to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> How many accidents have been caused by the mark 1 rolling stock? There is no answer. The hon. Gentleman is being unduly alarmist. The previous Government were as concerned about safety as are the present Government, to whom we give our support in their safety objectives.
<P>
The Minister has addressed the issue in the way that I wanted, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 429, in page 64, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) Any resident of Greater London may bring an action under this subsection, to recover such damages as are proved to have been incurred, against the Mayor and the Authority as jointly and severally liable for any breach of the duty in this section where as the result of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event or events such breach is shown to have taken place.
<P>
(5) It shall be a defence to an action brought under subsection (4) above for either or both the Mayor and the Authority to show that the breach occurred or was increased by a direction issued by the Secretary of State under section 124 below, and in such a case an action may be brought under this subsection against the Secretary of State by any resident of Greater London to recover such damages as are proved to have been incurred.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 122 imposes a duty on the mayor, and duties bring obligations. A mayor cannot have a duty in a vacuum--duties must be enforced. They can, of course, be enforced by judicial review, but the purpose of the amendment is to give the citizens of London the right to sue the mayor for breach of his statutory duty under the 553 554 <P>
clause. I would be grateful if the Minister could address the point. If the amendment is unnecessary, will she tell me how individual citizens can get redress for any breach of the mayor's duty?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction has already dealt with what could be described as the "legal profession (financial benefits) clause". The amendment would mean that a commuter who was late for work--we have had many such instances brought to our attention lately--could sue the mayor for losing his or her job. The mayor and Transport for London will enjoy no special immunity from legal liabilities. However, it would be impractical for such a breach of a fanfare duty to be actionable for damages in civil law. The mayor would never be out of the courts. Who then would create the transport strategy, or encourage economic development?
<P>
Residents of Greater London will have many more appropriate avenues if they wish to bring the mayor to account because they do not approve of how he discharges his statutory duty. The foremost is the ability to vote the mayor out. They will be able to vote for an assembly that will have extensive powers to scrutinise the mayor. The assembly will also appoint the London transport users committee, which will be a voice for passengers. That Committee will hear representations from individual travellers and it will be able to make recommendations on any transport function of the GLA and Transport for London. The mayor and Transport for London are open to judicial review and will be liable for negligence regarding their more specific duties such as safety. In the light of that, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am sure that she does not mean to do so, but the Minister almost contradicts herself by saying both that it is ridiculous to have an amendment that would allow someone to sue the mayor and that there are many ways in which the mayor could be sued.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I did not actually say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that she did not say that, so I withdraw the comment.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I said that there were many other more productive avenues by which an individual Londoner might bring the mayor to account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister said that the amendment provided an avenue by which the mayor might be brought to account; it seems inconsistent to oppose it simply because there are others. The matter is still not clear to me. How can an individual who feels aggrieved by a decision of the mayor bring about an action? Judicial review, as I understand it, allows a review of a decision made by the mayor to implement a policy. How could an individual seek redress if the mayor was incompetent or negligent in the performance of his duty?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have already said that the amendment would mean that, because of the fanfare duty of the mayor, he or she could be in court permanently for matters as slight as an individual believing that their lateness for work was the direct and exclusive responsibility of the mayor. That is where the absurdity of the amendment rests.
<P>
I have said that the roles of the mayor and TfL are open to judicial review. Of course, they will be liable for negligence resulting from their actions, but there would have to be proof of negligence. For the reasons that I have already given, the fanfare duty is broad. The amendment would mean that the slightest inconvenience felt--as opposed to experienced--by an individual travelling in, through and around London could cause him or her to sue the mayor in a civil court. In the light of my remarks, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister places a rather exaggerated interpretation on the implications of the amendment. An individual would have the right to sue for breach of duty. There would be no point in starting work-related litigation, willy-nilly, and arguing that there had been a breach of duty, unless there was a clear likelihood that the litigation would be successful.
<P>
The Minister said that the mayor would never be out of court, but she will be well aware that Departments are constantly sued under judicial review arrangements. That does not mean that Secretaries of State or indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, are constantly in court; they are merely the titular persons involved.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> What about the late Nicholas Ridley?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister for London and Construction conveniently makes my point. He implied that the late Nicholas Ridley, who we all miss very much, was constantly in court. He was never there in person, but the representatives of the holder of the office were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone (Brent, East):</B> What worries me is that there is now a tendency to extend the remit for intervention of the courts. Recently, I was struck by the comments of a cab driver. He thought that if a cab driver developed cancer, there were probably grounds to sue the police because they had not allowed cab drivers to ban smoking in their cabs. The amendment would be tailor-made for someone to take the mayor to court if she or he had not banned smoking in cabs and someone had contracted cancer as a result. The Opposition may think that the amendment is narrowly drawn, but the courts are widening their remit all the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have always thought that the main trouble with this country is that the people who would be best equipped to run it are too busy driving taxis and cutting hair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> That is very kind of the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Few of us would argue with the wisdom of a London cabby. Nevertheless, the amendment sought to make an important point. I am not wholly persuaded by the Minister's arguments, but I do not wish to divide the Committee on the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 24--
Transport functions of the Mayor--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) the Mayor--
<P>
(a) shall keep under review the matters which may be expected to affect the transport facilities and services mentioned in section 122(1) above; and
<P>
(b) may, if he thinks fit, at any time institute a fresh survey of Greater London examining those matters.
<P>
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the matters to be kept under review and examined under that subsection shall include--
<P>
(a) the principal physical and economic characteristics of Greater London and, so far as they may be expected to affect that area, of any neighbouring areas;
<P>
(b) the size, composition and distribution of the population of Greater London (whether resident or otherwise);
<P>
(c) without prejudice to paragraph (a), the communications, transport system and traffic of that area, of any neighbouring areas;
<P>
(d) any considerations not mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) which may be expected to affect any matters so mentioned;
<P>
(e) such other matters as may be prescribed or as the Secretary of State may in a particular case direct;
<P>
(f) any changes already projected in any of the matters mentioned in any of the previous paragraphs and the effect which those changes are likely to have on the transport strategy.
<P>
(3) A survey under subsection 1(b) may relate to only part of Greater London; and references in subsection (2) to Greater London or any neighbouring areas shall be construed accordingly.
<P>
(4) The Mayor shall, for the purpose of discharging his function under this section of examining and keeping under review any matters relating to another local authority, shall consult that other authority about those matters.".
<P>
We have talked at some length about cyclists, safety, equestrian facilities, air transport and rail transport and so I hope that the debate will be succinct. As the new clause, which deals with the general transport functions of the mayor, was tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, I call him to open the clause stand part debate.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The purpose of the new clause is to set out those matters that the mayor should keep under review in performing his duties. Its source is section 30 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The existing legislation applies where more than one authority covers an area with respect to the same function and where the superior authority has a strategic role while the subsidiary authority has an implementational role.
<P>
Transport issues are presently dealt with in the unitary development plans of local authorities in London and in strategic and borough plans elsewhere in the country. The creation, consultation on and publication of those plans are dealt with in great detail in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The Bill takes transport functions away from London boroughs in parts, but fails to impose on the mayor the same constraints that other strategic transport authorities face. The result will be transport strategies that are based more on political expediency than on hard data and criteria. It will be impossible or impractical to implement them. That may result in an impasse between the strategic and implementing authorities.
<P>
The Bill also removes transportation planning from the public arena in that there is no provision for a public inquiry. Such provision presently exists in respect of unitary development plans.
<P>
For those reasons, it is essential that the Government accept the new clause, which would provide protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I support new clause 24. Any responsible mayoralty will want to keep transport in London under constant review. Demographics and the economic situation will change while the GLA's spatial development plan will alter the pattern of development and economic activity in the capital.
<P>
The new clause has its origin in other legislation and there are good precedents for it. I support it particularly because of the deficiencies in clause 122. For the public, the mayor's general transport duty will be among his most important functions. Londoners will look to the mayor and to the authority to realise the Labour election manifesto promise--that things will get better. As far as transport is concerned, things have become considerably worse.
<P>
Several aspects of the services are spelt out in clause 122(l). They must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"safe, integrated, efficient and economic".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Londoners could equally well argue for other features. In that respect, I am glad to see the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) in Committee because he was always a champion of London transport, particularly underground transport, when he was the chairman of the Greater London council. I am glad that he is back from his contest with his colleague, the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). I do not see why Her Majesty's Government should victimise the hon. Member for Brent, East, who is a transport expert, in the way that they have, but that is how Labour politics are conducted these days. That aside, Londoners will want comfortable, punctual, smooth-running, clean, reliable, well-lit, and sweet-smelling services. Those are hardly characteristics of London Underground. That is particularly true today, when members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are on strike because they have no confidence in the Government's implementation of the public-private partnership for the London underground transport system.
<P>
The new clause is important. There are many deficiencies in the Bill's provisions. You enjoined us not to deal at great length with air transport, Mr. Winterton, but it merits profound consideration. Heliports have always been a vexatious issue for Londoners. Battersea is useful, but there could be a case for more heliports in London, particularly with the advent of tilt rotor aircraft, which will provide the potential for services into city centres, of which London may want to take advantage. London has no fewer than four major airfields Heathrow, the City airport, RAF Northolt and Biggin Hill, which, I believe, is situated in the borough of Bromley, and which has immense potential for business aviation.
<P>
Transport policy will have to ensure that important air transport interests are accommodated within a satisfactory surface transport infrastructure. That must be done according to environmental requirements to ensure that minimum noise is perpetrated upon local residents and that minimum environmental intrusion is caused by excessive development of airport facilities. Those aspects of transport policy will be a major challenge for the mayoralty.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Committee has had a good debate, but we have merely scratched at the surface, although we have given detailed treatment to important aspects of the Bill in relation to cyclists and, dare I say it, to Shanks's pony.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Association of London Government has drawn to the attention of the hon. Members of all parties a couple of points about the clause. I should like to air those points, and to give the Minister the opportunity to respond.
<P>
First, the ALG is concerned that the clause specifically refers to the economic proivison of transport. I am sure that all hon. Members welcome the desire to achieve best value and economy in the delivery of transport services. The concern is, however, that such provision might preclude the mayor from developing strategies involving the subsidy of uneconomic service within the Greater London public transport network. Will the Minister make it clear that such preclusion will not arise because of the wording of the duty in the clause?
<P>
Secondly, the ALG is concerned that a conflict of interest may arise between the mayor and Transport for London because of the drafting of the duty. The mayor has to provide the policy framework, funding and so on, but he or she is not directly responsible for delivering the policy. I can see from the Ministers' body language that they do not accept the ALG's point. Will the Minister clarify the matter, however, for the ALG's benefit, and perhaps for that of other people outside the Committee? The ALG is concerned that the Bill does not give the mayor specific power to deliver transport services, and instead gives powers to deliver transport to Transport for London, which is a separate agency. A conflict may arise if the two are at variance about the way in which they should be operating. I dare say that the Minister will refer to other clauses that act as checks and breaks and which will prevent such conflicts. However, will she address that specific point for the record?
<P>
The general duty contained in the clause is a good basis for the mayor to proceed. It also provides a good platform for setting out the policies on which people will fight to secure the office and to deliver to the people of London the improved public transport that everyone wants. The hon. member for Ruislip-Northwood was right: no other part of the Bill will be more important to Londoners than that which deals with a reliable and safe public transport system that delivers to them the environment, sustainable economy and growth that they and the capital need. We will therefore support the clause.
<P>
The new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South would place additional prescriptive obligations on the mayor, and is therefore unnecessary. I entirely accept, however, the need to require the mayor to review his or her strategies and to ensure that they are up to date and grounded in facts, figures and reality, not merely in rhetoric. I hope that the Minister will assure us that that is also the Government's intention and that the Bill already provides for such mechanisms of review to take place.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The points made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood were especially interesting. I am mindful, Mr. Winterton, of your remarks to the Committee about the variety of modes of transport that we have already discussed this morning. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood spoke about more heliports and helicopters. The word "more" is heard constantly when discussing the improvement of transport in London. Virtually everyone has their own favourite means of improving the situation, whether by the provision of more buses, more cycles, more pedestrianisation or more interchanges. "More" is always part and parcel of the solution. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood went on to talk about the concerns that inevitably develop as a consequence of the idea of simply introducing more of something. Those concerns centre on increased pollution, overcrowding and noise. Everyone wants more, but they want more with less pollution, less overcrowding and less noise.
<P>
That is why the mayor is so important. One of the Government's major aims is to end the current fragmentation of transport in London, which means that a gap is constantly appearing between what is perceived to be the desired outcome and the fact that that outcome can be a nightmare for someone else in terms of environmental pollution, overcrowding or a reduction of the space around an individual or the environment in which they live.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I have a question for the Minister about the fifth terminal for Heathrow airport. Will the outcome of the inquiry go to the Secretary of State for resolution, as in the past, or will the mayor have an input? What will happen if there is a conflict between the view of the mayor and that of the Secretary of State? Likewise, if the Central Railways case were to go for adjudication under the Transport and Works Act 1992, would it be for the mayor or for the Secretary of State to decide?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The inquiry into terminal 5 will conclude well before the mayor takes office, and the decision will therefore be the responsibility of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The clause gives the mayor a wide-ranging duty to promote and encourage transport to, from and within London. It will achieve the Government's aim of ending the current fragmentation of responsibility for London's transport by placing the responsibility with a directly elected and publicly accountable mayor. The duty extends the mayor's influence to all forms of transport, including those outside his or her direct control. It encompasses the needs of pedestrians, to which I referred earlier today, the movement of goods and the needs of the users of London's transport who live outside the capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Subsection (3)(b) refers to the transportation of freight. The Central Railways project will send vast freight trains thundering through my constituency and across London to the constituencies of, among others, my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Uxbridge. That is dreaded by many residents of London and will cause grave environmental damage. The Transport and Works Act procedure means that the Secretary of State would have ultimately to adjudicate if Parliament were to approve his further consideration of the project. What would happen if the Greater London authority were in existence?
<P>
Would the mayor have the power to decide, or would it still be solely for the Secretary of State to decide?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I well remember previous debates in the House on former proposals by Central Railways and how those proposals were categorically dismissed. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the responsibility still rests firmly with Parliament. As part of an integrated transport strategy, the mayor could conceive of a scheme that would require Transport and Works Acts, but the decision to introduce such Acts is the responsibility of the House, not the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> On the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has just made, would the mayor or the Greater London authority have an input in discussions with the Secretary of State on something like the Central Railways scheme, which would be detrimental to the people of London? Would the mayor be able to put that view to the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Clearly, as the duties on the mayor for the provision of transport in London are so clear, it would be remiss of any mayor not to engage in discussions on any scheme proposed for consideration in that way. I refer not only to the mayor's duties with regard to transport, but to those duties in relation to spatial planning, the environment and the economy.
<P>
We believe that our proposals will result in a great improvement on the current situation in London. There is little doubt that to get to grips with the capitals transport problems will require vision and leadership. The mayor will have a strong mandate from Londoners. The mayor's influence over all forms of transport will allow the development of truly integrated solutions and responses to these problems.
<P>
I should like to touch on the idea behind new clause 24 of the mayor basing the transport strategy to implement this duty on relevant information. I have no disagreement with that, nor do the Government. It would be absurd to presuppose that anyone could compile an integrated transport strategy, which will be the mayor's duty, without obtaining all the relevant information. There will be a great deal of information available to the mayor, and there is the necessity to consult. I have no argument with information being a relevant factor in the creation of a transport strategy, but surely it is unnecessarily and overly prescriptive to lay down in statute what would be not only expensive but complicated.
<P>
The GLA, as a strategic authority, will be very rich in information resources. For example, there is the London Planning Advisory Committee and the London Research Centre. There will also be all the information which I have little doubt the boroughs will be only too happy to present to the mayor. It is by coordinating all the available information, because the range of functions is so broad, that the mayor will be able to produce a truly integrated and--inevitably and inescapably-- well-informed strategy and policies.
<P>
In the light of my remarks, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will not press new clause 24, and that Clause 122 will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am satisfied by the Minister's reassurance on new clause 24 and will not press the matter to a vote.
<P>
I have a point to make on clause stand part. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, in his probing on Central Railways, has placed a gaping hole in the middle of the Bill's transport strategy. The Minister says that Central Railways' proposals will be a matter for Parliament and not for the mayor); but Parliament could oppose a measure that the mayor supported, or vice versa. The Bill covers, in great detail, the interaction between the Secretary of State and the mayor the question of who can override whom--it is always the Secretary of State overriding the mayor--but as far as Parliament and the Transport and Works Act are concerned, there is no provision whatever.
<P>
The Minister will remember the row that was generated last time Central Railways made such a proposal. It was considered to be quite simply over the top--it would effectively have driven a railway through the gardens of my constituents and was, in my opinion, totally out of the question. However, I can imagine Parliament and the mayor disagreeing with each other over a similar proposal. Can the Minister explain how such a situation would be resolved?

<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has paraphrased what I said in response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood with regard to his concerns about what Central Railways has apparently publicised although I have seen no concrete proposals. I simply referred to my direct experience of a previous proposal by Central Railways. I well remember the debate that was held in the House and how the proposal was overwhelmingly turned down--[Interruption.]-- rejected, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South says from a sedentary position, by the House.
<P>
I have already said that it will be possible for the mayor to propose a Transport and Works Act for a scheme that he or she might perceive as being central to an integrated transport strategy. The possibility of opposition to any proposals is a matter for the mayor.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked what would happen in the case of a direct disagreement between Government and the mayor over a proposal that the mayor might perceive as impacting adversely on London. I am prepared to go back and ask about that. Should such a situation arise, where the mayor perceived a proposal to be hugely detrimental to London and Londoners, and Londoners also perceived it as being detrimental to them, there would not be only the mayor's 561 562 <P>
voice outside Parliament opposing the proposition: all the relevant London Members of Parliament and, almost inevitably, representatives of the London boroughs would also be protesting strongly.
<P>
However, I frankly admit that the hon. Gentleman has raised an issue that I have not considered in any detail. I am relieved that, he says from a sedentary position, he shares my ignorance. It is an important matter, which I shall examine. I trust that I will be able to give him a more informed reply than this at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> This issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and I have raised is of inestimable importance to Londoners. Will the Minister ensure that the Government address it on Report so that there will be clarity before the matter comes back to Parliament? I believe if the consultation process on the route goes satisfactorily, Central Railways could be given leave to have an order debated in Parliament. Such debates normally last for an hour and a half, and we ought to know before an order is debated what role the mayoralty will have subsequent to Parliament approving the order and whether a significant input by the mayoralty could affect the Secretary of State's decision.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I trust that I shall be able to return to the Committee well before Report with a response to the issue that has been raised by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood. However, I must tell them that I shall be examining a principle, which would not attach only to the particular scheme to which they have referred. A serious issue of principle is involved, with much wider implications. As I said, I hope to be able to return to the matter before Report to give a detailed reply.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 122 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to the amendments that I have selected to clause 123, and in an effort to be helpful to all members of the Committee, may I say that we have mileposts that we must bear in mind--and that I as Chairman must bear in mind. I understand that in our next seven sittings we must deal with more than 80 clauses, new clauses and schedules. I remind the Committee of that because the Committee must judge how it deals with all of those matters--most, if not all of them, important--so that they are properly debated in this Standing Committee.
<P>
I repeat that the Business Sub-Committee will meet to consider adjustments in the light of this Thursday and, of course, Budget day on 9 March, but I remind the Committee that I have a duty to try to ensure that all important matters are properly debated, and I hope that all members of the Committee will bear that in mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 437, in page 64, line 33, after "shall", insert "before 31st May 2000".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 438, in page 64, line 33, after "shall" insert
<P>

New clause 25--Duty of Mayor to consult on transport strategy
--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) When preparing proposals for the creation, revision, whether pursuant to a direction of the Secretary of State or otherwise, or repeal and replacement of a transport strategy and before finally determining its content the Mayor shall take such steps as will in his opinion secure
<P>
(a) that adequate publicity is given in Greater London to the matters which he proposes to include in the transport strategy;
<P>
(b) that persons who may be expected to desire an opportunity of making representations to the authority with respect to those matters are made aware that they are entitled to an opportunity of doing so;
<P>
(c) that such persons are given an adequate opportunity of making such representations; and
<P>
(d) that copies of the transport strategy are available for inspection.
<P>
(2) The Mayor shall consider any representations made to him.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In response to your welcome remarks, Mr. Winterton, may I say that, in fact, in the same period of time that we have until the next milepost, we were able to deal with 120 clauses by today, and with a similar number of amendments. We will strive to proceed at a similar pace. I assure you that there will be no lengthy speeches from Conservative members of the Committee in this debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 437 is now irrelevant in view of the Minister's statement the other day about the commencement of the authority, so I will not press it. However, I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 438 and new clause 25, so for procedural reasons, I will not withdraw amendment No. 437 until I have made my speech.
<P>
Amendment No. 438 would oblige the mayor to consult certain bodies in implementing his draft transport strategy. Those organisations represent passengers, pedestrians, persons with mobility problems, cyclists, motor cyclists--who are a particularly important part of the travelling public--public service vehicle operators, licensed hackney carriage and private hire vehicle drivers and operators and businesses.
<P>
New clause 25 sets out a detailed requirement for consultation with the public at large. The new clause is lifted from section 33 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Public consultation in the planning process is tried, tested and valued by the public. Such consultation is most important, and I hope that the Minister will take that into consideration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am using my discretion, but I take it that the hon. Member friend or Croydon South chose to speak not to amendment No. 437, but to amendment No. 438.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> An admirable compromise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to receive that compliment.
<P>
<B> Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Croydon, South did not want to move amendment No. 437. Not only has it been overtaken by events, but it is manifestly absurd, as it would give the mayor just 19 working days to prepare a hugely comprehensive transport strategy, consult people all over London about it and publish it. That is clearly impossible, so I am glad that we do not have to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am glad that we have got that out of the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
Let us now turn to amendment No. 438 and new clause 25. Their purpose is to change the consultation mechanisms for the preparation of the mayor's strategy. We gave an undertaking in Committee on 2 February to reconsider the consultation mechanisms in the Bill. That commitment extends to the points raised about this strategy.
<P>
However, I should make it clear that we are not sympathetic to long lists of people who must be consulted. The hon. Member for Croydon, South has produced an extremely long list in amendment No. 438--he mentioned motor cyclists among many others. The problem with such long lists, as we discussed when dealing with a comparable Liberal Democrat amendment, is that invariably they contain nonsense, such as bodies that no longer exist, or omit important groups. The hon. Gentleman has omitted any reference to users of the river-unintentionally, I am sure. I should have thought that it was important to consult potential users of the river in preparing a strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> And equestrians.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Indeed; he mentions another group. For that reason, we are not sympathetic to the idea of a prescriptive list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister may have been concentrating unduly on his speech when he said what he has just said, but when he mentioned lists and said that the Government were against them, a tremor passed across the face of Liberal Democrat members of the Committee, for reasons which may have more to do with voting than with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall not follow the right hon. Gentleman down that most interesting path, but I note his observation.
<P>
We are equally unsympathetic to the provisions of new clause 25, which would make unduly prescriptive arrangements for the consultation process. We have already made it clear that we will give further thought to the mayor's duties to consult on his or her strategies, and I hope that on the strength of that, the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw the amendment, and will not press the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister is quite right to criticise our drafting; he is entitled to do so. We have tabled amendments such as these not because we expect the Minister to accept them but because we want reassurance that matters have been taken into consideration. I imagine that the Liberal Democrats have done likewise. There will be more such amendments, so it may be helpful for the Minister to know where we are coming from. Nevertheless, on this occasion he has just about reassured me, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 436, in page 64, line 36. at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) a timescale for the submission of local implementation plans from the London borough councils pursuant to section 127."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 460, in clause 127, page 66, line 19, after "shall", insert "in accordance with the timescale contained in the transport strategy".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 436 would simply tighten the time scale for the submission of local implementation plans. In effect, it would ensure that boroughs did not take too long to produce their plans. Other amendments would similarly tighten clause 128.
<P>
Clause 127 provides for each borough council to submit its implementation plan to the mayor for approval. Amendment No. 460 would provide for such plans to be submitted within the time scale contained in the transport strategy, and follows from the lead amendment to clause 123, which provides for such a timetable to be included in the strategy. A specified timetable should be obligatory to ensure that the strategy is effective. Otherwise, there will be a sense of drift in the implementation of the plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I understand the purpose behind the amendments. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that they are unnecessary. The mayor already has the power to put into the strategy a timetable for the submission of local implementation plans if he or she so wishes. The amendments would make that a requirement, but we believe that the mayor should have a degree of discretion. There may be a case for what is, I think, now described as variable geometry--for example, differential timetables for the submission of plans emanating, for perfectly understandable reasons, from different authorities. We do not want an unduly prescriptive framework to apply.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Later today, the Committee will debate clauses that provide for the production of local implementation plans and the default mechanisms that will apply when authorities are slow in producing them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's concerns, while perfectly legitimate, are both satisfactorily addressed by the Bill. I therefore urge him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I should like to raise a point about the different timings of different aspects of the measure. We shall probably discuss that issue when we reach the clauses that deal with implementation, but it is also germane to this group of amendments. For example, when the unitary development plans and the transport 565 566 <P>
strategies that they contain are being produced, some effort must be made to synchronise the different processes--first, so that there is not a large amount of duplication and, secondly, so that the implementation plan is, to some extent, in line with the local authority's unitary development plan and transport strategy.
<P>
The statutory obligations that already apply to local authorities in drawing up their UDPs should take account of their new obligations in drawing up implementation plans. One ought to inform the other as much as the mayor's strategy for transport does. Perhaps when the Committee returns to the issue, we shall receive some clarification about the nature of the hierarchy in terms of the position of unitary development plans and their transport strategies, and the position of the mayor's transport strategy in respect of local implementation plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am satisfied by the Minister's response, and therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 123 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Directions by the Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 442, in page 65, line 10, after "area", insert "either within or".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 443, in page 65, line 17, leave out from "been" to "Parliament" in line 18" and insert "approved by".
<P>
Amendment No. 445, in page 65, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) No direction by the Secretary of State shall come into force if it is rejected by a resolution of the Assembly.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clause 124 deals with directions by the Secretary of State. As members of the Committee will gather from the tenor of the amendments, Conservative Members believe that the balance between the Secretary of State and the mayor is wrong: too much overriding power is held by the Secretary of State. The powers have, no doubt, been granted in case the hon. Member for Brent, East becomes mayor and the Secretary of State wants to ensure that he is able to control him. I gather that the hon. Member for Brent, East had a highly successful meeting last night, which gained national coverage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Eighteen hundred people came.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The number is increasing all the time. The newspaper that I read this morning referred to 1,500. The hon. Gentleman should send a message to the Prime Minister--I am sure that he will take note. I am sure that he has taken note of the meeting, but perhaps not in the way in which the hon. Gentleman hopes.
<P>
The powers are given to the Secretary of State in case he and the mayor should wildly disagree as to the way in which transport policy should be conducted.
<P>
I am puzzled that it was necessary to table amendment No. 442. Subsection (1)(b) gives the Secretary of State power to overrule inconsistencies between national policy and that of the mayor. It refers to an inconsistency that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is detrimental to any area outside Greater London."</ul></font>

<P>
However, I am sure that the Minister would want the provision to apply also to any area inside Greater London. Indeed, one is led to believe that areas inside Greater London will be more important than those outside as far as the authority is concerned. I may have completely missed the point, in which case I am happy to withdraw the amendment. There is, however, something slightly odd about the wording in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 443 and 445 relate to the grounds on which the Secretary of State can override the mayor's strategy if it is inconsistent with any national policy that has been laid before Parliament. Those grounds are similar to provisions in earlier parts of the Bill and we make the same point now that we have made before. It is not sufficient just to lay a White Paper before Parliament and to say that it represents national policy. The transport White Paper is a glossy document, which contains many photographs of success stories from the time of the Conservative Government. Not one photograph originates from what the present Government have done; they all relate to success stories under the previous Government. However, the White Paper presents us with a new world in which, all of a sudden, we have an integrated transport policy. The Government are, however, talking about integrating our policies. Those policies are no more or less integrated now than they were when we were in office. The point is, however, that the document will be laid before Parliament and everyone will say, "Right, that is national policy." It is possible that much of the White Paper will not become law, as has happened in the past under Conservative and Labour Governments. Barbara Castle laid a White Paper entitled "In Place of Strife" before Parliament under the Labour Government in the 1970s--that did not become law.
<P>
Are we saying that a White Paper is national policy just because it is laid before Parliament? It should not become policy until Parliament approves it and it has been enacted. We should not impose a wish list on Londoners. It is the case that the Secretary of State has only to tell his officials to publish a document, to say, "This is a White Paper" and to lay it before Parliament for it to be national policy, which the mayor must consider? That is not a balanced approach. It is the wrong way to approach obligations on the mayor and I invite the Minister to consider our points seriously.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Extraordinary misdrafting has given rise to the double criterion in subsection (1)(a), which states that the Secretary of State can intervene only if the mayoralty's transport policy
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is inconsistent with national transport policy".</ul></font>
<P>
We understand that. If a flagrant contradiction would negate and damage the transport policy that Her Majesty's Government were pursuing, the Secretary of State should of course be able to intervene. Subsection (1) contains a double criterion, however, which results from the addition of the words
<P>
<P>
"and the inconsistency is detrimental to any area outside Greater London."
<P>
I am sure that Her Majesty's Government will put that right.
<P>
The other aspect of the present group of amendments is that it demonstrates the totally cavalier attitude that Her Majesty's Government display towards the authority and which we have seen so often during the passage of the Bill. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree that transport policy is, par excellence, an activity that will be pursued on behalf of Londoners and which they will expect the mayoralty to pursue with vigour. The mayor will have a democratic mandate to pursue transport policy. It could, however, be hobbled by constant interference on the basis of documents that the Government lay before just one House of Parliament. I think that my hon. Friends have been too kind. I would have said that such documents should be approved by both Houses of Parliament in amendment No. 443. There should be no question of a piece of paper being laid before the house of cronies--that is what the House of Lords will become before too long--and of it constituting Government policy.
<P>
The assembly must have a meaningful role in transport policy. If a democratic mandate exists and the electorate have clearly stated their support of the mayor's policy, and if the assembly concurs, then only in the most exceptional circumstances and if it is in the national interest to do so should the Secretary of State be able to override the mayoralty and the assembly and stop them acting in agreement to pursue a policy agreed on behalf of Londoners as a whole.
<P>
The clause contains cavalier phraseology, because the Labour Government are not prepared to see a Greater London authority carrying out its democratic will as it jolly well ought to. It will be intriguing to see what transpires, and to see whether the Government allow that phraseology to remain or accept that the authority has a genuinely democratic role to play in transport.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We support the amendments. We articulated a similar view, in debates on earlier clauses, with regard to the approval by Parliament of policies that the Government are seeking by dint of the clause to require the mayor and assembly to follow. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made the point well. We have on several occasions said that provisions such as those in this clause are inappropriate because they place in the hands of the Secretary of State the ability to direct the assembly and mayor. They fly in the face of the general tenor of the legislation, which purports to give more power back to Londoners, to enable them to govern themselves and to make decisions on their own behalf and on that of the capital.
<P>
The current Secretary of State may be an undoubtedly benign figure who will operate the power entirely consistently with Londoners' wishes. A time will come, however, when such a Secretary of State is not in office. Another Secretary of State will have power to enforce policies that may be against Londoners' wishes. That is why we support the amendments, which would give the assembly an important checking role. They would also give Parliament an important scrutiny role in the formulation of policy. If we agree that a Government can make a policy merely by issuing it, and without proper parliament scrutiny and decisions, we are on a dangerous path.
<P>
The Bill contains 260 clauses giving the Secretary of State powers. Power is being increasingly centralised in the person of the Secretary of State without proper regard for the rights and privileges of the House in scrutinising Governments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> As someone who has an interest in being mayor one day, I do not view the provisions with any great alarm. I assume that if the authority were to pursue a narrow and purely London interest, a transport strategy might evolve that could damage areas outside London but still have popular support.
<P>
The south-east might eventually have regional government. The two separate bodies could devise strategies that are popular in their own areas but which conflict with an integrated national transport strategy. Were a Secretary of State to act unreasonably, his or her actions would be open to challenge in the courts. The matter does not seem to me to be a great problem.
<P>
Much as I love to hear the Oppossition parties worrying about my future political activities and constraint under some rapacious reactionary Government, I must remind them of when the Labour-run Greater London council offered British Rail money to enable it to cut fares on services in the GLC area. The Transport Minister of the then Conservative Government instructed British Rail that if it accepted the funds he would cancel an equivalent amount in the Government grant, thus negating the reduction in fares. Although the GLC, had tried, to take action, Bromley took it to court because it had not cut fares on British Rail services.
<P>
The Oppossition's new-found interest in independence for London transport policy is remarkably new. I hope that no Opposition Member lies awake at night worrying that I am concerned about finding myself in conflict with a Labour Transport Minister. I am not concerned--I think that it is a damn good policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support amendments Nos. 442 and 443. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South made a salutary point about White Papers. He elicited the fact that all the illustrations in the recent White Paper were drawn from achievements of the previous Government.
