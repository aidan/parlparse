if they wish, remove their jackets. Mr. Caton, my
co-Chairman, will take his own view, and I am sure that he will inform
you of that. Please ensure that all mobile phones, pagers and other
such devices are turned off or switched to silent mode during Committee
sittings.</div>
<a name="08101450000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
Ways and Means resolution in connection with the Bill, and copies are

should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my fellow Chairman
and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that
might be reached during an afternoon
sitting.</div><a name="08101450000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion, on

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>changes that we have seen. I congratulate the Minister on his recent
elevation to the Privy Council. We broadly agree with the programme

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000344"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I thank Members of another place who debated the
Bill fully. The legislation we pass tends to look forward and to make
reforms for the future, but this Bill begins with a legislative look
over its shoulder. Clauses 1 and 2 are about returning to past practice
in some ways.</div>
<a name="08101450000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1
provides for the repeal of the statutory dispute resolutions, which I
will call &#147;the procedures&#148;, brought into force by
regulation in 2004 under powers in the Employment Act 2002. When the
procedures were introduced, the then Government Minister, Lord
Sainsbury of Turville, said that
we</div><a name="08101450000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
committed after two years to a review of how the procedures operate in
practice.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23
February 2004; Vol. 658, c.
101.]</div><a name="08101450000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
did that both internally and through the review of dispute resolution
carried out by Michael Gibbons and published last year. It is widely
accepted, and the review by Michael Gibbons confirmed, that resolving
disputes in the workplace as early as possible is desirable for all
concerned. The tribunal system is important for access to justice, but
it would be a mistake always to regard arrival at the tribunal as
evidence of the system&#146;s success. Very often it is better if
disputes can be resolved before reaching the tribunal. Over the years,
the Government have tried to create a system that maintains the access
to justice in the tribunals, but also encourages earlier dispute
resolution. The 2004 procedures should, to some extent, be looked at in
that
light.</div><a name="08101450000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procedures introduced a legal requirement for the parties in a dispute
to seek to resolve it through what has become known as the three-step
procedures. They require, first, one side to inform the other of the
issue in writing; secondly, a meeting to discuss the matter; and
finally, usually, an appeal process. It was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>important, and we will touch on it several times in our debates, that
the procedures were not only written into law, as it were, but that
they affected the balance of content and merit that a tribunal took
into account when reaching a judgment. Under the current regulations,
tribunals have to reject claims that do not meet the requirements
concerning the submission of a written grievance and to increase or
decrease awards if either side fails to complete the
procedures.</div><a name="08101450000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
internal review in 2006 revealed concern among stakeholders about the
impact of the procedures, so the then Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry invited Mr. Gibbons to undertake an end-to-end
review of the dispute resolution process. His terms of reference were
to raise productivity through improved dispute handling in the
workplace, to ensure access to justice for employers and for employees,
and to reduce the costs involved for all parties. His report of March
2007 concluded that while the intention of the regulations had been
right, their operation resulted in an unnecessarily high administrative
burden for employers and employees and had unintended consequences
which outweighed the benefits. Many businesses told the review that the
procedures had led to the use of formal processes to deal with problems
that could have been resolved informally. In my informal language,
Gibbons&#146;s overall conclusion was that the procedures drove
disputes into the formal process too early and that they increased
legal involvement and costs to all parties. We are, of course,
concerned not only with justice, but with costs. If there is a
mechanism that can deal with disputes in the workplace while decreasing
costs for the parties, but that does not compromise justice, we should
introduce it. That is the intention behind clause 1 and other
clauses.</div><a name="08101450000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government published a consultation document alongside the Gibbons
review. Respondents endorsed the conclusions of the review. I well
understand the principles behind the 2004 changes, which were to set
out clear steps that people should go through when there is a dispute
in the workplace. Those principles were sound, but in the light of two
years&#146; experience of operating them it is clear that there were
unforeseen results when they were enshrined in
legislation.</div><a name="08101450000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
system that will replace the three-step procedures, which is set out in
the following clauses, gives tribunals more discretion and will try to
avoid elevating process over merit, which was a key focus for Gibbons.
The Government propose through the clause to repeal the 2004
procedures, but at the same time we will put in place a package of
measures to encourage the continuation and spread of good practice
designed to resolve disputes in the workplace early. Part of that
package is a revised ACAS code, which will be principles-based and
concise. There will also be an incentive for parties to comply with the
code in the form of a power for tribunals to adjust upwards or
downwards&#151;I stress that that will be at their
discretion&#151;where the parties unreasonably fail to comply with
the relevant ACAS code. There will also be enhanced resources for ACAS
to run a new helpline, more pre-claim conciliation and so
on.</div><a name="08101450000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are abolishing the 2004 three-step procedures and replacing them with a
new system that will be better funded and which is designed to resolve
disputes in the workplace earlier. There will be up to &#163;37
million of funding over three years for the set-up and running 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>costs of the enhanced advice service. Additionally, funding for the
early conciliation service has already been
announced.</div><a name="08101450000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill begins with a recognition that the 2004 regulations, while well
intentioned, have resulted in an unforeseen formalisation of disputes.
We are therefore acting to remove them. That will be the effect of the
clause.</div><a name="08101450000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000345"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We open the debate on the opening clauses of the
Bill, which deal with dispute resolution and tribunals. I mirror the
Minister in noting that significant consideration has been given to
these provisions and to the Bill as a whole in another place. It did a
pretty thorough job. I say here and now that I do not intend to rerun
all of the debates that were held in the Lords where that is not
required. Hon. Members will see that from the amendments that have been
tabled thus far. However, that will be required in a few
instances.</div><a name="08101450000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
my party recognises that the clause, which deals with employment
dispute resolution, is an admission by the Government that their 2002
reforms of dispute resolution have failed and that they need to go back
to what was there before and start again some six years later. We
support the provisions of the clause, as proposed by the Gibbons
review, although we note how unimpressed we are with the process that
has come to this position over the last six
years.</div><a name="08101450000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000346"></a>John
Hemming:</b> My party, too, is sympathetic to the attempt to
minimise the amount of paperwork involved in the process and to resolve
issues on an informal basis at an early stage where possible. However,
an eternal difficulty is that people are informed at the final
stage&#151;whatever that may be&#151;of how much paperwork they
should retain at the early stages, once they have had the experience. I
have seen this matter from many different sides, in various
circumstances as a representative of employees in internal disputes and
as an employer. The steps to try to resolve things through written
submissions rather than a hearing are crucial. The Government should be
aware that whatever the final conclusions are, they will inform the
early stages.</div>
<a name="08101450000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it
is good news that the Government have recognised that things have
become over-formal, unless serious efforts are made to ensure that the
issues of dispute are identified at an earlier stage, we will end up
with the same problem in the same circumstances. So this is generally a
good direction, recognising the errors that were made previously, but
it remains a challenging area to
resolve.</div><a name="08101450000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<a name="08101450000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
absolutely the right thing to do. Whatever we think about statutory

individuals who are not members of trade unions, simply do not

have a practising certificate and was previously appointed as a
part-time chairman of tribunals. It is clear that people do not
understand statutory codes. They understand simple, straightforward
guidance. May I therefore also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>congratulate ACAS on the draft code that the Minister has kindly
circulated? If that is to be the new standard, it is a gold standard
which certainly could be a precedent for much else in the world of
employment law. On this, we are absolutely at
one.</div><a name="08101450000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000348"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This is the second part of looking over our
shoulder in the sense that the clause will return us to what we call
the Polkey line in unfair dismissal cases. The House of Lords judgment
in the 1987 Polkey case established the precedent that dismissal could
be unfair purely on procedural grounds. However, the judgment also
provided that in those circumstances the tribunal could reduce the
compensation to the claimant, or eliminate it completely, in proportion
to the likelihood that the dismissal would have gone ahead even if the
correct procedure had been
followed.</div><a name="08101450000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
do we need to take such action? Having decided to repeal the statutory
procedures, which we discussed under clause 1, we had to reconsider the
procedural fairness provisions that went alongside them. That question
was raised in the Government&#146;s consultation on the Gibbons
review and an additional detailed review of the different options was
issued alongside the main consultation. One option&#151;the one we
have chosen&#151;was to revert to the Polkey case law.</div>
<a name="08101450000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
option was the no difference rule. Where a dismissal was unfair,
provided that it could be shown that the failure to follow procedures
made no difference to the decision, it would not need to be taken into
account. Employees, in particular, felt that that was unfair because it
gave employers a blank cheque to ignore procedures in these cases. On
balance, we decided to recommend returning to the Polkey
line&#151;and, indeed, more people involved in the consultation
supported returning to Polkey than to the no difference rule.
Therefore, we propose to repeal section 98A of the Employment Rights
Act 1996 to revert to the Polkey line of
cases.</div><a name="08101450000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000351"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Although there are many amendments, they all do
pretty much the same thing. They look at what constitutes the defined
code of practice in dispute resolution. I shall consider some of the
wider issues in the code in the stand part debate. I direct the
Committee to the debate in the other place on this matter. Lord Bach,
the then Minister, confirmed that six codes were currently issued under
chapter 3 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992. By his own admission, the drafting of the clause was deliberately
wide to allow for flexibility to cover other present or future
codes.</div><a name="08101450000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I agree that we have no interest in hamstringing ACAS, there is a need
for certainty on this front. Employers are placed in a
disproportionately burdensome position whereby they are forced to
comply with broadly defined procedures. To prevent undue expense and
time-consuming second-guessing of the legislative intention by
employers, would it not be prudent to specify the relevant code from
the outset as the ACAS code of practice on discipline and grievance
procedures? Would that not be preferable to a definition that
encompasses six separate procedures but expects compliance with only
one? There is a need to give employers a clear, well sign-posted route
for dealing fairly and efficiently with disciplinary procedures. It is
a course of action that, for most, is a last resort. It benefits
neither the employer nor employee to have an opaque legislative
procedure, which leaves both parties in the dark. This is especially
true given the financial penalties for
non-compliance.</div><a name="08101450000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000352"></a>John
Hemming:</b> We broadly support the amendment. When there are
statutory codes and a process that people need to follow, clarity is
greater and things are
easier.</div><a name="08101450000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000353"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Huntingdon for the
spirit in which he moved the amendment. My response is about
future-proofing the Bill. The clause is important and goes
wider than the subject matter of the amendments. I am sure that we will
return to that on clause stand part. The clause is about the balance
between content and merit, which I mentioned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>in my opening remarks. It includes the capacity to vary awards based on
the degree of adherence to the codes issued under
it.</div><a name="08101450000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of a relevant code of practice was, as the hon. Gentleman
pointed out, discussed in the other place. A relevant code of practice
is one issued under the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992, which relates exclusively or primarily to
procedures for resolving disputes. The hon. Gentleman correctly said
that there was more than one code. There are currently six codes, some
relating to disclosure of information to trade unions for collective
bargaining purposes and others relating to industrial action, picketing
and so on. Those matters need not concern us here and are not covered
by the clause.</div>
<a name="08101450000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of the
existing codes, the definition of a relevant code of practice in the
clause would apply only to the ACAS code of practice on disciplinary
and grievance procedures. I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for
Hastings and Rye said a few moments ago about the valuable work that
ACAS does and its expertise in these areas. The clause will also allow
the application of adjustment in the context of future relevant codes
issued by ACAS or the Secretary of State under the 1992
Act.</div><a name="08101450000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would have two effects. First, they would tie the definition
of &#147;relevant Code of Practice&#148; to a code on discipline
and grievance procedure issued by ACAS and not the Secretary of State.
Secondly, they would provide expressly in the 1992 Act that
ACAS&#146;s power to issue codes encompasses codes on discipline and
grievance
procedure.</div><a name="08101450000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the first point, ACAS certainly plays a crucial and valuable role in
the resolution of workplace disputes, as I have said. In my time as
employment relations Minister, I have valued my working relationship
with ACAS. That organisation is sometimes in a strange position because
its successes do not reach the news. It resolves many issues without
their spilling over into a wider problem of industrial relations. The
drafting of the clause to refer to codes issued by ACAS or the
Secretary of State is therefore not intended to belittle or downgrade
the role of ACAS. However, under the amendments, it would not be open
to the Secretary of State to issue additional codes if he or she so
wished. While there is currently no intention for the Secretary of
State to issue a code of practice under this provision, the power
exists and the Government do not wish to exclude the possibility that
it might be used. It would therefore not make sense for tribunals to be
unable to take account of the provisions of such a code, were it to be
issued.</div><a name="08101450000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe the second proposal to be unnecessary. Under section 199 of the
1992 Act, ACAS has the power to issue codes of practice as it thinks
fit to promote the improvement of industrial relations. That covers the
issue that we are
discussing.</div><a name="08101450000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the first effect of the amendments would be to tie the
hands of future Secretaries of State in issuing codes alongside the
ACAS codes. The second effect is unnecessary. On that basis, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000354"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Does the Minister accept that employers and
employees both need certainty and that the Department should be guided
by that need when issuing guidance and identifying what is and is not
relevant?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="08101450000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000355"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I accept that clarity is needed for employers
and employees. I do not believe that building in the possibility for
the Secretary of State to issue a code detracts from that clarity. I
have been quite clear that the code we are talking about in the Bill is
the ACAS
code.</div><a name="08101450000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000356"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): May I add my
expressions of pleasure at serving under your chairmanship,
Mr. Bercow? It is always clear, with no confusion
whatsoever, and we are grateful for
that.</div><a name="08101450000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I, too, question the Minister about simplicity? The Bill was originally
intended to be a simplification of what is pretty complicated law for
laymen to deal with. That is what matters. We are dealing in many cases
with very small business people who cannot afford recourse to the law
on such issues. They try to do their best, but find it a nightmare. The
complication that we create in this law leads to a compensation
culture, which is not healthy, especially for small businesses. Over
the next two years, it will be particularly unhealthy because, as we
all recognise, such businesses face massive
strains.</div><a name="08101450000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
represented my company in days gone by in three tribunals, I know how
much the law has been misunderstood. I know also how effective ACAS is
in helping with these matters, particularly in supporting both sides in
such disputes. To complicate the law beyond that process seems to me
simply to add further problems, not only for small businesses that deal
with these matters from an employer side, but for
employees.</div><a name="08101450000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to make one further point. Employees often have recourse to
Citizens Advice and receive legal representation as a result, but many
employers are unable to do that. There must be a balance. Establishing
one code of practice is an important part of that balance because
everybody knows where to go. Everybody knows in the first instance that
ACAS is the authority. To complicate that particular trend seems
unhelpful. I urge the Minister to think
again.</div><a name="08101450000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000357"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I had intended the amendment to be probing, but
I will have to go away and think further about it. Having heard the
Minister, I am not totally satisfied. I always feel rather
uncomfortable when I hear a Minister say that we need to legislate for
what might need dealing with in the future, and that the Secretary of
State might need such powers. I get the same chilly feeling that I had
yesterday evening when I heard the Home Secretary say that she was
going to put her draft Bill in the
Library.</div><a name="08101450000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South. Businesses
expect clarity. They will want at the very least a full explanation of
what this legislation means for them. There is potential for things to
be changed and for them not to hear about it, and to therefore be
confused as a
result.</div><a name="08101450000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000358"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that in the present economic climate, it is even more important to be
clear about what we are asking businesses to do and how they should
change? The cost implications of those changes will not be
inconsequential, at a time when most companies are struggling to
survive.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="08101450000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000359"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point that I
will use when discussing other aspects of the Bill. I thank him for
making it now as it is
relevant.</div><a name="08101450000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will go away and think about this matter further. In the meantime, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000360"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in
clause 3, page 2, line 15, leave
out &#145;25%&#146; and insert
&#145;50%&#146;.</div><a name="08101450000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000361"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 4, in
clause 3, page 2, line 25, leave
out &#145;25%&#146; and insert
&#145;50%&#146;.</div><a name="08101450000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000362"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This is another probing amendment, which
attempts to discover the Government&#146;s reasoning behind the
reduction in the power of employment tribunals to vary awards for
non-compliance from 50 to 25 per
cent.</div><a name="08101450000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first question we must ask is whether this is yet another example of
the Government tinkering with regulation unnecessarily. Section 31 of
the Employment Act 2002 provided employment tribunals with the power
effectively to punish employers or employees who failed to comply with
the statutory disciplinary and grievance procedures. That Act
enabled&#151;indeed, obliged&#151;employment tribunals to vary
awards made to employees by anywhere between 10 and 50 per cent.,
depending on what they considered just and equitable. I confess that I
am no statistician, but I have trouble seeing how reducing the maximum
figure from 50 to 25 per cent. does anything other than blunt the teeth
of the employment tribunals and reduce the scope for dealing with
vexatious
claims.</div><a name="08101450000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
by reducing the penalties for non-compliance, could it not be said that
the suggestion to employers is that compliance with the new ACAS code
of practice for discipline and grievance is somehow less important than
compliance with the previous code? In the other place, Lord Jones of
Birmingham, then a Minister, stated that the power to adjust awards up
and down
was</div><a name="08101450000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
incentive mechanism to encourage parties to follow good
practice.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4
February 2008; Vol. 698, c.
GC465.]</div><a name="08101450000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
Michael Gibbons in his report recommended that there be an incentive to
comply with the code. While I agree that those are laudable aims, I
cannot help feeling that the incentive has had its legs cut from under
it and become half the incentive that it could have
been.</div><a name="08101450000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that in mind, I ask the Minister two simple questions. What is the
Government&#146;s rationale for changing the figures? Secondly, why
choose 25 per cent.? I am also curious as to how the Minister and the
Government envisage employment tribunals enforcing a non-statutory,
principle-based procedure for dispute
resolution.</div><a name="08101450000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2006 consultation on the Employment Act 2002
stated:</div><a name="08101450000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Employment Tribunal Service will be able to monitor the number of cases
where failure to comply with the procedural elements becomes an issue,
including the number of cases where awards are adjusted because of
procedural failings.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="08101450000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet from what I have
been able to discover&#151;I would appreciate it if the Minister put
me right&#151;no such figures have been produced. Can he tell us why
and give us those figures now? Without knowing how the existing system
has been working, how can we get the system right with this
Bill?</div><a name="08101450000100"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000363"></a>John
Hemming:</b> We are perhaps more sympathetic to the Government
on the 25 per cent. figure, but that obviously depends on the
Minister&#146;s answer to the question at hand. Compliance with the
codes is perhaps a procedural issue, rather than a substantive one.
Inasmuch as the Bill is orientated towards the substance of the issue,
we do not feel that it necessarily would be good&#151;for employers
or employees&#151;to revert to a greater focus on procedural matters
and change the 25 per cent. figure to 50 per cent. Hence, we are
generally with the Government on
this.</div><a name="08101450000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000364"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> I certainly want to resist the amendment. I
am surprised that it comes from the quarters that it does, because
powers have previously been used against employers, usually small
employers who have simply not understood the procedural
requirements.</div><a name="08101450000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000365"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My point was that we do not have the figures
about how powers have been applied. I would be grateful if the hon.
Gentleman put us right on those
figures.</div><a name="08101450000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000366"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> My evidence is empirical. I agree that the
substantive figures would be helpful. However, anyone who deals with
small employers&#151;not just as a lawyer but in their constituency
surgery&#151;knows that it is they who almost inevitably fall foul of
the procedural rules. The hon. Gentleman seems to be penalising small
employers because of some failure on their part, as we discussed
earlier, to have the resources to access knowledge across the board.
They do not even have the ability to go to Citizens Advice for support,
as employees may. This amendment is therefore targeted against small
employers, which is wholly
unfortunate.</div><a name="08101450000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000367"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me first deal with the point about figures.
I do not believe that the tribunal service issues a breakdown of the
cases in which the current variance of 10 to 50 per cent. is used, but
it has told officials in my Department that the top end of that
variance is rarely
reached.</div><a name="08101450000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
more substantive issue before us is what the degree of adjustment on
procedural grounds should be. I started my remarks today by saying that
the Bill has a thread running through it, which is the balance between
procedure and merit in tribunal cases. The hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley got it right when he cautioned us against running against the
Bill&#146;s general direction by elevating procedure to too great a
level above merit. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye is
also right when he says that the effect of the amendment, if accepted,
could be that a small employer, having perhaps been substantially
correct in the case presented to the tribunal, is hit with a 50 per
cent. increase in the award against them because of the procedural
weakness of not appealing to the ACAS code. The reason why we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>are removing the 2004 procedures, as set out in clause 1, is that,
having reviewed their operation for a few years, we concluded that
process was being elevated above merit. I fear that the amendments
would lead us to fall back into that
trap.</div><a name="08101450000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000368"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> In reviewing that matter in the legislation, has
the Minister or any of his officials discussed the implications with
the Federation of Small
Businesses?</div><a name="08101450000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000369"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Yes. We discuss all our employment matters with
the main business organisations regularly, including the Federation of
Small Businesses, the CBI and others.</div>
<a name="08101450000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
to remember is that, whereas the 2004 procedures required tribunals to
elevate procedure above content, under the changes that we are bringing
in, that judgment will be for the tribunal to make. The hon. Member for
Huntingdon asked why the figure was 25 per cent. instead of
another one. These matters are not an exact science; where we set the
figure is a matter of judgment. Our policy aim is to not elevate
process above content, and to not allow procedure to be simply
disregarded. We want to get that balance right by allowing tribunals,
at their discretion, to vary an award if there has been an unreasonable
failure to adhere to procedures.</div>
<a name="08101450000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3
creates an incentive mechanism by proposing that tribunals be
allowed&#151;not required&#151;to adjust awards by up to 25 per
cent. if either party has acted unreasonably in failing to comply with
the relevant code of practice. An adjustment of 50 per cent. would take
us back to the system that the Bill is trying to reform and would
perhaps repeat the unforeseen consequences of the 2004 procedures that
we are trying to move away from.</div>
<a name="08101450000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000370"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The first point to make is that the Minister has
admitted that the figures do not exist, even though in 2002 it was
claimed that they would. We are all operating in the dark; we do not
know what the situation is. The Minister said that it is not an exact
science; I say that he is sticking his finger into the wind. We are
hindered by a lack of information but I am starting to see the problem,
which the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye elaborated on and the
Minister confirmed.</div>
<a name="08101450000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and the Minister seem to be saying that they understand the
concerns of companies and small businesses, and that they are unsure of
the tribunals&#146; ability to get to grips with the problems of
putting companies and employees on an even procedural footing and of
dealing with vexatious claims. In other words, if the figure were 50
per cent., it could be used disproportionately against companies,
rather than employees. In that context, I can see why the figure is
capped at 25 per cent. rather than 50 per cent, but that does not make
it right. Equally importantly, it shows that the Bill will not have the
impact that the Minister has
claimed.</div><a name="08101450000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000371"></a><b class="B">Barry
Gardiner</b> (Brent, North) (Lab): On a previous amendment the
hon. Gentleman asked for increased clarity. Does he not accept that
reducing the scope by which any penalty may vary from 50 to 25 per
cent. gives the clarity and certainty that small businesses would
welcome?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div><a name="08101450000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000372"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, I totally disagree with the hon. Gentleman.
If companies and employees were to be treated on a fair and equal basis
and the figure was 50 per cent., that figure could well act
as a disincentive against vexatious claims. The point that the hon.
Member for Hastings and Rye and the Minister made is that companies and
employees may not be treated in the same way, and that companies may
therefore lose out. I tend to agree. We do not know whether we can
agree because we do not have the figures. So, as I said before, we are
thrashing around in the dark
here.</div><a name="08101450000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08101450000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000373"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me cast some light. The hon. Gentleman
referred to vexatious claims. Surely he accepts that vexatious claims
can be dealt with at a pre-hearing review and that the tribunal will
recognise them as vexatious and will not find in favour of the person
who brought them. To elevate this procedural device of saying that not
adhering to the code should be matched with an ability to vary awards
up or down by 50 per cent. will not deal with an issue of vexatious
claims. They can either be dealt with in the current process, or the
target would be
missed.</div><a name="08101450000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000374"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister pre-empts my final point; I am
going to agree with him. When we get on to vexatious claims we do have
some figures. We will come on to that because I have great concerns
about those figures, but to my mind it is impossible to separate the
debate between the procedural and the vexatious; certainly, the average
small company would not do so. For them, it is all part of the same
problem. As the Minister says, the Bill separates the procedural from
the vexatious and is rather toothless as a
result.</div><a name="08101450000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
the Bill ignores the question of vexatiousness, so we have tabled
amendments to remedy that. I am sad to see that those amendments are
not being considered under this clause. I feel that they should be, but
that is a decision taken by others and I respect it. We will come to
that issue at a later stage, but the Minister will take the point that
vexatious claims are not dealt with in the Bill, and that is what will
most concern small businesses. On the basis of what we have heard, we
will wish to reconsider our position on these clauses, and I seek leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000375"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I make it clear to members of the
Committee that ordinarily when someone seeks leave to withdraw their
amendment, I will immediately put that question to the vote. Similarly,
if an hon. Member seeks to push their amendment to the vote, I will
immediately put it to the vote. In this case I have received a slightly
belated indication from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley that he
wishes to speak on the matter and on this occasion I will happily allow
him to do so. Hon. Members will quickly discover that I am a
facilitator. I want them to contribute but unfortunately I am not
psychic, so an hon. Member who wishes to catch my eye cannot rely
simply on raising their eyebrow. They need to rise and indicate their
wish to speak.</div>
<a name="08101450000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000376"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. On a procedural
matter, although my declarations of interest are a matter of public
record, I should like to add to that record. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>I am a member of the Federation of Small Businesses, which
has not been mentioned so far. I am an employer as well as having been
on various sides of employment tribunals. The issue of substance is
whether vexatious matters have any substance. Vexatious cases do not
have any substance. Therefore they would not be found on a substantial
basis, so this is totally irrelevant to the question of whether any
application to a tribunal is vexatious. The question is whether it
satisfies the procedural process. The Government&#146;s direction of
travel is right. Perhaps we would prefer 22.596 rather than 25 per
cent., but that is not really an issue of
substance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000377"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I understand that the procedural formalities
here mean that I must again seek the Committee&#146;s leave to
withdraw the amendment, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="08101450000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000378"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in
clause 3, page 4, line 3, after
&#145;Society)&#146;,
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">&#145;Regulation 17 of
the Cross-border Railway Services (Working Time) Regulations 2008 (SI
2008/1660) (breach of
regulations)&#146;.</div><a name="08101450000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer the Committee to proposed new schedule A2 on page 3 of the Bill,
which sets out a list of jurisdictions to which the rest of the clause
applies. In other words, those are the enactments under which someone
could pursue a claim under the
clause.</div><a name="08101450000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 1 will add an enactment to that list. It is periodically
updated as employment law evolves. As we have discussed, tribunals can
apply an adjustment to proceedings under the jurisdictions, as set out
in new schedule A2. That schedule replicates the jurisdictions listed
in schedule 3 to the Employment Act 2002 and covers the vast majority
of the jurisdictions of claims accepted by employment
tribunals.</div><a name="08101450000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a sense, the amendment can be put down to timing. Following Third
Reading of the Bill in the other place, the Cross-border Railway
Services (Working Time) Regulations 2008 came into force on 27 July. I
am sure that all hon. Members noticed that at the time. Those
regulations transpose a European directive on working conditions for
railway workers on cross-border railway services. For example, they
allow a worker to complain to an employment tribunal if his employer
has refused to permit him to exercise rights relating to rest, break
periods and so on. Regulation 17 was inserted into schedule 3 to the
Employment Act 2002. This is a consequential amendment that will add
regulation 17 to new schedule A2 as a jurisdiction to which the new
adjustment provisions will also
apply.</div><a name="08101450000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000379"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In principle, we see no reason to oppose the
amendment. Perhaps the Minister could clarify who constitutes a
cross-border worker for the sake of the remedies provision. Does he
have figures for the number of times such remedy claims have been
successful, and in how many of those cases would a tribunal have varied
the award on the basis of a failure to comply with the code? Finally,
does the Minister believe that the amendment will have any cost
implications?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="08101450000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000380"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> An example of the type of worker involved is
somebody working on a railway service through the channel tunnel, which
is a cross-border railway service. This provision will apply to their
breaks, rest periods and so on. The hon. Gentleman asked how many times
the tribunal will be able to take cases. That is a matter for the
future, not the past. The cost implications for employers operating
services through the channel tunnel will depend on the extent to which
they adhere to the working time regulations. If the regulations are
contravened, there will of course be a cost implication. As in all of
these matters, there is a very easy way to avoid cost implications: to
adhere to the law in the first
place.</div><a name="08101450000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000381"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I would like to continue probing this part of
the Bill. I note with interest the comments of Lord Henley in the other
place on the circulation of the draft ACAS code. He was concerned that
the other place was furnished with a copy of the draft code only on the
morning that it was to be
debated.</div><a name="08101450000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the importance of the new code and the fact that it forms much of the
core of the Bill, I would be grateful if the Minister enlightened the
Committee on the consultation process that was undertaken. I am aware
that the consultation was initiated and subsequently undertaken by
ACAS. I would be grateful if the Minister answered the following
questions on the consultation process. What format did the process take
and which organisations were contacted? What responses were received
and will the House have the opportunity to see
them?</div><a name="08101450000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
shorter, more concise code is to be welcomed. I know that most
employers will welcome the emphasis on informal dispute resolution, but
will the lack of guidance given by the principle-based approach
increase the workload of the employment tribunals? I hope not, but will
the Minster give his view? I thank him for sending through a finalised
version of the code&#151;I think that it arrived last Friday. He will
appreciate that we have had a short time to review it, and we will need
to seek people&#146;s views and possibly come back to him at a later
stage.</div>
<a name="08101450000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having looked
through the code, I would like the following points, on the
code&#146;s paragraphs, to be addressed. The advice at point 5 of the
original draft code issued by ACAS
stated:</div><a name="08101450000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Employers
and employees should do all that they can to resolve disciplinary and
grievance issues in the workplace. Recourse to an employment tribunal
should only be a last
resort.&#148;</div><a name="08101450000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
has that express and clear statement been removed? Point 8
states:</div><a name="08101450000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
cases where a period of suspension with pay is considered
necessary&#148;.</div><a name="08101450000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
employment lawyers have been saying that there is a need to clarify
that, given the number of possible reasons for those cases. Is there a
need to specify the situations where it is needed? In point 13, the
phrase &#147;workers&#148; is used in the body of the section, yet
the title states &#147;employees&#148;. We need consistency,
especially as the words may convey different ideas and roles. In point
20, should &#147;further misconduct&#148; not become &#147;any
misconduct&#148;, thus removing any impression that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>subsequent misconduct needs to be associated with the former? It would
also ensure that minor misconduct does not slip through the net. After
point 33, should powers to investigate the reported grievance and then
to discuss it with the employee not be included? The manager should be
able to undertake an informal fact-finding procedure before formal
proceedings are
initiated.</div><a name="08101450000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
prevents employment tribunals and courts from seeing the code as
statutory again, and how will the Government avoid that? Does ACAS see
it as an organic code that will be reviewed and changed as needs be? If
so, how frequently is it intending to review the code? How much
discretion will employment tribunals have with regard to those who
follow the spirit rather than the letter of the code, especially small
businesses that may lack the human resources capability of others? How
do the Government propose to make small businesses aware of the new
code? That action is very important in
itself.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000382"></a>John
Hemming:</b> All parties are in agreement with the
Bill&#146;s direction, which is towards clarity and ensuring that
issues are resolved at an early stage with the least
formality&#151;although one does need formality at a certain point,
so that people know that there is a formal grievance. I ask the
Minister to recognise that there are different ways of achieving that
clarity and informality. It is when one gets the whole package,
including any departmental guidance, that one has what people have to
face. Even if it is not specified in the Bill, departmental guidance
that clarifies which code of practice to follow in which circumstance
is important. It is straightforward for a smaller business to look it
up and not to have to bring in legal advisers, even if some
organisations provide legal support. Clarity and simplicity are the
order of the
day.</div><a name="08101450000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000383"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is right that we consider clause 3 in the
round, and the ACAS code in particular. The code is an important part
of the system, which will replace the 2004 procedures abolished by
clause 1. It is more principles-based than some previous ACAS codes,
because we have had an important dialogue with business and employee
representatives. Some respondents have said that they do not want a
lengthy procedural handbook that they have to cover, but that they want
to know in broad terms what they have to do to be
fair.</div><a name="08101450000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked whether tribunals have discretion in
this area. They do and that is one of the changes that we are making
from the 2004 procedures, where the elevation of procedures was more
automatic. The ACAS code that we have proposed is more
principles-based. The draft code has been circulated. It will allow
tribunals greater discretion in the varying of
awards.</div><a name="08101450000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000384"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Minister clearly recognises that vexatious
cases can be a problem. He points to a strengthening of the code. My
experience is that often, ACAS, and its code, have shied away from the
issue of vexatious cases in reality because it is fearful of being
labelled anti-employee or anti-employer. That is a real concern. Will
the Minister take that into account and genuinely consider
strengthening the code and the conciliation that follows in this
respect? That would take away much of the concern that small businesses
have about this
matter.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="08101450000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08101450000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000385"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about the
fear small businesses have of vexatious claims. The changes that we are
making will help in that regard. Part of the problem with the 2004
procedures was that they often placed the claimant&#151;if I may put
it like that&#151;on a fast track to tribunal, without going through
the kind of conciliation that could have solved the problem outside of
a tribunal. Later, we will consider ACAS and time limits on
intervention, which is another relevant issue. The system that the Bill
creates places greater emphasis on pre-claim conciliation. ACAS will
have more money to do that through the extra funding, and an expanded
helpline will help with that. We will go a long way towards meeting the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s legitimate
point.</div><a name="08101450000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the questions that the hon. Member for Huntingdon asked about
the code. The consultation on the code was with ACAS&#146;s usual
stakeholders&#151;not a term I always like, but I use it for want of
a better one. They include the business organisations, some of which
have been represented here, the trade unions and others in this field.
I understand that about 170 responses were received during the
consultation on the code. ACAS has a balance to strike because some
people&#146;s responses will be that they want the code to cover
everything&#151;to mention this, that and so on&#151;and others
will be that they want less and less in the code. I think that ACAS is
right to go for a principles-based code because we are trying to reach
an end product that can be read and dealt with by businesses of all
sorts and sizes. We are talking about busy people so it is correct to
have something that is short, concise and principles
based.</div><a name="08101450000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
publication of consultation responses is a matter for ACAS. The normal
practice is that consultation responses are made available unless the
person who submitted the response requests
otherwise.</div><a name="08101450000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the code set in stone for ever? No, ACAS may revisit it. However, we
have spoken of the virtue of clarity. When the code is settled, laid
before Parliament and approved, I do not think that we will want ACAS
to revisit it any more than necessary. In that way, businesses and
employees will know what is involved and what is required of
them.</div><a name="08101450000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked various other questions, for example, whether the
size and resources of business could be taken into account. Yes, they
can. He also mentioned the worker-employee distinction. That
distinction is recognised in law, and the terms are used precisely. The
hon. Gentleman will be aware&#151;this is not a debate for this
Bill&#151;that the employment rights and the obligations attached to
a worker are different from those attached to an employee, and that
distinction exists in
law.</div><a name="08101450000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new code is more principles based, and tribunals, employees and
employers are asked to have regard to it. It also contains a
discretionary power for tribunals to take into account such regard when
assessing awards, and to adjust awards by up to 25 per cent. if either
party has acted unreasonably in failing to comply with the code. I
emphasise that the power is discretionary; it is for employment judges
to apply depending on the case, without the rigidity of the previous
automatic link to the statutory procedures that we discussed earlier.
As we discussed in relation to the amendment that I
moved,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>proposed new schedule A2 lists the enactments that apply to the clause
and to the power to vary awards. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="08101450000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000386"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000389"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This is a probing amendment, to open up this
important clause to wider discussion and perhaps
clarification.</div><a name="08101450000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Michael
Gibbons&#146;s 2007 report &#147;Better Dispute Resolution: A
review of employment dispute resolution in Great Britain&#148;
recommended that some cases before the tribunal should be dealt with by
a fast-track procedure. His emphasis was on the settlement of monetary
disputes on issues such as wages, redundancy and holidays, as the legal
points at issue were simple and would be resolved more quickly by
expert determination. However, in the debate in the other place the
matter got confused, and it is necessary to make it clear when a full
tribunal hearing is required and when a fast-track individual hearing
is appropriate. Specifically, there seemed to be confusion in the other
place about whether the Government intended the process to apply solely
to monetary
claims.</div><a name="08101450000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
balance that must be struck is between comprehensiveness, fairness and
cost. The aim of an abbreviated fast-track process must be to deal
quickly and fairly with those cases that do not need a full tribunal. I
support proposals for a system that, in the words of the Minister in
the other
place,</div><a name="08101450000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
deliver swift and effective justice and help many claimants to receive
redress early, potentially relieving them from hardship and
uncertainty&#148;.</div><a name="08101450000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister went
on:</div><a name="08101450000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Respondents
will also benefit from having cases determined at an early stage,
freeing them to concentrate on their

February 2008; Vol. 698, c.
487.]</div><a name="08101450000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
all well and good, but care must be taken not to place an individual in
a weaker position for the sake of expediency. We need to limit the role
of single-member tribunals to dealing with those cases that are so
clear-cut as to be almost procedural. There is something worrying about
limiting a claimant&#146;s right to a review by a full panel in all
but the most simple and incontestable cases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="08101450000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
introduce a written consent process, as envisaged by proposed new
subsection (3AA) to section 7 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996,
provision must be made to ensure that that cannot be abused. I am
especially concerned about the role of deemed consent to a
single-person tribunal. To that end, I would be grateful if the
Minister could make clear to the Committee the limits of the proposed
new subsection: the claims to which the fast-track process would apply,
and what form consent in writing to a single-member tribunal would
take.</div><a name="08101450000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000390"></a>John
Hemming:</b> This comes down to the good old article 6
question of whether people are having a fair hearing. The bigger issue
that needs clarification is proposed new subsection (3AB). Logically,
if both parties agree that there should not be a hearing, there will
not be one. That is entirely fair. There is a point about fast track.
If we aim to resolve things prior to tribunal in the conciliation
process, one would hope that there was a fast track in initial
determinations to suggest such a resolution.</div>
<a name="08101450000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see no
reason why the word &#147;only&#148; should disappear, although it
seems otiose in the circumstances, as the tribunal would have to be
given a power to determine something without a hearing. Therefore if it
does not have that power, it will not be able to determine it without a
hearing. That should be limited. The circumstances are reasonable, but
some clarity is needed under proposed new subsection (3AB) because
employers who feel that they have responded and are then told that
their response does not count would have a real problem. Perhaps the
Government should considering tabling an amendment on
Report.</div><a name="08101450000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000391"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I should like to say how
much I look forward to serving under your chairmanship, Mr.
Bercow. I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Huntingdon,
but the amendment does not seem to address the key issue. If there is
mutual consent or if one side has not bothered to put in a substantive
case, it seems obvious that the matter should be fast-tracked, entirely
independently of whether it is a money issue or something else. I take
the point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley: we need to
be clear about the exact meaning of proposed new subsection (3AB)
because there should not be any doubt. We have sufficient trust in the
tribunal system to believe that a reasonably adequate request for a
hearing would not be dismissed purely on frivolous procedural
grounds.</div>
<a name="08101450000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000392"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is
particularly important to indicate to a respondent that their response
has not been accepted and that they could submit an alternative before
any written
determination?</div><a name="08101450000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000393"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> That sounds reasonable to
me.</div><a name="08101450000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000394"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Indeed. The point has been made about how an
employer as a respondent has the opportunity to make his case. I ask
the Minister to look at the current procedural rules more generally.
Perhaps I can give him a short example of a local case that came 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>to my notice. The employer did not receive the notice in time, or so he
claimed. He sent something in slightly late&#151;two days after the
final date. The rules currently say that he cannot be heard. The only
option was to go through the whole process with him sitting there
watching, but not taking part, and then subsequently appealing to the
AT to see whether there was another way. I do not know what happened as
a result of all that. But the draconian nature of the current rules,
which debar people from taking any part in proceedings, is unlike any
other jurisdiction. In every other part of the legal system, so far as
I am aware, by incurring a penalty or making a payment to the court or
whatever, there is a way back into the proceedings. Uniquely within the
tribunal rules, that does not apply. I ask the Minister to have a look
at that if he agrees that it is an
injustice.</div><a name="08101450000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000395"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause was indeed the subject of
considerable debate in the other place. That is understandable, because
it deals with a traditional part of the tribunal process, and perhaps
people are led to expect a full hearing with the tribunal chair and two
lay members&#151;or wing members as they are sometimes known. The
question posed is whether that is always necessary in all jurisdictions
and in all cases. Earlier we discussed faster and perhaps less costly
mechanisms for resolving disputes, which is really what the clause is
concerned with. The question at the heart of amendment No. 17 is:
&#147;If we are to have a system of written determinations or
determinations without a hearing, what jurisdictions should that
cover?&#148;</div>
<a name="08101450000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08101450000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first point to make is that tribunal chairmen can already sit alone and
deal with certain jurisdictions, so that is not new. I have written
several times to hon. Members who have asked what jurisdictions I have
in mind. They are largely, but not entirely, the same as those
jurisdictions in which a tribunal chair can already sit
alone&#151;unlawful wage deductions, breach of contract, redundancy
pay, holiday pay and minimum wage cases. The only difference is the
addition of holiday pay.</div>
<a name="08101450000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
type of case to which we are referring, and the question at the heart
of the amendment is how we define that in the Bill. Our intention, if
introducing such a procedure, is to define in secondary legislation
those jurisdictions to which it would apply. Were such a system to be
introduced and prove successful, those jurisdictions might or might not
change over time in the light of experience. The Government&#146;s
view is that it makes more sense to specify the jurisdictions and the
type of cases to which the procedure would apply in secondary
legislation. Also, the regulations and rules would be laid before
Parliament, which would allow us greater flexibility to amend the
jurisdictions in the light of experience while of course retaining
proper parliamentary oversight. That is a judgment about what needs to
be on the face of the Bill, and it is how we intend to
proceed.</div><a name="08101450000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley asked about proposed new subsection
(3AB). The secondary legislation consultation looked at default
judgments and how parties might have a way back into proceedings, a
point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye also
referred. We are currently considering the responses to that and will
announce any changes we might make in due course.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="08101450000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
I believe that the type of jurisdiction is best defined in secondary
legislation. That would allow us the flexibility to make adjustments in
the light of experience if
necessary.</div><a name="08101450000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000396"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for his clarification on
the areas to which the clause is likely to apply. He said that that
would be finalised in secondary legislation. I will go away and think
about whether items of such importance merit being put on the face of
the Bill, rather than going through secondary legislation, and I might
well come back to that at a later stage. I take the point made by the
hon. Member for Broxtowe that the amendment only loosely makes the
point that I intended to make, but I raised it on a probing basis
because I thought it was important that we had a debate about the
fairness of the procedures whereby someone would effectively give up
their rights. I think that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye and, to
an extent, the Minister recognised that. I am pleased that we have had
the debate and will think a little further on it. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
5</h4><a name="08101470000001"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Conciliation
before bringing of
proceedings</div><a name="08101450000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08101450000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000397"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Clause 5 brings us on to the duties and powers
of ACAS. At present, ACAS has a duty&#151;I stress that word,
&#147;duty&#148;&#151;in certain circumstances to conciliate in
cases where no claim has been presented. The effect of the clause will
be to change that duty to a power.</div>
<a name="08101450000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful to explain the context of this change, which is an important
underpinning element of our package of changes to the dispute
resolution system. As we have heard throughout this morning, ACAS has a
good record of achieving settlement in the period after a claim is made
to an employment tribunal but before the process of the tribunal
hearing. Currently, it also has a duty to offer conciliation in certain
cases that are capable of becoming the subject of an employment
tribunal claim where both parties request it, or where one party makes
a request and the conciliation officer judges that there is a good
prospect of
success.</div><a name="08101450000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
duty is not new; it has been on the statute book since the 1970s.
However, during the 1980s in particular ACAS found that some employers
were using this pre-claim conciliation duty simply to obtain an ACAS
settlement, as the basis for a legally-binding agreement to underpin
severance arrangements that had already been agreed without the
involvement of ACAS. Also, the nature of the duty on ACAS to provide
conciliation was such that it could lead to ACAS being asked to assist
with cases that were never likely to become the subject of an
employment tribunal claim, at the taxpayer&#146;s expense. That was
not the intention of the duty.</div>
<a name="08101450000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response,
the ACAS council decided that conciliators should interpret the duty
strictly in the spirit that was intended, so that the pre-claim
conciliation service would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>be focused on cases that were otherwise more or less certain to become
the subject of a tribunal claim. In turn, that had the consequence that
ACAS steered away from actively promoting this service, even though it
could be valuable. The number of pre-claim conciliations carried out
since has been small; it has run at around 1,000 a year in recent
years, making up less than 2 per cent. of the conciliation activity of
ACAS.</div>
<a name="08101450000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government see clear benefits in making the conciliation services of
ACAS more widely available in disputes that have not yet reached the
stage of a tribunal claim but are likely to do so; making that change
is an integral part of these reforms. If a dispute can be resolved
before the parties set out their positions in a formal and legal way,
that can save considerable time and costs for all concerned. A total of
85 per cent. of respondents to the consultation following the Gibbons
review supported the proposal that ACAS should be given additional
resources to provide such services.</div>
<a name="08101450000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already referred to the additional resources that the Government
are making available to ACAS in order to achieve that aim. Those
resources are considerable. However, we also think that it is
appropriate to give ACAS the power to target properly pre-claim
conciliation on those cases where it thinks that it can make the most
difference and be the most valuable. That is really the purpose of the
clause.</div>
<a name="08101450000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will then
be open to the parties in such cases to decide whether to use the
service. Regardless of whether the parties take advantage of this
pre-claim conciliation, if the dispute subsequently turns into a
tribunal claim they will still have access to ACAS conciliation
services in the post-claim period, in the usual
way.</div><a name="08101450000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short, we are trying to ensure that ACAS is able to manage effectively
the new case load that we wish it to take on, without having to
restrict the use of its services unduly and without having to transfer
resources from other parts of its operation into an area where it has a
duty to respond to every request. So we want more pre-claim
conciliation; we have given ACAS more resources to achieve that, and we
also want to give ACAS the power to use its discretion to apply those
resources where they would be best used. That is the purpose of the
clause.</div><a name="08101450000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000398"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with encouraging conciliation.
I am happy to say that we agree with the thrust of these proposals. In
the other place, there was significant debate on the relative merits of
conciliation and mediation. Perhaps that was because many mediators
were involved in that debate. I am not a mediator. I have since heard
in a roundabout way that ACAS is generally not keen on mediation as a
form of dispute resolution. There are certainly some circumstances in
which mediation is a better way of moving forward than conciliation.
Does the Minister agree with the claim that I have heard that ACAS
steers clear of mediation when it should sometimes go in that
direction? What is the Government&#146;s attitude to mediation? If he
thinks that there are situations where mediation would be more
appropriate, how does he intend to promote
it?</div><a name="08101450000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000399"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Mediation is a perfectly fair and appropriate
part of the armoury. I have not heard under the wire or on the
grapevine that ACAS is somehow 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>reluctant to engage in mediation or is hostile to it. The question that
has been in ACAS&#146;s mind is the one that I raised in my opening
remarks on the clause. It has a duty to carry out pre-claim
conciliation, but it has no capacity to target that where it can be
most effective. Therefore, that service and duty are not promoted. That
situation ends up where we do not want to be, which is with less
pre-claim conciliation than we would like to
see.</div><a name="08101450000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will free up ACAS and, at the same time, give it more resources.
In clauses 1 to 7 we are attempting to create a system that provides
the maximum chance for disputes to be resolved before they get to the
door of the
tribunal.</div><a name="08101450000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000400"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Accepting what the Minister says, there is the
facility to encourage people to follow the code of practice and adhere
to proposals from conciliation. People must try to reach an agreement
and will find themselves in a procedural anomaly if they fail to adhere
to that agreement. Therefore, there will be the 25 per cent.
penalty. Is that the Government&#146;s
intention?</div><a name="08101450000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000401"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The Government&#146;s intention is to
encourage people to settle disputes outside the workplace. The code
offers certain help in doing that by setting out procedures to be
followed. As the introduction to the code says, dealing with these
things informally can often help. That is a direction that we want to
go in. Of course, we always have to balance that with the right of
access to a tribunal. That touches on some of the amendments that we
will discuss
later.</div><a name="08101450000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000402"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I made a blunder in my question to the Minister.
Would the Government consider saying in the code of conduct that if the
conciliator suggests a figure and the employer or employee does not
adhere to it, but does not get substantially more or less, there will
be a procedural penalty? That is often the case with other judicial
proceedings, although there are obviously no cost issues here. However,
if the conciliator says that something is worth &#163;10,000 and the
employment tribunal then says that it is worth only &#163;9,000,
could there be a procedural penalty for the employer or
employee?</div><a name="08101450000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000403"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am not sure whether that would constitute a
procedural penalty. I do not want to place myself in the shoes of the
tribunal chair. I have no doubt that tribunal chairs will look at such
matters, take into account efforts or proposals that have been made at
the conciliation phase and consider everything in the round. With this
clause, we want to maximise ACAS&#146;s effectiveness by giving it
the discretionary power to target its resources on the conciliation
cases where it can have most effect with the increased budget that has
been provided by the
Government.</div><a name="08101450000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
6</h4><a name="08101450000009"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Conciliation

<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="08101450000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000404"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Clause 6 is important because it refers to time
limits. The laudable intention of the procedures set out in 2004 was
that, in order to focus minds on settling early, there would be time
limits on ACAS&#146;s ability to offer its services. In practice,
minds are often not concentrated until much closer to the tribunal
hearing, by which time ACAS cannot offer its services because it is
beyond the time limits. Therefore, the clause will remove the time
limits on ACAS&#146;s duty to offer conciliation in cases once they
have been presented to the employment tribunal. That will mean that
ACAS&#146;s services will be available for both sides right up until
the moment the tribunal hearing takes place. We feel that that can be
of benefit to both employees and employers.</div>
<a name="08101450000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I never
forget that the context for all of this is the significant estimated
reduction of up to &#163;170 million in costs for business because of
the Bill&#146;s measures that will reform dispute resolution. Part of
that is because the Government, rather than having businesses spend all
of that money in tribunals, have increased the resources for ACAS and
removed the time limits so that it can offer its services in a much
greater part of the
process.</div><a name="08101450000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
2004 the duty to conciliate has been subject to time limits of either
seven or 13 weeks, depending on the jurisdiction concerned. ACAS
retains the discretionary power to provide conciliation after those
prescribed periods have expired, but under the clause, those time
limits will be removed and ACAS will be able to offer its services in
that much-expanded way. Gibbons found that the time limits had not
achieved their desired intention and that parties were still realising
close to the hearing day that they wished to settle but found that an
ACAS conciliation was no longer available. Over 70 per cent. of
respondents to the consultation agreed that those restrictions on the
availability of ACAS conciliations should be removed. The Government
agree, so the clause will repeal the relevant provisions and, like
clause 5, is part of our effort to make ACAS even more effective in the
future than it has been in the
past.</div><a name="08101450000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000405"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> I certainly would like to support the
clause, because the time limits have been an impediment to settlement.
The nature of industrial tribunal cases is that people do not
concentrate their minds until the last moment, even when orders for
directions are made. That is how people work, and perhaps we work like
that sometimes. It is certainly the case between employers and
employees and their representatives. Frequently the strength of the
case is not known until statements have been interchanged as a result
of an order for directions or something of that nature. If all the
facts are on the table quite late in the proceedings, perhaps ACAS can
play its greatest role at that point.</div>
<a name="08101450000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that some costs might be involved in reaching that stage that could
have been dealt with earlier if ACAS had had an earlier intervention,
so I hope that it will not abandon the possibility of early resolution
because it has a longer period in which to do it. ACAS, too, might be
subject to the ability to leave things until the last minute, which
would be a detriment. If it can go in early and be there late, that
would have a great
effect.</div><a name="08101450000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000406"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We welcome the removal of the time limits and
the resulting expanded and more adaptable service that ACAS can
deliver.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000407"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I want to say a brief word about this final
clause dealing with dispute resolution. It inserts a new provision into
the Employment Rights Act 1996 to empower employment tribunals to order
employers to compensate workers for the full financial loss they have
sustained as a result of unlawful deductions from wages, including
failure to pay the national minimum wage, and non-payment of redundancy
awards.</div><a name="08101450000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the moment we should put ourselves in the shoes of a worker entitled to
the national minimum wage who does not receive it. We all have
constituents who may be in that position and we have some understanding
of just how difficult it is for someone in that position to make ends
meet. The denial, contrary to the law, of perhaps a couple of hundred
pounds, is something that we could probably all deal with. It would not
make us become overdrawn, but to those on the minimum wage it can make
the difference between just getting by or ending up in real trouble.
That is what this clause is
about.</div><a name="08101450000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone incurs bank charges for going into overdraft as a result of
such an unlawful non-payment, the clause would be available to the
tribunal to help compensate for that. I stress that it is as a direct
result of the non-payment and it is drawn tightly, but it is
recognition that financial loss can result from things like unlawful
deductions from wages or non-payment of redundancy
awards.</div><a name="08101450000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000408"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> This all looks very well on paper as we debate it
here, but what is the application of this in reality, particularly for
casual workers from eastern Europe who are subject to gangmasters? How
can this be enforced in that
respect?</div><a name="08101450000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000409"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is enforced by the tribunal. We will discuss
migrant workers and the gangmasters, agencies and so on in the
following clauses, but if I continue I may be able to enlighten the
hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08101450000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employment
tribunals already have powers to extend awards to full financial loss
arising out of claims for holiday pay and breach of contract. The
clause will allow workers to bring a combined tribunal claim covering
both breaches of the law in all these areas, and claims for
compensation for financial loss arising from such breaches. At the
moment, workers can obtain the compensation in the claims covered by
the clause only via a separate claim to the civil courts. The clause
will remove the need for claimants to make a separate claim. It is also
designed to encourage employers to make the correct payments in the
first place.</div>
<a name="08101450000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The payments
that an employment tribunal may currently order the employer to pay or
repay under these circumstances are limited to the amount arising from
the employer&#146;s direct liability. This means that financial
losses incurred by a claimant, which are over and above 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>the amount owed but which can be attributed to the non-payment, can be
pursued only through the civil courts. Such losses might include, for
example, charges incurred if a direct debit has failed or punitive
interest on bank accounts that go into the
red.</div><a name="08101450000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will refer later to the work of the Government&#146;s vulnerable
worker enforcement forum, which I have chaired over the past year. One
of the issues raised time and time again in that forum is just how
marginal the existence of some workers is. Such workers are dependent
on timely and correct payments, so it is absolutely right that
financial loss, which occurs as a result of them not receiving those
payments can be taken into account by the
tribunal.</div>
<a name="08101450000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000410"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): May I welcome you to the chair,
Mr. Bercow? May I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on
his well deserved elevation? We welcome the clause, but we have
expressed concerns about how financial compensation should be
calculated, particularly interest on the total outstanding amount. It
is welcome to hear the Minister talk about bank charges incurred as a
result of not paying moneys in a timely way, but how feasible will it
be for a tribunal to calculate the award? He rightly points out that
many of those affected will not have been paid even the national
minimum wage. Using bank charges to give fair restitution to employees
might not help a considerable number of those affected. My hon. Friend
the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) has previously raised the
issue of using interest charges. Where it is not possible to get an
idea of bank charges&#151;perhaps if the relevant person does not
even have a basic bank account&#151;could a similar interest charge
payment be used to ensure that there is fair
restitution?</div><a name="08101450000208"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000411"></a>Barry
Gardiner:</b> I wish to speak about this because we are all
considering the issues of people who might be facing unemployment and
redundancy, and the measure is extremely relevant in the current
financial situation. It is abhorrent that someone should seek to avoid
paying legitimate redundancy payments to any employee. In such a
situation, the failure to pay appropriate redundancy moneys can be the
sort of financial interruption that leads ultimately to someone
defaulting on their mortgage, thus leading to foreclosure and a
dramatic effect on their whole life. Even if such a person could get
back into employment within three or four months, the non-payment of
redundancy moneys might precipitate the loss of a family home. I am
delighted that the clause puts in place appropriate compensation for
people who have suffered financial loss as a result of such events. It
should be welcomed by both sides of the Committee, and I congratulate
the Government on introducing
it.</div><a name="08101450000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000412"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me begin by acknowledging the comments of my
hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North. He is absolutely right that
the clause is timely&#151;more so than in recent years, given some of
the problems that our constituents face.</div>
<a name="08101450000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Solihull is right that the hon. Member for Brent, East
raised the issue of interest on Second Reading. However, if my memory
serves me correctly, and it may not, she was talking about minimum 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>wage arrears, which we will deal with shortly, in clause 8. As for the
question of how someone would prove that losses are directly related to
the non-payment, the provision is not new. It already applies to
holiday pay, so tribunals are used to it. We are simply extending it. I
should like to point out the key phrase in the clause. Subsections
(7)(1) and (2), propose a new subsection (2) in section 24, and a new
subsection (5) in section 163, of the Employment Rights Act 1996. The
last line of new subsection (5) will
read</div><a name="08101450000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
compensate the worker for any financial loss sustained by him which is
attributable to the non-payment of the redundancy
payment&#148;.</div>
<a name="08101450000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It must be directly
attributable and, of course, there must be evidence, but that is for
the chairmen of tribunals to judge. We are extending provisions for
holiday pay to other matters, in recognition of the fact someone who is
unlawfully denied money, and who is dependent on every pound of their
wages, could incur other charges through no fault of their own, as well
as lose their
wage.</div><a name="08101450000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000413"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Will there be an appeal system and, if so, how will
it work? If someone is made redundant and does not receive the proper
compensation to which the tribunal says they are entitled, they could
default, for instance, on child support payments. People with a tight
budget could have other commitments, such as standing orders, mortgages
or whatever, but they could choose not to pay to maintain the Child
Support Agency payments. The plaintiff could argue that they were
unable to maintain their child support payments because of a reduction
in the amount of money to which they were entitled, but they could at
the same time maintain payments on white goods or mortgages. Who will
adjudicate on whether someone has found a clever way around a
commitment or whether it is a genuine entitlement to the
plaintiff?</div><a name="08101450000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000414"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second
question is that the tribunal chairman or members would adjudicate. On
the first question, all tribunals have an appeal mechanism to the
Employment Appeal Tribunal. It tends to judge appeals on points of law
rather than reconsider a whole case, but there is an appeal process in
tribunals.</div><a name="08101450000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000415"></a>Barry
Gardiner:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that in relation to
the financial loss that has been incurred, the tribunal will look not
at what has resulted from the loss&#151;the non-payment of one bill
rather than another or the reallocation of funds&#151;but whether
there has been a directly attributable financial loss? Therefore, the
points made by the hon. Member for East Devon are not relevant to the
clause.</div><a name="08101450000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000416"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000417"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We now come to the provisions that deal with the
minimum wage, which are important. We touched on the minimum wage when
discussing clause 7, and clause 8 deals with minimum wage
arrears.</div>
<a name="08101450000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful to the Committee if I set out the difference between how
arrears are dealt with now and how we intend to deal with them in
future under the provisions in clause 8. Let us consider the case of a
mythical minimum wage worker who finds that they have been paid less
than the minimum wage over a period of two or three years. As hon.
Members will know, the Low Pay Commission recommends the rate of the
minimum wage and, since its inception, it has increased year on year.
My <i class="I">Sunday Mirror</i> told me a couple of weeks ago that, if there is
a change of Government in future, that could change. It said that
senior Conservatives have said that the minimum wage will whither on
the vine. Ten years on, perhaps that was a revealing insight into
Conservative party thinking. It is certainly not how the Government
think. Under us, the minimum wage has increased both in line with
average earnings and in relation to prices.</div>
<a name="08101450000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000418"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Minister has made a rather serious allegation.
Will he provide us with the details of the people who said that? He
says that they were senior
Conservatives.</div><a name="08101450000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000419"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I think we began proceedings by saying that
written evidence would be put in front of the Committee. If the hon.
Gentleman wishes me to furnish him with a copy of the <i class="I">Sunday
Mirror</i>, I will be very obliged to do
so.</div><a name="08101450000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000420"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He has now put my
mind at rest by saying that it was in the <i class="I">Sunday Mirror</i>. That
makes it all
clear.</div><a name="08101450000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000421"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I will leave that
point.</div><a name="08101450000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, the minimum wage has tended to be uprated year on year on the
basis of recommendations from the independent Low Pay Commission.
Currently, workers who find themselves being underpaid and therefore
have minimum wage arrears discover that, when they report that and it
is found that they have been underpaid and are entitled to arrears,
they receive the minimum wage at the rate that was in operation at the
time of the underpayment. In other words, they get their back pay, but
lose out on the upratings that have taken place in the meantime. Such
underpayments serve as inadvertent and unintentional loans from
employees to employers. The clause will change
that.</div><a name="08101450000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Low Pay Commission has expressed concerns on this matter over the
years. It expressed particular concerns in its 2007 report. We
consulted on whether arrears could be calculated in a fair way, to take
account of the depreciation in value of those arrears as a result of
the uprating of the national minimum wage. The overwhelming majority of
respondents agreed with the aim of making 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>arrears fairer for workers in that way. The majority of those who
expressed an opinion were in favour of calculating arrears
by reference to the current rate of the minimum
wage.</div><a name="08101450000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this point I tread carefully, Mr. Bercow. I will attempt to
take the Committee through the equation on page 6 of the Bill under
clause 8. As hon. Members will see, the equation is A over R1,
multiplied by R2. A is the amount of money calculated to have been
underpaid to the worker, and R1 is the rate of the minimum wage at the
time of the underpayment. For example, if the underpayment happened
last year and the worker was underpaid for one hour, the &#163;5.52
that was earned would be divided by the rate at which the minimum wage
was paid, which was &#163;5.52 per hour. That calculation reaches a
time of precisely one hour. R2 is the current rate of the minimum wage.
The formula takes an amount that somebody has been paid at the minimum
wage and turns it into an amount of time in hours, based on the rate of
the minimum wage at that time. In order to ensure that the fair arrears
apply, that time is multiplied by the rate of the minimum wage at the
time the incident is reported or found out. In the case of our mythical
worker who was underpaid by &#163;5.52 last year, they would then
receive &#163;5.73 as the fair arrears. That is the rate of the
minimum wage since it was
uprated.</div><a name="08101450000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new method of calculating arrears is much fairer. Despite my poor
teaching skills it is relatively simple, in that the concept changes an
amount of money into an amount of time and multiplies that by the
current rate of the minimum wage. It secures a measure of justice for
workers who, as we agreed in discussion of clause 7, are often living
at the margin and certainly cannot afford to lose out by giving what
are, in effect, interest-free loans to their
employers.</div><a name="08101450000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000422"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Will it be the point at which the claim was
submitted, at which the judgment was awarded or at which an agreement
was reached that will determine the rate used? That is important,
because there could have been a change in the rate. In the unlikely
event that the commission should decide on a reduction in the minimum
wage&#151;or in the even less likely event that the Tories should get
in and reduce it, or do something of that order&#151;what would be
the safeguard that the formula would never result in a lesser sum?
Theoretically, at least, the formula could result in that
outcome.</div>
<a name="08101450000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000423"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The rate that would apply would be the one in
force at the time the judgment is given. My hon. Friend is right:
sometimes these things can take time to come to fruition. He asked what
would happen if the minimum wage were to fall. There will come a point
in the next couple of years when the voters can take that into account.
They have seen what was written in the <i class="I">Sunday
Mirror</i>&#151;there is a record to look at&#151;and that may be
part of their decision. The provisions ensure that if the minimum wage
were to fall, employers could not argue that they should pay back
arrears at the lower current rate. Clause 8 provides that the current
rate is used if it is higher than the rate that was in force when the
underpayment was
made.</div><a name="08101450000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000424"></a>John
Hemming:</b> The formula is a relatively complicated
sledgehammer to crack an important nut, but the nut needs to be
cracked. On the definition of the pay 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>reference period, would a claim over two or three years during which
there were several historic minimum wage rates require a number of
claims? If we follow the statute verbatim, whatever that may be,
mutatis mutandis, one may be forced to use only one historic rate, but
several historic rates would need to be taken into account to get the
right answer. Does the statute, when modified, achieve
that?</div><a name="08101450000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000425"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> No, I do not think that separate claims would be
required if someone were underpaid over three or four years. As I said,
in the equation on page 6, R1 is the rate at the time they were
underpaid. So if someone was underpaid for 10 hours&#146; work three
years ago and then for another 10 hours&#146; work two years ago,
each incident would be converted into a proportion of time, and all of
it would be multiplied by the current minimum wage rate. Separate
claims are not needed for each year. Simplicity is important. One of
the advantages of the minimum wage is that it is clear and simple to
understand.</div><a name="08101450000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Solihull about
interest. It was argued when we were consulting on fair arrears that
perhaps interest should be charged on top of the calculation that I
have set out. However, if we were to do that, workers would be required
to complete self-assessment returns for tax due on the additional
element of arrears, or interest. It is not sensible to put minimum wage
workers in the position of having to fill in a tax return for what
would be relatively small sums of interest when we can deal with the
heart of the problem through a simple, fair arrears calculation. This
is a highly legitimate issue to raise, and it has been of concern to
the Low Pay Commission. Through clause 8 we will ensure fair arrears
for people who are underpaid the minimum
wage.</div><a name="08101450000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a great deal of discussion this morning about various clauses.
This clause will be an important measure of justice for some of the
lowest paid people in the country, and I commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="08101450000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000426"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in
clause 10, page 13, line 30, after
&#145;them&#146;,
insert</div><a name="08101477000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;if copying
facilities are not available at that
place&#146;.</div><a name="08101450000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are still dealing with the national minimum wage and the parts of it
that deal with compliance. Let me say first that, despite whatever
appeared in the <i class="I">Sunday Mirror</i>, the position of the Conservative
party is that given our support for the national minimum wage, to the
extent that people want to break the law and not pay it, we are
concerned for the rights of the employees and  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>also for the rights of those employers who are not breaking the law and
who are put at a competitive disadvantage as a result.</div>
<a name="08101450000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concerns
about clause 5 and also about clause 11 fall into two different
categories. First, we are concerned whether the provisions are
proportionate in cases where civil liberties would be reduced as a
result of them. Secondly, we have a more practical issue: we need to
look slightly further to examine whether they will actually work and
improve the current failings in the system. The second set of concerns
is probably more suited to a stand part debate on clause 11, so we will
come back to it then. The amendment, which is a probing amendment, is
more closely related to the first category of concerns. It aims to
limit the right for compliance officers to remove documents to those
situations where it is the only practical way for them to continue
their investigation.</div>
<a name="08101450000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rule of
law in this country maintains that we are innocent until proven guilty.
To that end, compliance officers should not be able to infringe the
rights of employers to run their business unmolested by Government
agencies unless it is absolutely necessary. Given the expansion of
technology in offices in the last decade and the availability of
photocopiers, should officers not be encouraged, where practical, to
take copies of relevant documents rather that removing originals in a
way that might disrupt the running of the business? That is the nub of
the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was discussion in the other place of the need for these powers to
ensure full and effective enforcement of the national minimum wage
regulations. However, I must confess to having some scepticism about
that assertion. I would have thought that the copying of documents
should be the starting point and original documents should only be
removed from offices if all other avenues have
failed.</div><a name="08101450000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the possible significant disruptive effect of these powers, I would be
grateful if the Minister could provide us with some figures for the
number of occasions when the lack of copying facilities has prevented
an enforcement action. It is important that we weigh the right of the
business to operate unmolested by the state against the need for
effective enforcement.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000427"></a>Barry
Gardiner:</b><b class="B"> </b>I see the point of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks. Clearly, however, one could then get into a
situation in which the officers go in to copy documents, if that is
possible, but when they ask for use of the photocopier, there is
obstruction on the part of the employer, who says, &#147;No,
I&#146;m sorry, you&#146;re not going to use my
photocopier,&#148; or, &#147;I&#146;m going to charge you
&#163;1.20 a copy,&#148; or whatever.</div>
<a name="08101450000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that such
an amendment would do is put in place another obstacle that would
become a point of dispute between the officers and the employers. I
thought that the whole thrust of what the Committee wanted to do was to
simplify things and get certainty. In that sense, it is much better
that the powers should be as they currently appear in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101450000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000428"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but it is not in tune with the reality. In the past, I have been
involved in advising companies on the outcome of Office of Fair Trading
raids, for instance, and know that the impact of removing documents,
even if at an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>investigatory stage when no charges have been made, can be devastating
to a company&#146;s business. I am not claiming that there will not
be situations in which that will not be the correct way to go ahead. He
mentioned the example of companies making it difficult to get access to
the photocopier. If the company was making it difficult, the documents
should be taken away, but my concern in that regard is that the
starting point is that there should be as little disruption as
possible. I am not sure that the clause, as drafted, would ensure that
that is the case. We could improve the
drafting.</div>
<a name="08101450000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000429"></a>Barry
Gardiner:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that what he has
just said is not what his amendment says? His amendment would simply
insert</div><a name="08101450000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
copying facilities are not available at that
place&#148;.</div><a name="08101450000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
might be available at the place, but they might be charged for at an
exorbitant rate. Officers might be refused access to those copying
facilities. What his amendment proposes is not the reasonable point of
discussion that he has
made.</div><a name="08101450000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000430"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s assertion
that the drafting is not all that it could be, which is probably why I
announced it to be a probing amendment. I am making a point of
principle, because I think that this could be like using a
sledge-hammer to crack a
nut.</div><a name="08101450000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000431"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the clause
does not stipulate that officers are compelled to remove documents? If
copies are instantly made available at no cost, it is quite possible
that they could accept
those.</div><a name="08101450000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000432"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I accept that, but the reality is that if the
enforcing officers are given the powers, they will often use them. It
is incumbent on us, as legislators, to ensure that we minimise the
disruption.</div><a name="08101450000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000433"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Although we share the concerns of the hon. Member
for Brent, North about the drafting of the amendment, we want the Bill
to reflect the principle that people operating on behalf of the state
have the powers to do only what is necessary, rather than allowing them
to take any documents from anywhere. The principle is a good one, but
the drafting needs a bit of
work.</div><a name="08101450000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000434"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> May I refer to the reality of the situation when
the inspector calls? Hon. Members do not need me to remind them just
how many inspectors can call on small businesses&#151;VAT inspectors,
those looking at health and safety at work and a number of others
spring to mind. In many instances, they create in small businesses a
feeling of fear, and certainly great apprehension. We need to be very
careful about the power with which we endow inspectors, specifically
with regard to businesses run by members of our ethnic communities.
Often they are not fully versed in the English language and have a
sizable fear, brought with them from the culture of their countries, of
inspectors who call. That needs to be taken into account much more in
this respect.</div>
<a name="08101450000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording
of the clause is imperfect. There is a vagary about the term
&#147;copy records&#148;, about which the Minister might like to
reassure us. I know that the term
</div><a name="08101450000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;records
must be returned as soon as reasonably practicable&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="08101450000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a legal phrase, but
it is as lose a legal phrase as one can get. The Minister and I both
know that sometimes the arm of bureaucracy is used to instil fear and
apprehension. That concerns me enormously.</div>
<a name="08101450000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. What concerns the hon. Gentleman is
naturally a concern to many people, but I gently say to him that the
sentiments he is expressing relate to the clause and therefore
potentially, if there is to be one, to the clause stand part debate.
Sadly, his comments do not relate to the amendment. On that basis, I
feel confident that he is about to draw his remarks to a
close.</div><a name="08101450000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000436"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> You are absolutely right, Mr. Bercow,
to bring me to the matter that I really want to talk about, which is
the amendment itself, but you will appreciate that I had to create the
colour first.</div>
<a name="08101450000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The truth of
the matter is that we should do everything possible to ensure that
inspectors do not remove documents that small business men might need
to work on once the apprehension is planted in their minds that they
could well face a bureaucratic&#151;indeed, legal&#151;problem. The
return of those documents as soon as is reasonably practicable leaves
open a problematic issue that we need to attend to with more
certainty.</div><a name="08101450000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support the amendment because if it is practically possible to copy
documents, it should be right and proper to do so. However, equally, I
want the Minister to take account&#151;I will refer to this matter in
the stand part debate&#151;of the looseness of the wording in that
respect. For those reasons, I support the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000437"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Given what you have just said, Mr.
Bercow, I am wary of setting out any context for my response. However,
the context is important because we are not dealing with a new law; we
are dealing with something that has been in place for 10 years and has
become a familiar part of the labour market. Clauses 9 to 12 all relate
to stronger enforcement of the minimum wage and context is important
because we have 10 years of experience of how it operates. Most
employers are perfectly willing to pay the minimum wage and treat their
workers completely fairly, and when we discuss the policing and rules
around those who do not, it is important to acknowledge that.</div>
<a name="08101450000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northampton, South referred to when the inspector calls.
Sometimes minimum wage enforcement is criticised from the different
direction of the inspector not calling enough&#151;people do say
that. It is important to make it clear to the Committee that the
inspectors work in two ways. One way is in direct response to reports
of non-payment of the minimum wage. That would be investigated and
inspectors may visit a premises and so on. The other way they work is
proactively on what we call risk-based inspection. We know that that is
more likely to take place in certain sectors than others and that
certain employers might have a track record in other areas. In a world
of finite resources, we target the resources we have as well as we
can.</div><a name="08101450000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the amendment, of course, given that most employers are decent people,
it will not be necessary to take records away. The current powers of
the officers, who enforce the minimum wage by requiring the employer to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>produce records for inspection and copying them on the employer&#146;s
premises, are sufficient in the vast majority of cases. However, if an
employer does not agree to the removal of such records, officers do not
have the right to remove them to make copies. I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Brent, North that the problem with the amendment
is that it makes the question about the existence of the photocopying
facilities the key point, when it is not. The key point is the
co-operation of the
employer.</div><a name="08101450000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101450000438"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that
in most companies that operate any sort of payroll facility, however
basic, it will most likely be done, and should be done, through a
computerised system in the interests of good record keeping? In the
event of copies being removed from premises, the employer is very
likely to have some form of copy or record available on a
computer.</div><a name="08101450000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000439"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Let us remember that
the penalty regime, which was dealt with in clause 9, has increased for
employers. A non-compliant employer who is underpaying will know that
they are liable for an earlier and bigger penalty than under the
current rules. The co-operation of the employer is key, not the
existence of photocopying facilities, because it is quite possible for
those to exist, but for the employer to say, &#147;Well, we have it,
but you can&#146;t use it.&#148; In those circumstances, we would
have delays and so
on.</div><a name="08101450000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman, who is a very decent and honourable man, quite rightly
raised the point about proportionality. The powers in clause 10 would
be used only in that small minority of cases where enforcement officers
cannot complete the review on the employer&#146;s premises and where
the employer refuses to allow them to remove the
records.</div><a name="08101450000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000440"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I thank the Minister for his remarks, and of
course I understand much of what he is saying. However, will he comment
on the line in the clause about how records should be
returned</div><a name="08101450000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
soon as reasonably
practicable&#148;?</div><a name="08101450000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that that is rightly part of the stand part debate, but will he
comment on that, if the Chairman allows him to? Timing is
important.</div><a name="08101450000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000441"></a>The

to comment in the clause stand part debate, which might

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000442"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I shall obey the Chairman&#146;s wise guidance
and perhaps return to that point during the debate on the
clause.</div>
<a name="08101450000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not feel
that amendment No. 15 would deal with the issue of the co-operation of
the employer. One of the things raised with us time and time again is
that we are dealing here with vulnerable workers who very often are
fearful of reporting. We are also dealing with a system where&#151;we
will discuss this in later clauses&#151;currently, without the
clauses that we are about to discuss, prosecution is often dependent on
the willingness of a vulnerable and often fearful worker to testify in
person. The provisions are all about enabling enforcement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>without always being dependent on such a worker coming forward. The
examination of the records, particularly in the context of whether an
employer is being obstructive, is a necessary part of that process,
which is why I do not agree with the amendment&#151;I am
afraid&#151;and hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
it.</div><a name="08101450000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000443"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister just said that we are dealing with
vulnerable workers. In some clauses, that is the case, but not in
clause 10, which deals with authorities raiding what might be
vulnerable companies. That is the issue with which we are dealing. We
have raised our concerns about the fact that in some situations the
authorities might not give adequate thought to the needs of the ongoing
business of the company from which they are taking documents, probably
in some kind of raid. I have heard the Minister try to explain why that
is necessary, and I accept that the wording of the amendment is not
perfect, which is why I shall not press it to a vote now. However, we
will reconsider that point, and in the stand part debate I shall
address related
circumstances.</div><a name="08101450000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000444"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that he advised companies
on dealing with the consequences of DTI raids. Presumably he would have
talked to them about their risk management. Did he ever come across any
companies that only had a single copy of their records? If so, would he
have advised them of the risk they were taking in the event of a fire,
flood or some such accident where those records got
lost?</div><a name="08101450000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000445"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> First, the answer to your question is probably
yes.</div><a name="08101450000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000446"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I did not ask any
question.</div><a name="08101450000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000447"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The answer to the hon. Lady&#146;s question is
probably yes. The largest companies often do not keep multiple copies
of their records. More importantly, it is the smaller companies who
probably would not be able to afford legal advice or would not even
think of going for legal advice in relation to what they should have in
the event of authorities raiding them. Those smaller companies are the
companies that are most likely to be negatively affected by these
provisions. Small companies often do not have the resources to take
multiple copies of documents. They are surviving hand to mouth and
perhaps may do their paperwork every quarter when they have to do their
VAT return or whatever. That is the reality of small businesses. We
still maintain that, as drafted, the clause could be a sledgehammer to
crack a
nut.</div><a name="08101450000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000448"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I do not want to prolong this any more than is
necessary, but I want to take issue with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comment at the opening of his remarks that the clause was not dealing
with a situation involving vulnerable workers. It most certainly is. We
may have a situation, as sometimes we do, where vulnerable workers are
fearful of reporting the non-payment of the minimum wage and
prosecutions that would otherwise take place cannot take place because
we have not given the inspectors the necessary powers to enforce the
law. That most certainly involves vulnerable workers. In all the
clauses relating to the minimum wage we are most certainly dealing with
some of the most vulnerable workers in the
country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000449"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not accept that. I am not arguing against
enforcement. In fact, I am going to argue later that enforcement should
be improved. I am not arguing even that raids should not happen where
they are appropriate. I am simply saying that the clause as drafted
does not give enough leeway for the reality of the circumstances that
may exist for companies that are wholly innocent at the time they are
raided. The downside of that could be very significant. We have covered
the point. We will look at this again. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101450000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000450"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I just want to draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to one or two points in this clause. It relates to the
mechanism by which criminal offences under the National Minimum wage
Act 1998 can be tried. Criminal offences already exist under that Act
so this does not create new criminal offences, but it relates to the
overall strengthening of the penalty regime which we have just heard
that the Conservative party supports. The overwhelming majority of
cases of non-compliance with the minimum wage have been dealt with
under the civil law. That will continue to be the case under the new
regime proposed in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101450000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
national minimum wage is enforced under current arrangements by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. As I said, that is initiated
either by a complaint from workers or through risk assessment,
including targeted enforcement at low paying sectors. An HMRC
enforcement officer will visit the employer, interview the employer and
the workers, check the employer&#146;s national minimum wage records
and so on. The vast majority of cases are resolved with the employer
repaying arrears to workers who have been underpaid, which we have
discussed. It is only in cases in which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs cannot achieve payment of arrears to workers that the issue
and enforcement notice requiring the employer to repay the arrears
takes effect. Let me give the Committee some figures. In 2007-08, HMRC
investigated 4,500 cases. It found non-compliance in 1,649 cases. Of
those, 96 per cent. were settled without the need to issue an
enforcement notice and HMRC had to resort to the formal mechanism of
issuing notices in only a small number of
cases.</div><a name="08101450000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
9 changes the enforcement notice process. Following recommendations
from the Low Pay Commission, we also want to make changes in other
areas, too. I want to talk about the criminal sanctions that are
affected by the changes that we propose in clause 11. The National
Minimum Wage Act provides for a number of criminal
offences&#151;deliberately paying below the minimum wage, failing to
keep minimum wage records or keeping false records and obstructing
enforcement officers. Currently, such offences can be tried only in a
magistrates court in which the maximum fine is &#163;5,000. Criminal
conduct by employers is the exception rather than the rule.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div><a name="08101450000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
considering how we need to strengthen the enforcement regime with the
penalties under the civil law, we also considered whether the sanctions
for the criminal offences were sufficient. We concluded that in order
to ensure a balanced spectrum of enforcement, the potential fine
available to a criminal court when sentencing for an offence should be
greater than the maximum penalty that can be imposed by notice of
underpayment. Secondly, HMRC&#146;s investigative powers, which we
believe are necessary and are proposed in clause 12, could not be used
if the offences remained triable only as summary offences in the
magistrates courts. The clause is important on its own and in relation
to clause
12.</div><a name="08101450000286"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101450000451"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We only have a few minutes, but I will make a
start. There are some important principles in relation to this clause.
My main issue is to address whether these provisions dealing with the
level of penalty and mode of trial are going to fulfil their objective
of improving payment of the national minimum wage. The underpayment of
the national minimum wage is poor practice. It has a negative impact on
both employers and compliant companies, with the former being underpaid
and the latter being undercut. Further, those businesses that are
undercut are often small local businesses which bear the resulting
burden of unfair competition heavily. For this reason, we welcome the
Government&#146;s proposal to address the issue of enforcement of the
minimum wage, which comes on the back of recommendations of the Low Pay
Commission&#146;s report. However, I have recently had the
opportunity to review that report and I was surprised to read the
figures that it recorded for enforcement actions taken by HMRC. In the
period of 2006-07, it identified some 1,523 cases of non-compliance but
issued only 71 enforcement notices and two penalty notices. The total
value of underpayments was identified at some &#163;3 million, with
the average arrears per worker being &#163;214, as against a figure
of only &#163;130 for the previous year.</div>
<a name="08101450000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee is no doubt aware that under the National Minimum Wage Act,
provision is made for criminal prosecution under six offences that
relate to the payment of the minimum wage, the maximum penalty for
which is &#163;5,000. Those were not used for nine years until 2007
when two prosecutions were successfully made. One of them, a director
of a day nursery, was fined &#163;2,500 and ordered to pay costs of
&#163;500 for the offence of obstruction under section 31(5)(a) of
the Act. More recently, there have been two further prosecutions, most
notably, the case of a Sheffield butcher&#146;s shop, which was fined
&#163;800 plus costs and ordered to pay more than &#163;11,000 in
compensation to two previous employees. The payment of that fine was
due by 1 October. I would be interested to hear from the
Minister whether it has been paid. My point is that we must not wonder
why we are being asked to give HMRC more powers when those that it
currently has are being used so sparsely.</div>
