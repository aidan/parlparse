<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000310"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> I was in the middle of dealing with questions
about EU emissions trading scheme receipts asked by the hon. Member for
Wealden and had explained, somewhat to the dismay of certain members of
the Committee, that the problem was that we did not yet have a decision
from EUROSTAT&#151;the EU statistical agency&#151;on how EU ETS
receipts should be classified in the public finances. For that entirely
reasonable reason, we were not able to publish them in advance of such
a decision, but we had tried to provide some information. That has been
done&#151;the hon. Gentleman is aware of this&#151;by including the
receipts in other taxes and royalties in that line in the relevant
tables in Treasury publications. I understand why he considers that
unsatisfactory, and we have gone further to indicate the sorts of
moneys involved. Those moneys are put as public finances forecasts in
the Budget and pre-Budget report and are based on the likely number of
allowances and the secondary market price for
carbon.</div><a name="10011329000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman may or may not be aware that the 2009 pre-Budget report
noted that, to date, UK carbon auctions have raised more than
&#163;350 million and that future revenue was set to rise to about
&#163;2 billion in 2013-14. Those moneys are contained in
the Consolidated Fund, and as with other moneys, which are raised in a
variety of ways, they are, of course, used to fund the
Government&#146;s programmes. They therefore constitute public
finance. If we took the money from those sources, we would essentially
be using public money directly to fund the CCS projects, but our
preference is to put the obligation on electricity suppliers, paid for
by the suppliers in the form of a levy. I do not know whether the hon.
Gentleman seeks further clarification, but I assure him that that is as
much information as I can provide him
with.</div><a name="10011329000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000311"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I am very grateful to the
Minister; she has been genuinely seeking to be helpful. On the UK
carbon auctions to which she refers and the figure of &#163;2 billion
for 2013-14, it would be helpful if she let us have&#151;not
necessarily immediately because she may not have it&#151;the
corresponding figure for each year from now for the whole Budget
period. As a result of auctioning the EU ETS allowances, do the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>Government expect to raise other amounts that would come to the UK on
top of those figures or would that be the totality of
them?</div><a name="10011329000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000312"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Unless I stand to be corrected, I imagine that
that would be the totality of them. It is not obvious to me where else
moneys would come from. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the EU
raising finance through allowances from the new entrants reserve, which
will fund some EU projects, but that is a separate matter, although the
UK will benefit because we will undoubtedly have EU-funded projects in
the UK. That is our
expectation.</div><a name="10011329000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have explained the situation and given as much information
as possible, but it is important to distinguish, for the matters
covered in the debate, the fact that the Government&#146;s position
is not to take public funds directly to fund projects 2 to
4&#151;and, indeed, project 1 now&#151;but to do that through the
levy system. Of course, that is the matter that we have been
debating.</div>
<a name="10011329000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
about the contract for difference, and I said that I would attempt to
answer that question before going on to the main stand part debate. The
hon. Member for Wealden raised the matter and related it to the carbon
price. He is right to point out the benefits of a contract for
difference related to the carbon price. Clearly, over time, the amount
of payment through the levy could therefore conceivably reduce, which
would be an obvious advantage.</div>
<a name="10011329000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consulted on the matter and two proposals were put last year. One
proposal was the contract for difference, linked to the quantity of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>abated, and the other was to make an additional payment
linked to the amount of CCS electricity supplied. We need to do further
analysis with the Treasury, and we will, of course, need to take a
decision in time for the launch of the competition for further
projects. So there is no final decision on that, but we share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view that there could be an advantage in the
contract for difference linked to the carbon price.</div>
<a name="10011329000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want
to raise a matter discussed this morning. Questions were asked about
which suppliers would have to pay the levy. The debate was about large,
small and local companies and so on, and in seeking to clarify, I
indicated that the levy would be imposed only on licensed suppliers.
That is indeed our preferred course.</div>
<a name="10011329000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000313"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):
But.</div><a name="10011329000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000314"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> But we do, of course, have to consult. Therefore,
it was premature of me to say definitively that we will do it that way.
For the sake of accuracy and clarity, let me make it clear that that is
our current intention, but it will be subject to
consultation.</div><a name="10011329000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000315"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): I thank the Minister for giving
way, as I raised that point with her earlier in her speech this
morning, when she said that perhaps very large suppliers would have a
different tariff. Does she imagine a multi-tiered approach to levies,
perhaps going from the largest to the smallest
provider?</div>
<a name="10011329000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000316"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Lady is confusing suppliers and
supplies. I think that she is referring to when I mentioned
representations from intensive users. It is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>people receiving the largest amount of supplies who have made
representations that, for example, there could be a ceiling on the
amount of supplies that should suffer the levy. That goes back to the
suppliers, but those who use the electricity have made those
representations. This is not a distinction between large and small
supply
companies.</div><a name="10011329000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000317"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I am grateful to
the Minister for that explanation. I asked about and relationship
between suppliers and the levy on big users, because costs
proportionately fall more heavily on the smaller than on the large
business. I asked but did not get a clear enough answer. She has now
clarified the situation to the extent that I need more clarification
with regard to my question.</div>
<a name="10011329000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000318"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Everyone is suggesting that they are confused.
Let me be clear: I am not saying anything absolute on this matter. I
simply raised this issue&#151;regrettably perhaps&#151;and admitted
to the fact that we have received representations from people who are
heavy users and want some limit on how the levy paid by the supplier
companies will impact them. I am not in a position to give the hon.
Gentleman any further information. We have provisions in the Bill, and
I have made it clear that we have no intention to exempt at the moment,
despite representations from a variety of sources&#151;including
renewables, which we also discussed&#151;with the sole exception of
exported, not imported, electricity. We will not be looking to exempt.
That is the position now, but things may change substantially; we are
in a new field altogether, as regards the economics and the progress of
the project. I am afraid that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman further,
and I hope that I am not making things more complicated by what I have
just
said.</div><a name="10011329000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000319"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): Will the
Minister give
way?</div><a name="10011329000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000320"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I will, but we are in danger of complicating
things and not moving any further. There is a limit on what I can say
at the moment, but I stress again that we will have to undertake
further consultation, including on the
regulations.</div><a name="10011329000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000321"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It is exactly a question about consultation that
I want to ask. Who will conduct the consultation? Does the Minister
envisage the new office of carbon capture and storage taking that on,
or will the Department push it
through?</div><a name="10011329000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
we complete our debate here and the Bill, hopefully, becomes an Act,
the details of the discussions will be lost until we get more direction
from either the Minister through a statement or the new office. If a
company that supplies electricity has a mix of one third-two thirds,
where one third comes from a renewable source that produces no
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions, will that have any effect on the size of its
levy?</div><a name="10011329000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000322"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have made it clear that there is absolutely no
intention at the moment to exempt the supply that is derived from
renewable sources. I have made that absolutely clear throughout the
debate; it is not an area of confusion.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="10011329000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
question that the hon. Gentleman posed, the consultation will be a
formal Government one in the normal way. The Government will set out
proposed plans for regulations, and they will be part of a formal
Government consultation, which will take the normal 12 weeks. The
Government will, of course, publish the results, as is normal, and
respond. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Perhaps I am not the one
to sit down. I think and hope that I have succeeded in answering the
questions that were outstanding at the point at which we were
interrupted.</div><a name="10011329000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000323"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> May I remind the Minister of one? I asked her
about the cost. What will be the total amount of the levy and the cost
of the project? How much will people have to pay? I would be grateful
for her
answer.</div><a name="10011329000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000324"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have answered the question, but the hon.
Gentleman may not have found it sufficient, because all I provided him
with was the total sum and the range, which we think, from memory, will
be between &#163;7.2 billion and &#163;9.5 billion. That
is the amount of money that would be raised by the proposed levy. How
that will be disbursed and exactly where in that range we will end up
depends on the actual projects and their nature. Until we know that, it
is impossible to arrive at the final sums. So I say again that I am
honestly giving the Committee as much information as possible at the
moment.</div><a name="10011329000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="10011329000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000325"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is the global cost, but the other question in
which consumers will be interested is what it will add to the bill. Can
the Minister give us parameters for
that?</div><a name="10011329000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000326"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I think I can do that. We have suggested that we
are probably looking at a 2 to 3 per cent. increase in bills, looking
towards 2020&#151;about &#163;15 to &#163;17 per annum per
consumer. There will be no immediate effect on bills and, probably, no
significant effect before 2015, which is quite far off. We are
concerned about any addition to customers&#146; bills, but we have to
see this in the round and see what we can provide for customers. Energy
security is, very topically, what consumers will want and we believe
that this is a substantial way of providing that energy security and
appropriate energy mix.</div>
<a name="10011329000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
gives the Secretary of State the power to raise funds, based on the
provision of financial assistance to CCS demonstration projects, which
could include support for the retrofit of CCS to the full capacity of
the power stations hosting the demonstration projects, should a
decision be taken to do so in the future. Those funds will be raised
through the charging of a levy on electricity supplies, with the levy
to be paid by electricity
suppliers.</div><a name="10011329000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000327"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and
appreciate that I am testing her patience early in the proceedings. If
we create a technology that is not only successful here but is exported
to other parts of the world&#151;which I think is what she implied
earlier&#151;is there any mechanism by which the taxpayer would
benefit by getting some form of rebate? Is there any way&#151;through
patents or other methods and financial structures&#151;in which this
amount, which could be up to &#163;9.5 billion, could be repaid to
the taxpayer?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div><a name="10011329000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000328"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The taxpayer will get value for money, if this
succeeds, in energy security. The taxpayer would get benefits from any
form of exports; there are jobs in exports. I have no doubt that there
are benefits for taxpayers. I do not envisage at the
moment&#151;though one can never say never&#151;a means of clawing
back money. If under the contract payments are made according to
differences in the carbon price, that will properly reflect how well
things are going in the market. We are going down the route of a levy
only because we understand that these projects would not be
commercially viable unless the payments were made. Therefore, we have
to be prepared to commit that money and to bear the burden&#151;I
have indicated that it will not be huge, but there will be a small
increase in consumer bills in due course&#151;because of the benefits
that will accrue overall. We would not envisage trying to claw back; we
are trying to give people confidence in going ahead with these
projects, with support. We want to do that as efficiently as possible
and at the best cost. None the less, I do not anticipate what the hon.
Gentleman
suggests.</div><a name="10011329000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters that may be covered by
the regulations governing the levy mechanism. In particular,
provisions allow the regulations to prescribe to what types of supplies
the levy will apply and the suppliers who will be liable to pay the
levy. Provisions under the clause will also allow for different rates
of levy to be set in different cases. The clause allows for measures to
apply relating to the enforcement of the levy, including the penalties
for late or
non-payment.</div><a name="10011329000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
making regulations under the provision, the Secretary of State must
consult the administrator and such other persons as he considers
appropriate. Importantly, regulations must be laid in draft and
approved by both Houses of Parliament before they can be made, ensuring
that Parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the detailed
provision made about the levy. The provisions in the clause are
required to set the framework for the levy mechanism needed to support
UK demonstration of CCS.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000329"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We have had a useful debate, and I am grateful to
the Minister for the extra clarification. We will not seek to block the
clause, but we would prefer funding for the developments to come
through the EU ETS. I recognise that she has given further guidance,
but we think that that is a new source of funding that does not add to
consumers&#146; bills at this time. Consumers are already anxious
about their bills, and an additional levy must inevitably cause some
complications.</div>
<a name="10011329000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000330"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not follow my argument
that if he were to take money that has gone to the Consolidated
Fund&#151;receipts from auctions&#151;he would deprive other areas
of public finance, such as schools and hospitals, which are very much
needed and will continue to be needed in the future? Whichever way he
looks at it, the small amount that the levy would put on
people&#146;s bills would be completely offset by his proposals
directly to take public funds, which would be much
worse.</div><a name="10011329000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000331"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> What has been clear in our discussion is that the
funding is opaque. If we look at the budget book and the documentation,
it is difficult to see exactly how much there is. Today, for the first
time, after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>months of asking for information, we have had some detail on how much
money is assumed to come from the EU ETS. We need to look further at
how that is allocated. We cannot do that at this stage, and we do not
seek to do so. However, it is a means of avoiding a levy on consumers,
which would have been nice.</div>
<a name="10011329000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are determined to pursue the levy approach. We will not seek
to block that, because, in the event that money is not available

be said about clause 5, but I fear that its intention is not clearly
set out, and therein lies my
concern.</div><a name="10011329000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the clause, the Government intend to change the authority that is
responsible. I accept that, and it seems sensible that we should have
an authority responsible for the whole clean coal issue. I think that
we would all welcome that, but what changes have the Government thought
about? What is the time frame for the changes, and what sort of
authority will it be? Will it be a regulator? We need to know more
about
that.</div><a name="10011329000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
real concern, however, is the explanatory notes, which state that the
clause gives the Secretary of State power, through regulations, to
transfer the function of administrator to another body,
&#147;including to himself&#148; or, indeed, herself&#151;a
further growth in ministerial power over a rather sensitive area. Does
that give the Secretary of State the right to increase or change the
levy, and, if so, in what way? We need to understand that, because
&#147;levy&#148; is simply another word for taxation. What powers
would it give a Secretary of State? I assume that it would give all the
powers given to the authority, but I want that to be clarified. What do
the Government envisage if the measure is enacted? If they do not have
a view, I wonder why this provision is in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011329000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000333"></a>Anne
Main:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point about
this quite complex situation. If someone is unhappy about the operation
of the authority, to whom do they appeal if the powers have been given
back directly to the Secretary of
State?</div><a name="10011329000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000334"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Given the questions that I am asking, I fear that
I am not competent enough to answer my hon. Friend&#146;s question,
but no doubt the Minister has taken it on board and will be kind enough
to respond. There are serious concerns about the inclusion of the
phrase in the Bill. The Government must believe that there might be a
need to transfer power to the Secretary of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>State. Therefore, we need to know why that might be necessary. Will the
Minister be kind enough to make the clause&#146;s intentions
clear?</div><a name="10011329000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000335"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The provisions relate to the administrator of the
CCS financial support mechanism. A number of elements make up the
financial support mechanism: the raising of funds through a levy on
electricity supplies, the making of incentive payments to CCS projects
and the monitoring of the assistance schemes under which assistance is
provided. The elements clearly create a need for an administrator to
carry out the functions necessary to administer the levy and payments
to projects. We believe that Ofgem, the regulator of the electricity
supply industry, is well placed to carry out that
role.</div><a name="10011329000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause therefore appoints Ofgem as the administrator. At the same time,
it provides, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the Secretary of State
has the power to transfer the functions of the administrator to another
public body if required. That will enable the Secretary of State to
take account of any future change in circumstances that might make it
appropriate to transfer the function of the administrator to another
body.</div>
<a name="10011329000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="10011329000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our evidence sessions, we discussed whether a new body would be
necessary in the future; I think that the Conservatives had proposed
that new body. At the time, I said that the creation of such a new body
was premature, but this is a long-term programme that takes us to 2020,
conceivably with levy payments and conceivably adding retrofit
payments. We are therefore probably talking about a period of potential
financial support of, say, 15 years. Therefore, it is clear
that we need to have an open mind about what might be necessary in the
future. However, let me be absolutely clear that it is our settled view
at the moment that Ofgem has the appropriate expertise, and indeed
Ofgem is being appointed under this clause.</div>
<a name="10011329000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000336"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Does the Minister not accept our concern that this
measure makes the Bill rather narrow? We understand that the funding
mechanism will be fundamental to the projects being developed. However,
there are many other aspects, in terms of organising the funding
mechanism and its strategic deployment, that will have to be overseen,
and there will have to be an organisation to do that. Therefore, does
it not make sense to make provision for that, rather than perhaps
needing new primary legislation to set up another body when the matter
becomes much more urgent? I think that we can all see the need for that
new body. Industry sees the need for it, so would it not be sensible
simply to have the power to create it
available?</div>
<a name="10011329000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000337"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I will be happy to consult officials outside the
Committee, but I am not aware that there would be need to be primary
legislation to set up another body that might have the functions that
the hon. Gentleman has just referred to. This measure is narrow and
specific for good reason: to ensure that the moneys can be raised and
disbursed appropriately and that monitoring can take place. We believe
that Ofgem is the appropriate body to do that. Indeed, we have no plans
at this time to make any subsequent transfer of functions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div><a name="10011329000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the time for which we expect the projects, and what follows from them,
to run, we believe that it is reasonable to have this flexibility,
should it be required, although we do not currently anticipate that it
will be needed. Indeed, some of the other functions that the hon.
Gentleman has referred to could probably be covered by means that did
not require primary legislation nor the transfer of these particular
powers, because they are specific powers.</div>
<a name="10011329000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000338"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Minister is being immensely generous in giving
way and I hope that we are reacting in that spirit.</div>
<a name="10011329000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will remember that we scrutinised a Mrs. Jenny Saunders, or
a Miss Jenny Saunders&#151;I do not know her marital status,
actually. I questioned her on the efficacy and efficiency of Ofgem. In
particular, I asked her whether she felt Ofgem was doing a reasonable
job. I think that the information that I got back was that she felt
that it could improve considerably.</div>
<a name="10011329000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister therefore happy to give this power to Ofgem, or does she
intend to ensure that Ofgem ups its efficiency in respect of the task
she is giving
it?</div>
<a name="10011329000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000339"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hearing of most of the witnesses, including Ms
Saunders, was that they were saying that Ofgem&#146;s functions may
have left a lot to be desired in the past. However, I think they all
said that it was now on a better track and had improved in recent
years. We will debate at a later stage the ways in which Ofgem might
take on board climate change and energy security.</div>
<a name="10011329000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we are all of the view that Ofgem has perhaps not always performed as
we have wished it to, but considerable improvements in performance have
occurred and new directions are being pursued that are in line with
Government wishes. We are therefore confident that Ofgem, which has
already set up a new unit to cover a number of functions&#151;of
which the issue under discussion will be one&#151;is equipped,
experienced enough and able to do the
job.</div><a name="10011329000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
repeat that the provision is narrow, as it needs to be; it is the task
that Ofgem needs to carry out. It is the body that we are appointing
through the Bill to do the relevant tasks. We do not have plans at
present to change that, but we will allow ourselves the flexibility.
Whether there is a need for a different public body with much wider
functions&#151;the kind to which the hon. Gentleman has referred,
perhaps&#151;and whether that would require primary legislation, will
be part of our considerations in the rolling review.</div>
<a name="10011329000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that, as we progress, we will be able to make those decisions
subsequently; they do not need to be taken in this Bill at present. I
think that I have indicated clearly enough that the clause&#146;s
provisions are required, as they specify who will carry out the central
function of administering CCS financial
support.</div><a name="10011329000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000340"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> My apologies, but I did raise the issue of the
information in the explanatory notes. Will the Minister refer to them?
The possibility of transferring the power to the Minister, whoever that
Minister might be, is a pretty important factor in this
discussion.</div><a name="10011329000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000341"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I will share the view that
it is always better not to transfer additional powers of this kind to
Ministers, but we have to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>that flexibility should it be necessary. I have, however, indicated that
we have no such plans. We could have gone along with the proposed
contractual arrangements for the first project where the relationship
is directly with the Secretary of State and the developer for CCS
projects. We have put Ofgem in the position to do the work involved,
which is important to us. We think that Ofgem is the right organisation
to do it and we did not include the provision to suggest that we want
to make a transfer. It is there as a protective clause for the
future.</div><a name="10011329000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000342"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s answer, but I did
ask about what sort of circumstances she envisaged the power being used
in. If there are no such circumstances, why is the power in the
explanatory notes and why does it
exist?</div><a name="10011329000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000343"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> It is in the explanatory notes because it is in
the Bill. I have no idea what sort of circumstances might arise, but
the hon. Gentleman will understand that the expert civil servants who
advise us on the issue believe that we should have such a clause. The
drafters of Bills often advise that, too. I am content with that and I
am not ashamed to say that I cannot enlighten the hon. Gentleman on
this point at this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000346"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley. These amendments
stand in my name and are supported by the Conservative party.</div>
<a name="10011329000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of these amendments is self-explanatory, but it is an important issue
at the heart of the Bill. It is now fairly clear that the winner of the
first competition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>will be a coal-based plant. There are only two left: Longannet and the
E.ON plant based possibly at Kingsnorth.</div>
<a name="10011329000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In discussing
clause 1 this morning, the Minister stated that the next four plants
were intended to include two pre-combustion plants. However, clause 6,
as it currently stands, makes clear that the demonstration projects
will be for coal-fired generation only, as will the additional future
funding that may be available. The effect is to exclude the possibility
of CCS demonstrators being on a gas-fired plant; any pre-combustion
plant would have to be coal-based and not gas-based. I believe that
that is short-sighted and that we should leave open the possibility of
demonstration plants being either coal or gas&#151;or other
possibilities, such as biomass or oxyfuel.</div>
<a name="10011329000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
remind the Committee that we had the opportunity to get ahead of the
field with the Peterhead scheme, which was a joint venture involving BP
and Scottish and Southern Energy. I have talked about that many times
and I will not bore the Committee by going into great detail.
Considerable investment was made in that development, which would have
demonstrated the use of carbon capture and storage on a gas-fired
station. It would also have generated energy from hydrogen as well as
the storage of the captured CO<span class="Sub">2</span> in the Miller oil field. As
a result of indecision, continual delay on the competition and the
final decision to exclude pre-combustion schemes by the UK Government,
that opportunity was lost and is now being pursued in Abu
Dhabi.</div><a name="10011329000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
run a real danger of doing the same again by putting all our eggs in
the one basket with this clause. When the Minister was asked about this
issue in the evidence session, she said that coal was the most
carbon-intensive fuel and that a solution was needed. No one here would
disagree with that and, as the hon. Member for Northampton, South never
ceases to remind us, there are many, many years&#146; worth of coal
under our ground. We need a solution that will use that coal for energy
security, if nothing else.</div>
<a name="10011329000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">When asked
specifically about gas, the Minister restated the importance of coal
but
added:</div><a name="10011329000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not just what we can learn in this country; we need to learn from
what is happening in other countries as
well.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy Public
Bill Committee, </i>7 January 2010; c. 111,
Q244.]</div><a name="10011329000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
went on specifically to mention what the Norwegians were doing with gas
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would draw Members&#146; attention to the excellent paper submitted
to the Committee by Professor Gibbins. In paragraph 13, he
states:</div><a name="10011329000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
respect to technology demonstration elsewhere, conditions are more
relevant in Norway, but low demand there for fossil fuel may hinder
rapid development of gas CCS at scale. Conditions elsewhere in the
world where gas with CCS is being discussed, notably the Middle East,
are rather different with respect to ambient conditions and gas and
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> prices, so optimum technology approaches may also be
different
there.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, neither of these may be suitable for either the conditions in
the UK or the speed with which we need to get gas CCS up and running.
But it seems to me, in respect of the Minister&#146;s response, that
exactly the same argument can be made about coal. Both the USA and
China, for example, are pressing ahead with coal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>technology, mainly due to the energy mix in the countries. Indeed, the
professor indicated that the first commercial plant may well be in
China.</div>
<a name="10011329000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at what technology would deal with the decarbonisation of our
energy supply to meet our carbon reduction targets. We undoubtedly need
to have CCS for coal to unlock our vast coal reserves, but we also need
to look urgently at the decarbonisation of
gas.</div><a name="10011329000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point was made forcefully by Professor Gibbins during the evidence
sessions when he
said:</div><a name="10011329000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reason why the Bill needs to take in natural gas is that it seems
likely that because we now have these quite stringent targets for 2030,
we will have to fit a significant amount of natural gas plant with
carbon capture and storage in the 2020s. To be able to plan for that,
you need to have demonstrated the technology and to have the reference
plants to look at and say, &#147;This is how it&#146;s
done,&#148; and to be absolutely clear about what you&#146;re
doing. That&#146;s why you would work on
gas.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy Public
Bill Committee, </i>5 January 2010; c. 44,

pm</div><a name="10011329000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
will be aware that a large part of our current generating capacity is
gas-fired. This morning, the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey said that it was 41 per cent., while Professor Gibbins said
that it was over 30 per cent. Whichever it is, it is substantial and
unlikely to change in the immediate future. Indeed, I looked at what
was happening at the moment, and 33 new applications for gas plants
have already been granted, with a further nine being under
consideration&#151;perhaps as much as a further 10 MW of generation
capacity. Even as we move towards a low carbon economy, we clearly have
many existing and proposed gas stations; equally, those newer gas
stations will still be operating after 2020. As Professor Gibbins
states,</div><a name="10011329000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while
the building of new coal generating capacity before and after 2020 is
still uncertain, so it is probable that gas fired plant will be the
source for a major part of UK power-sector emissions of fossil carbon
dioxide in the 2020s and beyond.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000348"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
The point stands&#151;it is a substantial amount and is going to be
for the foreseeable
future.</div><a name="10011329000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that, as the Minister also made clear in evidence, new gas
stations emit less CO<span class="Sub">2</span> than coal, and indeed older gas
stations. None the less, we need to have CCS technology for gas in
place by the 2020s. The demonstrator, however, will not be up and
running until 2014 and some of our witnesses were very sceptical as to
whether that target would be met, which means that time is running out
for gas technology. I draw attention particularly to what Professor
Gibbins says at paragraph 6 of the memorandum. Forgive me,
Mr. Bayley, as it is a lengthy and somewhat complicated
quote, but it is
important:</div><a name="10011329000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Committee on Climate Change suggests that, for the entire UK
electricity fleet (i.e. an average of all generation sources, fossil
and non-fossil) an overall electricity emission intensity of
70 gCO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh or less will be required by 2030
(compared to an average value of around 500 gCO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh now).
This implies  that fossil fuel plants should on average be
emitting around  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>100 g CO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh, with the lower UK fleet average resulting from
the inclusion of renewables and nuclear as very low carbon options.
Individual gas power plants will emit of the order of 350
gCO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh at full load, but significantly more if they are
running at part-load or varying load to compliment and support
wind-generated electricity. Even gas-fired CHP plants can only approach
an electricity emission intensity of 200 gCO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh, and then
only for ideal operating conditions and location with full
heat/electricity matching and with an acceptance of an accompanying
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emission from heat production. It is clear, therefore,
that any gas power plants running for extended periods in 2030 (as well
as  coal plants) will need CCS in order to achieve emissions
of  100 gCO<span class="Sub">2</span>/kWh or
less&#148;.</div><a name="10011329000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the important point: we will still be using gas plants into 2030 and
possibly beyond, and the older a plant is, the more CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">
</span>it will emit. Given that older plants in particular may be put
over to peaking or emergency duties to back up other sources, they will
emit more CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, if I understand correctly.</div>
<a name="10011329000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The professor
goes on to say that we cannot be certain of the position between 2020
and 2030:</div>
<a name="10011329000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but in this
uncertainty fossil fuel, and particularly gas, is in effect being used
as a <i class="I">de facto</i> insurance policy to keep the lights on if other
options fail to deliver&#151;and ensuring that CCS is developed in
time for widespread rollout from around 2020 is, therefore, the
insurance policy to make sure that the UK CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">
</span>emission target set by the Committee on Climate Change are
met.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that we have to take account of gas. We cannot put all our
eggs in the one basket of coal, important though I accept coal
is.</div>
<a name="10011329000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other
potential problem that in my view shows a slight lack of joined-up
thinking is the overarching national policy statement on energy, which
is of course part of the national planning framework. Section 4.7.1 of
that statement, dealing with carbon capture storage readiness,
states:</div><a name="10011329000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
ensure that no foreseeable barriers exist to retrofitting carbon
capture and storage (CCS) equipment on combustion generating stations,

EU&#146;s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)<span class="Sup"> </span>should
demonstrate that the plant is &#145;Carbon Capture Ready&#146;

unless this is the case. In order to assure the IPC that a proposed
development is CCR, applicants will need to demonstrate: that
sufficient space is available on or near the site to accommodate carbon
capture equipment in the future; the technical feasibility of
retrofitting their chosen carbon capture technology; that a suitable
area of deep geological storage offshore exists for the storage of
captured CO2 from the proposed combustion station; the technical
feasibility of transporting the captured CO2 to the proposed storage
area; and the economic feasibility within the combustion
station&#146;s lifetime of the full CCS chain, covering retrofitting,
transport and
storage.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
4.7.3 then
states:</div><a name="10011329000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the IPC, having considered these assessments and other available
information, concludes that it will not be technically and economically
feasible to retrofit CCS to a proposed plant during its expected
lifetime, then the proposed development cannot be judged to be CCR and
therefore cannot receive
consent.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that that runs a real danger of preventing the future
development of gas-fired plant because of the lack of proven CCS
technology&#151;unless, of course, we invest and make sure that that
technology is available and working. Making an assessment of the
technological and economic feasibility of retrofitting the technology
to a planning application is impractical and likely to produce a
meaningless assessment. Without knowing the costs, it is impossible to
specify objectively what is economically feasible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="10011329000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said at the outset, given that the clause as it currently stands only
refers to coal-fired generation, anyone wishing to use CCS on gas
plants will have to prove economic feasibility without subsidy. I would
also point out that as the IPC is due to come on stream before the
first demonstrator plant, that will have potentially serious impacts on
developing new gas plants.</div>
<a name="10011329000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all those
reasons, I believe that we should accept the amendment to the Bill and
ensure that we at least leave open the possibility of CCS from gas and
other fuels. We should not be restricted to coal alone; that might have
the consequence&#151;I was going to say the unforeseen consequence,
but it can be foreseen&#151;of serious difficulty in the years
ahead.</div><a name="10011329000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000349"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on moving the
amendment in that way. This is a very important part of the Bill, and
how we approach the whole subject is also important. This can either be
a rather lame Bill, which moves us forward significantly in some areas
but not enough in others, or it can be a very big, bold step forward
that will really change how we think about carbon capture and storage.
His ambition and ours and that of many other members of the Committee
is that we should be looking for the latter. We should be ambitious and
create a totally new feel about
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have, I am afraid, missed the boat once before. The competition was too
narrowly focused. We then missed the boat on pre-combustion, and it
will be some years before we can begin to catch up in that area. The
project in Peterhead that the hon. Gentleman referred to was a very sad
loss. It was one of the most advanced projects of its kind in the world
and was ultimately lost because of the lack of Government
support.</div>
<a name="10011329000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our challenge
must be to not make the Bill too restrictive. We should seize the
opportunity, going for the whole range of technologies that may be out
there, and doing what we can to make them happen. The challenge for the
Minister is to make this a leap forward, rather than a gradual inching
forward. The danger is that CCS will develop in coal-fired generation
capacity as a result of the Bill, but that its potential development in
gas-fired generation will be stifled because it was not included in the
Bill. We will then have to wait for another piece of primary
legislation to make it possible, while others around the world will
develop the technology. We will be stuck in a time warp, because of our
failure to make the Bill fit for purpose.</div>
<a name="10011329000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">If enacted,
the Bill will be there for all time until replaced by something else.
The proposed levy is not time-limited, and there is no sunset clause.
Unless the Bill is repealed in 30 or 40 years&#146; time, the levy
will still be imposed, yet its sole purpose is to help to develop CCS
technologies at the pilot stage. At that point, it will clearly not be
applicable for coal. Even after a decade, it will not be applicable for
initial development. However, it would be applicable to gas, and we
must ensure that it is as broadly based as possible.</div>
<a name="10011329000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
important for us to listen to the evidence given last week. Above all,
the reason for those evidence sessions is to call before the Committee
those who have unparalleled expertise and to hear their views on how to
make the proposed legislation better.</div>
<a name="10011329000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall quote
Professor John Gibbins again. He
said:</div><a name="10011329000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reason why the Bill needs to take in natural gas is that it seems
likely that because we now have these quite stringent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>targets for 2030, we will have to fit a significant amount of natural
gas plant with carbon capture and storage in the 2020s. To be able to
plan for that, you need to have demonstrated the technology and to have
the reference plants to look at and say, &#147;This is how
it&#146;s done,&#148; and to be absolutely clear on what
you&#146;re doing. That&#146;s why you would work on
gas.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a further exchange, Professor Gibbins was being questioned by the hon.
Member for North-East Derbyshire. She said about
gas:</div><a name="10011329000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So
the answer is yes&#151;you would want a separate demonstration
project.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy
Public Bill Committee, </i>5 January 2010; c. 44-47, Q94 and
101.]</div><a name="10011329000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Gibbins replied: &#147;Correct.&#148; The professor is one of the
greatest pioneers and developers in the country and internationally.
His expertise clearly suggests that we should use the Bill not only for
coal but for gas.</div>
<a name="10011329000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know for
certain that carbon capture will be necessary at some point if we are
to meet the legally binding carbon reduction requirement of 80 per
cent. by 2050. That target can be reached only if we apply CCS to
gas-fired power stations. We know that now, so we should use this
opportunity to plan for it now and to put in place a mechanism that
will make it possible.</div>
<a name="10011329000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000350"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman
makes a good argument. However, I wonder whether there is a priority
for coal, whereas gas does not have the same sort of power. If I
remember rightly, no one said in evidence that gas would not be used in
future, but the priority now and the urgency is for
coal.</div>
<a name="10011329000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000351"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the
urgency is for coal, but the Bill is specific. It is only for
coal-fired generation. The Bill specifically excludes gas-fired
generation. Although we completely agree that the priority should be
for coal, we do not want to exclude gas when it becomes the priority.
We agree about the priority, but it is a mistake to close options when
we can see that they will happen before
long.</div><a name="10011329000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000352"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, taking
clauses 1 and 6 together, the next CCS demonstrator plant must also be
coal-based, thus effectively ruling out gas for the foreseeable
future?</div><a name="10011329000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000353"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman, who makes a valid
point. One aspect, which could be covered now or in a clause stand part
debate, is that I am not persuaded that the Bill allows pre-combustion
technology at all. My definition of coal-fired generation is that coal
is burned to create the electricity; by definition, therefore, that is
only post-combustion technology. I hope that the Minister can provide
us with some legal guidance to say that, where we gasify the coal and
burn the gas, that will still be considered as coal-fired generation.
So there are areas where we need greater clarification and
guidance.</div><a name="10011329000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5pm</div>
<a name="10011329000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000354"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I can answer immediately: the hon. Gentleman is
correct.</div>
<a name="10011329000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000355"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> If that is the case, there is no such definition
in the Bill. When the definition of coal-fired generation is given in
the Bill, it does not make that clear. I ask the Minister to reflect on
that point and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>come back with an amendment, perhaps on Report, to change the definition
so that it is clear, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that that is the
case. We need to address this point not only because of the development
of gas, but because a range of other technologies and uses could
generate carbon capture and storage and one might wish to assist their
development at some point.</div>
<a name="10011329000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000356"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Would not the inclusion of gas give a message that
is wider than the message that the Bill gives? Would it not tell
industry and commerce that this development is very much on the cards
and could happen irrespective of whether the Government want to be
involved with any of the funding and so on? If there is a feeling that
it could be on the cards, might not industry itself take up the
challenge?</div>
<a name="10011329000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000357"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> My hon. Friend could not be more right. The
opposite of that point is that businesses looking to develop
gas-related CCS anywhere in the world will look at the Bill and say,
&#147;Britain is simply not interested in doing this, and we are
specifically excluded from any funding mechanism&#148;. Therefore,
they will look to other countries in which to develop gas-related CCS.
Once again, it will be a case of catch-up and trying to say,
&#147;Okay, we had a potential lead; we have lost it. How do we catch
up again?&#148; The very simple change that is proposed by the hon.
Member for Angus would enable us to put that debate to bed, so that
people around the world would say, &#147;Look, Britain wants to lead
in coal-fired CCS, but if you are interested in gas-fired CCS, Britain
is the place to look to do that as
well.&#148;</div><a name="10011329000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect of this issue is that CCS will be relevant to a range of
other uses that are not directly related to electricity generation. In
particular, I refer to major industrial users&#151;for example, the
chemical industry, including aluminium smelters&#151;that need to
create an enormous amount of heat. Traditionally, they do that by
burning coal or gas. In time, if we are to deal with our industrial
emissions issues, those users will also need to have CCS.</div>
<a name="10011329000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need those
types of businesses to invest in Britain. If we are considering a
cluster approach, we should be looking, for example, at the Humber area
and nearby Teesside, which are areas that have incredible expertise in
the chemical industry. We should say that one of Britain&#146;s great
strengths would be to have a cluster based on the Humber, where
companies investing in the chemical sector could to tap into a pipeline
to develop CCS technologies to show that we can undertake some of the
most polluting industrial activities in a clean way in Britain. That
would be a wonderful message to send to the industrial world, but it
would not be permitted if we do not make this change to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10011329000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are very
keen to see CCS technology developed as broadly as possible. However,
this is the moment when the Minister has to decide whether she wants to
be timid or bold. The funding mechanism is a big step forward&#151;we
completely accept that&#151;but she can either say that her vision
for CCS is for coal or that her vision is for coal, gas and other
industrial uses. There is no downside to this change. In the early
stages, the levy could be used entirely to assist coal-fired
generation, but its use could then be permitted to support other
technologies in the future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div><a name="10011329000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change says that fuel
poverty is the issue. There is no issue of fuel poverty in this regard,
because the levy would be set at exactly the same level. The Government
would then use that income, but when it was no longer required for
coal-fired generation, it could be adapted to be used for gas-fired
generation. To suggest that the issue is fuel poverty is a red
herring&#151;it is not correct. We are looking for a bold response
from the Minister that will make the Bill much more important and
impressive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000358"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member
for Angus, which is supported by the Conservatives. It is consistent,
and accepting it is one of the bold things that we want the Minister to
do with the Bill, but not the only one. It would do an obvious thing:
as well as changing the breadth and the width of the technological
future of CCS in the Bill, it would also increase diversity, which is
what Ministers talk about all the time. When we talk about energy
security, the phrase that normally follows is, &#147;We therefore
need diversity of supply.&#148; It seems that by going down only the
road of coal CCS technology, which, yes, is the obvious one to start
with, we are putting all our eggs in one basket.</div>
<a name="10011329000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although that
is the obvious place to start, all the evidence that we have all
received makes it clear that we will have significant gas contributions
to our energy mix. That produces emissions, too, and can use this sort
of technology. Why not get the scientists and the technologists to work
on solutions to everything? As the figures make clear, if we can
capture and store, which the UK has the capacity to do, emissions from
not just coal-fired power stations but from other energy sources, we
could deal with 90 per cent. of emissions from energy generation.
Therefore, I support the amendment, and I hope that the Minister can be
positive and see the merit of modestly amending the Bill&#151;the
amendment will not affect its structure&#151;sending out a different
signal and opening up a lot of positive response from the industry,
science, technology, our engineers and the international
community.</div><a name="10011329000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000359"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I, too, support this crucial amendment&#151;one
of the most important ones that we are discussing today. At this
juncture, we can ask ourselves whether the Bill is an opportunity to
simply catch up with the rest of the world in respect of CCS or to
leapfrog ahead. So I congratulate the hon. Member for Angus on
introducing the prospect of including gas as a possibility for
CCS.</div>
<a name="10011329000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The feeling
among the Opposition is clear, and I think that if we put Labour
Members against the wall, they would agree, too. I would be saddened if
they were forced by their Whip to deny this opportunity to include such
a major improvement to what is considered an adequate and important
Bill, but is nevertheless not as strong as the nation expects us to
deliver, considering the pressure that we are under to meet some
ambitious targets. The Government have talked an awful lot about
meeting targets for 2020 and 2050. The idea is to take the action
required to ensure that those targets are met. The amendment is a
critical step
forward.</div><a name="10011329000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we paused for a second and looked at coal, I would be pleased but
amazed if any of the processes were up and running by 2014. As the
evidence suggests, 2017 seems a more likely date. With that time scale
in mind, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>seems strange that we are not looking over our shoulder to the other
giant contributor to our energy&#151;gas&#151;and realising our
desire to ensure that technology is developed and the expertise grows,
so that we can harness that technology to capture carbon in the same
way as we plan to do for
coal.</div>
<a name="10011329000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000360"></a>Anne
Main:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely valuable point.
Does he share my concern that it seems somewhat iniquitous that other
producers will be expected to pay the levy and yet will have no
opportunity to be part of the investment and the drive forward in such
technologies?</div><a name="10011329000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000361"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. I refer to
the intervention of the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West, who said
that coal should be a priority. I do not think that anybody would argue
with that&#151;coal has to be a priority. It is the dirtiest of all
the natural resources that we use. However, when does the hon.
Gentleman think a Bill might be introduced that will allow us to shift
our attention not away from coal, but to include gas as well? I will
give way to him, even though he is deliberately avoiding eye
contact.</div><a name="10011329000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000362"></a>John
Robertson:</b> No, I am not&#151;I am making it now. I had
not sought to catch Mr. Bayley&#146;s eye, but I will
after the hon. Gentleman has
finished.</div><a name="10011329000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000363"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman obviously wants time to think
about the answer. This is, however, a question for the Minister. If the
Government are successful in May or whenever the election might be,
when will a Bill be introduced that treats gas along the same lines as
we are discussing in respect of coal? We on the Opposition Benches are
saying that there is an opportunity to allow that mechanism&#151;the
legislation that I believe the nation is calling out for&#151;to be
introduced as we speak. If we do not do it now, we will have to wait
for a change of Government. It will be a priority for us, but this will
also be seen as a missed opportunity, because we will move from playing
catch-up on coal to being behind the curve again on
gas.</div><a name="10011329000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wealden also said that this matter will have
an impact on the other dynamics covered by the Bill, such as the size
of the pipes required for the clusters that are likely to develop in
key parts of the UK. Including gas in the Bill would have an impact on
the issue of the size of those pipes&#151;we will address that later,
in another amendment&#151;and would almost oblige us to ensure that
those pipes were of a sensible size to include the expected increase in
carbon that we would have to
transport.</div><a name="10011329000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore urge the Minister to consider the amendment carefully. This
matter is bigger than the individual agendas and partisan approaches
that we sometimes pursue and adopt. It is about meeting our energy
requirements in a safe and secure manner and reducing carbon emissions
as part of the Government targets. I do not believe that we will meet
those targets unless we can give the industry the green light that it
needs to include at least one or two demonstration projects on gas as
well as coal. I therefore ask her to accept the
amendment.</div><a name="10011329000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000364"></a>John
Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution was
very narrow. He seems to be content to think just of the small picture
rather than the big one, and the big 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>picture is what is happening worldwide. What happens with gas in this
country is important for one reason&#151;security of supply. Do we
want to be going down the road of using foreign gas for our needs in
years to come? The Government are correct in their assumption that they
have to prioritise coal. The question then has to be about how we spend
the money on the projects that will take place in the months and years
ahead.</div><a name="10011329000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
we spread ourselves thinly by having gas as well as coal, or do we
concentrate on coal, which is a priority cost-wise? We have 300-plus
years&#146; worth of coal in this country; we do not have to go
abroad for it. If we can clean the dirtiest coal that is dug out of the
ground sufficiently for use, we will suddenly become self-sufficient
and have security before we go down any other energy
road.</div><a name="10011329000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000365"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I do not disagree with what the hon. Gentleman is
saying, but the point being made about gas is that we have the gas
stations and will continue to have them for at least the next 20 or 30
years. If we are to meet our target, we have to clean them up. We need
to deal with that while we wait to get the new CCS coal stations online
or we will never meet our carbon
targets.</div><a name="10011329000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000366"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Well, of course there are other ways to meet
those targets. The hon. Gentleman and I have had discussions about
energy in a few Parliaments, and he knows my opinion that nuclear has
to be part of the energy mix and will help to solve the
problem.</div><a name="10011329000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000368"></a>John
Robertson:</b> If the hon. Gentleman lets me answer that
question first, I will let him in. I believe that at this time we have
other priorities than to put money into gas. That is not to stop any
companies that want to go down the road of investing in a project that
they are paying for. We are talking about how much money will come from
Government to assist the four projects. I can understand where the hon.
Member for Angus is coming from and I believe that we will go down the
gas road in the future, but I just do not believe that at this time we
should be doing
that.</div><a name="10011329000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000371"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being very kind.
I do not understand the argument, because it seems to me
that all we are doing in proposing the amendment is opening up the
option. We are not spending any money. We are not committing the
Government to any action. We are simply opening up the option should it
be opportune at some
point.</div><a name="10011329000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
does the hon. Gentleman think that the whole concept of fuel pricing
and exploration has suddenly stopped? We know that there are real
possibilities in the south Atlantic, specifically around the Falklands,
which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>might be of great benefit to us. I was there only about a year ago. The
possibility is exciting. The world is an ever fluid, moving, ongoing
place, which is why we should keep our options open, not close them
down. I wonder why that would be the
case&#151;</div><a name="10011329000143"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000373"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Northampton, South
for his very short contribution. I understand what he is
saying, but I happen to think that the option is open and has not been
closed down. It is not in the Bill, but that does not mean that gas
exploration cannot be done. I think that the option is there. It is
just that the Government at this time want to put coal first and
foremost in the Bill. I think that they are right to do
so.</div><a name="10011329000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000374"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way; he has been very generous. I do not understand why the measure
cannot be included in the Bill. Is it because the Government are being
churlish? Is it simply because it was not their idea? I am asking him
to stand back from that. The question that I pose to him is whether he
recognises that by 2020 all the coal-fired power stations will be
either pre-combustion with carbon capture and storage attached to them
or obsolete, which means that the massive contribution to our energy
needs will be made by gas. With that in mind, when does he see his
attention turning to gas? When will he start considering the carbon
capture and storage requirements for that part of the energy
spectrum?</div><a name="10011329000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000375"></a>John
Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I happen
to think that with the rules that will, in the years to come, curtail
our use of coal as it is at present, and therefore run down our
coal-fired power stations, we will be left in a particularly difficult
position in which we will have to use gas in large quantities, but it
will not be British gas. It will be gas from Russia, the far east or
even Africa. I have a problem with
that.</div><a name="10011329000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I want to ensure that although gas will be an important part of the
mix, it will not have any kind of sequestration on it; it will be gas
as we know it today. We have other ways of going down the road. I
believe that coal has to be given priority. I would not have a problem
with gas being in the Bill, but then again, I would not argue that it
is a necessity for it to be there, either. I do not believe that gas is
not
there.</div><a name="10011329000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members want gas to be looked at and they want this to be done, but I
disagree with what is being said because as soon as that is written
into the Bill, that is what the interpretation will
be.</div><a name="10011329000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000376"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="10011329000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000377"></a>Charles

<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="10011329000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000378"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I have given way to the hon. Members for Angus
and for Bournemouth, East, so there is only one Member I have not given
way to and I give way to him now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div><a name="10011329000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000379"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am very grateful. I have always found that the
hon. Gentleman and I broadly agree on many of these energy issues, and
I have a great deal of time for him, but I have just listened to him
for five minutes explaining why the measure should not be in the Bill,
then he said that he would have no problem with it being in the Bill.
No one is suggesting that we add the words &#147;gas-fired&#148; to
the Bill. The suggestion is that we simply remove the words
&#147;coal-fired&#148;.</div><a name="10011329000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill stands, it would be against the law for &#163;1 of the levy
to be spent on developing gas CCS; it could go only on coal-fired
generation. Therefore, the proposal, which seems eminently sensible, is
not to require this to be done on gas, which is what the hon. Gentleman
appears to be suggesting, but simply to make that possible so that it
could be done without the law being
broken.</div><a name="10011329000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000380"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Another short intervention. I understand what
the hon. Gentleman is saying, but he also agreed with me earlier, when
I intervened on him, that coal was a priority. Therefore, if coal is
the priority, the Government are introducing what I think is a fairly
sensible Bill and ensuring that that issue is identified and looked at.
That will not stop this being done again in years to come, but I just
do not think that gas needs to be written into the Bill just for the
sake of doing it. That has nothing to do with whose idea it was,
because most of our ideas come from outside industry anyway. I do not
see why that has to be a
problem.</div><a name="10011329000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will leave it to the Minister to explain why the Bill has been drawn up
in such a way. I am sure that it will be clear to everybody and that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10011329000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000381"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Obviously, this is quite a passionate debate,
with people raising many reasons why gas should be included and, as the
hon. Member for Angus says, quoting Professor Gibbins at some
length.</div><a name="10011329000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some difficulty here, because it seems to me that there is nothing
in the evidence with which any of us would disagree. We urgently need
to consider and plan for the decarbonisation of our whole electricity
supply. We also need to acknowledge a large part of the supply as
gas-fired. However, Professor Gibbins said clearly that we are talking
about into the 2020s and looking to 2030, when gas plants will still be
in use. Nobody is suggesting that we will not expect to want to have
CCS on gas at some point in the future; this is all about where the
priority
lies.</div><a name="10011329000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no question but that we would wish to understand CCS on gas. It is
clear to me that the potential is there to learn from other projects,
notwithstanding that all circumstances, as the hon. Gentleman said,
quoting Gibbins, are not identical. However, we expect to be able to
learn and that some aspects of CCS and coal in this country would in
themselves be applicable to gas, so there is no difference between us
in that
respect.</div><a name="10011329000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman seemed to think that there was a contradiction in the
national planning strategy on energy. He quoted the provisions on
carbon capture readiness, but surely that only reinforces the fact that
the Government accept that there will be a need for CCS on gas in the
future. That is the sole reason why we have said that carbon capture
readiness is a necessary part of consenting to new
plant.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000382"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> In a sense, I am not disagreeing with the hon. Lady.
My point is that, as the national plan is written, no one will get
permission for a gas-fired station because the CCS is not ready. How
can we demonstrate that carbon capture is ready if the technology does
not exist for gas? That is the
point.</div><a name="10011329000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000383"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The fact is that enough is known already about
the CCS potential for gas for companies to be able to understand what
CCS readiness is. That was indeed spelled out in what the hon.
Gentleman read into the record, so it is quite clear that carbon
capture readiness is understood, is provided for and can be undertaken,
and that planning inspectors will be in a position to make decisions
based on what is set out in those plans. There is no contradiction. The
issue must surely be whether there is to be experimentation elsewhere.
We know that there is; both the hon. Gentleman and I have cited
examples of
that.</div>
<a name="10011329000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden referred yet again to the BP plant. It is completely
incorrect to suggest that the BP plant was lost due to lack of
Government support. Government support for the plant was never directly
offered or sought; it was a question of whether it entered itself into
a competition, and it decided not to participate when all the details
became known. It made commercial decisions that had nothing to do with
lack of direct Government support to that plant. There was never a
question that the Government would simply subsidise one company in one
location dealing with one specific
technology.</div><a name="10011329000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000384"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD): With the
greatest respect to the Minister, she will know that at the BP Miller
field there was encouragement of a single project, together with
Scottish Power, at that time. That was the arrangement. It was only
when the final decision about funding the project came in that
the Government&#151;very disingenuously&#151;invented a
competition. That was what happened, rather than the other way round.
BP was certainly in a position to go ahead with that project as a
demonstrator.</div><a name="10011329000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000385"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Neither the hon. Gentleman nor I will know of
private conversations that may have taken place&#151;encouragements
or otherwise&#151;but I am absolutely clear that there could never
have been an intention specifically to subsidise an individual plant.
That is why we have the competition.</div>
<a name="10011329000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing I want to say, before I get to the meat of the debate on clause
6, is that everyone has spoken as though CCS were already a proven
technology and we could have real certainty about applying CCS to gas
through demonstration projects. The whole purpose of demonstration
projects is to see whether it is possible to bring CCS to scale and to
do it commercially.</div>
<a name="10011329000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, we are in a very different place from where we could
conceivably be by 2020, not least through our own demonstrators in this
country. As everyone has acknowledged, they are also taking place in
many other countries, not least with EU funding of 12 projects within
Europe, where I would suggest things are pretty comparable in terms of
their
application.</div><a name="10011329000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000386"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I think the Minister is missing the point. What do
clauses 1 and 6 mean? The whole of the four or five projects will be
turned on coal. There is no window 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>for gas, despite its importance to electricity generation in this
country. It seems absurd to close off that avenue altogether, without
even leaving the possibility of it being helped
along.</div><a name="10011329000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000387"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Let me address those points in a more
comprehensive way, as opposed to answering questions. Clause 6 sets out
the definitions for a number of terms used in this part of the Bill. In
particular, the clause defines the term &#147;commercial coal-fired
electricity generation&#148; which is used throughout part 1. The
effect of that definition is that financial assistance, which may be
provided by the Secretary of State to CCS demonstration projects and
for the future retrofit of CCS to any unabated capacity at such
projects, is limited to commercial-scale electricity power stations
that are fuelled using coal or coal and biomass. Amendments 16 to 20
would remove all references to coal-fired power stations from the Bill.
As hon. Members have indicated, they would therefore broaden the scope
of the provision to allow CCS demonstration projects to use any type of
fuel, including
gas.</div><a name="10011329000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="10011329000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I set out at our evidence session last week, there are strong arguments
for prioritising the development and demonstration of CCS technologies
for coal power stations. I need to reiterate them as they have been
entirely lost from the discussion, except in the case of the excellent
contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West,
who outlined the many sound reasons why we should pursue coal rather
than other fuels.</div>
<a name="10011329000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coal is the
most carbon-intensive fuel and its use is set nearly to double globally
by 2030. CCS for coal is the most technically challenging because coal
is such a dirty fuel, but CCS for coal is cheaper than for gas.
Therefore, for economic reasons, it should be deployed sooner. New
clean coal in the UK will provide diversity and flexibility in the
energy mix and so help to ensure security of
supply.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000388"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I apologise to you, Mr. Bayley, and to
the Minister for missing part of the sitting. I was speaking at a
college reception elsewhere. It was already a commitment when my hon.
Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey ganged me into
coming on the Committee.</div>
<a name="10011329000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000389"></a><b class="B">Emily

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000390"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> He did not press me because I do not allow him to
touch me at all, in any shape or form.</div>
<a name="10011329000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important point of principle. There is an assumption, and the hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West made this point, that the Bill will lead
to the development of clean coal technologies in the UK and that carbon
sequestration in the form proposed&#151;and I agree with all the
arguments that the Minister has just made&#151;will lead to the
resurgence of the UK coal industry.</div>
<a name="10011329000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have 200
years&#146; worth of coal beneath our feet, particularly in an area
such as mine in Yorkshire, with some of the largest coal seams going
right up to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>north-east. The reality is that when the previous Government privatised
the electricity industry, the industry became free to buy coal from
wherever it liked, as it does now under a Labour Government. It does
not buy it in the UK.</div>
<a name="10011329000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000391"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interventions are supposed to be short.
This is not a speech, but an intervention on the Minister&#146;s
speech.</div>
<a name="10011329000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000392"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Oh, is it? I am sorry. I hope that the Committee
will agree that it is an important point. I take your guidance because
you are a very wise Chairman, Mr. Bayley. I ask the
Minister, where in the Bill is there any comfort for the UK coal
industry? How can it assume that there will be a reason for the
electricity companies to use British coal when carbon sequestration is
in place?</div>
<a name="10011329000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000393"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s apology for
not being here. If he had been here throughout all the sittings, he
would have heard me say why I think that there is encouragement to
those who might invest in coal supplies in this country. If there was
no CCS project funding or framework, there would be no investment in
new coal or new coal plants. If we give assurances that there is
support and that new coal-fired plant will be built in this country,
that will encourage those who mine coal in whatever way in Britain, as
they will have a ready market for their product. That is the connection
and there is nothing more in a privatised market that anyone would
expect a Government to do with
legislation.</div><a name="10011329000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000394"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> It is too dear. It is too
expensive.</div><a name="10011329000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000395"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes comments that are not
relevant to how a Government legislate. I think that I have explained
the connections. We are in a free market when it comes to producing the
raw fuel.</div>
<a name="10011329000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
speaking about why coal should be prioritised and I would add the
important role that coal-powered stations perform, which is to respond
to changing supply and demand&#151;for example, as back-up to
intermittent renewables such as wind, or when there are unexpected
problems with other power stations. Coal generation can also provide a
useful back-up when gas needs to be prioritised for heating for
domestic consumers in very cold weather, such as we have at the present
time. For us, therefore, coal has many important roles and that is why
we seek to include it in our energy mix.</div>
<a name="10011329000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000396"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Nobody doubts the primacy of coal as a current UK
base energy source&#151;that primacy is obvious. What I do not
understand is why the Minister, through her resistance to these
amendments, is obliging Parliament to legislate again if it should wish
to come back to this issue to broaden CCS to other energy sources. That
seems to be nonsense.</div>
<a name="10011329000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying
to reduce legislation, so it is surely better to give an option. These
amendments would not oblige anybody to do anything; they give an
option. In a minute, we will debate fuel poverty schemes, where the
Government have a &#147;may&#148; provision and not a
&#147;must&#148; provision. Why cannot we have a
&#147;may&#148; provision here, just as we have in the rest of the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div><a name="10011329000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000397"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points in due course. I just want to continue my train of thought about
why coal is so important. We have a demonstration programme as part of
our wider framework for the development of clean coal, which we
published last November. It includes the requirement for any new coal
power station to demonstrate commercially the full CCS chain.</div>
<a name="10011329000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">If companies are to invest in
the new coal power stations over the next decade, we all agree that
they will need to have financial assistance to help with the
requirements of this regulatory framework. Widening the scope of the
demonstration programme to include gas could jeopardise that investment
in new coal power stations, as there would be no certainty that all
four projects to which the Government are committed would be in coal
power stations. I say that advisedly, because the amendments that seek
to remove the reference to coal would mean that there could be CCS
support for power stations that are fuelled in any way
whatever.</div>
<a name="10011329000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
determined that we will have coal in the mix. Therefore it is obvious
that we must have a certain critical number of coal-fired power
stations; it is not acceptable to us that there should be a completely
open provision in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011329000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000398"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We are all keen that we should have CCS in
coal-fired power stations. My party is keen on that&#151;as much, if
not more, than other parties here today. However, the Minister could
deal with her concern by coming back with a counter-proposal that at
least three of the developments must be in relation to coal. We are
seeking to open the opportunity for CCS in relation to other options,
not to drive CCS completely in the other direction. I have given a
counter-proposal that the Minister could make. Alternatively, we could
make it and she might be able to respond more
positively.</div>
<a name="10011329000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000399"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The answer to that suggestion is that I clearly
would not seek to do that. The hon. Gentleman has just illustrated what
is wrong with these amendments&#151;indeed, what would be wrong,
given the priorities that I have clearly outlined, with any other type
of amendment that created a situation in which we could get fewer than
four coal-fired stations receiving financial support under the levy
system.</div>
<a name="10011329000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
hon. Members, including those on the Conservative Front Bench, might
like to propose doubling the levy and the number of the projects.
However, the fact is that we think that it is a sustainable proposal to
have four coal-fired power stations that can adopt CCS under the
provision, given the amount of money that we think is reasonable to
raise and consumers can reasonably bear. If we think that four is the
right number, and that the sum of money is of the right order, it is
essential that those four power stations are coal-fired ones, because
coal is the priority for the reasons that I have indicated. It is also
a critical priority to keep a significant amount of coal in the mix.
Even with four CCS coal-fired stations, which would be capable of
running into the &#146;20s and beyond, we would still have a much
reduced coal capacity compared with what we have
today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div><a name="10011329000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000400"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> The Minister continues to make a powerful
argument as to why we should have carbon capture and storage for coal,
but she is not making the case as to why we should not have it for gas.
She is repeating the same message that we received a couple of days
ago.</div><a name="10011329000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister wants to protect the coal industry. If we were
cynical, we would see that we are importing more coal than we are
digging up in the UK. As that continues, we are supporting the import
of even more coal. By denying the opportunity to include gas, the
Minister is protecting the coal industry, with the effect of denying
the opportunity for gas to catch up with carbon capture and storage.
That is what is happening, and that is underlying the message that we
are
getting.</div><a name="10011329000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000401"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that nothing is
further from the truth. If he is against imports, he must be against
gas, because half the gas that we use in this country is
imported.</div>
<a name="10011329000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I have
said clearly is that for energy security needs, global needs and a
whole range of reasons, we want to see coal in our energy mix, and we
want to have it with CCS fitted if possible. If we are to have four
projects and raise the money that we have proposed, we need to ensure
that those projects are coal. Therefore, it is not enough to suggest
that it would be okay to have three. We believe that in the future we
will need that amount of coal-fired generation with CCS. The programme
will do exactly that. There is no way that we will seek to have fewer
projects to bring gas
in.</div><a name="10011329000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I say something about gas? There is no question of our accepting
amendments that would diminish our commitment to coal. We seek not to
protect any aspect of the energy industry&#151;we have a free and
privatised market&#151;but to get the energy mix right. The issue is
about the energy
mix.</div><a name="10011329000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000402"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I do not understand how the Minister can say that
we would diminish the efforts that we are placing on coal. At the end
of the day, she and the office of carbon capture and storage will
decide where the money will go, regardless of what bids are proposed.
The question that I posed to her is the same as the one that I posed to
the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West. When does the Minister think
that a Bill will come through that will allow the introduction of
demonstration projects on carbon capture and storage for
gas?</div><a name="10011329000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000403"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I find myself in some difficulty, because I am
becoming repetitive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000404"></a>Mr.

come
forward?</div><a name="10011329000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000405"></a>The

projects. If we removed references to coal, it would open the field to
projects that are not coal. That is the simple logic. I imagine that it
could even be the subject of a legal challenge if the Government then
said that any field could be included, but we had chosen only coal. The
hon. Member for Bournemouth, East would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>then say that we were favouring the coal industry over every other
industry. We are being honest, straightforward and saying exactly what
we seek to achieve with the Bill. That is why I am resisting the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000408"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Any company that sought to develop any project of
any size could do so if it used its own resources. Gas-fired stations
could therefore become pilots for CCS. However, the Bill will establish
a levy, so, as my hon. Friend rightly asks, what would it mean to
produce an additional amount of money to fund an additional station? We
have indicated that it costs between more than &#163;7 billion up to
&#163;9.5 billion to support four coal-powered stations, so it would
be easy to work out what it would cost to support a fifth station if we
thought that the sums of money were equivalent, but that is something
that we cannot say. We believe, however, that gas would be more
expensive than that, thus significantly increasing the levy and
consumer
bills.</div><a name="10011329000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Timing
is another issue. I have given many reasons why coal should be a
priority, but surely timing is an additional reason. The timing is very
important, because coal is so polluting. Coal-fired stations will have
to close down for a variety of reasons under other legislation. If we
are to replace and retrofit coal, we have to do it in the coming
decade. That is clearly the absolute priority. However, we can
accommodate gas to a large degree and for a longer period within the
emissions limits that we have set this
country.</div><a name="10011329000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are considering CCS for gas at a later stage. Once that is clear, it
will be possible to have a debate about whether we need a levy system
to support gas at some point in the future. Moreover, do we think that,
by the 2020s, the carbon price and technology learning might be such
that a levy would be commercially viable in its own right? None of
those things is known today. There is no denial of the needs of gas,
but they are in a different time frame, and we have time in which to
make those
decisions.</div><a name="10011329000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011329000409"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that that is precisely the point made in Professor Jon
Gibbins&#146;s note to the Committee about the time scale for gas and
the extent to which coal-fired stations would not be built as a result
of the large plant directive? Does she also agree, in view of a recent
study by Centrica, that the potential to place renewable gas into the
gas supply system is considerable? It would further mitigate the carbon
emissions of gas and therefore place it further back in relation to the
priority of
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000410"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend, as always, makes cogent
arguments, and I am grateful for his
support.</div>
<a name="10011329000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000411"></a>Anne
Main:</b> I am reading with interest the fact that the Bill
mentions only four projects and that anything else seems to be
envisaged in a potential new Bill. That is wasteful legislation. It
would be so much easier if the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>Minister considered a similar phraseology to that about the
administrator and put something like &#147;may at some point&#148;
include other fuels. That would simply remove the need for another
piece of legislation in
future.</div><a name="10011329000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000412"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Lady proposes something that is not
before us. We are debating the amendments that remove all reference to
coal. I hope that I have by now made my position clear on that
matter.</div><a name="10011329000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000413"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s argument. Can I
be clear, however, that there is also one other bit of mutual
understanding? Is it the Minister&#146;s wish that, as a result of
her four demonstration projects, we will have the technology to ensure
that all future coal-fired power stations, or continuing coal-fired
power stations that carry on past 2020 or thereabouts, will use CCS?
This is only a demonstration, so that the whole of the industry can use
it. I hope that that is the common understanding. There will
potentially be many more than four coal-fired power stations, but there
will simply be four places where they trial and work up to final
projection, so that everybody can then nick the technology and use it
for the future. That is what she means, is it
not?</div><a name="10011329000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000414"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Yes. We need to be clear, however, that we are
talking about support through a levy that is specific to
demonstrations. We have included&#151;this is critical&#151;that if
decisions were taken to this effect, the levy system could further
provide for bringing the whole capacity of the demonstrator stations up
to 100 per cent. of
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000415"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> So it is not just four&#151;the levy keeps on
being
paid.</div><a name="10011329000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000416"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> No, no. It is the
four.</div><a name="10011329000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000417"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Does it say that in the
Bill?</div><a name="10011329000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000418"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am explaining that the Bill will create all the
frameworks. It will create the possibility of having the levy and all
that goes with it. We have said clearly that we believe that that is
required for coal-fired, pre and post-combustion. In addition, when the
demonstrator shows, as we hope that it will, that the different
stations can function and that it will be possible to move to 100 per
cent. coverage, the levy system could be used to support the
retrofitting of the rest of the stations.</div>
<a name="10011329000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
got a provision in the Bill, or an intention that would come through
regulations, to do other things with the levy. The levy is limited to
what I have just described. As for other stations, learning and
bringing retrofits would be a matter for the market at the time. We
have a rolling review going forward to 2018, so we will be able to see
what else may or may not be required to support
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000216"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000420"></a>Joan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000421"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I hope again that there is common agreement that
the Minister would say that the Government&#146;s strategy, which we
would support, is that once the technology and the demonstration has
been established as working, the next generation of coal-driven power
stations would not seek or be given any Government subsidy or levy by
collection, because the technology will already have proved successful.
The idea is to prove that it can work and then leave the markets to pay
the full price. That is what I assume the Minister is
saying.</div><a name="10011329000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000422"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I think that I may have said that this
morning.</div>
<a name="10011329000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000423"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> It has been helpful for the Minister to make clear
the Government&#146;s position, but I take her back to a key point.
She said two things this afternoon: first, she said that Government
policy is to do with energy security, then she said it is to do with
the energy mix. Energy security means that the source of the energy is
controlled by the UK. That is why we have gone partly into
nuclear&#151;we can control that source, which involves small amounts
of nuclear material. Coal brings me back to the point made by the hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West: unless we use UK indigenous coal, we do
not have energy security in the sense that the Minister talked about
nuclear energy. Would the Minister welcome an amendment, or perhaps the
Government could table a proposal, stating that those four
demonstrators&#151;they are being paid for by a levy, which is on UK
customers only&#151;would have to use UK coal as part of that
demonstration?</div><a name="10011329000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000424"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My guess is that we would contravene some trade
laws if we attempted to do that, so there would be no question of doing
it. However, if we do not produce the levy and enable coal to be clean,
there will be no future for the UK coal industry. That is the way that
we&#151;</div><a name="10011329000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000425"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> That is a different
issue.</div><a name="10011329000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000426"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> No, no. This is important, because it is about
incentivising the industry and we incentivise it by making that change.
The hon. Gentleman says that we have no energy security, but energy
security is based on the fact that some of the coal is produced here.
There is the potential for more to be produced here. In addition,
achieving the mix means better security in terms of
generation and protecting against failures in other
plant.</div><a name="10011329000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000427"></a>John
Robertson:</b> The problem with coal-fired power stations is
the type of coal that has to be burnt. The dirtier coal is not suitable
for our power stations at the moment and therein lies the problem.
However, that should be looked at in the future, so that we use UK
coal.</div>
<a name="10011329000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will my hon.
Friend the Minister tell me when the EU emissions directive comes in
for coal-fired power stations? One problem that I am aware of is that
2015 was a deadline for some of the power stations to be closed down if
they did not meet the criterion of being clean enough. Longannet is one
of those power stations and is the biggest in the nearest trial area to
me. Do we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>have a problem in that, even though we get those trials, we will have to
start to shut down coal-fired power
stations?</div><a name="10011329000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000428"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> That is indeed my understanding. From
recollection, I said this morning that I thought five coal-fired power
stations would have to close by 2015. Nobody has corrected me, unless
this piece of inspiration is a correction. No, I am right. Five
coal-powered stations will have to close by the end of 2015 as a result
of the large combustion plant directive. I am afraid that that is the
case, but it has always been what we expected to
happen.</div><a name="10011329000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are looking forward to make it possible for replacements to occur and
for new coal to come on stream. Given that a third of the coal used for
generation in coal-fired power stations is produced in the UK, we think
it important to secure the future for that production. I
think&#151;again, I speak from memory&#151;that about 6,000 people
are employed in that
industry.</div><a name="10011329000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000429"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The Minister has been very generous in giving way.
We completely agree with her that coal is a priority. We completely
understand that the focus will be on coal. However, this technology is
moving fast. We have some of the most innovative companies in the world
involved in gas in the UK&#151;BP, Shell, Centrica&#151;and they
are developing how CCS could be applied to work with gas as
well.</div><a name="10011329000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
the Minister is saying that because she insists that the levy can only
ever be used for coal-fired generation, it is not really worth those
companies doing that work in this country unless they can do it
entirely without support. We are not trying to move her away from the
priority&#151;we accept it&#151;but in a world where it is likely
in 2020 that 50 or 60 per cent. of our electricity will come from gas,
surely it makes sense to include that ability in time to use the levy
for the development of gas CCS, rather than requiring new
legislation.</div><a name="10011329000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="10011329000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000430"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There is a real difficulty in responding. I
understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from, but we made a
decision about the number of projects and the size of the levy that can
be raised and is sustainable. At the moment, we cannot move away from
that to include additional stations at some time in the future. We
cannot look further forward and do not seek to commit more money
through a more punitive levy. Given those limits, which are
appropriate, four coal-fired power stations are
appropriate.</div><a name="10011329000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about not passing primary
legislation again to include gas. If it were that simple, I would be
attracted to the proposal, but we cannot, at this stage, envisage that
the same mechanism would be appropriate at a later date. How much would
be required, how many stations and what kind of technology would be
appropriate for gas? There is more than one possible technology, as he
knows.</div><a name="10011329000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not dealing with legislation that we can add gas on to. If gas is
to be supported at some later stage, that will require primary
legislation because there will be many other factors involved. This
matter is not as simple as the Bill in its current form becoming
applicable to gas. As I have said repeatedly, we are talking about a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>15-year cycle and the rolling review process will determine when it is
appropriate to look at further applications of
CCS.</div><a name="10011329000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that I
have at least made it clear where the Government stand. That is not to
say that we do not recognise the fact that to decarbonise electricity
supplies fully, we may also need CCS for gas. As I said, our
requirements for carbon capture readiness extend to all power stations
over 300 MW, and that includes
gas.</div><a name="10011329000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are putting in place measures that will enable us to move relatively
quickly to CCS on gas power stations at some point in the future. I
have made the point, and I think I need to repeat it, that we should
not forget that there are other demonstration projects in Europe and
globally. We expect that those will include some demonstration of CCS
on gas
generation.</div><a name="10011329000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Facilitating
the global roll-out of CCS to the levels required to tackle climate
change will require global co-operation. Therefore, we expect that the
benefit from the learning developed by demonstration projects in other
countries, in the same way as we intend to share the learning developed
here, will be an important aspect of the overall development of
CCS.</div>
<a name="10011329000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
reasons I have laboriously set out, we do not intend to provide
financial support for the demonstration of CCS using gas-fired
generation in the near future. Consequently, I do not believe it
necessary to widen the provisions of this part of the Bill in that
respect. I hope, therefore, that the amendments will not be pressed to
the
vote.</div><a name="10011329000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000431"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We have had a full debate on the issue and poked it
from every possible angle, but I still do not understand the
Minister&#146;s position. We all agree that the priority is coal.
There is no dispute about that and it is clear that the first
demonstrator will be coal. All the amendments would do is open up the
possibility of also looking at gas, if that proved a more
attractive
option.</div><a name="10011329000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister tells us that there is research on gas CCS being done
throughout the world, but, as I mentioned earlier, the same can be said
of coal. We do not know which will be the most attractive technology.
It seems to me that the Government are doing exactly what
they tell us they never
do&#151;picking winners among
technologies.</div><a name="10011329000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not an attempt to undermine research on coal or an attempt to put
gas in the Bill. It is merely an attempt to leave our options open,
given, as we said earlier, that 42 per cent. of our electricity already
comes from gas. This is an issue that we need to look at, and I would
say that we need to look at it in the relatively near
future.</div><a name="10011329000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000432"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate&#151;I am
sure he does&#151;that we are talking here about a levy for a
specific purpose, which is to get the most bang for the buck, as it
were, in bringing on to viability a technology that will make any form
of mineral-based power generation acceptable in the low-carbon economy?
That is what this measure is about. Therefore, it seems to make a great
deal of sense to go first for coal. We know that coal is much more
carbon-intensive than gas, we know that we have to get this carbon
capture technology in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>place rapidly and we know that such technology can be applicable to
other forms of generation if it can be shown to
work.</div><a name="10011329000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
those circumstances, therefore, I would have thought that matching a
levy, which we presumably wish to bound&#151;we have already said
that we wish to bound it&#151;with a number of projects that
prioritised coal in such a way would benefit gas, because the levy
would show how that mineral-based energy generation could continue to
be part of the fuel economy. In any event, clause 6(4)(b) says
&#147;by coal and biomass&#148;, which may be of relevance to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument.</div><a name="10011329000242"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011329000434"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I respect what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I
think that he has got it wrong. The whole point is that it is a levy;
it is money from consumers to set up CCS and get it going. All I am
saying is that we should leave our options open as to what is the best
value for the consumer to get CCS going. It may or may not be coal, but
we will have two demonstrators in the first competition anyway. It will
be either Longannet or Kingsnorth. Coal will start this process off,
but we must have the option open to look at
gas.</div><a name="10011329000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West talked about importing gas. There
is a lot of dispute about whether we will also end up importing coal.
However, I ask him to look at what his own Government&#146;s
overarching national policy statement on energy says about gas
production and imports. By 2020, gas imports will probably represent
the same percentage as they do now because it is projected that there
will be a reduction, although we will still be using a lot of gas from
the North sea.</div>
