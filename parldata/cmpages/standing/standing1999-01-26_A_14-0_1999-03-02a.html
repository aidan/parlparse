<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to our 14th sitting. I trust that hon. Members had a good weekend and that we shall make good progress during this sitting and this afternoon's sitting, which will be under the chairmanship of my co-Chairman, Mr. O'Hara. The first business before us is the resolution of the Business Sub-Committee, which must be decided forthwith without debate.
<H4><center>Resolution of Business Sub-Committee</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Resolution of the Business Sub-Committee [20th January] be amended as follows--
<P>
(a) in paragraph (a) for "27" there shall be substituted "26";
<P>
(b) in the second entry in the first column of the table for "17th" there shall be substituted "18th";
<P>
(c) for the third entry in the first column of the table there shall be substituted "19th to 26th".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
That the Committee agrees with the Resolution of the Business Sub-Committee.--[Mr. Raynsford.]
<H4><center>Clause 170</center></H4>
<H4><center>Penalty fares</center></H4>
<P>
 Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: Government new clause 60--Penalty fares.
<P>
Government new schedule 5--Penalty fares.
<P>
Government amendment No. 883.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I echo your hope that our consideration of the matters before us will be speedy and thorough, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
The clause deals with penalty fares. As hon. Members will be aware, the Government have tabled new clause 60 and new schedule 5 to provide for the transfer of the current penalty fares regime. We are providing for a scheme that is almost exactly the same as that which was created by the London Regional Transport (Penalty Fares) Act 1992. We are doing that in the Bill rather than simply by giving the Secretary of State powers to prescribe a scheme by regulations. In that way, we will be in conformity with your wish, Mr. Winterton, and with that of the Committee that provisions be made as far as possible in the Bill. We have taken that approach even though it will involve further Government amendments. I hope that the Opposition accept that the present proposals are in the spirit that we have discussed and that we have an opportunity to give them full scrutiny.
<P>
 The new measures will remove clause 170 from the Bill and replace it with a new clause and a new schedule, which set out the provisions.
<P>
The Bill must make provisions for the penalty fares scheme that already operates on London Transport's tube and bus services and for that which operates on the docklands light railway. New clause 60 and new schedule 5 provide for a scheme that is almost exactly the same as that which was created by earlier legislation.
<P>
The penalty fares regime for Transport for London will cover the underground and buses, whether they are operated by TfL or under an agreement with it. The mayor will be able to determine whether the penalty fares regime applies to particular services or classes of service. He will also be able to determine the levels of penalty fares. Before making any change to those levels, however, he will be required to consult the Secretary of State and others with an interest, such as local authorities and transport users. The mayor will be required to consult the Secretary of State so that a consistent approach can be adopted to setting those penalty fares for which the mayor will have responsibility and those on surface rail services, for which the Secretary of State will have responsibility. That will avoid incoherence and inconsistency between the different regimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): What will the vehicle for discussions with the railways be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The consultation arrangements will involve the usual bodies that need to be consulted. However, in the case of changes to penalty fares, the Secretary of State has a crucial role because he or she has to agree the penalty fares regime for the railways. That is why we are specifying that the mayor must consult the Secretary of State in addition to the other wider consultative obligations that exist in relation to this and other transport measures that the Committee has already debated. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that that is the reason for the specific obligation to consult the Secretary of State. I propose that the new clause and the new schedule should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I welcome the fact that the Government have introduced more detailed measures instead of staying with the original provisions. Liberal Democrat Members support that and will therefore, in due course, vote in favour of replacing the clause with the new clause and the new schedule. I hope that we make the Government happy by starting the day by supporting them.
<P>
I have two questions for the Minister. First, will the hon. Gentleman tell us how much money is currently collected every year by London Regional Transport in penalty fares? Can he confirm that that revenue stream already goes to LRT and that it will continue to do so? It is an important matter, because it represents extra money going into the system.
Secondly, will the Minister address the matter of when reasonable excuse provisions can be allowed to operate? I hazard to suggest that even Ministers may have found themselves in such situations--at least, other members of the Committee, staff and parliamentary colleagues may have done. The current arrangements, as set out in the new schedule, stipulate that on ticket bus services one is allowed to buy one's ticket later if one has not had a reasonable opportunity to purchase it at the beginning of the journey. For example, a crowd of passengers may get on the bus and, for safety reasons, the people in charge of the bus shoo some to the other end of the bus and come round for tickets later on--clearly, it may not have been possible to have bought a ticket earlier.
<P>
More difficult cases can arise in relation to rail journeys. The Bill sets out certain defences. Paragraph (4)(2) of the new schedule states that, subject to sub-paragraph (3),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person shall not be liable to pay a penalty fare . . . if at the time when and the station where he started to travel on the train service there were no facilities available".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is clearly a proper defence. I have been in situations in which I have bought a ticket but, when the time comes to present it, I cannot remember where it is. [Interruption.] I have seen other people equally embarrassed. I am happy to be honest about it--I have bought a ticket, rushed to get on the train, got on the train and, as soon as the inspector arrives, forgotten which pocket the ticket is in. There should be a perfectly reasonable defence for someone who is able to prove that he has bought the ticket. He may not be able to show the proof there and then--he may have paid by Visa, for example, and need to get Visa to confirm the purchase. I want to be satisfied that people who act in good faith, and board trains having done everything appropriately, will not be caught, publicly embarrassed and later penalised.
<P>
I should like the Minister to clarify one other issue. He may think that it is not his responsibility but, while LRT remains a nationalised industry, Ministers must be accountable for such matters. What will be the position if one arrives at Paddington station a quarter of an hour before the train leaves and discovers that there is no way of buying a ticket in time because the machine at which it could be purchased with notes is not working, and the queue goes on forever? We have all been the next person to buy a ticket when the person before us is a first-time visitor to Britain who is discussing his round-Britain tour in detail. Having received one lot of information, he then explores another option. As the queue mounts behind, steam rises and people suffer mild heart attacks. We have all been in that position, and had to make an instant decision whether to miss the train or to get on it and try to explain ourselves.
<P>
It would be unsatisfactory if people in that position were not able to provide a reasonable defence. The problem is that rogues can also provide that defence; they can get on the train and say that they were in a queue for half an hour. The schedule is a proper criminal justice provision for dealing with people who have ridden the railways in London without paying, but we must not act on the assumption that people are guilty; we must assume that they are innocent.
<P>
I have noticed recently that it is still possible for people to get through the ticket gates on the skirts, as it were, of the person before them. Three times this year, I have seen people get into the underground system without paying or using a ticket simply because they are mighty speedy at getting through the gate when someone else has got it to work by properly using a ticket. Are we ensuring that there is the necessary investment to maximise the chance of people being required to pay on their way in, by having ticket machines that are open all the time, and to minimise the reduced but continuing evasion, which disadvantages us all and reduces London Regional Transport's revenue stream?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). I note that in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the schedule, there is strict liability, so intent does not have to be proved. On local services, however, another criterion is applied. One must have had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable opportunity to obtain a fare ticket".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That criterion does not appear to apply to trains. The problems to which the hon. Gentleman referred tend to apply more to trains at the big terminuses than to local services. Can the Minister explain why there are different criteria for the two services?

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be extremely brief. I am not sure from the Minister's explanation of the Government's arrangements for the clause whether they represent a genuine effort to improve the Bill. I have noticed that a number of other references in the Bill to the Secretary of State have been replaced by Government new clauses that take powers from the Secretary of State and bestow them on other people. Of course, in general, I am in favour of such streamlining of the Bill. I am not sure whether the Government are reacting to criticism from Opposition members of the Committee that the Secretary of State has too many powers--what some would call the Brent, East syndrome--or whether it was always intended to change the Bill, but the new provisions were not ready. Are the new provisions a smooth reaction to the course of our debate? It will be difficult for the Minister to give a totally honest answer to that question, but I await his response with interest.
<P>
As for the subject raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I immediately declare an interest as someone who has paid a penalty fare in his time. Zone 1 is obviously heavily concentrated in my constituency, and I therefore take advantage of carnets. Every now and again I go to jungle country outside and forget that I am supposed to have a different ticket.
<P>
I have one more question for the Minister, which arises out of the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the person who, very fleetly, gets through the barrier behind one, because it is open just long enough for him to do so. If someone doing that then goes to the same platform as 873 874 me, I engage him in rigorous stares to shame him. The technique works, in that such a person tends to leave the platform and go somewhere else until I have got on the train. But that is purely anecdotal.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The question that I have for the Minister is the same as that which one periodically asks Customs and Excise about how it knows what proportion of drugs it catches before they get into the country. I have seen London Transport's statement that the fraud occurring on the underground system comes to £20 million a year. That is a significant amount of money, which could be much better spent on the system's infrastructure, and I am strongly in favour of legislation. However, I do not know, unless it is an extrapolation from the number of passengers it carries, how London Transport knows how many people do what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and I have observed move fleetly through the system or deploy other methods of fraud. I am curious as to how London Transport can arrive at so precise a figure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have only once employed the opposite tactic to the one used by the right hon. Gentleman. It is known as the Bermondsey approach and involves getting hold of the person and yanking them back again. That is generally successful, because they are not able to do much about turning round in such a confined space. So one can follow the Home Secretary's advice to have a go on occasion, probably without too much risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Gentleman was intervening on me, so I should respond. It sounds very much like someone who goes into a revolving door behind one and comes out in front. I take it that the hon. Gentleman has not yet been through the barrier himself--it is not his ticket on which the fraud is occurring. My experience is the opposite--my ticket is paying for someone else's passege.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip--Northwood): I should like to say a brief word about the penalty fare regime excuses validated by paragraph (4)(2) of new schedule 5. It deals with what happens if there were no facilities available for the sale of the necessary fare ticket for a passenger's journey when he started his trip. Facilities, I presume, means machines, and human beings to man them. But all too often the necessary personnel are just not present. That can lead to problems, inasmuch as the personnel are not always officially absent. They may not be willing to admit, when checks are made, that the ticket office was closed owing to their unauthorised absence from duty.
<P>
I hope that we can have an explanation about that matter. It causes anxiety to the travelling public; extremely bad timekeeping by staff who should be on duty and manifestly are not is all too common on London Transport's underground system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an interesting short debate, and a number of points have been raised. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked first about the estimated yield from the penalty system. I am informed that approximately £5 million is raised in a full year from the penalty fare regime. Obviously, everyone should welcome, on behalf of all the honest passengers on the underground and London buses, measures designed to ensure that everyone pays their fare. In that way, freeloaders would not benefit without making a contribution, to the detriment of everyone else who, in consequence, would be expected to pay more.
<P>
The money is available to LRT, and will continue to be available to Transport for London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Has the figure been going up consistently over recent years? Is it an ever-increasing amount?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That I do not know. I will look into it and write to the hon. Gentleman with an answer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) gave examples of several potential excuses, the most obvious of which was the inability to buy a ticket. He highlighted the possible discrepancy between the provision relating to buses and that which applies to underground trains. I refer the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to paragraphs (3)(1) and (4)(2) of new schedule 6, which show that there is a parallel.
<P>
Paragraph (3)(1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person travelling on a ticket bus service who has had a reasonable opportunity to obtain a fare ticket",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
while paragraph (4)(2) exempts from liability a person travelling by train
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if at the time when and the station where he started to travel on the train service there were no facilities available for the sale of the necessary fare ticket".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus, there is a broad parallel between the two provisions. Inevitably, however, there are differences between the operation of bus and train services and therefore it is not possible exactly to replicate the provisions for each.
<P>
I note that the mayor will have significant discretion in giving guidance on the operation of the penalty fare scheme. The Bill sets out the framework, but the guidance on how it will operate, what tests should determine whether excuses are valid and how TfL should respond in terms of, for example, station staffing--to which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) referred--will all be subject to guidance given by the mayor. These are all perfectly legitimate concerns. We want to put in place a framework that will facilitate a sensible scheme which gives people a real incentive to pay their fares while ensuring that there is a safeguard for those who are genuinely unable to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey gave the example of a foreigner purchasing a round-Britain ticket. I advise the power of diplomacy. I would have thought that a little diplomatic negotiation to advise the foreigner of all the advantages and beauties of Southwark and Bermondsey, followed by a deft request to allow a simple transaction to travel between Southwark and Bermondsey and Westminster--which would take no more than 30 seconds--would be the solution to the problem and would avoid the hon. Gentleman getting into difficulties in future.
There is no conceivable way in which one can legislate to deal with those circumstances, and it would be inappropriate to try. Clearly, there must be good guidance arrangements in place to ensure that when tickets cannot be bought--because ticket machines are not working or staff are not available--and people genuinely cannot comply with the requirements to obtain a ticket before travelling, they not penalised for failing to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall resist the temptation to mention--with, I hope, the support of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)--that the south bank is about to become Britain's premier tourist attraction.
<P>
Will the Minister think about whether, as the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood and I suggested, the phrase "reasonable opportunity" ought to be added to the train defence, as in the bus defence? The Minister is right to say that there are specific defences. However, on the grounds of logic and fairness, perhaps there should be a defence for people who could show--or prove on the balance of probabilities--that they had had no reasonable opportunity to buy a ticket because a ticket office was closed or no one was behind the window.
<P>
<B> Mr. Ottaway:</B> I endorse that last remark.
<P>
<B> Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was intervening, but I give way to the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged. My intervention will be briefer. I support what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said. The Minister said that it would be difficult to legislate, but providing for a test of reasonbleness or reasonable opportunity would be a fair stab at legislating as far as the trains are concerned. Perhaps the Minister would reconsider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> in response to both interventions, I accept that these concerns are genuine. As hon. Members will probably know, a review is taking place between the London Regional Passengers Committee, London Transport and the Government office for London regarding the operation of the penalty fare scheme and the exercise of discretionary criteria. I shall ensure that the issues that members of the Committee have raised are considered as part of that review.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr Brooke rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was about to respond to the earlier comments of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), but if he wishes to make an additional point, I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. I wanted to intervene when I heard him describe the review. It would be helpful if it also considered the standard paragraphs used by staff of London Regional Transport and London Underground to respond to people who offer excuses.
<P>
I recently heard of the case of a person who had lost his season ticket during a journey. On not one but two occasions, correspondence came back from an office that was written in standard paragraphs that were irrelevant to the case. All that results in such cases is that the blood pressure of people who lose their season ticket rises because it is clear that they are conducting correspondence with a machine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman described a situation that, I suspect, all of us have encountered at various stages of dealings with bodies that prefer a computerised letter to a personal response to--[Interruption.] Ministerial letters are all personal responses. However, I am afraid that other organisations do not always achieve such personalisation and customisation of responses.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised a valid point. The review is at a relatively advanced stage--interim conclusions have already been drawn--so I am not sure that it would be possible to go back into all the detail that he wanted to be examined. However, I have already undertaken that the regime that we shall put in place will allow the mayor the scope to issue guidance on the operation of the scheme.
<P>
I certainly want the concerns that have been raised in the debate to be taken into account before the review is finalised. That will allow the opportunity to influence, first, the review and, secondly, the mayor, who will have a significant say in the operation of the scheme. I say that despite my feeling of aggravation towards the right hon. Gentleman because of his unwarranted slur on my constituency, which he described as "jungle country". He could come to Greenwich if he wished, and I could show him the beauties of Greenwich park. I remember one of his contributions to a previous debate, so I might invite him to come behind the bike sheds where we could sort out my unhappiness with his description of my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Before the Minister completes his shopping list of responses, may I add to it? He is right to resist the siren call from the fare dodger's friend, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the question of ticket inspectors on the buses and tubes, the number of whom has been reduced over many years? However, they fulfil an excellent function and meet exactly the problem that has been described. There is a large body of men and women of an authoritarian bent who have not been employed since may 1997 and who may relish the opportunity to do some small service to the nation. Apart from former Conservative Members of Parliament, I am sure that many people would enjoy the work.
<P>
On a more serious note, recruiting more inspectors would be an extremely useful way of having a presence on public transport that was supportive and that provided the travelling public with extra safety.
<P>
In addition, ticket inspectors could respond immediately to the hypothetical case described by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He imagined being caught in Paddington station behind a 877 878 Saga package tour from America. If he experiences such a problem, the main Railtrack station manager is a Mrs. Pound--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a rather long intervention. If the hon. Gentleman had thought to catch my eye, I would have been happy to call him. If he is making an intervention, will he come to the point that he wishes to put to the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I am chastened, contrite and shall be silent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend made a long, but extremely pertinent and characteristically witty intervention and I am happy to respond. I cannot say that we are able to introduce a new element of the new deal to cope with people who found themselves unemployed in May 1997.
<P>
My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point about the importance of checking whether people have valid tickets. I know from travelling my normal route to work in the morning on the Connex South Eastern service from Blackheath to London, that the presence of ticket inspectors, whose number has been greatly increased in recent months, at Blackheath and Victoria stations, has undoubtedly contributed towards reducing the fare evasion that, in my experience, was taking place on that service.
<P>
I know that that is not the subject of the debate, Mr. Winterton, but I hope that you will forgive me for straying. There is an obvious read-across between that subject and the matters under discussion. In London half the population depends on the surface rail service, but those who live in north London tend to use the underground more for travelling to work. Those are important issues which the mayor will need to consider.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was delighted by the prospect of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster intimidating fare dodgers with his rigorous stare. That is the best possible response to the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound). I will leave it to the Committee to decide whether the person who delivers those rigorous stares has to be someone of an authoritarian bent.
<P>
We have had a useful debate which has highlighted some important issues relating to the desirability of a penalty fares system and the need for safeguards to ensure that the genuine passenger who is unable to purchase a ticket is not penalised unfairly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I asked a question about how London Regional Transport and London Underground know how much fraud takes place. I will understand if the Minister cannot answer that question now. However, does he know what the average fare paid is? Knowing that would enable us to work back from his figure of £5 million for penalty fares to find out what percentage of fraud is detected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that question. Obviously it is difficult to estimate how many journeys are paid for that otherwise would not have been, were it not for the penalty fare arrangements. The LRT estimate of £5 million annual revenue from penalty fares is based on historic ticket yields before and after the introduction of the scheme. I undertook to write to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey with more detailed figures for the yields over a period, and I will write to all members of the Committee with that information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I apologise for the almost Japanese fanaticism with which I am pursuing my point. The Minister has not answered my question about how LRT knows how much fraud occurs. That has nothing to do with how much is collected in penalty fares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's rigorous stare is certainly the most intimidating influence that I could face in Committee.
<P>
There is great uncertainty about the yield of penalty fares as it is not possible to be sure about the level of fare evasion. The Committee has been given estimates of £20 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Is that the London Underground estimate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Yes. I do not have any further information to give the Committee today but I undertake to look into that further, and as well as writing to members of the Committee about the trends in yields from penalty fares, I will include figures for the estimates of fraud and where they are derived from.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am probably one of those members of the Committee who will be content to wait for the Minister's letter. However, may I suggest partly to help him that it is inherent in the nature of fraud that one does not know how much one has been ripped off?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair comment--a point that I emphasised myself when I said that it was difficult to be certain. None the less, estimates are necessary as it is important to have some idea of the levels of fraud. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find my letter helpful as it will set out the basis on which the estimates were made. I beg to move that new clause 60 and the new schedule 5 stand part of the Bill, and that clause 170 do not. I have probably got that wrong, Mr. Winterton, but you know what I am trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is my duty to put the question, but it is not for me to dictate the way in which the Government and the Opposition vote.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 170 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 171</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of the London Regional</center></H4>
Passengers' Committee
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am sorry that I was slow to get to my feet, Mr. Winterton. I was expecting to vote on new clause 60.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I say to the Committee that the new clause, the new schedule and the Government amendment will be put at the appropriate time when we come to them on the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged, Mr. Winterton, and I am glad that you know when that is.
<P>
I suspect that clause 171 runs into the same trouble that we had with clause 142 in that London Regional Transport will cease to exist. The Minister was obliged to concede that that entire chapter will have to be amended in the light of the delay in transferring London Underground to the new authority.
<P>
The same position applies now. The London Regional Passengers Committee will cease to exist. My question to the Minister for Transport in London is, when, and how she will cope with the transitional arrangements whereby everything except the underground is transferred, with the underground remaining with the Government. Looking ahead to clause 172, it appears that the new users' Committee will scrutinise Transport for London--TfL--rather than the Secretary of State who, until the underground is transferred to TfL, is the owner/operator of London Underground. I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether she intends to table amendments later to deal with the transition from the first stage to the second.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. I support the question from the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It occurred to me that the Bill does not make clear when the London Regional Passengers Committee will cease to exist. It is important to know, because I should like to express our thanks to Sir Alan Greengross, the chairman, and his predecessors. They have worked extremely hard for users of London's public transport over the years and have made a significant contribution to the debate about public transport in London and to improving it. If they carry on with that for the coming two or three years, they will continue their contribution and no doubt gain our thanks in future years.
<P>
I wonder whether the Minister has read the most recent annual report of the passengers committee which was sent to her right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister in January--and particularly the letter from Sir Alan Greengross entitled "Couldn't we go the extra mile?" which begins the report. It makes interesting reading and enables us to examine both the committee's work and its relevance to our proceedings.
<P>
In paragraph 1.4 of his letter, Sir Alan asks the Deputy Prime Minister:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As you edge towards 'mid-term'. . . is it any wonder that many of London's passengers have fallen back into the old mood of cynicism and despair that has for so long characterised travel in the Capital? I wish you could prove to me that they are wrong to do so."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That question is pertinent to our Committee's proceedings. Sir Alan asked the Deputy Prime Minister other pertinent questions, one of which was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Do you blame Londoners for being especially dubious when, unlike the Scots, they were not even offered the chance of voting for their Authority to have any tax varying powers?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister has read the report. If she has, will she say whether it has affected her thinking about the way forward for London Transport and the GLA?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> First, I shall respond to the question of the hon. Member for Croydon, South about the transition from the London Regional Passengers Committee to the London Transport Users Committee. The Assembly will appoint the LTUC, but the hon. Gentleman is right to stress that a seamless transfer from the LRPC to the LTUC is essential to ensure continuity of user representation. Users' voices must be heard.
<P>
We are working to ensure a seamless transition throughout the range of functions provided by Transport for London, so that direct provision of transport is unaffected and transport users' voices can be heard, and their anxieties expressed and examined. We envisage that the Secretary of State will extend existing appointments to the LRPC and transfer them to LTUC. The extension is likely to be short term--perhaps six months from 3 July 2000. That will enable members of the Assembly to make firm decisions about future appointments to the LTUC as soon as possible after they take office.
<P>
We are considering what needs to be done if the transition is not as smooth as we envisage. I assure the hon. Member for Croydon, South and the Committee that we are committed to ensuring that the voice of the passenger is heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is the Minister satisfied that the clauses in chapter IX cover that, or does she envisage introducing amendments later?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am perfectly prepared to consider whether the existing arrangements, which should ensure a smooth transition, might not provide the desired outcome. We shall return to the matter if it is deemed necessary. Our prime consideration is that the passenger should continue to be represented, currently by LRPC and by LTUC when it is introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that she is prepared to consider the matter. We are currently debating it. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether she is satisfied that she has legislative cover for the transition? The wording of the chapter suggests that when the LRPC ceases to exists, the LTUC will be introduced. Will the LTUC be able to monitor the underground and express a view on it, even though the criteria specify that its role is to scrutinise the activities of TfL, not the Government's ownership of the underground.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I was going to respond to the question that the hon. Gentleman asked about the LTUC's powers over the underground. I reassure him that such powers will form part of its remit for transport when the Assembly and the mayor are established.
<P>
I have mentioned our current proposals for ensuring a smooth transition. The Secretary of State will extend existing appointments for about six months to ensure that the Assembly will have enough time to change appointments if it wishes to do that. However, I am prepared to reconsider the matter to ascertain whether the system could be improved. My understanding is that the legislative powers are there.
<P>
I shall take up the points made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) about the LRPC annual report, which I have read. He referred to a letter from Sir Alan Greengross, which is at the front of that report. He neglected to refer to the other letter from Sir Alan Greengross, which also accompanied the report, in which he underlined his support for my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and for what the Government are doing about integrated transport in London.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to endorse strongly the hon. Gentleman's comments about the services of LRPC to passengers in London. That is why the creation of LTUC is so important. The new transport structures that are being established under the GLA will require a new user perspective. Indeed, clauses 171 to 175 establish the new LTUC to provide that perspective. The committee will be capable of assisting with any complaint about transport in London. It will be independent of service providers and central Government. It will ensure that the interests of ordinary individual transport users are fully represented.
<P>
The mayor will have no role in the appointment of the committee. Appointments will be made by, and the committee will report to, the assembly. The committee will be able to make recommendations to the mayor, assembly and TfL about any matter in which it has an interest. As well as providing a voice for the travelling public, the committee will be able to assist the assembly in its scrutiny of the mayor and TfL.
<P>
The LRPT, originally set up under section 40 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984, will be abolished and the new committee will start at the same time as the rest of the authority on 3 July. I have already touched on our proposals for the interim period and I trust that the clause can stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged to the Minister for that explanation. For what it is worth, I have just reread the clauses and I do not think that she has the coverage she wants for the interim position, but I am grateful that she will look at it again.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. If I am incorrect, I will write to the Committee and ensure that what we wish to be achieved will be achieved.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 171 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to clause 172, may I assist the Committee? The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has asked for divisions on amendment (a) to Government new clause 57 and amendment (a) to Government new schedule 4 when we come to the formal part of the proceedings on new clauses. I have granted that request.
<P>
The Committee does not appear to be aware that, on all these matters and new clauses that we have referred to recently and upon which votes have not been taken, there will be an opportunity, if necessary, for votes when we have completed and disposed of clause 177. We will then deal with the new clauses and so on relating to chapters VII to X of part IV. I hope that that helps the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 172</center></H4>
<H4><center>The London Transport Users' Committee</center></H4>
<P>
<B> Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 744, in page 85, line 22, leave out "twenty-four" and insert "twelve".
<P>
I am obliged for your explanation, Mr. Winterton. There are so many new clauses that keeping track is a problem.
<P>
This is a perfectly simple and straightforward clause. In her speech on clause 171 stand part, the Minister rightly described the committee as being appointed by the assembly rather than the mayor. On balance that is probably right as it is a more user-friendly approach. The committee consists of a chairman and not more than 24 other members. My concern is that this is a rather large committee and as such it would be more effective and efficient if the number was smaller. As a result, we tabled this probing amendment to discover whether the Minister has any reason for the number being 24, or whether a smaller committee might be more effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My intervention is interrogatory. For how long would members of the committee normally be expected to serve? Will there be a time limit? What remuneration or honorarium will be received by members of the committee? If there is to be remuneration, it obviously makes much more sense to have 12 members than 24. I hope that the Minister for Transport in London will spell out exactly what will be the work load of the London Transport Users Committee. She may then satisfy me that it would be appropriate to have 24 members, but I am inclined to support the cost-effective approach proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief, but I rise to speak in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The late, great John Garnett used to say in respect of the number of people required for a body to be effective that there was much to be said for our Lord's decision to choose 12 disciples. He allowed a secular amendment for the size to reach that of a rugby 15, but doubted whether a body larger than that could be led. Were the Minister to cite the size of the Cabinet as an example in Opposition to the amendment, I would refer her to the notable chapter in Professor Parkinson's book, "Parkinson's Law", which totally destroys the argument that the Cabinet is a sensible size.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have no intention of taking on both Professor Parkinson and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster on the issue of the Cabinet.
<P>
I shall touch first on the question raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood: for which areas of transport will the LTUC be responsible? As I said, we are looking for a new perspective on what constitutes public transport in London after the creation of the mayor and the GLA. The LTUC will be expected to respond to concerns expressed to it by pedestrians, cyclists and users of buses, the underground, surface rail and river transport. We are proposing a wider remit than that of the LRPC, because of the new perspective on transport in London.
<P>
To touch on the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South that smaller is more efficient, we have heard praise which no member of the Committee has countered for the excellent work that the LRPC does as the voice of passengers in London. At present, the upper limit on membership of that Committee is 30. As the hon. Gentleman said, we propose to cut that to 24, plus a chairman. We expect the LTUC also to be the rail users consultative committee for London. RUCCs have an upper limit of 20 members. We believe that 24 members will allow the full range of concerns of transport users to be met, while being sufficiently efficient to ensure speedy progress in response to those concerns, so that the LTUC will be able adequately to scrutinise and make representations to the mayor and Transport for London.
<P>
The issues of remuneration and terms of appointment raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood will be for the assembly to decide. At present, appointments to the LRPC are usually made for two to four years. Members of the LRPC are not paid, apart from the part-time chairman, who receives a remuneration of £15,000. As there will be additional areas of responsibility in ensuring that the passenger's voice is heard, we believe that 24 is the right number. As I said, the terms of appointment and remuneration are matters for the assembly. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I cannot say that I am entirely satisfied with that. I still believe that 12 members would represent a more efficient committee. However, I accept the Minister's arguments, and do not intend to press the matter to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 855, in page 85, line 27, leave out "Greater London" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Greater London area, as defined in section 2 of the Railways Act 1993".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I move the amendment in a spirit of offering constructive help to the Government. We want to ensure that the new committee, which we welcome, is able fully to look after Londoners' interests in terms of their transport needs. We therefore suggest that the area in which the committee operates is wide enough to ensure that those interests are properly defended. In defining that area we thought it appropriate, as have the Government elsewhere in the Bill, to borrow from other pieces of legislation to make the definition appropriate and consistent with existing legislation. The amendment thus suggests that the Greater London area should be defined as it is in section 2 of the Railways Act 1993, which covers some of the railway routes that run outside the GLA area. We feel that that is fairly uncontroversial and hope that the Minister, if she is not minded to accept the amendment, can explain why she feels that the GLA area only should be covered.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would require the assembly to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that representation on the committee would cover those who use transport services in an area wider than that of Greater London. The area would be that which is specified in the Railways Act 1993 in defining the geographical area for which the London Regional Passengers Committee currently has responsibility as a rail users' consultative Committee. The LTUC's activities will cover the same areas because the Committee will assume LRPC's responsibilities as the rail users consultative committee for London.
<P>
The definition of the LRPC area that is given in the Railways Act 1993 does not set out precise geographical limits. It refers instead to the definition used in the London Regional Transport Act 1984. The definition in the 1984 Act is itself derived from the Transport Act 1962. The existing area is intended to reflect London commuting services as well as services wholly within London. It is bounded by Bicester North in the west, Bedford in the north, Stansted airport, Upminster and Sevenoaks in the east and Gatwick airport and Guildford in the south. The boundary is also contiguous with neighbouring RUCC boundaries.
<P>
The Bill requires that the assembly shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that, between them, committee members represent the interests of those who use transport in Greater London--that is, an area somewhat smaller than that for which the LTUC will have responsibility. The Bill does not prevent the assembly from having regard to other matters such as the interests of transport users in the LRPC area, but it will not be obliged to do so. In view of the obvious need to ensure that those using rail services in the area that is currently covered by the LRPC can be properly represented, I am sure that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will be delighted to hear that I am prepared to consider the issue further and return to it at a later stage. I trust, therefore, that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was glad to hear the Minister's comments. I think that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton would have been even more honest with the Committee if, in addition to saying that he was borrowing the words from the 1993 Act, he had also said that he was borrowing a suggestion made by the LRPC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am more than happy to take up the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion and inform the Committee of that. However, I imagine that as other members of the Committee must have received the same briefings as my hon. Friends and I have done, it is hardly a secret. In other Committees on which I have served, members of all parties have referred to briefings but not always their source. I did not realise that that was a convention. If it is, I apologise for not complying with it.
<P>
The Minister made some very reassuring remarks. We look forward to her returning to the Committee with some other proposals to define that area. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 856, in page 85, line 28, at end insert "(a) the Mayor,".
<P>
This is not an anti-mayor amendment. It states the obvious: it would be unwise for the mayor to be on this Committee, as he or she will have many other responsibilities. The amendment speaks for itself, and I hope that the Minister will feel minded to accept it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> On this occasion, I have to disappoint the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I cannot see how--[Interruption.] I did not hear what the right hon. Gentleman said from a sedentary position.
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Lady will be disappointing not only the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton but she will again be disappointing the LRPC.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. Winterton. I am about to deliver a double disappointment to the Committee.
<P>
This is an unnecessary amendment. It is for the assembly to appoint the Committee. Part of the Committee's responsibility will be to scrutinise the mayor and Transport for London. It would therefore be both unlikely and unacceptable for the assembly to appoint the mayor in such a capacity, given that what is central to the appointment of the Committee and its remit is that it should be the voice of the passenger. As it is inherent that, although it is unlikely, there may be criticism of the mayoral transport strategy as well as Transport for London, the amendment is unnecessary. The appointment of the mayor to the Committee would not be regarded as delivering the voice of passenger. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr Davey:</B> The Minister's answer is interesting; she seems to be agreeing with me, but not agreeing with me. I shall not take up the Committee's time by forcing a Division on this matter. However, I believe that the assembly members will be at least guided by her words because, like her, Liberal Democrat Members believe that it would be inappropriate for the mayor to sit on the committee.
<P>
Let me make it clear to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that I have no vested interest in the LRPC that I need to declare. I shall be more than happy if, every time my hon. Friends and I move an amendment that has been suggested to us and other members of the Committee by the LRPC, the right hon. Gentleman points that out from a sedentary position.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When the hon. Gentleman moves an amendment that has been suggested to him, he does not need to state to the Committee whose suggestion it is every time, That is not necessary; it is not even a convention, although perhaps on the first occasion it may be considered desirable.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet) : I should like to make a brief comment. In a previous debate on a previous clause, we had a little spat about what to call the presiding officer of the Greater London assembly. I maintained that he should be called a chairman. The majority view in the Committee was that he should be referred to as an inanimate object--a chair. As a result, I am seriously considering changing my name by deed poll.
<P>
Are the Government being inconsistent or schizophrenic? Clause 172 and schedule 11, which relates to clause 172, use the word "chairman" and, indeed, the words "deputy chairman". I hope that the Government have had second thoughts and that they will refer to the person who presides over meetings as the chairman and not as the chair.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 649, in page 176, line 5, after "such", insert "reasonable".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 650, in page 176, line 13, at end insert "reasonably".
<P>
No 651 in page 176, line 25, after "may", insert "reasonably".
<P>
No. 657, in page176, line 27, after "Assembly", insert "reasonably".
<P>
No. 658, in page 176, line 31, after "may", insert "reasonably".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On the Minister's last point, it is interesting to note that you describe yourself as the Chairman on the selection list, Mr Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): There is nothing like a view to the big picture, is there?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We do not want a debate on the matter. We are dealing with schedule 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The word "chairman" appears so often in schedule 11 that one would need a shotgun to shoot it down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It will be excised.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> There is a little more to the amendments than meets the eye. On several occasions in schedule 11, the assembly awards people remuneration in the form of expenses and salaries. The situation is interesting. When we in the House of Commons award ourselves our salaries, office cost allowances and so on, we do so by means of an Executive motion and a vote by the legislature. In the schedule, we have an unusual situation in that the legislature--in effect, the assembly--will make the decision on financial arrangements.
<P>
If a Minister makes a bad decision, he is subject to judicial review; Parliament is not. Will the assembly be subject to such review if it makes a grotesque decision?
<P>
We have tabled the amendments to impose a test of reasonableness on payments. Such a test would make the job of those who conduct the judicial review easier. Any remuneration and expenses should, in any event, be reasonable. The Minister may well reply that a test of reasonableness is implied. Nevertheless, the point that I really want him to address relates to judicial review of the assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> With the amendment, we return to a subject that, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South recognised, we debated in a previous sitting, when we explored the requirements on public bodies to act reasonably. I said then--and I repeat it for the Committee's benefit--that it is a general principle of administrative law that public bodies are obliged to act in a reasonable way when they carry out their functions. The assembly will be established by statute and will be a public body, so it will be subject to the test of reasonableness and to judicial review. The amendments are, therefore, unnecessary as there will already be an implied requirement on the assembly to act reasonably. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also act reasonably and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 857, in page 177, line 2, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<P>
I shall be brief. The amendment would ensure that the mayor "shall" provide accommodation for the new London Transport Users Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment is both unnecessary and undesirable and I hope to be able to persuade the hon. Gentleman to act reasonably and withdraw it.
<P>
It is extremely unlikely that the assembly would not provide accommodation for the Committee that it had just created. It is not realistic to suggest that the assembly will establish the LTUC and not provide for its accommodation. However, it may not feel that it is appropriate to provide that accommodation itself--it may believe it more appropriate to provide the resources for LTUC to secure its own accommodation, which would be prevented by the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that the amendment would prescribe an unduly rigid formula. The current permissive power allows the assembly to provide accommodation if it so wishes or to provide resources for the LTUC to obtain its own accommodation. That must be a more sensible arrangement. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister's words will be calming for those who may feel a sense of insecurity regarding the new committee's accommodation. Given his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 858, in page 177, line 23, after "sub-committees" insert "or officers".
<P>
The amendment would put into law what is the current practice of the LRPC. A lot of the work that is done by the Committee is, in effect and in practice, done by officers. I am sure that Committee members' work is often done in their names by staff in their offices. Concern has been expressed to me and my hon. Friends that without this tidying-up amendment and given that this is an increasingly litigious age, officers' work might be reviewed in some way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, although I note that once again, he has obviously been in close contact with the London Regional Passengers Committee, whose amendments he has a predeliction for tabling.
<P>
I fail to see why the amendment is necessary. Neither I nor my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London are aware of any evidence that the lack of this power is a problem. Furthermore, the amendment would put the LTUC on a different footing from all the other rail user consultative Committees, which is not an appropriate precedent.
<P>
If there were evidence that this was a serious problem, clearly the mayor would want to consider the matter in due course. However, there is no such evidence at the moment and given the need for and desirability of achieving consistency with the other RUCCs, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his amendment is inappropriate and will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am slightly disappointed by the Minister's failure to assure the Committee that officers would in such circumstances be protected by the mayor. I hope that he is right and that if this power appeared to be necessary, the mayor would step in. I had hoped that the Minister would say that in such situations, the mayor would receive the Government's support.
<P>
Such a power is not in the remit of other transport Committees, but if that became a problem, I guess from what the Minister said that the Government would be minded to ensure that it was put right quickly. Given that, which I take from the Minister's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 859, in page 177, line 37, after second "the" insert "Authority, Transport for London,".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 860 in page 177, line 50, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) Information furnished in confidence under sub-paragraph (2)(a) above shall only relate to information of a commercially or legally sensitive nature, or information relating to personnel issues of the body providing the information or the Committee.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> These amendments concern the information that is given to a closed meeting of the committee, either by the authorities listed in the Bill, or as we propose in amendment No. 859, also the GLA itself and Transport for London. Information that is of a confidential nature has quite a strict definition. Restricting it merely to commercial and legally sensitive matters and also to information relating to personnel seems a sensible definition of such information and is consistent with other definitions in legislation affecting local government. I hope that the Minister accepts the amendments in the spirit in which they are moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I fear that once again I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman. Under amendment No. 859 the GLA and TfL could require the LTUC to consider information provided by it in closed session. As such, it would put the GLA and TfL on the same footing as the franchising director and the rail regulator. If the hon. Gentleman thinks through the implications of that he will realise that the proposition is not appropriate. Whereas the franchising director and the rail regulator are regulatory bodies, TfL is a service provider and the GLA is the body that is responsible for an oversight both of those services and of transport in London. It would not be appropriate to put them on the same footing as the specific regulatory bodies.
<P>
Amendment No. 860 would mean that information provided by the franchising director or the rail regulator to the LTUC could be considered in closed session only if it was commercially or legally sensitive or related to a personnel matter. That could be unduly restrictive and counter productive if it discouraged the franchising director or the rail regulator from providing information to the LTUC on other matters that had a strong requirement to maintain confidentiality for other reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I hoped that the Minister would elaborate by giving us examples of what he had in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can well envisage circumstances in which the rail regulator could be in discussion with train operating companies about particular matters that might affect the future pattern of services. However, because those discussions had not reached a point at which it was appropriate to go public, the rail regulator might feel that it was inappropriate to provide that information to a body such as the LTUC other than on a confidential basis.
<P>
As a result of the amendment, the regulator would simply not pass that information across on the grounds that he could not take the risk that the information might get into the public domain as a result of discussion at the LTUC. There are many other examples in which the exercise of discretion would help to ensure that the LTUC received information which otherwise the regulatory bodies would not feel it safe to provide. The amendment is therefore undesirable.
<P>
The amendments would involve a separate and different regime for the LTUC than for other rail user consultative committees. Perhaps if the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton had consulted with other RUCCs before tabling these amendments, he might have realised the problem that would be created by inconsistency in the application of principles that are important to bodies which exist to represent the consumer and to provide that framework of consumer input into services. We therefore believe that it is best left to the judgment of the London Transport Users Committee as to what information received from the GLA and TfL should be heard in camera. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I must make my peace with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I was not getting at him but his phrase about borrowing the wording from other legislation was not helpful because it was clear that the credit in that direction came from the London Regional Passengers Committee. I shall not allude to it again other than to say that he is right that the LRPC's suggested amendments were circulated to all members of the Committee, which gave us all the opportunity to consider them. On amendment No. 859, I agreed with the Minister, rather than the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton.
<P>
During our debates on clauses 51, 56 and 59 I was uneasy about the fact that confidential advice would not he available. In this instance, there is considerable virtue in the examples that the Minister quoted. I can also envisage there being issues of judgment about which a franchising director and the rail regulator would be questioned, especially during negotiations. It would be much easier to establish a meeting of minds if they were able to speak freely without worrying about their comments being reported in the press the next day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall take that peace offering from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster in the way in which it was meant, although it was slightly barbed.
<P>
The Minister argued in favour of consistency--the desire that the principles applying to the working of the Committee be applied elsewhere. Ministers sometimes say in Committee that we are creating a body that is different from TfL and special in some way, and different from transport authorities elsewhere, and that that is why the Government are creating a different type of legislation with different powers. At other times, they say that we must be consistent, but they are being inconsistent. Liberal Democrats wish that the Government would be far more consistent in their approach generally to the setting up of the new authority. On the specific issues that arise from the amendments, the Minister said that the authority and TfL will be service providers, and therefore that they will relate differently to the LTUC, but he did not explain why. They will be relevant to the work of the LTUC. If, for example, personnel issues such as amendment No. 860 raises are being considered, they should be governed similarly. I did not think that the Minister made his case.
<P>
On the matter of whether information should be given in closed hearings, the Minister made an interesting point. I had not considered that the result could be that more information might be given up to the LTUC. Having heard of the experience of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, which supported the Minister's point, I accept the Minister's arguments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a job lot of amendments. Amendment No. 652 relates to public admission to meetings of the LTUC. The legislation contains a general power to exclude the public. We believe it right and proper to exclude them from confidential matters, but to broaden the provision to a general power to exclude on a whim seems to us to be undemocratic.
<P>
Amendment No. 653 would oblige the LTUC to give three days' notice of a meeting. This applies in local government, and we think that it would be satisfactory for the LTUC.
<P>
The remaining amendments relate to clause 174, but you have rightly grouped them with the others, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
Amendment No. 749 would provide that recommendations of reports were not only distributed to the assembly, the mayor and Transport for London, but that they were given a full public spin. The amendment specifies the press and media, but I am sure that the Minister could find better wording, if he was minded to do so.
<P>
Amendment No. 751 would provide for the annual report to include externally audited accounts.
<P>
Amendment No. 752 would impose a duty on the assembly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" to appoint and fix the remuneration of the external auditors".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The LTUC should submit its budget to greater public scrutiny, and the assembly should control the auditing process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I understand the reasoning behind the amendments, which are intended to provide for more openness in the LTUC's operation. However, they would restrict its flexibility and have some undesirable consequences. I hope that, after I have explained matters, the hon. Gentleman will, in his characteristic way, act reasonably and withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 652 would remove the LTUC's discretion to determine the material that should be considered in a closed session, and that which should be discussed in a session open to the public. It is not healthy to remove the committee's ability to make such a judgment. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said in an earlier debate that some sensitive issues could not always be contained in a tight definition of what should be confidential. An element of judgment is always desirable. The provisions of the Bill replicate those that apply to RUCCs in the rest of the country and there is a case for consistency between similar consumer bodies. Therefore, the amendment is not desirable.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 653, 748 and 749 would provide for an openness that would be potentially unworkable. Giving proper notice of each meeting is sensible, and, in all normal circumstances, the LTUC will provide such notice. However, there may be circumstances in which the committee needs to meet quickly to cope with a matter of immediate importance and urgency. A ruling that only a meeting for which three days' notice has been given is valid could preclude a flexible response to particular circumstances. The London Transport Users Committee will not be a public body, but a consultative body, which will be subject to scrutiny by the assembly. Therefore, I believe that the current arrangements are probably satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is it for that reason that the Minister differentiates between local government and consultative bodies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is very much on that basis. All local government bodies that are democratically elected public authorities are subject to a test. However, we are considering what will essentially be a consumer committee, which will be subordinate to the democratic body. We believe that sufficient checks exist to ensure accountability and that LTUC will not abuse its flexbility.
<P>
It would be impractical to require all LTUC papers that go to the mayor, TfL and the assembly to go to the media. The wording of amendment No. 749 would require the LTUC to provide copies of its papers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the London press and media".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this litigious age, a small newsheet in an obscure part of the jungle territory of London could sue the LTUC for a failure to comply if that wording was accepted. That is taking the matter a little too far.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Ottaway:</B> Do not the Government send everything to the papers anyway, so is it not utterly appropriate for the assembly to do the same?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Of course I recognise that the Government's ability to communicate with the media is far superior to that of the Conservative party, but that is not germane to this argument. We are discussing the LTUC and its relationship with the media. As a body representing transport users, it will naturally want to involve the media where appropriate and to ensure that the media are aware of its activities. However, there may be occasions on which it decides that it would not be appropriate to release information to the press. For example, if an LT recommendation concerned the conduct of a specified individual or a commercially sensitive matter, that would obviously not be appropriate to be sent to the press, as would be required by the amendment.
<P>
I remind the hon. Gentleman of our earlier discussions concerning the role of the assembly. It is for the assembly, consisting of elected members, to scrutinise the working of Transport for London. The assembly will no doubt want to publicise its concerns about TfL, and will do so on recommendations from the LTUC, which will assist the assembly by representing the concerns of transport users about the GLA's transport functions.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 751 and 752 relate to the audit and accounting arrangements for the LTUC. Spending by the LTUC will come under the budget of the GLA, and so will be covered in the GLA's accounts. We do not consider that detailed arrangements need to be defined in the Bill, because proper provision is made for the audit and scrutiny of the GLA's accounts, so spending on its subordinate bodies, such as the LTUC, will be properly covered. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore recognise that the amendment is inappropriate, and will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister and I will have to agree to differ on most of those points. As the Minister pointed out, amendment No. 652 is modelled on existing legislation introduced by the previous Conservative Government. I tabled it as a probing amendment; I just wanted to test the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment. No. 862, in page 86, line 36, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) It shall be the duty of the Authority or Transport for London to provide the Committee with such information as may be necessary to enable the Committee to fulfil its responsibilities in subsection (1) above".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the House gives bodies statutory duties, it should ensure that those bodies have the information to allow them to carry out those duties properly. The amendment seeks to ensure that. The LTUC will be the watchdog for travellers in and around London--passengers on public transport and users of the highways. The London Regional Passengers Committee and I consider that the Bill should ensure that the committee will have the information to enable it to carry out that function. The committee will not have many powers to bite; its major power will be in its bark. It is important that it has available to it all the information required properly to carry out its functions.
<P>
The Minister may say that the committee will be the creation of the assembly, so it will be the assembly's job to ensure that TfL and the mayor are carrying out their functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> In a moment.
<P>
The Minister may say that it is unlikely that the assembly will not give the committee the information that it requires. I agree that that is unlikely, but it is possible that the assembly may decide to protect the mayor and Transport for London and not give the Committee the information that it requires. That may be unlikely, but we should consider possible scenarios, and ensure that there is a statutory requirement to provide information. Does the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) now wish to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> The LRPC, of course, had no such statutory requirement. The hon. Gentleman began his speech by praising LRPC. How does its role suffer by not having such statutory provision as the hon. Gentleman proposes for the new body? A brief answer, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The LRPC was one of the groups which suggested tabling such an amendment. Clearly, it believed that having that power in the Bill would be useful. Its experience must have shown that the Committee and the House should be giving such a power to its successor body.
<P>
We hope that, in the spirit of ensuring that the statutory duty can be carried out properly, the Government will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In introducing the amendment, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was somewhat dismissive of the body that he and his hon. Friends have been arguing since the beginning of our proceedings should be the major power centre in the Greater London authority's assembly.
The amendment has to do with the provision of information to the London Transport Users Committee. Again, this is unnecessary: the LTUC will inevitably not be able to carry out its function without access to information. It is equally the case that, given that we want to ensure that the voice of the passenger is heard, it will be in Transport for London's interests, in delivering high-quality services to their passengers, to listen to that voice when it is transmitted to it by the offices of the London Transport Users Committee.
<P>
For the future, we are looking to the examples that already exist of the helpful and constructive negotiations that have been going on as far as LRPC and LT are concerned with regard to penalty fares. It will be in the interests of Transport for London, as it is in the interests of passengers within the Greater London area, that the relationship between LTUC and Transport for London should be positive, open and co-operative. However, I have to say to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that, should that not occur, the power in this instance rests with the assembly. The assembly has the power to ask for that information, and it has the power to pass on the information to the LTUC. Given the certainty that relevant information--other than that which is commercially confidential or could be deemed to be intrusive on either a personal or personnel level--will be available to the LTUC, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> We heard in earlier debates that the power of the assembly will not be quite as great as the Government seek to make out. It is our concern that the assembly might not be able to ensure that the Committee gets that information, and might not be able to stand up strongly enough to the mayor. That is one reason why we believe it important to have a statutory requirement.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Yet again, the hon. Gentleman is confusing powers. The central, overriding purpose and powers of the assembly rest within its scrutinising role within the GLA. The idea that information will not be accessible and available to the assembly is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was referring specifically to those scrutinising powers. When we debated those in Committee, we saw that they were not as great as those which bodies such as this House or councils often have. The assembly's powers of scrutiny are not as clear and strong as Ministers seem to pretend. That is why bodies such as the committee--
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I really am most concerned about this, Mr. Winterton. If I remember correctly, the only argument that the hon. Gentleman could advance in previous debates, when he wished to prove that the assembly does not have the relevant scrutinising powers, was that the powers in the Bill do not allow the assembly within the GLA to summon the Secretary of State. Everywhere else, the powers intrinsic to the duties of the assembly have to do with scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister makes our point for us. We believed that it was very important that the Secretary of State should be able to be summoned. The Minister laughs, but I think that members of the Committee would want to ensure that the Secretary of State will be held to account.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> In a second. The Minister should restrain herself. We have all seen how ubiquitous the Secretary of State is in the Bill and how many powers he or she will have to intervene in the way that Transport for London is run. The assembly is limited in its powers of scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene for the third time. With regard to the powers of the Secretary of State, the hon. Gentleman was clearly arguing, given his acceptance of the huge power base that the assembly comprises in terms of its powers to scrutinise, that the assembly should be able to overturn the House of Commons, which is the supreme legislative power. The assembly's powers to scrutinise the mayor are the reason for its existence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I think that the Minister is trying to put two powers together and drawing the wrong conclusion. The issue of scrutiny, and ensuring that someone comes to the Committee to answer to it, is not about the Committee's ability to overturn the decisions of the Secretary of State or the House of Commons. The point is to require the Secretary of State to appear in public, answer Questions and provide information. That is where the Bill has failed time and again. If the new committee is not given statutory power, perhaps the Secretary of State will not have to provide information; we have already seen that he or she will not be providing it to the assembly. The Minister has intervened on me three times, but she has failed to deal with that point. Clearly, the Minister will not accept the amendment. However, my hon. Friends do not wish me to withdraw it and we shall therefore divide the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I shall make only a brief intervention in interrogatory mode. It concerns the potential for the London Transport Users Committee to have any investigative powers relating to air transport. On the face of it, clause 173 means that any such investigation would 897 898 be ultra vires for the committee, even to the extent that it arose from an unsolicited request from the general public.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister explained the greater powers and wider ambit that will be available to the LTUC as against the old LRPC. It may be that surface transport facilities, which are available to passengers in airports in the Greater London area, could, prima facie, be a matter for the transport users Committee to consider. Will the Minister explain whether the committee could, for example, consider passenger handling facilities--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am finding it extremely difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman. will those Labour Members who are carrying on conversations do so extremely quietly or, preferably, not at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Will the committee be able to consider passenger handling facilities at London City airport and London Heathrow airport for scheduled services and those at Biggin Hill and RAF Northolt for unscheduled business aviation services? That is worth knowing. It could set a precedent if the Minister explained whether such powers exist and whether the clause precludes such an investigation by the transport users Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggested an amendment to the clause. I do not suggest that I am more discriminating than the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, but I did not table it; to be fair to the hon. Gentleman, nobody did.
<P>
The chamber was concerned that the widening of the Committee's responsibilities beyond those held by the LRPC would downgrade the attention that was paid to passengers. It proposed a limitation in its amendment. However, I found the suggestion slightly paradoxical. I moved amendments that the chamber had suggested to schedule 8 of paragraph 2(3) on the need for experience within the membership of transport for London.
<P>
Before we leave clause 173, I would he grateful if the Minister said how the attention that the LRPC has given passengers--attention that all of us have praised--can be sustained when the remit goes much wider, in line with Transport for London's responsibilities.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I obviously am as discriminating as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster because the LRPC suggested an amendment to me and my hon. Friends that was similar to that suggested by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The LRPC expressed concern that, under the clause, the new committee's powers would be much wider than those of the LRPC. There was concern that the passenger's voice would be diminished. The LRPC suggested that there could be many conflicts between users of the highways and users of public transport if the new committee looked after the interests of users of the highways, as suggested in subsection (4). It suggested what might happen if a user of the highways was concerned about a bus stop that was to be put in the road and which might get in the way of cars, but which might improve the availability and accessibility of public transport for Londoners. Like the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, I was not completely convinced by that argument.
<P>
The new Committee will benefit from having to weigh up conflicting interests. It will need to ensure that London's public transport system takes account of other users of the highways and does not ride roughshod over them. It is important that it grapples with those issues, just as other decision makers have to grapple with them. That does not mean that it cannot be the voice of the passenger, but it should take into account how public transport impinges on other users of the highway in the capital. We therefore chose not to move those amendments, but we would like the Minister to explain how the Government feel about that--whether the widening of the new Committee's remit as compared with that of the LRPC will create problems and, if so, how the Government feel such problems could be overcome.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall first address the concerns of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the powers of the LTUC to make representations on behalf of air passengers.
<P>
As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, there is already a body representing the interests of air passengers, namely, the Air Transport Users Council. As we have said before in response to concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised about air transport, although there is no direct power as such arising from the mayor's integrated transport strategy regarding concerns about, for example, the possible expansion of airports and the resulting potential environmental damage, he or she will most definitely have a voice on spatial development strategy and certainly on environmental concerns.
<P>
As for the point made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and, from a slightly different perspective, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton on concerns expressed by the LRPC in the one instance and in the other by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that the LTUC would, by virtue of its wider remit, cease to be the effective voice for the passenger, I cannot conceive of that.
<P>
As I pointed out when I spoke to the first clause dealing with this subject, we are looking with a new perspective at what constitutes transport--and what constitutes integrated transport--within the GLA. For some time we have been at pains to argue that the needs of, for example, pedestrians and cyclists are valid concerns and must be considered--indeed, local authorities are considering them. They must be integral to the mayor's considerations when creating a properly integrated transport strategy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton talked about what is perceived to be an imbalance in the vying claims of road surface users. The LRPC expressed concern to me that it might be asked to argue for the interests of car users. We are not looking to the LTUC to prioritise in that way the concerns of individual passenger groups. We want it to be the voice of the passenger, but also the voice of all those transport users who would not necessarily regard themselves as passengers. The most obvious examples are people who walk and cyclists, but other groups can also make justifiable claims on LTUC to be represented.
<P>
The LTUC itself is not a decision-making body; it represents the concerns of transport users in London. If it is not the right body to take a particular complaint to, it will certainly know to whom the complainant should turn to ensure that his or her concerns are raised. In the light of the past record of the LRPC and the dedication, commitment and energy that its members have brought to their functions, I think it highly unlikely that there would be a shortfall in the representation of passengers' concerns. However, the new body will be appointed by the assembly. If the assembly decided a few years after the creation of the GLA that there should be an increase in facilities to help the work of the LTUC, that would be in its power.
<P>
Clause 173 will impose a duty on the LTUC to consider and make recommendations on any matter that affects the functions of the GLA or Transport for London, and which has been the subject of representations made to the Committee by or on behalf of transport users, or has been referred to it by Transport for London or the GLA. The LTUC may also take an interest in cases that it believes that it should consider.
<P>
The clause will empower the LTUC to act as a one-stop shop in its assistance with any complaint about transport in London. As I have already said, if the committee cannot deal with a complaint, it will be able to tell the complainant of other bodies that can help.
<P>
The LTUC will be able to consider any matter affecting the services and facilities provided by Transport for London and its subsidiaries, those provided under an agreement between Transport for London and another party, and those authorised by Transport for London. We intend that provision to cover complaints from taxi and minicab users, but only those that do not fall within the remit of the Public Carriage Office.
<P>
I have been at some pains to point out that one factor has been central to all the Government's deliberations regarding the creation of the GLA, the assembly and the mayoral strategies for integrated public transport. That factor has been that the voice of the passenger must be represented and heard. The LTUC will carry on the remarkably good work of the London Regional Passengers Committee, although the new body's remit will be wider than that of the old one. I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister's detailed response confirms what I suspected during the debate on clause 171 stand part. The transition arrangements for London Underground are not covered by clause 173. The Minister said that she would examine the matter; nevertheless, this was the right moment to make my point.

</UL></FONT><P>
The purpose of the amendment is to guarantee that Transport for London and the GLA give the the LTUC the reasons for their decisions. That would help the committee to learn about the thinking of members of the assembly and of those who run Transport for London and to react to it, rather than giving a simple response to their recommendations. It would therefore be more appropriate for reasons to be given in detail.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has moved an amendment that is typical of the over-prescriptive approach that Liberal Democrat Members have taken, especially to part IV of the Bill.

It is unnecessary for the Bill to define how the mayor and the assembly should do everything. There will be a statutory requirement for the LTUC to be notified of decisions. Neither the authority nor Transport for London is likely to supply a decision with no reasons attached. Including an explanation of a decision is a matter of good practice, not a matter for legislation. Apart from an obsession with being over-prescriptive, there is no reason to include such a requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In an ideal world, I would have spoken immediately after the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. In a sense, my comments will now act as a coda to what the Minister said.
<P>
Under clauses 51, 56 and 59, we will be prevented from knowing what advice is given to the mayor on several subjects. The Minister for London and Construction has taken the line throughout our discussions that, under administrative law, it is considered desirable, indeed normal, for public authorities to behave reasonably.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although answers given, without stated reasons, may be reasonable, it is not unreasonable that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton should have asked, in this instance, for the reasons to be spelt out. That is especially the case for clauses 51, 56 and 59 whereby, because of the ministerial mode that the Government are conferring on the executive role of the mayor, and in a manner previously unfamiliar to local government, great chunks of advice, underlying argument and logic will exist but will not be available to the general public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman gave a far more effective response to the Minister than I had planned to do. He referred to administrative law and the restrictions relating to that. I wish to add to his helpful comments to the Minister. She accused the Liberal Democrats of being too prescriptive in our amendments to the Bill. If she examines them, she will find that we are prescriptive where we feel that it is important that the assembly--or the London Transport Users Committee--has a 901 902 protected and properly defined role and clearly designated powers. That is where we have chosen to be prescriptive.
<P>
We have approached other matters from another angle. We have tried to persuade the Government to be less prescriptive and to remove all the powers that have been given to other bodies. That would improve accountability and the powers of the organisations that will deal with the detailed operations of the Greater London authority. Therefore we have not been completely prescriptive--on the contrary--but it is important that the obligations of Transport for London and the authority to the London Transport Users Committee are detailed in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): Once again, the Liberal Democrats misunderstand the roles of the assembly, the mayor and the London Transport Users Committee. We constantly repeat the argument that it will be for the assembly, in its scrutinising role, to examine the issues. The members of the assembly will be democratically elected politicians representing Londoners. They will fulfil that duty and, therefore, the requirement of the amendment in relation to detailed decisions would be prescriptive. How far would the reasons for decisions go? Pages and pages of reports and documents could be required when politicians, through their scrutiny role, examine the issues and, within the context of the assembly, display the decisions for everyone to see.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill), as he has throughout the Committee, has put forward a clearer and better explanation than I gave to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will know, of course, that the mayor will always be open to legal challenge if he or she does not appear to behave reasonably. I also point out that the assembly, as well as having a detailed scrutiny role, will be a public body and its decisions will therefore be public. The reasons will be public if it decides on something proposed by the London Transport Users Committee. It is common sense and good practice throughout central and local government that, where a decision is given, the reasons for the decision are also given. The amendment is unnecessary, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The only encouragement I get from the Minister's reply is that she expects any response to the London Transport Users Committee to contain detail. I hope that the members of the committee will read Hansard and say to the assembly and the mayor that that is what Parliament intended. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
Government say yes to that--as I hope they will today--the sooner we will be able to legislate, the sooner the charging regime can start and the sooner we can clear the backlog.
<P>
The cab trade may have hoped that it would not have to pay--that would be its preferred option--but if the choice is between waiting years for a test or paying for one and taking it much more quickly, on balance I think that people wanting to be black cab drivers would prefer to pay and be dealt with more quickly. I therefore hope that the hon. Lady's new clause is given a fair wind. She knows that it has the support of Liberal Democrat Members.
<P>
I have a couple of other points. The Association of London Government wants to know whether after the GLA is set up the designation of taxi cab ranks will be the responsibility of Transport for London, even on those roads that are still borough roads. I do not hold a brief either way. I can see the logic of such decisions being made by the body that runs the cab trade; on the other hand, if parking issues in some streets are determined by boroughs, there ought to be co-decisions rather than imposed decisions.
<P>
The current regulation of the way in which the record of black cab drivers is dealt with is unsatisfactory. At the moment--my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham elicited this information--if a complaint is made against a cab driver, whether or not it is corroborated, it remains on his record for the rest of his driving career. I do not think that that is appropriate. If we believe in the rehabilitation of offenders, surely we also believe in the rehabilitation, in terms of their private records, of people who were never proved to have offended in the first place.
<P>
There is a wider issue about whether it is appropriate for any conviction of a black cab driver to remain on his record for the whole of his career, with no explanation of the purpose for which it can be used. I am fully aware of the important and sensitive issues involved, but we need to ensure that the rules regulating minicab drivers and black cab drivers do not treat them unfairly relative to anyone else with the same relationship to the public. I am not arguing that if, under the new regime, one takes the public service job--even though one is a private operator--of driving a minicab or a black cab, one should not have an additional responsibility; but I want to 
know that there is not a different regime which prejudices the career 15, 20 or 25 years later of a black cab driver who once in his first five years might have been guilty of criminal damage.
<P>
Finally, I want to ask about the appeals system. There is no established consultation procedure under the Metropolitan Public Carriage Office and no clear independent appeals system--unless it has just come into operation; the Minister may be able to give me an answer--on the things that matter to cab drivers, such as the advertising regime. For example, if a cab driver wants advertising on his cab, he can apply but he may be turned down. There is then the right to appeal. There is general concern in the industry that appeals are not independently scrutinised. One written answer stated that there would be an independent appeals system, and I wonder whether that will come into operation so that there will be independent scrutiny.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I have tabled new clauses about smoking; I hope that they will find a favourable response. I will leave my hon. Friends to talk about the outer London, cross-London county boundary issues later.
<P>
I hope that as a result of this debate we will achieve, first, a much more accountable operation of the black cab trade in London; secondly, thank goodness, a much more accountable system operation of the new licensed mini-cab trade in London; and, thirdly, a trade that works for both the user and those who supply the service. By and large, one of the great delights of the London scene is that black cabs do an increasingly good job. I pay tribute to the people who do that job, who often do so with cheerfulness and political content, much to the amusement of their passengers. Almost overwhelmingly, they serve the public extremely well; they are an important and valuable part of the London scene.
<P>
If we need more black cabs, we should be able to get them. Under the GLA, we should have a modernised version of the Public Carriage Office. I hope that the Government will give us a modern view of how to regulate the public hire car trade in London in this afternoon's debate.
