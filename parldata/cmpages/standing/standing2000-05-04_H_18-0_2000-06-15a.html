<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<b>Mr. Richard Ottaway (Croydon, South):</b> We are now in the exhilarating world of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949. I will be brief, as I know that the Financial Secretary has to be elsewhere shortly. I want to make four primary points, and I imagine that the Treasury has had the opportunity to consider them all.
<P>
The first point concerns the definition of indefeasible rights to use telecommunications cable systems. Many feel that the definition should be extended to cover radio and satellite transmission parts, and preferably future transmission media yet to be defined, as well as relevant telecommunications technology and dark fibre if it is not already included. The matter is of some interest to the industry, so perhaps the Financial Secretary could tackle it.
<P>
My second point is that the industry feels that the legislation discriminates against IRUs entered into before 21 March 2000. Given that indefeasible rights of use are a recent development and that contracts normally have a life of 12 to 22 years, it would seem equitable to permit relief for IRUs entered into before 21 March 2000 at least to have effect from that date.
<P>
Thirdly, the legislation seems to discriminate against IRUs acquired from an associate or an associated company. The industry finds it difficult to understand such discrimination and considers that transfer pricing rules should be sufficient to deal with the subject.
<P>
Fourthly, the legislation deals only with disposals of acquired IRUs and does not deal with the tax treatment of the grantor of an IRU. Clarification of that tax treatment is urgently required.
<P>
I appreciate that those are all highly technical points, but I know that the Financial Secretary's response will be of interest beyond the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those points and the way in which he made them. The clause and schedule 23 provide for tax relief to be given, as announced in the previous Budget, for the cost of acquiring third generation spectrum licences and any other spectrum licences auctioned in future. Relief will also be given for the cost of acquiring, on or after 21 March 2000, capacity on telecommunications cables, which is known as indefeasible rights of use. Receipts from the disposal of those rights will be taxable.
<P>
The rights are now regarded as capital assets, and the acquisition cost does not qualify for deduction. However, the cost does not qualify for capital allowances. The clause and schedule will remedy the gap by providing that the IRUs will be treated as revenue items and relieved over the life of the rights. Any receipts for disposal of all or part of such rights will be taxed as trading receipts. That will level the playing field in matching relief enjoyed in other tax administrations and help to open up the on-line world to competition.
<P>
Relief will be spread over the life of the asset. The cost to the Exchequer will depend in part on how much is paid for the licences or IRUs, but the net cost to the Exchequer is expected to be negligible in practice, as most operators will manage to secure relief by holding licences in an offshore subsidiary and paying the subsidiary a royalty or rental fee that is deductible for tax purposes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked some specific questions. It has been suggested that the relief provided by the schedule might be extended to IRUs in all types of transmission path. As the Budget resolution that covers the clause and the schedule relates only to telecommunications cable systems, it might be difficult to widen the provision at this stage. In fact, the Budget announcement related to IRUs in international submarine cables, as that was the object of the representations made to us.
<P>
Immediately after Budget day, we received several queries about why the relief was so restricted. As a result, we decided that relief should be available for all IRUs in telecommunications cable systems, in accordance with the representations that we had received at that stage. Following the Budget resolutions, further representations were made for IRUs in other media, not just in cable systems, and it might be appropriate to consider extending relief in that way. We have already announced that we shall consider the possibility of providing tax relief next year for other intangible assets, and we shall consider the case for other types of IRU as part of that review.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about extending relief beyond the application in the Bill to include the acquisition, disposal or revaluation of IRUs. I do not believe that that is necessary. The original representations that we received about IRUs related to the business cost of acquiring the IRU, which did not qualify for tax relief. The aim of the new provision, therefore, is to provide relief for the cost of those particular intangible assets following depreciation shown in the accounts. It is logical that, when the person who acquires the IRU disposes of it or revalues it in his accounts, we should be able effectively to claw back excess tax relief by charging the disposal receipt or the revaluations.
<P>
The owner of a cable already qualifies for capital allowances on the cost of installing the cable. If, on finding that he has certain capacity, he grants an IRU, he is disposing of a capital asset and will therefore be liable to tax on the capital gain. If, however, he built the cable with the intention of selling off part of the capacity for profit, he will be liable to tax on the consideration as a trading receipt. In both cases, he will continue to own the cable and enjoy capital allowances on its original cost. That is a logical arrangement.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the possibility of removing revaluations from the scope of the schedule. Paragraph 3 of schedule 23 ensures that any increase in the value of the licence or IRU that is recognised in the accounts, even if it is not taken to the profit and loss account, is charged as income, regardless of where it is credited in the accounts. Amortisation of that higher value will be relieved as and when it is taken to the profit and loss account.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman's suggestion were accepted, taxpayers could keep revaluing their licences or IRUs, thereby increasing the amount on which depreciation could be claimed, and no compensating tax charge would apply. Therefore, if the directors thought that previous amortisation rates had been excessive, they could correct the position on the balance sheet by revaluing the asset, but the excessive tax relief already enjoyed would not be clawed back. Nevertheless, they would in future be able to claim amortisation of the revalued amount. That would not be a sensible or prudent arrangement.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's helpful questions on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I declare what is for once a genuine interest. I hope that the Financial Secretary will seriously consider the tax treatment of IRUs in non-cable telecommunications assets; the United States authorities have switched the accounting treatments so that the revenue is recognised even though the cash flow may come from the sale of an IRU at the front end. The revenue is to be recognised across the life of the IRU, usually about 10 years, and it makes abundant sense in that domain too for the tax treatment and the accounting treatment in the United Kingdom to follow the United States pattern. I was encouraged to hear that the Minister will take note of that; whether action is taken this year or next year is immaterial, but it is important that it should be taken soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I assure the Committee that we will carefully consider the matter.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposals deal with capital gains tax anti-avoidance measures. I want to make two points of principle before I speak to the amendment. First, I have observed a tendency in recent years in language and approach for avoidance and evasion to be viewed as the same thing; sometimes the words are used in the wrong context. My hobby-horse is that one of the great strengths of anglo-saxon civilisation is the clarity of the law and the difference between avoidance and evasion—between what is within and without the law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that only the anglo-saxon nations have clear law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will be more patient, my point will become apparent. In Germany there is no such distinction within the law and millions of Germans evade tax on interest, which is socially acceptable. It has been the cause of the unwise withholding tax proposals, which I commend the Government for resisting.
<P>
A strict line between what is within and without the law helps to keep a society honest; if that line is blurred, it permits what is not honest. Companies and individuals will, naturally, try to keep their tax liabilities as low as possible within the law, and it is the job of Government to ensure that they cannot do so. Evasion is a different matter, and should always be treated as such.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, our tax laws have been hugely cluttered with anti-avoidance measures introduced by the Government and by the previous Administration. There is little point in having a splendid committee to consider the drafting of tax law and trying to simplify it when the problem is the complications of the underlying legislation.
<P>
Avoidance occurs largely when taxation rates are perceived as unacceptably high by those on whom they fall. In Hong Kong, there is a 20 per cent. tax on everything; there is a consensus to pay it and no tax avoidance industry, and tax law remains simple. United Kingdom Governments could learn an important lesson from Hong Kong; our tax law is becoming over-complex for business and will inevitably lead to injustices because of the almost paranoid attempt to deal with all potential avoidance schemes.
<P>
The amendment is designed not to oppose the measure in principle but to draw attention to situations in which innocent transactions may be affected, when employee trusts, charities or bona fide trustee ownership of corporate assets may be improperly or unfairly damaged by the measures.
<P>
Clause 89 removes the long-established holdover relief on gifts of shares to a company; the Government say that the measure is to combat tax avoidance schemes in which holdover relief is claimed as part of a scheme to on-sell the shares, and hence to escape capital gains tax. If it is designed to avoid people or companies who make genuine gifts and do not receive any value from the transactions, the amendment should be flagged as an anti-avoidance measure and pegged to the avoidance scheme referred to in the explanatory notes. The amendment would add arrangements to catch avoidance schemes, however staggered, for the transferor to generate value from the gift for himself or a connected person.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Good morning, Mr. Cook.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the difference between evasion and avoidance. In such complex areas, it is not always entirely clear where one starts and the other begins, but, as he said, avoidance is achieved by the use of the law. People therefore describe it as within the law; it generates many complex arguments about the nature of our legislation and about Parliament's intent—an even greyer area, which I shall not go into.
<P>
Evasion is illegal; it is an outright challenge to the law. I take the hon. Gentleman's first point if he means that all Governments must be careful about how they use those terms and what they understand them to be. However, all Governments—including the previous Government—become anxious when avoidance schemes result in massive loss of revenue, which the legislation clearly does not intend.
<P>
The second reason for avoidance that the hon. Gentleman cited was the high level of tax. If only it were that simple. I would not dispute that it is a contributory factor, but the schemes that we are considering in relation to the amendment relate to people wanting to pay no tax on capital gains, which is a different matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In the proposals that we debated earlier on taper relief and business asset relief, the Government have recognised that capital gains tax at 40 per cent. is perceived as too high and leads people to try avoidance schemes. The problem is that once people start to incur the legal costs of avoidance schemes, they will try to avoid all liability. It is a question of the consent to pay, and of avoidance schemes not being worth the hassle.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorely tempted to go down that route, but it would be out of order. The hon. Gentleman is being somewhat selective in terms of identifying a particular tax rate as a drive for avoidance. It is an interesting debating point, and we would have some common ground on his general points.
<P>
I want to make a second point before responding specifically to the amendment. The clauses that we are about to debate are aimed at avoidance schemes now in operation in the tax system. They operate for the benefit of a few very wealthy individuals but lead to a substantial loss to the Revenue. That is something that has exercised the minds of the previous Government and ourselves.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point, which is a theme of his amendments, is on the vexed question of whether such provisions, in any of the clauses, inadvertently catch what are called innocent transactions. Such transactions are undertaken for genuine commercial reasons. We have tried to respond directly to complex but narrow issues—hence the complexity of the clauses—and target only those points. I refer the hon. Gentleman to a quote from a leading article of Taxation of 13 April this year. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The one saving feature of the anti-avoidance provisions for trust schemes is that they are carefully targeted and I would be surprised if they have inadvertent application to innocent transactions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 89 gives effect to the measure that the Chancellor announced in his pre-Budget report. Its purpose is to stop people putting valuable shares or securities into United Kingdom companies as a first step in a scheme to avoid tax. It achieves that by denying business asset gifts relief on the transfer, so that any unrealised gains are charged at that time. That aspect of gifts relief was being used primarily for tax avoidance. When used for bona fide reasons, other reliefs, such as that available on the incorporation of a business, or that for company reorganisations, can be used to achieve the desired effect. On the question of whether bona fide commercial activities would be affected, other provisions in the tax system would achieve the same objective. Therefore, it was unnecessary to retain the relief to enable certain financial transactions to proceed.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the scope of the clause so that it would bite only where, at the time of transfer, there are no plans for the shares or securities to be sold by the company in question or the transferor to derive any value from them.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I am not attracted by the proposal. First, it might be difficult in practice to prove that such plans existed. The hon. Gentleman recognises that in his amendment, which refers to not only arrangements in existence but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>arrangements for arrangements to come into existence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We could go further and have a third or fourth tier of arrangements, but that would serve no useful purpose because the evidential trail could be well nigh impossible to establish. As the manoeuvres are very expensive, the tax avoider would do his utmost to ensure that that was the case. A huge amount of energy and time would be invested in trying to deal with that situation.
<P>
Secondly, the Revenue has seen many avoidance schemes in which the shares or securities are not sold, but the shares in the company to which they were transferred or in the company that owns that company were sold instead. For example, valuable shares have been gifted to companies that were under the control of people who obtained relief under the business expansion scheme. The business expansion scheme shares were then sold to a third party and the gain on those shares was exempt from capital gains tax. Such schemes, which will be prevented from succeeding by the clause, would be reprieved by the amendment. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman was seeking to achieve that.
<P>
The clause is designed to prevent a large number of avoidance schemes from succeeding. That will result in a substantial saving of tax. We have not heard of any examples of genuine commercial transactions for which gifts relief was formerly used that cannot now be satisfactorily effected by using other capital gains reliefs. Therefore, the measure clearly needs to be effective—the amendment would render it ineffective.
<P>
I also inform the hon. Gentleman that provisions such as those in the clause have already been successful in dealing with the type of avoidance to which I have referred. On that basis, I hope that I have given him enough reassurance that bona fide commercial practices have other methods for achieving the aim of his amendment. The amendment is therefore unnecessary, and would render the clause ineffective. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment; if he does not, I will have to ask the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I want to make a point that is broader than the scope of the amendment but relevant to all of the clauses that contain specific, detailed amendments to the law on capital gains tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) said that the Inland Revenue had to fight a constant battle to contain avoidance of capital gains tax and to redefine evasion. There is an obvious reason why that CGT is especially exposed to relatively sophisticated, expensive avoidance schemes and why every Finance Bill contains a tranche of amendments to the law on that tax that block up the year's new schemes marketed by tax planners. When I sat in the Paymaster General's seat, I proposed three sets of amendments, but was never confident that I would not need to return the following year with another set. If the Paymaster General is wise, she will not be confident that she will not need to come back to the same square next year. The simple reason is that capital gains tax, uniquely in our tax code, is a voluntary transaction-based tax in the sense that it is the taxpayer's decision to dispose of assets that triggers a tax liability based solely on that transaction.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are two unavoidable characteristics of a transaction-based tax. The first—that it impedes the movement of capital from one activity to another and impairs flexibility—is highly undesirable in a modern economy. That is why capital gains is a particularly damaging tax. The second is that because it is transaction-based, it arises where there are large amounts of money, and teams of lawyers and accountants have to be employed to allow the transactions to proceed.
<P>
Firms of lawyers and accountants no longer have only tax departments but they have specialist transaction tax departments—a posh name for a capital gains tax avoidance department. Specialists are paid to devise new ways round the taxes imposed on transactions. It continues to be economic to employ such people because the sums in transactions, as opposed to the sums for income and spending tax, are more likely to be measured in millions of pounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that capital gains tax is a bad tax? If so, can he provide an example of a good tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am glad that I have communicated sufficiently to make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I believe that capital gains tax is a bad tax. It is bad because it impedes flexibility in the economy and creates a not very productive industry of people trying to think up ways around it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No. I shall complete the second part of my answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. All taxes do some damage to the economic process, but a tax that arises solely as a result of transactions is different—in kind, not just degree—from continuing taxes on profits, earnings, spending, and so forth. In the context of a very fast-changing economy, this different form of taxation is far more damaging than income and spending taxes. That damage has become greater over the past 10 or 15 years as the rate of economic change has become faster.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is the abolition of capital gains tax Conservative party policy, or is he revolting against his party's failure to commit itself to such action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I bear no responsibility for my party's policy on this matter. I am simply advancing an important point, but I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will listen to it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am enjoying this exchange, but I hope that we shall return quickly to the subject of debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I warned you in advance, Mr. Cook, that I would seek your indulgence to make a larger point out of a narrow one. I am not against this particular tax change, but I am against a tax system that makes it an inevitable annual event. To answer the question posed by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will listen. More precisely, as they can benefit from my advice, I hope that Ministers will listen. The hon. Gentleman will not be able to accuse the Conservative party of being irresponsible by giving away tax revenue, because the force of my argument will have been accepted by the Paymaster General and it will be there in the Red Book that we shall inherit.
<P>
I do not propose to go on much longer. I shall simply recount an anecdote of my last days as Treasury Minister. I had been there for two years and had just returned from No. 10 Downing street. A senior official in the Treasury, who shall remain nameless, bounded into my room clearly very pleased to get rid of me and said, ``Congratulations, Financial Secretary, on moving on. You are only the next Financial Secretary to move on without abolishing capital gains tax.'' That might half answer the question that I have been asked.
<P>
This measure is unexceptional in itself. It is the system that gives rise to it that is exceptional and it is doing increasing damage to our economic process. I hope that hon. Members on both Front Benches will think about how the tax system can be changed to avoid the need to introduce this kind of legislation every year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her comments. I shall be withdrawing the amendment, but I should first like to make two points. The Minister says that the clause is intended to address a much wider range of potential avoidance devices than the more specific point focused on. Secondly, she said that other CGT reliefs were available to meet bona fide situations. That gives some comfort and I simply ask the Government to keep a watch on that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs for his comments. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) will be embarrassed to hear this, but I always listen carefully to what he says. I do not always agree with him. I am not sure whether when I depart the Treasury—if I ever will, I have begun to wonder—the same comment will be made to me.
<P>
The context to this issue is much wider than just CGT. First, there is the tax planning industry and the increasingly complex arrangements that it makes not to pay the tax that we think should be paid. We experience that not only with CGT; VAT is another tax for which there is a battery of anti-avoidance legislation. The wider point is about taxation. We may agree on the principle, although not on how to deal with it. The question in a fast-changing global economy is what is the appropriate role for taxation in raising the revenue for a Government who want a revenue base to fund public services and investment in society.
<P>
The question that the right hon. Gentleman poses is wider than CGT. In the past three years, the Government have tried to address it systematically in the relationship of the tax system to companies, individuals, transactions and profits, some of which the Opposition agree with, and some of which they do not. The clause was announced in the pre-Budget statement. It has the desired effect. It is now being placed in law. Regrettably, when we come to some of the other clauses, I will say that another way round has been found for a change that I made last year. I shall therefore fulfil the hon. Gentleman's prediction by saying that that is the nature of tax planning and type of challenges that all Governments face, not just us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 89 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 90</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disposal of interest in settled property:</center></H4>
deemed disposal of underlying assets
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 358, page 63, line 42, after `property', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where that disposal takes place as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is the avoidance of tax'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Here again, we have a clause with an anti-avoidance objective with which we have some sympathy. However, we are worried about the wideness of the drafting because the phrases ``interest in settled property'' and ``for consideration'' could mean whatever the Inland Revenue wants them to mean. The clause should be set out as anti-avoidance in nature to protect taxpayers against inadvertently triggering tax charges through, for example, restructuring settlement for convenience. We did not want to devise a raft of amendments to the schedule that could open up the possibility of keeping loopholes. We do not want to take a general anti-avoidance stance, but the principle of applying the clause to situations, the purpose of which is tax avoidance, seems to be fair.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 90 and schedule 24 prevent the avoidance of capital gains tax by individuals who place assets in a United Kingdom trust and sell their interest in the trust to someone else. Any gain arising on the disposal of an interest in a UK trust is not generally chargeable to capital gains tax. That exemption was being exploited in a big way by people setting up trusts essentially for their own benefit and transferring valuable assets to them. The scheme took many forms, but, in essence, instead of the assets being sold by the trustees to a third party, the settlor—the person who had transferred his or her assets to the trust—was selling his interest in the trust to that person. That enabled the CGT exemption on the disposal of trust interests to be used in circumstances in which it was never intended to apply.
<P>
The Revenue has also become aware of that form of avoidance being used in schemes to circumvent the measure that was introduced in last year's Finance Bill, which was to prevent the sale of trust losses. That will amuse the right hon. Member for Charnwood, although it did not amuse me when it came to light. The measure was enacted to prevent substantial trust losses being sold to people with large gains. Under the arrangements, the Revenue has now become aware that trust assets standing at a gain are effectively being sold to trusts with losses—the other way round from the scheme that we attempted to block last year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Has the Paymaster General thought about asking her officials what they have in mind for next year's scheme?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Indeed I have. I have probably followed in the right hon. Gentleman's footsteps. Such a situation must have occurred when he was Financial Secretary. We scrutinise matters with great interest, hold tax-planning conferences and issue publications, and little ideas are floated. However, I think that he would accept that we must draw the line somewhere. If we legislated for everything that might happen—even if we made reasonable guesses—we would be here for an even longer time. We made similar complaints in opposition—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Just as ineffectively.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Well, it is an important negotiating position to say, ``Don't do this, because we thought that you might,'' although that simply stops people from wasting time and effort on examining such action. I always feel that introducing anti-avoidance legislation is like throwing down the gauntlet to the tax planning industry. However, as the right hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) did, we Ministers must act when the revenue loss becomes too great.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 90 and schedule 24 tackle the avoidance by charging gains on the sale for consideration of some UK trust interests. That is achieved by deeming the asset to which the interest relates to have been disposed of and reacquired at its market value by the trustees.
<P>
Amendment No. 358 would introduce a motive test so that the provisions could take effect only if the trust interest were disposed of for tax avoidance purposes. Given the points that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made about avoidance and evasion and how to distinguish the two clearly, I am a little surprised that he is now trying to make that distinction clearly in legislation.
<P>
Motive tests can be useful in some contexts, but they are not appropriate in the circumstances that relate to the anti-avoidance measures. If I may be forgiven for using rather strong language, the perpetrators of the abuse—the Government see it as a misuse of the legislation—would do their best to ensure that no conclusive evidence of a tax avoidance motive could exist. That relates to the exchange that the right hon. Member for Charnwood and I had. We are talking about large-scale avoidance. We estimate that the measures will produce about £200 million of extra revenue and protect a further £300 million, although a health warning accompanies that estimate.
<P>
The provisions are carefully targeted. They will bite only when a trust interest is disposed of for consideration and when the trust property comprises assets in which the settlor has retained an interest or has had such an interest at any time in the previous two tax years. When someone is reaping the rewards of gains generated in the trust, it is perfectly reasonable that the gains on the relevant underlying trust property should be charged to tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Clearly, the measures will be effective in helping to close a loophole for those who seek to avoid tax, although one cannot say that a new loophole will not emerge. Does my hon. Friend agree that one important effect of such legislation is to reinforce the Government's stance that those who use trusts as vehicles not for investment, but for tax avoidance, are engaging in an unacceptable practice? We rightly seek to shut down such practices.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> To put it in simple language, those who play with fire can expect to get their fingers burnt. The Government will not allow certain lines to be crossed and, in fairness, nor did the previous Government. That is a clear message.
<P>
The effect of the measures will be entirely proportionate. We do not believe that they are likely to affect many innocent cases. We see no need for a motive test, and cannot afford to risk weakening the effectiveness of the provisions in preventing the intricate avoidance schemes. We cannot say that we are going to close the loophole in that way, then back off and allow the opportunity to be exploited. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to withdraw the amendment, or I shall have to ask the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her response. Although I do not like motive tests, one should and does use them when they are the easiest way in which to make the dividing line clear between evasion and avoidance.
<P>
I was slightly sad that the Paymaster General said that she did not think that the clause would affect many innocent cases. I wish that the ``m'' had been missing and that the clause would not affect any.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was trying to be fair and honest with the Committee. I cannot say never with my hand on my heart. I believe that the measures are targeted so that we do not need a motive test and deal only with those seeking to avoid paying tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I broadly accept that 99.9 per cent. of the cases arising on the sale of assets are likely to fall within the area of what we all seek to stop. Based on that, and on the Paymaster General's statement that the Revenue has carefully considered the territory to establish that that is the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 90 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>NEW SCHEDULE 4A TO THE TAXATION OF</center></H4>
CHARGEABLE GAINS ACT 1992
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Twenty-fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I have a query about United Kingdom residence in paragraph 6. I think that I have discovered the reason for it, but I am a little concerned that the provision is so wide. The schedule is about trusts in which the settlor retains an interest. We are aware of the potential for abuse in such circumstances The Bill seeks to create a capital gains tax charge in certain eventualities, especially when the settlor disposes of an interest. As I understand it, in those circumstances the trustees will face the capital gains tax bill.
<P>
I am worried that that could hit people living abroad who use the United Kingdom to set up trusts. It is a good place in which to do so because of the clarity and certainty in our tax system, as was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. People come here from abroad from time to time; Britain is a metropolitan centre in that sense, and we have sophisticated capital markets. For all those reasons, people set up trusts in London.
<P>
Therefore, one can imagine a situation in which a foreigner who has never dreamt of living in this country creates a trust here for members of his family— perhaps for his extended family, including his grandchildren and even his cousins. He may be a man of considerable wealth who lives in another country and wants to create a trust but retains an interest as a settlor. That settlor comes to the country on an extended visit and is therefore classified as a resident for a certain tax year. To do so, he need live here for only 190 days.
<P>
One can then imagine that he returns to his country, where he lives for another four years. He is unconnected with this country and never comes here again or dreams of becoming resident or domiciled here. At some future date, he decides to sell his interest in the settlement because he wants to raise some money. Paragraph 6 of the schedule bites at that point, as I understand it, and the UK trustees would be assessed for capital gains tax. That is curious and unfair, given the tenuous relationship between the settlor and the trust and the settlor and this country. It is unclear why a tax charge should be made in the circumstances. I cannot believe that that is the schedule's purpose but, in trying to set up anti-avoidance systems, we are casting the net ever wider to catch the abusive schemes.
<P>
I would not want the United Kingdom to win a reputation as a place that sweeps up a lot of innocent schemes—years, perhaps, after their creation—because of anti-avoidance provisions. Will the Paymaster General enlighten us as to whom those provisions are designed to catch and whether they will catch people who set up trusts but live abroad?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman refers to the five-year requirement, which is contained in paragraph 6. It may come as some surprise to him, but I agree that Governments should be careful about how they enact anti-avoidance legislation and how widely the net is cast. They should also consider whether that legislation would have a negative effect on a range of issues connected with the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a place of investment.
<P>
As the right hon. Gentleman knows, a debate has been going on for some time about whether there should be specifically targeted anti-avoidance measures of the kind that are in the Bill. Should there be complex legislation—I freely admit that it is complex—to deal with a complex issue, targeted at a specific area? Should Governments approach the matter through a broader general anti-avoidance rule? The Government have considered those issues closely and, in the past year, have consulted about VAT. We proposed two options to deal with the question whether we should have a directly targeted measure or a mini anti-avoidance measure. Everyone agreed that the targeted measure was a better way forward. That is also true in this case.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman described a disincentive effect. I am not aware, and nor is the Revenue, of that occurring. The five-year rule is needed to give protection from the charged trusts set up by overseas residents who have no connection with the UK. Five years seemed a perfectly reasonable length of time to establish whether such a connection existed.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is no specific requirement for a foreign settlor to set up a trust with UK trustees, so in most cases trustees will be resident overseas. If the right hon. Gentleman is using the example to make a cautionary point about anti-avoidance legislation, I agree with him. All Governments should be careful in the way that he describes. However, I do not believe that the five-year rule is a problem in connection with overseas settlors.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our four amendments are designed to avoid employee share benefit trusts being affected by the anti-avoidance measures that we have discussed. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. Clearly, it would be extremely unfortunate if an employee share trust incurred UK tax penalties and was unable to utilise historic losses, for example, to cover new gains, because it had been acquiring shares in the market over time, while the share price had been falling and rising.
<P>
The clause inserts the wide definition of trustee borrowing that is in schedule 25. In practice, employee trusts often—
<P>
THE CHAIRMAN'S attention having been called to the fact that thirteen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and thirteen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I was about to say that, in practice, employee trusts often borrow funds from a group parent company in connection with the agreement to take on obligations to deliver shares to a group of employees. It would be more sensible and easier simply to exclude employee share schemes from the schedule, rather than seek to provide an exhaustive list of specific amendments to each paragraph of the schedule. Amendment No. 359 excludes new schemes set up under schedule 8 and, more widely, all employee share trusts following the definition in section 86 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, which requires an element of all-employee participation as beneficiaries.
<P>
Amendment No. 360 deals broadly with the same territory. A wide definition of interest in settled property is covered in schedule 24 and that could extend to a situation where a company had established an employee trust and was taken over by another company which, under the terms of the takeover, also assumed the first company's powers and rights under the trust deed. An example of the Government's not knowing what the right and left hands might be doing is that the new provision could catch their new all-employee share ownership plan. I am sure that the Government want people to use the AESOP and not to use it as a tax evasion device.
<P>
Amendment No. 362 is broadly in the same territory as amendment No. 359. Amendment No. 365 adopts a belt-and-braces approach and seeks to exclude employee share trusts across the board from particular anti-avoidance measures.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman explained, the amendments seek to limit the application of clauses 91 to 94 so that trusts set up for the benefit of employees, particularly the new all-employee share ownership plans introduced by the Bill, are excluded. The hon. Gentleman argues that such trusts should be excluded because they are unlikely to engage in tax avoidance and that that is recognised by section 86 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. That section identifies trusts for the benefit of employees that are potentially eligible for inheritance tax exemptions provided elsewhere in that Act. But it does not provide the exemption itself. Crucially, for the purposes of these amendments, the provisions that provide the exemption, such as sections 13 and 72 of that Act, contain additional safeguards under which the exemptions operate.
<P>
To put that another way, section 86 of the 1984 Act is drafted in wide terms to cover a range of trusts when employee status is the common characteristic of the beneficiaries, for example trusts for the benefit of all or most of the employees of a concern. It goes much wider than approved employee share schemes. Section 13 of the Act, which provides the exemptions for transfers into such a trust, includes safeguards to ensure that the exemption for transfers of value into such a trust cannot be exploited, for example, to prevent the channelling of benefits to employees who are also owners.
<P>
The result of accepting the amendments and simply latching on to the definitions in section 86 of the 1984 Act would be that there would be a range of circumstances where the protection provided by clauses 91 to 94 for capital gains tax purposes would not be available, even though the particular trust concerned would, rightly, be subject to the IHT charge. That does not seem to be an appropriate result.
<P>
I do not accept the premise of the amendments. The IHT rules reflect an IHT issue: whether it is right to regard certain trusts as a conduit for private bequests. Even if they are not so regarded, they do not necessarily deserve special treatment for other tax purposes. In general, employee benefit trusts are chargeable for capital gains tax on gains in the normal way. Special rules apply to approved schemes, but the general point still applies: that such trustees are chargeable on their capital gains.
<P>
Why, then, should the trustees of an employee benefit scheme not be subjected to the normal rules in circumstances when a gain is currently chargeable on the trustees? It is right and proper for the clause to ensure that taxation of that gain cannot be avoided. It therefore follows that the protection provided by the clauses should apply. If trustees of employee benefit schemes are chargeable on their capital gains, the anti-avoidance protection that applies generally should be applicable to them and there is no reason to take a contrary view.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 359 and will not press amendments Nos. 360, 362 and 365; otherwise, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are in complex territory; I accept that employee benefit schemes are properly chargeable to capital gains and the amendments are not intended to stop that. However, I am unhappy that clause 91 and related clauses may bring a tax liability to AESOPs and other employee trusts when that is not the intention of this or previous Governments. The Paymaster General said that the Government are satisfied with the clauses as drafted; they cause a capital gains tax liability only when it would properly apply anyway. If that is so, it is satisfactory and on that undertaking I will ask leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I shall delve more deeply into the matter myself, as I am not entirely comfortable with it.
<P>
In my previous speech, I committed the sin that I railed against earlier and used the word ``evasion'' when I should have used ``avoidance''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments would stop charitable trusts from being unfairly affected by the clause's anti-„avoidance measures. I concede that the proposals are too wide and could open up loopholes, but they are probing amendments to ensure that trusts are fairly looked after.
<P>
Clause 92 has a scattergun approach; it is a device intended to catch tax avoiders which would catch charities, because the definition of settlement is widely drawn. Amendment No. 361 would protect charities, which would otherwise be affected by the clause.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 364 and 366 were tabled to protect charities and to rectify the defects in clauses 93 and 94, whose aims we support.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has explained, the amendments would restrict the scope of clauses 92 to 94, which would thus not apply to charitable settlements that have as one of their objectives any charitable purpose or settlement when a charity is the beneficiary.
<P>
I give the hon. Gentleman the bad news first: there is no justification for the amendments to clauses 92 and 94, which relate to outright avoidance. Clause 92 relates to gain-buying when the sole purpose of the transaction is to engineer the matching of gains and losses that have accrued in different ownerships.
<P>
Clause 94 relates to offshore trusts that become resident in the United Kingdom and then become non-„resident when they can stockpile gains in an attempt to ensure that the beneficiaries can dispose of their interest in the settlement, the value of which is at least partly represented by those stockpiled gains, without incurring a tax charge. Bona fide charitable trusts should not engage in that type of avoidance transaction, and if they do it is only right and proper that they should be caught by the anti-avoidance clauses.
<P>
As for clause 93, amendment No. 364 may have a point—that is the good news. However, the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that we are in highly complex tax territory; the question whether charities investing in offshore companies should pay tax under section 13 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 goes wider than the clause, although I accept that some gains may previously have been protected by tax treaties.
<P>
I am not absolutely clear that there is a problem in practice, and in that respect I refer to my exchanges with the right hon. Member for Charnwood. For example, there is no current treaty protection for gains accruing to United States treaty corporations, but no problems have been reported. However, I have asked the Inland Revenue to examine the issues involved without prejudice and to discuss them with those who might be affected to discover whether there is a case for change. We have the ability to take action should it be necessary.
<P>
I hope that my undertaking to the Committee that the Inland Revenue will seek out those who have difficulties and discuss with them a means of dealing with their problems has helped the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her comments. Many charity lawyers will be able to engage in constructive discussion with the Revenue. In amendments Nos. 361 and 366, our intent was not to exempt charities that engaged in deliberate avoidance transactions, but to exempt those engaged in transactions for non-avoidance purposes that might have been caught under the provisions. The Minister's response was that that was unlikely to occur. I see no reason, in principle at least, why charitable trusts should be liable to capital gains tax in respect of offshore company investments, but I was pleased to hear the Minister's assurance that the Revenue will reflect further and ensure that justice is done. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>The next group of four are the most important amendments to the clause, but amendment No. 363 raises an important point of principle. The clause provides for trustees to be taxed on chargeable gains made by companies resident in a country with which there is a tax treaty that exempts those companies from tax. Clause 93 is, in a sense, a unilateral abrogation of such tax treaties by the UK, which is strange when the Government are trumpeting their intention to foster international co-operation to combat tax evasion. How do those two approaches fit together? Surely it is sending out the wrong signals to ask for co-operation and then to forget about a signed treaty.
<P>
We understand the Belgian wheeze that the Government rightly seek to block, but it carries larger issues with it. Amendment No. 363 would protect the international reputation of the UK—and, dare I say, the Chancellor—by clarifying the fact that where the Government suspect that a tax treaty is being used to perpetuate tax avoidance, it should envisage that an otherwise non-taxable gain could be taxed by the UK.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments deal with our tax treaties. The purpose of such treaties is many-fold, but is generally to ensure that a resident is taxed in the country of residence and that there is no double taxation. Double tax treaties are not in place solely to help UK residents to avoid paying tax anywhere in the world. That goes to the heart of the argument.
<P>
In responding to the amendments, I must explain why the clause is important to this package of anti-avoidance measures and why there is no case for limiting its scope as suggested by the amendment. We are dealing with the selling of assets, tax-free, through offshore close companies in which trusts participate and from which UK residents can benefit. Such increasingly common arrangements exploit tax treaty exemptions, which are intended to protect residents of other countries from double taxation, not to protect our residents from no taxation. The avoidance involves assets being placed in an offshore company underlying the trust—usually when the trust is set up and the assets are low in value. Many offshore trusts are organised in that way, though the avoidance is not confined to the offshore trusts. When the assets have risen in value, they are therefore sold by the company rather than the trustees. Tax would be paid under the relevant tax rules that apply to the trusts if the gains were to arise to the trustees. However, because the gains arise to the foreign company, we must rely on a different set of rules under section 13 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which attributes certain gains of offshore close companies to the trusts. That attribution can be prevented by the terms of tax treaties, which provide for the gains of residents of the partner country to be taxed only in that country. That exemption is intended for residents of the other country, not our own. It is not meant to protect people from legislation designed to ensure that United Kingdom residents pay tax on their gains. The clause enables that legislation to apply.
<P>
We have several variants of the device, which is a particular favourite at tax-planning conferences. Those using it seek to exploit exemptions in double taxation agreements to ensure that some large gains are taxed anywhere in the world. While most of the arrangements are wholly tax motivated, some may have a commercial purpose. Nevertheless, the same avoidance may be achieved whatever the reason for which they were set up. We are determined that double taxation agreements should not be misused in that way.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, we have the largest network of double taxation treaties of any country. They facilitate a huge range of opportunities for our companies and are the cornerstone of taking forward that ability. We cannot allow them to be undermined in that way. The clause is focused. It applies only to those who can benefit from gains of offshore companies through a trust arrangement, which is where major tax avoidance takes place. The legislation that it underpins applies only to investment gains of those companies, not to gains of tangible assets used in a trade. There will be no double taxation of any taxpayer. Relief will be given for overseas taxes charged, although little, if any, foreign tax is usually paid on those gains. That is because the companies disposing of the assets are invariably situated in treaty countries, which, for one reason or another, do not charge the gains or base their charges on a nominal amendment.
<P>
The amendment would prevent the application of clause 93 to any case in which a United Kingdom company is interposed between an offshore company that realises the gain and the trustees unless and until we negotiate with our treaty partners a provision in our double taxation agreements that allows the attribution of gains realised by offshore companies to UK resident trustees or through offshore trusts set up by UK people or from which UK people can benefit.
<P>
The avoidance activity that clause 93 seeks to counter invariably involves offshore companies resident in countries where the terms of double taxation treaties would not allow us to attribute gains in the way described in the amendment. The amendment would leave large gaps in anti-avoidance protection, which clause 93 seeks to provide, until we can plug those gaps by renegotiating our treaties. I cannot see any reason to perpetuate such loopholes, and neither do I believe that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs can. I should make it clear that, in seeking to provide effective protection against avoidance, we have introduced the proposals in clause 93. We are not taking away any taxing rights from our treaty partners, but merely reinstating a UK taxing right. There is nothing defensive in that—our treaty partners can continue to tax companies that are resident in their territory. We are simply ensuring that we can tax our own residents under our own anti-avoidance legislation. Treaties that exempt residents of the treaty partner should not be used to protect residents of this country from an appropriate charge aimed at preventing avoidance.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is internationally accepted that tax treaties, while intended to eliminate double taxation, do not permit double non-taxation. Clause 93 seeks to ensure that there is no double non-taxation whereby the person gets the gain. We all understand the importance of those treaties, and our approach has clear international precedent as an appropriate response to avoidance through the misuse of treaties for tax avoidance purposes. Work is under way at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to strengthen its members' rights to prevent such misuse of treaties. Clause 93 is entirely within the spirit of those international precedents.
<P>
The avoidance scheme under discussion is highly artificial. It relates to gains being channelled through at least three layers—the trust, the UK company, the offshore company and sometimes more. Clause 93 seeks to provide an effective solution to such schemes, which put large amounts of revenue at risk. It is appropriate to act to prevent the misuse of the treaties, as well as to protect the revenue.
<P>
We do not expect our treaty partners to be concerned with the effect of the actions that we are taking. As I said, clause 93 seeks to ensure that we can tax our own residents under our own anti-avoidance legislation. We shall not take away any taxing rights from our treaty partners. Furthermore, we shall give appropriate credit for all foreign tax suffered by the overseas company when it realises the gain.
<P>
I apologise for such a long explanation of a complex matter. I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I have said, the Opposition's main points about clause 93 will relate to the next group of amendments. The initial amendment, as described, was genuinely intended to ensure that the Government did not upset its relations with double taxation treaty partners. I have heard rumblings of discontent from certain countries in the EU. [Interruption.] I am glad to hear that the Paymaster General is not concerned about that. If she is happy that the Government's approach has not had that result, so be it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Paymaster General pointed out, clause 93 seeks to prevent misuse of tax treaties for a fancy tax avoidance scheme. We accept that the Government need to stop such schemes. A typical case is that of an individual who has set up an overseas trust that owns assets in a company located in a tax haven and who arranges for the assets to be transferred to a company, especially a company in Belgium, immediately before the assets are sold. That is why we refer to it as the Belgian wheeze. That is certainly not an acceptable use of the UK-Belgium double tax treaty, and the Government are in principle right to act. Our anxiety, which was expressed by certain family business groupings, is that, although the proposed rules will catch such tax mitigation, they will adversely affect large, commercially driven businesses that do not have such motives but necessarily operate through overseas subsidiaries. I shall return to the further point that the provision will especially catch the Baxi partnership share employee scheme, which the Government blessed last year by passing a special Act to allow Baxi to continue with it. We are anxious to prevent injustice, as, I am sure, are the Government.
<P>
The arrangements proposed could lead to significant additional tax and compliance costs, even in the absence of economic gain and if no funds reach the UK trustee shareholders so that no UK tax is lost. As a result, private companies could face a substantial additional tax liability, resulting in fewer resources for reinvestment and adversely affecting sensible economic international reinvestment decisions.
<P>
The Government's target is structures that include trusts and companies created in order to mitigate capital gains tax. Several private companies have longstanding family trust arrangements and trustee shareholders. That is especially true of larger and more successful businesses. When it is no longer prudent or feasible for a major part of the business to be owned by individuals, trusts are used to provide continuity of family ownership and coherence of management and to protect vulnerable beneficiaries, especially the young. A company does not have such trustee shareholdings in order to avoid capital gains tax. When such structures have been in place for a long time, fair, bona fide evidence will show that they have nothing to do with the tax wheezes that we are trying to block.
<P>
The clause is aimed at cases in which valuable assets are moved from other jurisdictions to tax treaty countries just before sale. In contrast, commercial private companies set up subsidiaries for overseas business reasons and continue to use them as long as the business case continues. However, the clause will apply equally to a company that has owned assets in Belgium, for example, for 50 years and one that has owned them for 50 days. We do not feel that that is the intent or that it makes much sense.
<P>
If a structure is set up for temporary tax mitigation, individuals will benefit from receiving tax-free funds. In contrast, private companies invest and reinvest overseas for commercial reasons and over long periods of time. In the mitigation case, the individuals involved want to enjoy the proceeds for personal consumption; in the commercial case, the company will generally reinvest the proceeds of disposal in order to increase its overseas business activities and business empire. United Kingdom trustee shareholders will not receive the benefits of disposal. Present tax legislation imposes a charge if funds are brought back to the UK and distributed to shareholders.
<P>
The issue as we see it is how to introduce the necessary discrimination between the two different sets of circumstances. I am not sure whether the Paymaster General was saying earlier that in her view other arrangements are already in place that afford such discrimination, but we are not aware of any and believe that some objective tests could help focus on the right target.
<P>
We examined four different aspects in devising the right discrimination. The first was the length of time that a company had operated in the overseas location, as temporary movement of assets is, necessarily, outside that. The second was the reinvestment of proceeds of disposal, in which a tax avoider will not be involved for long periods. The third was the involvement of external investors as shareholders or joint venture partners, as a tax avoider will not share his gains. We also examined the issue of motive. As I said, it may not be possible to distinguish adequately in any other way, and at least that test works. We have also considered whether trusts are resident or non-resident, given the UK tax rules that apply to resident trusts.
<P>
The Government may feel that none of our tests satisfactorily determines whether unacceptable mitigation of capital gains tax is the main reason for locating assets in a tax treaty partner, but section 138 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 contains a clear precedent for such a test. That Act does not impose tax for the sale of a company in exchange for paper if the transaction is for commercial rather than tax avoidance reasons.
<P>
Our key amendment is the one that provides the Inland Revenue with a motive test and a formal clearance procedure for taking account of the bona fides of the situation and the relevant circumstances in deciding whether the overseas operator has been established for bona fide commercial reasons. If the Government accept our fundamental point and cannot persuade us that machinery is already in place to achieve our objective, they should accept our motive test amendment. It is the most sound of our amendments and avoids the risk of other schemes escaping out of the door.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): This is an important set of amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs ably set down the main framework of the arguments in favour of examining the issue carefully. I am grateful for the Paymaster General's kind comments about the role that my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood and I, in our way, played in dealing with anti-avoidance matters.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made the moral case for anti-avoidance legislation. He has an important point. Each person who gets away with avoidance adds to another person's tax burden. A taxation system that imposes clear obligations to pay tax, no matter what triggers people's tax liability, must work properly.
<P>
It is important to ensure that legitimate amounts of tax are taken, which is why I think that the amendments raise an important point of principle. If we believe that those who seek to avoid paying tax should be caught, we should be sympathetic to those who do not deliberately seek to avoid tax, but ask for some special treatment. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs alluded to the types of company affected by the proposal. Some Labour Members laughed when a large company was mentioned, and I suspect that one or two hon. Members have their own ideas about which company that was.
<P>
My hon. Friend carefully described the Baxi Partnership, which has an important influence in my constituency. Preston is part of my constituency, and Baxi sponsors Preston North End football club. More importantly, as the Committee knows because legislation was passed to deal with Baxi's trust status, Baxi employs 5,000 people worldwide, 2,500 of whom are in the UK.
<P>
For commercial reasons, Baxi has subsidiaries in France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and other countries, and trustee shareholders control those enterprises. The types of overseas gain that are the subject of our amendments are of interest to Baxi. I have not heard anyone laugh about what it does, which is to make central heating boilers and other items. It is a legitimate trading company. Companies that sometimes invest abroad and make a capital gain may want to leave that gain overseas for wholly legitimate business reasons. For example, they might take advantage of a business cycle abroad and not be so propitious as to repatriate that money for investment in the United Kingdom. Likewise, the reverse may be true.
<P>
Clause 93 deals with that proper business activity in a global economy. I was glad that the Paymaster General looked over the horizon and acknowledged the point that we now live in a different world in terms of the movement and placing of capital for legitimate activity. Everyone would want to encourage United Kingdom firms such as the Baxi Partnership to prosper. An unamended clause 93 would mean that their activities could be disadvantaged.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I took advice from KPMG because, as the Paymaster General said, the subject is complex. KPMG has a wider view of its clients and the effect of the provisions, and its advice is important. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The major accountancy and professional services firm KPMG have made representations to the Treasury and Inland Revenue on this Clause. While they have not carried out a comprehensive summary, they are aware of a number of clients with trustee shareholders and overseas operations. The overseas commercial activities involved are as a minimum millions of pounds. KPMG therefore support the proposal to introduce an appropriate test to make the provisions effective to deter unacceptable tax mitigation and also remove from their scope commercial overseas activities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes to the heart of the matter.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, some of the trust arrangements have been established to deal with the risks of a sole individual owning the assets and running the activities of a private company. Therefore, the trust has been established to spread risk for the future. I want to focus on that, as I am especially interested in amendment No. 348. As my hon. Friend said, it tries to sort the wheat from the chaff through a motive test. The reason why the trust was established is one of the elements that requires examination.
<P>
The Paymaster General rightly points out that the trusts with which she wants clause 93 to deal are set up for artificial tax manipulation purposes. In examples such as that of the Baxi Partnership, the trusts were established for wholly legitimate reasons to offset long-term risks of wholly legitimate businesses. We should be mindful of the interests of British companies if we are to be true to ourselves about wanting them, however they are structured, to prosper when involved in legitimate overseas trading activity on the basis of manufacturing, property investment or any other basis.
<P>
An unamended clause 93, if I understand it correctly, would enable the Revenue effectively to see through the effects of double taxation treaties and to levy a tax on overseas capital gains made by companies structured as affected by the terms of the clause. The idea is one of getting a share of the money irrespective of the consequences. If someone has set up a mechanism that is not connected with legitimate business or trading activities, I can again sympathise with the method that the Paymaster General is using. I understand her assurances about any questions in that context that refer to double taxation treaties.
<P>
There will be a further consequence if this thing is not attended to. If net funds are subsequently paid to the United Kingdom more than two years after disposal, there will be no UK credit for any tax that may be paid in the overseas jurisdiction. We shall have a double bite at the cherry if we do not distinguish between the legitimate and the illegitimate. I should be interested to know—again, maintaining when necessary taxpayer confidentiality—how the Paymaster General responded to the representations that KPMG made on behalf of clients and others. At the heart of the matter lies the ability of the legitimate business enterprise to use its capital to the advantage of the enterprise. In many cases, those companies will eventually repatriate moneys to the United Kingdom, because now is the time for investment to take place, whereas an overseas jurisdiction may presently offer better value for money.
<P>
In the wider context, the United Kingdom has a remarkable world record of investing overseas. It is a counterbalance to the cyclical nature of our economy. If such proper activity is to be indulged in by companies that are formed by the trust structure affected by the clause, we want to encourage it, not discourage it. While the words of the motive test under amendment No. 348 may not be entirely to the liking of the Paymaster General and the Revenue, we must sort the wheat from the chaff if, in fact, one follows exactly the logic that the Paymaster General outlined earlier.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Opposition Members' approach to the clause shows that they share our objective to deal with specific and systematic problems of substantial tax avoidance. The right hon. Member for Fylde said that the point of principle is that the fact that people do not pay the tax that they should pay means that someone else pays more tax than might have been reasonable. Those people are transferring their tax liability. The purpose of anti-avoidance and the debate that it continues is to catch those who are deliberately avoiding tax. I think that the word ``deliberately'' was used by the right hon. Gentleman. If I could define ``deliberately avoid'', it would have made our earlier debate on the difference between avoidance and evasion easier.
<P>
I shall explain why I do not accept the amendment and I hope to cover all the points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and the right hon. Member for Fylde. The purpose of the clause is to apply tax on a capital gain that is escaping tax entirely, but which should be taxed. Amendment No. 347 would exclude from the scope of clause 93 gains accruing to any offshore company during a period of at least five years in which it is a resident in one or more countries with which the United Kingdom has a tax treaty. We understand why the amendment was tabled, although it is based on a mistaken belief that gains accruing to a close company that has been based in a treaty country for some time are more respectable than gains accruing to companies based there for much less time, and that the UK resident who can benefit from those gains through a trust arrangement ought not to be charged on them. I do not accept that; nor do I accept that long-standing arrangements that enable gains to escape a tax charge are more acceptable than those arranged shortly before a gain is realised, if the same effect is achieved. That brings us back to what the right hon. Member for Fylde said about the result that is achieved. If that result is non-payment of tax on a gain, that is where we will focus.
<P>
In any event, the amendment would not prevent people from making such opportunistic arrangements. The amendment appears to allow some very simple tax-planning devices to which we would definitely want to put an end. For example, an asset could be transferred to a company that met the conditions set out in the amendment shortly before it was sold. That would produce little, if any, gain for our tax treaty partners to tax, and the amendment would prevent a UK tax charge from arising. I cannot believe that that is the effect sought by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. However, it would be one of the consequences of his proposal.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood asked whether we could legislate for what we could dream up. I am not describing a dream; I am considering the legislation and stating the possibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to reiterate my point to avoid doubt as to my meaning. I asked the question to illustrate the absurdity in which all Ministers get involved, not to advocate the approach.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I accept that. I am considering the examples only to predict what would happen.
<P>
Another possibility for avoidance would be for a company to switch residents between different countries, taking advantage of the domestic law in some of our treaty partners to give an uplift to the market value of assets on immigration. There can be no charge on the gain in the treaty partner country and the amendment would prevent a tax charge in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the tax treaties is to ensure taxation at the relevant points—in the country in which the person who benefits is resident. They should not be used to ensure that people pay no tax anywhere. The loopholes that the amendment would open are not the sort that the Government are interested in introducing or perpetuating. The amendment would, in addition, be difficult to apply or administer.
<P>
Amendment No. 348 would exclude from the scope of the clause gains accruing to any offshore company that the Revenue was satisfied had been established for bona fide commercial, not tax avoidance, purposes. A motive test of this sort would not provide an appropriate result in the situation, and I am not sure how it would operate here. What would be the criteria for deciding whether a company had been established for tax avoidance? Would it be defined as tax avoidance if little or no tax was paid on the gains of a foreign company and those gains could go to a United Kingdom tax resident without an appropriate tax charge? If that were so, few if any of the arrangements that the Revenue has seen would pass such a test, even though the company may be commercially motivated. Motive tests are not always to be ignored, but they would be flawed for such matters. A motive test would clearly not have the purpose of allowing UK residents to avoid paying taxes on gains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> In that context, will the Paymaster General give us her personal opinion of the relevance of the amendment to section 138 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will come to that point; I shall give not my personal view, but the Government's view. Interesting as it is to engage in personal discussions of such matters, I had better stay firmly on the subject.
<P>
Whatever the motive for the arrangements, if the effect is to enable an individual resident in this country to enjoy the benefit of gains without paying tax, those arrangements have to be considered in the same light as those that have been constructed with a clear avoidance motive. The issue returns us to the principle that the right hon. Member for Fylde and I agreed, which was that if someone does not pay tax when they should, someone else has to pay it. Therefore, there would be no point in a motive test on the issue, as it would not be accurate.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 349 is to exclude from the scope of the clause, gains accruing to an offshore company when it is not under the trustees' control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> So that I understand, will the Paymaster General say how a public limited company would be affected in the context of the capital gain made in an overseas jurisdiction?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clauses are focused on dealing specifically with schemes that are designed to be used by accrual to avoid capital gains tax on gains that would normally be taxable in the UK. There has been much discussion about how detailed the clauses are. I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Fylde was present at the start of our proceedings when I quoted a leading article from the 13 April edition of {**italic **}Taxation. It states that one
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>saving feature of the anti-avoidance provisions for trust schemes is that they are carefully targeted and I would be surprised if they have inadvertent application to innocent transactions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is outside confirmation that the clauses are properly targeted.<P>

<P>
The amendment is completely unacceptable. Not only would it enable resident individuals with an interest in a trust to continue to avoid tax on their gains, but it would also defeat the purpose of the clause in stopping the major avoidance that already exists. If the amendment were made, it would be simple to set up two or more trusts so that no single trust controlled the offshore company. Alternatively, control could be maintained through the use of other close companies. It would require some carefully constructed rules to ensure that the control test worked.
<P>
We disagree with the principle behind the amendment. The amendment suggests that there is something acceptable about trust arrangements that may have been in place for non-tax reasons, even though they might enable gains not to be charged. It is suggested that a trust holding in an offshore company of less than 50 per cent. should automatically be accepted as not involving avoidance, and that any gains that accrue to UK residents as a result of that holding should not be charged. We do not accept that.
<P>
It should not be forgotten that under section 13, protection is provided for small gains when the trustees' share of the gain is less than 5 per cent. The right hon. Member for Fylde might recognise what I am about to say. In principle, a case can be made for removing that exemption and charging all gains, subject to the annual exempt amount, however small. I remind Opposition Members that in 1996 their party extended the effect of section 13 in order to counter the tax avoidance then evident, by tightening up the application of the 5 per cent. de minimis limit. They did not see a case then for excluding gains above that limit, and I am not sure why they have changed their minds, especially given the use of the tax treaty device to avoid a charge on gains that is evident now.
<P>
Amendment No. 350 would limit the scope of the clause such that it would not apply to a resident trust that had not been non-resident or treaty non-resident in any of the previous five years. That would enable a trust that had always been UK-resident or in relation to which long-term tax planning was carried out to avoid paying capital gains tax by using the very device that the clause is intended to outlaw.
<P>
I see no case for providing or perpetuating such a loophole for individuals to exploit through a resident trust. I do not see that it matters one iota whether the trust is an offshore or a UK trust if the same effect—not paying tax on gains—can be achieved. That would be grossly unfair, as I thought that the Committee had agreed, to those in this country who do not shelter their income or gains from tax in that way.
<P>
It is not an answer to restrict the provision to UK trusts that have previously been offshore trusts, because nothing would prevent the same avoidance from being achieved through a trust that had always been a UK trust. Indeed, that would be the obvious route for all future tax planning arrangements.
<P>
All the amendments cut across the purpose of the clause, which is to ensure that UK residents cannot escape a tax charge on their gains through the arrangements covered by the clause.
<P>
A few other points were made about section 138 of the TCGA and company reorganisations. The issues involved are quite different. The legislation that provides for deferral relief on a company reorganisation specifies that relief is not to be given if the reorganisation in question forms part of a scheme or arrangements designed to avoid tax. The Revenue must, therefore, examine all the facts at the time of the application in order to ensure that the reorganisation will not result in tax leakage.
<P>
The clause deals with a quite different matter. It is designed to ensure that arrangements cannot be made to avoid tax on gains for the use of an offshore company underlying a trust. A company might be set up abroad for all sorts of reasons. It might even have been cleared under section 138, as part of a company reorganisation, but that does not mean that we should ignore its use in an arrangement that will enable UK residents to avoid tax on their gains. That would simply constitute a sanction of future tax avoidance.
<P>
Other points were made in connection with bona fide commercial arrangements and KPMG's comments about whether a general let-out from the provision or from section 13 should be provided for bona fide commercial transactions. I see no case for such a let-out. Whatever the motive for the arrangements that involve investment in an offshore close company, if a let-out would enable individuals or UK close companies with which they are involved, to avoid tax on capital gains, it is not an effect that we wish to produce. A motive test could not be made to work in such a situation. Avoidance would simply claim a commercial motive that may prove difficult to disprove, even though avoidance of tax was also the motive. The issues raised by KPMG have been dealt with.
<P>
Whatever the motive for arrangements that involve a private UK company in a chain between a trust and an offshore close company, the fact remains that such companies are being used to avoid tax and capital gains. We cannot allow that to continue. The clause is a targeted measure that affects only those UK companies in which trustees participate. We see no case for any special exemptions, as they would simply enable the avoidance to continue. Opposition Members continue to echo the point about genuine reason. The avoidance arrangements invariably involve trusts. UK residents who participate in an offshore company will be taxed on any distribution of the gain or loan by the company. That may not always be the case when a trust is interposed, so we are focusing only on situations in which there is avoidance. We are not making a sweeping rule, but focusing specifically on such arrangements.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde referred to plcs. A close plc will fall within the scope of the clause. Even with a close plc, there is the potential for a small number of shareholders to take control of the company and to benefit from the gains. It is therefore right that the clause should apply. The main issue is that individuals are not paying the tax on their capital gains that they should be paying. They know that they are not and the motive test is whether they engage deliberately in such activities. The clause would prevent them from so doing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Mr. Cook, is it not remarkable to listen to the twisted logic of the Paymaster General? I asked about the plc to establish the parallel between its tax position and that of the trust-based company that indulges in legitimate business activity. The position is straightforward: for example, if a plc operating in an overseas tax jurisdiction that is covered by a double taxation treaty sells the goodwill of a trade, property investment or an intangible capital asset, there will be no UK tax to pay.
<P>
The hon. Lady was saying that, in a parallel set of circumstances that resulted from the trading activities of a trust-based enterprise, if a capital gain from exactly the self-same set of circumstances occurred, it would be proper for tax to be paid at that juncture whereas, if a plc carried out such a transaction, it would not have to pay tax. It is crucial that, when the money comes back to the United Kingdom, it is taxed in whatever way is appropriate. That example illustrates the fact, in a way that our amendment might not, that there is a principle. By a quirk of positive action in the case of companies such as the Baxi Partnership, or by a response to family circumstances, a family enterprise might resolve itself into the trust structure that we have discussed and carry out business activities that can be observed to be proper. We know that they are proper, because they are okay if done by a plc. We do not question what a plc does, but we understandably question the legitimacy of what some trusts do in the context of deliberately manipulating tax law and double tax treaties to avoid paying tax full stop.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of the world's property market, sometimes it is good for a company that deals in property to invest abroad, make capital gains and bring them back in the form of new capital to invest in the United Kingdom. The UK has its opportunity to tax money that may have been made abroad, depending on the length of cycle that one considers.
<P>
The Paymaster General did not accept the principles involved in our arguments. In a discursive way at least, we recognise what is a proper business activity and can distinguish it from obvious tax manipulation. She chooses to say that anyone using the mechanism is effectively tarred with the same brush, even though she might acknowledge that some people's activities might be okay.
<P>
I mentioned section 138 of the Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 to point out that it provided a motive test in capital gains tax legislation that enabled legitimate commercial reasons to be distinguished from capital gains tax avoidance. The Paymaster General used a logical way out of the argument to say that the section might not apply in the context of this issue. She may be right, but using it would apply an existing test to distinguish good from bad. Bearing in mind that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue have received representations from a highly respected tax company, it is disappointing that she did not agree to re-examine the firm's arguments before Report, even if she could not accept the amendments. She could have tried to find a form of words to achieve her objectives, which we share, and to catch firms by the kind of mechanism that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs described, but by which firms such as the Baxi Partnership would remain uncaught. If there is an injustice, how does one explain to a Baxi Partnership worker, a Preston North End supporter, that his company will be disadvantaged in its overseas activities when a parallel plc acts in the same way and remains uncaught? That person may not understand why his benevolently structured company, which benefits him as an employee, seems to receive a worse deal than a rival.
<P>
That is the heart of the matter. Before the Paymaster General bats us off the pitch on technicalities, I implore her to see whether there might be a way to separate the tax wheat from the tax chaff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I second the comments of my right hon. Friend. Wherever the Paymaster General's advice has come from within the Revenue or the Treasury, I think that disingenuous logic has crept in. The point of clause 93 was to outlaw what was known as the Belgian wheeze—a tax planning device that enabled people to avoid capital gains tax when they sold shares, mostly in their UK companies. That cost the Revenue and taxpayers a lot of money.
<P>
The Paymaster General argued, through the words put into her mouth, that bona fide companies with established situations analogous to publicly quoted non-close plcs should be heavily taxed simply because they have trustee shareholders. That is unfair and inappropriate.
<P>
I return to the example of Baxi, which is 75 per cent. owned by am employee shareholder trust—we would all like such a virtuous situation to be more common. If the company's overseas subsidiaries realise capital gains, Baxi in the United Kingdom will be obliged to bear the tax bill because the trust does not have the money to pay it. A similar company that was not owned by its employees would not receive such a large tax bill. There is no logic in proposing arrangements that have that result. 
<P>
I was slightly confused by the words that the Paymaster General used, but there was some grain of a suggestion that the Government were concerned to differentiate between the wheat and the chaff, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde put it. She then made the strange argument that, as a matter of principle, any close company with a trustee shareholder ought to have that additional and unjust tax burden. If that was what she meant, it is unacceptable and economically crackpot, in that the effect of the legislation would merely prevent the companies that we are discussing from sensibly managing their assets internationally. They will not want to incur substantial tax liabilities, especially on fixed assets, that would erode the value of the portfolio—they will simply sit on their assets. Therefore, the measure will not be a great tax earner—if that is its objective. It will make corporate structures, in which there happens to be a trustee shareholder, less efficient in the management of their assets.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde made it clear that there was a division between tax planning and tax avoidance schemes that operate using double taxation relief and ownership structures that include trustees, either for employee share trusts or for widespread generational family interests. Those structures are desirable in the interests of UK plc.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General and her Revenue advisers further consider the matter? I repeat the request about the dialogue with KPMG. We would prefer to leave matters hanging in mid-air for a while to enable further consultation. However, if the Paymaster General will not give us that, we will make a stand on the issue. The proposals are unjust and benefit nobody economically.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause is not merely aimed at the Belgian wheeze, as the hon. Gentleman called it. It will ensure that, whatever the situation, United Kingdom residents pay tax on gains arising from offshore companies from which they can benefit. How that is achieved does not matter to us, but it is right that the gains should be charged. The Revenue has seen examples of the avoidance that we are discussing only from private close companies, not from public companies that are not close. It is right to focus on the situation in which the abuse arises. That is what we have done in this measure and I ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendment if it is pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is a clear matter of principle here. The Paymaster General refuses to acknowledge the ultimate distinction between the improper use of the arrangements and the accidental situation that comes about through the trust structure. It is unjust to overlook the fact that a trust structure has been in place for employees for long-standing reasons and to subject such a business to a higher tax rate than another business. That is nonsense, and I am astonished that the Revenue and the Government are proposing such a measure.
