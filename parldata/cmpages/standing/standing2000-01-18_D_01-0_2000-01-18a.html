<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/010/2000100.htm">Terrorism Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Terrorism Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee when I say that I am confident that, during our consideration of this important Bill, you will ensure that we make progress and have a full and proper discussion of the issues involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): May I, on behalf of my hon. Friends, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made clear on Second Reading, the Bill, to a large extent, enjoys the support of the Opposition. While we look forward to examining it in detail in Committee, we support the broad thrust of the Government's proposals. I therefore have no objection to the sittings motion.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister could find an opportunity during our proceedings to make clear how the Government see the way forward on a couple of issues that are related directly to combating terrorism and were covered by Lord Lloyd of Berwick in his report, but which are alluded to within the Bill only issue that I have in mind is the interception of communications about which Lord Lloyd made several recommendations. I hope that the Minister will be able to make it clear whether the Government intend to deal with that in other legislation, given that there is a reference in the Bill to the Interception of Communications Act 1985. Will Parliament have the opportunity to deal with the issues that Lord Lloyd raised?
<P>
Secondly, I understand that the Home Offce has been considering the recommendations of its working party on the confiscation of criminal assets and that work is being undertaken by the Cabinet Office, which is expected to reach a conclusion early this year. I hope that the Minister will make clear how the Government see their way forward on that issue and how any other proposals that they intend to make will fit alongside the specific provisions in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. I have served under your chairmanship before, which was very satisfactory. I do not object to the sittings motion. The Committee will know that my colleagues and I called for a Special Standing Committee to be set up to debate the Bill, which would have been the best way forward. However, the Government used their parliamentary majority to deprive us of such proceedings. They are entitled to take such action, although I believe that they were wrong to do so.
<P>
I am happy to collaborate with a reasonable sittings timetable. I prefer to debate Bills thoroughly, rather than have a lengthy debate on certain parts and then rush through others. There are many important parts to this Bill. I am happy to discuss matters outside the Room to ensure that we make steady progress.
<P>
Unlike the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and his hon. Friends, my party has serious reservations about large parts of the Bill. Provided that we receive a constructive response to them and do not meet a stone wall, I shall collaborate with the Government. I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) is able to participate in the Committee's proceedings. I did, however, lodge the objection that, in order to accommodate the hon. Gentleman, which we always wanted to do—the Ulster Unionists should properly be represented here—the Government refused to allow a Committee with sufficient members to permit my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik), the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Northern Ireland, to join us.
<P>
That, too, showed an unnecessary standing on formality and a lack of generosity, but the Government have the majority to deliver it, and I made my objection known. That may be to the disadvantage of members of the Committee, because, instead of hearing a variety of voices from this part of the Room, they will hear only one. However, the Government brought it upon themselves and they must not complain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I warmly endorse the words of welcome that have already been expressed to you, Mr. Stevenson. The Committee is fortunate to have you in the Chair.
<P>
I am a survivor of the Standing Committee that considered the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. I recall that the sittings motion was deficient because we did not anticipate the startling events that took place during the Committee stage. We did not anticipate the major IRA arms find on 20 December 1988. We learned from that that not only anti-terrorist legislation but an increase in police resources was necessary—in particular, to ensure effective surveillance.
<P>
The following day, while the Committee was sitting, we heard of the tragedy and nightmare of Lockerbie. From that we learned the weaknesses and limitations of national terrorism legislation in the face of state-sponsored terrorism. Lastly, in February 1998, and arising from the IRA find across the river, Nicholas Mullen was arrested in Zimbabwe. I fear that he will return to haunt the proceedings of the Committee while his appeal for compensation for wrongful arrest is heard.
<P>
The lesson to be learned is that when those of our agencies that are entrusted with enforcing anti-terrorism legislation break the rules, it can be an expensive business for the taxpayer I hope that we shall not parallel those proceedings this year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr Stevenson. I express my gratitude to the Liberal Democrats for providing the facility that has allowed me to be a member of the Committee. I am not surprised that the Government do not want people with first-hand experience of terrorism to be members of the Committee.
<P>
The Bill is of the utmost importance. As it passes through its various stages, it will be our responsibility not only to recognise the threat to society that exists in western Europe today, particularly within the United Kingdom, but to realise that a Government with a huge majority can create anomalies that will result in much of our legislation and many of the procedures and protocols within the House being substantially undermined.
<P>
One is horrified that the Government are about to undermine the authority that has traditionally been vested in Madam Speaker As a matter of routine, they are allowing unreconstructed terrorists into the Palace. There will be two unreconstructed terrorists—people who have commanded terrorist organisations and who are still inextricably linked with the IRA, an organisation with huge resources of arms and explosives. We shall also have their acolytes—people who are still active in what they call the military wing of the Republican movement.
<P>
It is horrifying that a Government can behave so irresponsibly; that they can throw away the advantages of the constructive work that has been done during the past four years. That is why it is important that we endeavour to ensure that the Bill is watertight to abuse by a Government with a huge majority. That is all that I want say now, but I believe that it will be necessary to go through the details with a fine-toothed comb if we are to protect society in the months and years ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I appreciate all those remarks. I am grateful for the general support offered by the hon. Member for Aylesbury and agree that we need to explore some aspects of the Bill, as was made clear on Second Reading. He mentioned two specifics, the first of which was the interception of communications. The Queen's Speech suggested that a Bill on that matter would consider in detail how interception was regulated. The issues covered in Lord Lloyd of Berwick's report will be addressed in the context of debates on that Bill, which will arise this Session.
<P>
On the more general issue of the confiscation of assets, the hon. Gentleman's information is as always entirely correct. The Home Office is giving the matter close attention, and the Cabinet Office is considering detailed proposals. It is fair to say that there is consensus across the Government on the need to legislate on the subject rapidly. I cannot give any specific commitment on time, as nothing was said in the Queen's Speech, but I do not think that a Bill is likely to be introduced this Session. The Government are considering the best form of such legislation and we would prefer to deal with those aspects in that manner, although they are referred to in the Bill.
<P>
I understand the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr Hughes) about the Special Standing Committee, and I dealt with some of them on Second Reading. I believe that it is right and appropriate to debate the important issues in Standing Committee. That will be an effective way to proceed. I appreciated the constructive approach that the hon. Gentleman suggested, and his remarks about the need to make steady progress throughout the Bill. I hope that I can assure him that he will find the Government constructive rather than stonewalling in character.
<P>
You will not be aware, Mr. Stevenson, that it has recently been announced that a train line directly between my constituency of Norwich, South, and Basingstoke will start running in May. I hope that by that time, the Committee will have dealt with its business. If not, the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and I can have a shuttle relationship to pursue our discussions.
<P>
To take a more serious note, the hon. Gentleman mentioned Lockerbie. One of the sadder experiences of my life was to be at the memorial service in the church in Lockerbie following the awful disaster there. I can only endorse the thrust of his remarks that it is important that our legislation inhibits the ability of anyone to prosecute acts that cause such terror and disaster.
<P>
I acknowledge what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, but I do not know to what extent the Committee will debate those issues. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who cannot be here today, will be a full participant in the Committee to discuss many of those questions. The most important thing that the hon. Gentleman said was that it was important that the legislation was, in his phrase, watertight to abuse. That is right, and we look to amendments to strengthen the legislation in the most positive way.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Resolved,

<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 and 2, Schedule 1, Clause 3, Schedule 2, Clauses 4 and 5, Schedule 3, Clauses 6 to 22, Schedule 4, Clauses 23 to 36, Schedule 5, Clauses 37 to 39, Schedule 7, Clauses 40 to 51, Schedule 6, Clauses 52 to 62, Schedule 8, Clauses 63 to 81, Schedule 9, Clauses 82 to 95, Schedule 10, Clauses 96 to 99, Schedule 11, Clauses 100 to 111, Schedule 12, Clauses 112 to 120, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 121 to 125, new Clauses and new Schedules.—[Mr. Charles Clarke.]<P>

<H4><center>Terrorism: interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 7, leave out from `means' to end of line 18 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`acts of persons acting on behalf of, or in connection with, any organisation which carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing, by force or violence, of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom or any other government de jure or de facto'.'<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments. No. 12, in page 1, line 7, leave out from `threat' to `of' in line 8.
<P>
No. 11, in page 1, line 8, after `which', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is contrary to the criminal law, which puts the public or any section of the public in fear, and which'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members may speak to amendments Nos. 11 and 12 even though they were tabled by hon. Members who are not members of the Committee
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Government have been sensible in proposing a Bill that codifies anti-terrorism legislation and in proposing that it start with a definition of terrorism. It is sensible to know what we are dealing with before reaching the detail. Many of us have considered far too many Bills in which the definition section is a considerable way into the Bill. I make no criticism about either of those aspects.
<P>
As we start with clause 1, the interpretation clause, we immediately face a major debate about the Bill's parameters. That debate is about the definition of `terrorism'. The various measures placed on the statute book in recent years contain different definitions. Broadly speaking, two definitions are currently in use. Against the background of a Bill to place terrorism legislation on a permanent, rather than temporary, footing—a point to which I shall return—the Government propose a more broad definition.
<P>
The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 contain the same definition:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `terrorism' means the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition is limited, in that the powers and offences apply only to terrorism connected with Northern Ireland and to international terrorism. The Government are introducing two changes. They are widening the definition and they are widening its remit—where the definition applies. I do not want to concentrate now on the second of those changes, but I shall return to it. It is a reasonable starting point to say that terrorism should be considered wherever it takes place. Like hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies, one of my complaints about previous legislation that the Conservative Government introduced and that, later, the Labour Opposition supported, was that it contained exclusion clauses and effectively treated different parts of the United Kingdom differently. As I said on Second Reading, I have never voted for that legislation. My party did on various occasions, but I never did. I voted against it on some occasions and abstained on others. One is either a citizen of the United Kingdom or one is not. I believe that one should be treated similarly wherever one is in the United Kingdom. The Government are getting rid of that distinction, which is welcome. We are now considering a geographical definition that relates to the four countries of the United Kingdom and an area that is not limited by national boundaries. The definition that I have just cited from the PTA was used in the EPA.
<P>
The other definition is the one that we have proposed in our amendment. It dates from only seven years ago, from the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993, which is used for determining compensation for acts of terrorism. The definition is not an invented alternative definition; it comes from UK statute.
<P>
We must ask ourselves how far we should go. I shall not repeat verbatim what I said on Second Reading on 14 December, starting in column 185. The Bill seeks to widen the definition of terrorism in two ways that are fundamentally unacceptable to those who want to ensure that legislation both deals with crime and protects individuals.
<P>
I declare an interest in that I am a human rights lawyer. I also have family who have served in Northern Ireland and friends who have been injured there. Both my parents were in the services and I hope that I understand the balance that is required between the need for a proper law and order structure to deal with terrorism and the need to protect civil liberties. Terrorism has traditionally been defined in ways that limit the activity. It is not violence against anybody but a specific activity that is usually directed at the Government. The ``New Oxford Dictionary'' definition is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition in ``Brewer's Politics'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The use of violence or intimidation to achieve political ends.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All the books on politics describe and define terrorism. For example, the ``Oxford Companion to Politics of the World'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The concept of terrorism has been a category of political discourse since the late eighteenth century. Its central meaning is the use of terror for the furthering of political ends''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has been the traditional definition. We must, therefore, be extremely careful if the Government propose legislation that absolutely rejects that traditional ground and gives additional powers to the state to deal with wider issues.
<P>
The definition of ``terrorism'' in clause 1(1) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, of action which—
<P>
(a) involves serious violence against any person or property,
<P>
(b) endangers the life of any person, or
<P>
(c) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is notable that no one in the public domain is advising the Government to go as far as they propose in the Bill. Have the Government received submissions from reputable bodies in support of that definition? If not, why have they chosen a definition that is wider than anyone has previously recommended?
<P>
Lord Lloyd headed the inquiry that preceded the Bill. It is perfectly proper to proceed by asking someone to review what is needed. That is one of the things for which the Government are criticised. Generally I do not criticise them for trying to set up commissions and inquiries before introducing legislation. It is always best to take advice before legislating.
<P>
Lord Lloyd, having weighed the matter carefully, proposed the following definition of terrorism:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use of serious violence against persons or property, or the threat to use such violence, to intimidate or coerce a government, the public or any section of the public.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then gave the definition of objectives:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in order to promote political, social or ideological objectives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the widest that any proposal to the Government went. The Government, in their consultation paper, proposed the following definition of terrorism:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use of serious violence against persons or property, or the threat to use such violence, to intimidate or coerce a government, the public, or any section of the public, for political, religious, or ideological ends''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The fundamental debate is whether one should extend terrorist legislation to actions that are not aimed at the Government—which would go further than the traditional purpose of terrorist legislation—and whether one should add a list of political, religious or ideological causes to the definition of terrorism. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone mentioned the issue on Second Reading. Widening the definition is important because it would allow a huge range of actions to be included within it.
<P>
Under the definition of terrorism in the Bill, if someone makes a threat in pursuit of a fundamentalist religious belief and by his own definition—even though he may not be sane—his action is religiously driven, it can be construed as ideologically motivated. That is nothing to do with the state, in contrast to the situation in Ireland, for example, where there are opposing ideologies surrounding whether the six counties are the rightful property of the United Kingdom or of the Republic of Ireland. The view that everyone should be armed, or allowed to carry a gun, or allowed to use any drug without restriction, could be claimed to be an ideological view. There is no view that could not be claimed by someone to be an ideological view. To be blunt, every Member of Parliament receives regular communications from constituents with fairly far-out views. They see their views as ideologically based and justify them to themselves and others as arising from their profound, philosophical or religious understanding. We might say they are mad, or madder than we are, but they define themselves as ideologically driven.
<P>
We get into dangerous territory once we start pulling into the definition of terrorism any action carried out in the ideological pursuit of a cause. I gave the examples on Second Reading—examples that have been debated outside the House—of someone who opposes the killing of whales, which is an ideological cause, and of someone who opposes all animal experiments, which is also an ideological view because it is held on the grounds of animal welfare. All such views are swept in by the definition in the Bill. I find it surprising that the Government wish to include such views and I emphasise that to the Minister, who will remember that we are old university sparring partners. That is a little unfair because he was a greater political mortal and I a lesser one.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve McCabe (Birmingham, Hall Green):</B> He still is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Well, physiologically and physically that is certainly the case. I concede nothing beyond that.
<P>
The Labour party has traditionally been, since the beginning of the century, keen on defending people's rights and liberties. It has a good libertarian tradition, as you know as well as anyone, Mr. Stevenson. I am therefore troubled that a Labour Government—I do not know whether it is a socialist Government; it does not seem to be, but that is a matter for internal Labour debate—has given up that traditional position.
<P>
There should be nothing in the legislation that could be covered by ordinary criminal law. Terrorism law exists precisely to cover areas that cannot be dealt with by criminal law. It is bad law, as well as bad politics, to sweep people into the definition of ``terrorist'', when they are just straightforward criminals. Terrorism is not general criminality by another name. It is a specific form of criminality—that is why it was traditionally defined as criminality against the state and the Government. We must be careful that we do not legislate, as clause 1 proposes, to define as terrorism activities that many of us would argue are simply criminal activities
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is the Government's Bill; we have a funny political system in this country in that Governments make proposals and it is for the Opposition to defeat them: we have to win the argument that proposals are no good rather than Governments having to win the argument that they are good. The burden of proof always lies not with the Government but with the Opposition in British politics. The Government can just get their troops behind the measure and push it through. To win people over, Oppositions have to win people to their view. However, if the Minister wants to justify the clause, I ask him to justify each and every extension of activities beyond the criminal law. People who attack an animal testing laboratory in Oxfordshire, for example, could be dealt with by criminal law. They should not even be considered for inclusion under terrorist legislation; the fact that they hear ideological voices or have strong ideological views is irrelevant. If something can be dealt with by criminal law, it should be.
<P>
As the debate progresses, I hope that we will look at examples of actions that are covered by criminal law. Criminal damage to property already exists as an offence, for example, as do conspiracy, arson and threats to people, which are dealt with by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Many Acts in existence give perfectly good scope for prosecuting people under ordinary criminal law.
<P>
The Government Whip and the Minister have to do their jobs, but I hope that Labour Back-Bench members of the Committee will have a sense of the necessity for civil liberty. I hope that they will not give universal support to the Government proposal, just because they are Labour Back Benchers. I hope that there is a critical appraisal of what would be a fundamental change to our legislation, threatening the liberties of all our constituents and giving powers to the state that throw the relationship between the state and the individual out of balance. I regret that we have to have such a fundamental debate at the beginning of our proceedings.
<P>
The other two amendments in the group were tabled not by members of the Committee but by other Labour Members. Rather than detaining the Committee later, it seems sensible to deal with them now. They seem to come as a pair. I understand what they are getting at, but they would leave the definition of terrorism, in the context of the general criminal law, as action against other people rather than activity against the state. Although they are an attempt to get rid of the political, religious or ideological cause argument, they would not deal with the fundamental point of whom terrorism is directed against and I do not believe that they would be as effective as amendment No 1.
<P>
The amendment comes from existing legislation. There is a precedent, and the Government cannot say that it is badly drafted, which is an argument often advanced against amendments. It is about terrorism against Governments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am broadly in sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's arguments about the definition of terrorism, but I have a strange feeling about the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other government de jure or de facto''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if he could elaborate on the latter part of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that I had not explained that part of the amendment. I shall do so briefly, because it is a perfectly reasonable request. I was not a member of the Committee that discussed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, but I understand that, in addition to democratically elected and recognised Governments there are de jure Governments or those who, in effect, are the Government although they may not have received democratic or proper approval. I think that the British Government still adopt the usual international practice that if, for example, there was a coup in Africa, as there has been in the past 10 years, we recognise the Government who successfully take over. Sierra Leone has gone through such a circular process.
<P>
We now come to whether we justify as terrorists people who are setting out to attack a Government who may not have legitimate authority to be in power. I share the concern that that would lead to a wider and more difficult debate. One of the points made on Second Reading was that we should be careful not to bring into the Bill activity that would have been illegal 20 years ago, such as when people supported the African National Congress in South Africa and acted against the minority white apartheid racist Government who were in place.
<P>
We may have to examine carefully how the clause ties in with other parts of the Bill that relate exactly to those, for example, who are trying to reinstate democracy in Pakistan. At present, that country has a de facto Government, who are a military dictatorship and not recognised by the international community. What about people who must have the civil liberty to act against such Governments? The Bill is intended to stop violent activity, but many leaders of the Church have often said that people who are governed by a dictatorship that they do not support may have to go along with the fact that an armed struggle may be the only way in which to deal with such a dictatorship. That was not the case in Northern Ireland because there was a democratic system, but it may apply to Pakistan.
<P>
I do not pretend that the amendment is the perfect definition, but we want terrorism to be defined as action against Governments here or abroad who are recognised as such by the international community. I want to limit it to action against Governments, rather than action where one side has no governmental role.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with most of the points raised by the amendment and by amendments Nos. 12 and 11. I look forward to the debate. I hope that we shall see some movement on the Government Back Benches, and that the Government will make some concessions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson; it is a pleasure to serve again under your chairmanship. I remember serving under your chairmanship last year on the Committee that spent so long considering what became the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Those long debates may be relevant to this debate, as exchanges similar to last year's will doubtless take place.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spent a great deal of time criticising clause 1, but he did not say much to justify the existing position. What I want to say follows on from what was said by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The amendment does not deal with the problem that could arise in collapsed states that may not have a Government, either de jure or de facto, or with the problem caused by conflicts such as that in East Timor. Until recently, the Fretilin movement was engaged in military action against the de facto Government of East Timor. That Government were not recognised internationally and there was a national liberation movement. That is a more recent example than the ANC's struggle against apartheid.
<P>
According to the amendment, anyone in this country who supported the activities of Xanana Gusmao and the other Nobel prize-winners who agreed with the activities of the organisation that took violent action against the illegitimate Indonesian occupation of East Timor would be encompassed by its provisions. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will doubtless say that the amendment is based on existing legislation, but that raises the question whether we need to update the law to take account of the realities of the world that we live in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I am sympathetic to his essential argument, but I remain unconvinced by the details. Perhaps he will elaborate later.
<P>
Despite the hon. Gentleman's reply to the intervention of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, it seems to me that he has not addressed the point that is expressed in the cliché that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Taking his amendment in conjunction with other parts of the Bill, we would still be left with the dilemma of prosecuting those who, in a relatively mild manner, support opposition to regimes that we find unacceptable. The amendment has not got round that problem.
<P>
I remain unconvinced about another matter, which emerges from the hon. Gentleman's restriction of the definition to ``overthrowing or influencing'' Governments. The tit-for-tat sectarian killings in Northern Ireland immediately come to mind. The objective there is not first and foremost and directly to influence Government, although those actions are caught up in far wider terrorist campaigns. Such a definition of terrorism would, by default, not include tit-for-tat sectarian killing. Although I sympathise with what he is trying to achieve in general terms, I am not sure on those grounds that he has achieved it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> To some extent, I am in an unfortunate position: when I read the Government drafting, I get the impression that the person responsible for it looked at a series of terrorist incidents, perhaps not in this country, and tried to find a series of phrases that would have embraced them. No phrase illustrates that better than that used in subsection (l)(c) about action that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the person who drafted that thought of the situation in Japan when sarin gas was released in the underground, and that he decided that we needed something specifically to cover such an incident, but those of us who have unfortunately been closer to terrorists than we would have liked over a considerable number of years know that, no matter what we try to identify as potential terrorism, terrorists have the ability to change their modus operandi. They can create novel forms of terrorism to counteract steps that the civil Bar endeavours to put in place.
<P>
For that reason, when I compare the drafting, I come down broadly in favour of the much more specific definition of terrorism in the amendment, but, like the hon. Member for Basingstoke, I am not able to embrace the latter part of the amendment.
<P>
On the definition relating to other Governments, instances have already been cited in which there would have been embarrassment for many who considered themselves not as terrorists but as champions of a democratic form of government. Where would we be today if the Pinochet Government were still in power in Chile, and if we, as individuals or as a group, found ourselves with the opportunity to try to protect those vulnerable people who were systematically murdered during that regime? I mention it as something of which most people are currently aware, but the same could apply to all Governments who were, in fact, terrorist Governments. Throughout the world, we have a responsibility to people who suffer under Governments who employ state terrorism to sustain themselves in authority. That is the difficulty that I have with the amendment. The Committee could do no better than examine further how to remove the vagueness of the Bill and try to use a form of words that would cover my reservations.
<P>
I want to be careful about how I express myself. The person involved in an incident in the centre of London last Saturday need only be seen to have a political, religious or ideological cause to be deemed a terrorist. From the limited information that I have, I can see little justification for saying that that person is a terrorist. The existing law is more than adequate to deal with the events in Downing street last Saturday. I appeal to the Minister to consider carefully whether the Government's drafting is so general that if one carries out an act of violence or issues a threat of violence, it will be difficult not to be deemed a terrorist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> One of the things that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Basingstoke is that the existing legislation—the EPA and PTA—clearly uses the words ``for political aims'', and does not go wider. Is that the sort of definition that the hon. Gentleman would prefer? Would he prefer the definition of terrorism to refer only to a political purpose, rather than being widened to the other ideological and religious actions that the Government have included in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have sympathy with the amendment because it defines terrorism as the sort of activity that is—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``directed towards the overthrowing or influencing, by force or violence, of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is exceedingly difficult to know where the dividing line between political, religious or ideological motivation lies. There is no clear-cut divide. My objective is to consider the potential outcome rather than tie myself to defining a specific cause. I do not know whether that helps the hon. Gentleman, but it is how I believe we should approach the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would extend his argument to cover the specific point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the tit-for-tat sectarian killings and say whether he agrees that such actions should fall outside the definition of terrorism. The objective in that case is to terrorise the community, and not necessarily the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am sorry, I am a little bit slow in understanding what the hon. Gentleman means. In the context of Northern Ireland, I cannot distinguish in terms of terrorism between a terrorist organisation involved in illegal activity designed to overthrow the Government, and a terrorist organisation involved in counter-measures designed to usurp the Government's legitimate authority in relation to law and order. I am not quite clear about his point, but I hope that that clarifies my difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I fully understand the honourable motives of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in tabling the amendment. It is difficult to strike the correct balance between proper safeguards against terrorism and due protection of human rights, which all of us, as democratic politicians, want to uphold. I am not persuaded by his arguments, but I want to make it clear that I am not impugning his right to table the amendment or his motives for doing so.
<P>
The definition that Lord Lloyd proposed, which the hon. Gentleman quoted, was based, as Lord Lloyd explained in his report, on the working definition of terrorism that the Federal Bureau of Investigation adopted in the United States of America. The key question in considering the definition seems to be whether we want to take the law beyond Irish and international terrorism, in so far as that already falls within the scope of our criminal law, and extend it to cover domestic terrorism. Once we have decided that it is right to make that extension, as Lord Lloyd advocates and the Government have accepted, it seems that a definition such as the one that Lord Lloyd proposed, which has been put in the Bill, probably flows inevitably from that single decision.
<P>
My worry about the definition in the amendment is that, for the best of motives, it would exclude many actions that most people in this country would regard as terrorist. Some of the debate hitherto has assumed that what is at stake is whether the Bill will brand people as terrorists. What seem perhaps even more important than the specific offences that the Bill will create are the special powers given to the police and other public authorities in later clauses in respect of actions that clause 1 defines as terrorist. The amendment would deny the police and other law enforcement agencies the right to use those special powers in respect of certain actions that I and, I believe, the majority of Committee members, would regard as terrorist.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey alluded to animal rights extremists. The example that he cited of something that he would not want to be included within the scope of the definition of terrorism was a group that wanted to end experiments on live animals. The biggest single problem with his amendment is that it seems to restrict the definition of terrorism to actions directed against a Government—however one defines ``Government''. What comes through from reading Lord Lloyd's report and Professor Wilkinson's appendix to it, and also from studying terrorist events in this country and overseas, is the fact that terrorist actions are frequently directed against the general public or sections of the public, rather than specifically the responsibilities of Government. Some research scientists working for pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies or medical institutions go in fear of their lives and safety because they are threatened by extremists.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I know of cases in which animal rights extremists are alleged to have used plastic explosives to attack targets, and police officers have told me that some such groups, whom I would describe as terrorists, are carefully organised in a cell structure that replicates that of an acknowledged terrorist group such as the Provisional IRA. We would be unwise to tighten the definition of terrorism in a way that excludes such groups from the definition and that unnecessarily limits the powers of the police and other agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says. I am glad that we are having a sensible and balanced debate. However, the important difference between the Lord Lloyd definition and that in the Bill is that the former set the condition that the violence or threat of violence had to be with the purpose of intimidating or coercing a Government, the public or any section of the public. The Bill misses out that central element. It sets out the action, the mental justification for it and the result of it, but misses out—this is the point that the hon. Gentleman was ably making—the fact that, to be defined as terrorism, an action must involve a purpose vis-à-vis the person against whom the attack is directed. In Lord Lloyd's proposed definition, the purpose of intimidation was included—not necessarily of the Government, but more widely. That is a severe weakness of the Government's draft, as compared with that of Lord Lloyd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am sure that the Minister will defend the Government's choice of words. Reading subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c), it seems clear that the Government are making an attempt to cover the points that the hon. Gentleman is making. I am sure that the Minister will respond in greater detail to the hon. Gentleman on why the Government have chosen the particular form of words used in the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke drew us on to this territory when he spoke of his fear that the alternative definition framed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey would exclude terrorism directed against a particular commumity. I wonder whether the definition in the hon. Gentleman's amendment creates a grey area around the issue of ethnic cleansing. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will know better than anyone present, there have been many attacks by Provisional IRA on individual members of the Protestant community in Fermanagh, South Armagh and other border areas of Northern Ireland. Similarly, there have been attacks by extreme loyalist terrorist groups on Roman Catholics and Catholic families in other parts of the Province. Those attacks are sectarian; they are designed to intimidate and drive members of a community away from an area. The definition suggested by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey might make things more difficult for the law enforcement agencies. It could make it difficult to demonstrate that such actions were intended to influence the Government rather than simply to intimidate a community or individuals, who would be excluded from the definition that he offers.
<P>
The international terrorist scene offers further examples. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred to the attack by a quasi-religious cult on the Japanese underground system. About two years ago, attacks in Egypt caused a large number of fatalities among foreign tourists visiting the temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor. It could be argued that those attacks were not so much the result of a specific wish to influence the Egyptian Government as a perverted cry of protest against alleged western influence and the corruption of Egyptian—and particularly Islamic—tradition. Given the reality of the world in which we live, it is right that our definition of terrorism should allow the police the power effectively to tackle the groups responsible for perpetrating such outrages.
<P>
Mr. Deputy Speaker—I mean Mr. Stevenson. I am sorry, I have promoted you too early. The consequence of amendments Nos. 11 and 12, which I am sure is unintended, would be to enlarge the definition of terrorism to encompass virtually any crime of violence. Those amendments are therefore unhelpful. I shall advise my hon. Friends not to support amendment No. 1, should the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey choose to press it to a Division. I hope that the Minister will give us a comprehensive account of the Government's reasons for choosing the definition contained in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am delighted that our first debate should be of such a fundamental nature. I hope that I can answer the arguments that have been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, the Government are fully ready to explore definitions of terrorism that might better match what we are trying to achieve. However, for reasons that I shall set out, amendment No. 1 does not fit the bill. First, I must answer a technical point. As the hon. Gentleman said, the definition used in the amendment derives from the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993. That Act was designed to deal with specific circumstances: it allowed the Government to meet their obligation, in certain circumstances, to provide reinsurance in respect of loss and damage caused by acts of terrorism. That definition is particular to that Act, and the fact that it was drafted professionally does not necessarily lead us to believe that it is the best definition for the Bill.
<P>
I continue with a much more fundamental point. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey wanted to know where, within the spectrum of action, terrorism should be defined. Amendment No. 1 focuses on action against Governments. As the hon. Gentleman told the Committee, the dictionary definitions refer both to government and to political aims. In his helpful discussion of the matter, Lord Lloyd referred to public concerns and social and ideological factors that needed to be taken into account. The definition of terrorism in the Bill should go wider than anti-Government activity, for the sake of dictionary definitions, Lord Lloyd's reasons as have been set out and those outlined by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone when he talked about state terrorist Governments. Focusing purely on Governments would be a false course of action.
<P>
The fundamental thrust of what we should be trying to achieve is a definition of terrorism as an attempt to undermine democratic processes by the use of violence. The definition should deal with circumstances in which a terrorist group decides to target a political party and certain Members of Parliament because they are members of that party, even though such action is not aimed at overthrowing or influencing the Government. I am not talking now about the particular circumstances in Ireland, but such a definition should encompass action against, say, the Liberal Democrats, members of the Campaign party or supporters of the pound if they became targets of a group.
<P>
The amendment should be rejected because it restricts the definition too narrowly to acts directed against a Government. That is not to say that members of the Committee have not raised important and difficult questions. I concede that it is difficult to find the right definition, which is why I said on the Floor of the House and I say again now that, if a better form of words can be found, we are willing to consider it. So far, however, we have not found one nor do I think that the amendment fits the bill.
<P>
We chose the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``advancing a political, religious or ideological cause''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because it summed up what we were trying to achieve. It encompasses the use of violence in an attempt to undermine the democratic process better than any other description. I have been involved in wide debate about the issue, not just this morning, but more generally, and I have not yet come across a better definition than that which the Government are offering. In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, we came up with such a form of words because we thought that it would deal with the feeling of what we were about as effectively as any other wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Did the definition in the Bill come by way of a submission or argument from an outside reputable body? I shall not criticise the Government if it did, but it would be helpful to know whether the Government or an outside organisation constructed the form of words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I must plead guilty as charged. The Government constructed a form of words that we thought summed up most effectively the spirit of the Bill. It was based on a great variety of views, including those of Lord Lloyd and others and arose from a wide public debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey knows this, but the Conservative party's submission to the consultation paper supported the Government's definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I was careful to take credit on behalf of the Government for what we did. I did not want to bring ourselves into disrepute by associating ourselves with the Opposition.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone agrees that it is important to refute publicly and directly the proposition that to have a cause is to be a terrorist. I accept entirely the thrust of his remarks. It is not the case that to have a cause is to be a terrorist. Or, to put it as he did, to have a cause is not to be a terrorist. Indeed, all of us who are in the business of promoting political debates about a wide variety of issues support the proposition that it is good for people to campaign for causes, whatever they might be. The distinguishing feature of a democracy as opposed as to other forms of organisation of society is that we promote those causes within our democratic system, rather than having recourse to violence and other means. It is important to be clear as to whether there is any doubt—I do not believe that there is—that the Bill does not suggest that it is wrong for people to have causes or that to have causes adds up to behaving as a terrorist. On the contrary, the Government and all hon. Members strongly want to promote a society in which people have views and causes, campaign and take up issues, but do so inside the democratic tradition that we embody by virtue of our election rather than outside it in any direct way.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I advance two further reasons why the Committee should reject the amendment. The amendment does not deal with them. Lord Lloyd proposed that any new definition should cover acts by terrorists that, although not violent in themselves, cause great danger to life. His example was the disruption of computer installations supporting an air traffic control system. It is important that our definition catches that broad type of abuse, even though there is a distinction between its effects and violence. Our definition is intended to catch it, but the amendment would not do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It is fair to raise a subject now that I did not raise before. Both Lord Lloyd's definition and that in the Bill suggest that it would be acceptable to use terrorism legislation to deal with attacks or violence against property as opposed to people which does not necessarily result in danger to life. That is one of the options; the Government list three. Does the Minister agree that we should certainly be careful about that issue, to put it mildly? An attack that merely damages property and is not intended to damage people is hugely different from something that, by damaging property, is intended to harm people and endanger life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point, but one has to be extremely careful about the concept of intent in this context. We all know of instances in which damage to property has had the effect, if not the intent, of threatening people's lives and health in various ways. Although I acknowledge that difficult and delicate issues must be addressed, I feel that it is right to include property in our definition due to the impact that damage to property can have. Some of the most serious recent terrorist acts, such as the Canary Wharf bombing, were allegedly focused purely on property rather than people. In that sense, the delicate matter of warnings becomes a sharpened issue, but people have lost their lives in such attacks. It would be rash simply to exclude property, even though a terrorist organisation could say that its intent was not to threaten life. That is why it is right to include property in the definition.
<P>
Individuals rather than organisations can pose terrorist threats. If the amendment were made, that would be a second difficult subject not covered. Such cases are not commonplace, but they sometimes arise, so legislation should encompass them too. A case in point is that of the Oklahoma city bomber.
<P>
I conclude by emphasising something that I said on Second Reading that is important for us all to bear in mind, and in doing so I accept a point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. For the most part, people who commit or threaten terrorist acts will be dealt with under the normal criminal law whether the act involved is murder or something else. The purpose of including the definition is to trigger additional powers for the police to use in preventing, detecting and investigating terrorism. That is the fundamental purpose of the Bill. Of course the Bill includes some additional offences, designed primarily to curb the establishment and maintenance of terrorist organisations. That is a worthy aim, because some terrorist organisations have as an ambition the undermining of democracy. It is not simply a question of objecting to a particular Government and being involved in anti-Government activity. The activity of some organisations goes much wider than that, and it is important to equip ourselves as effectively as possible in this rapidly changing world to deal with it.
<P>
For all those reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the hon. Gentleman's arguments and amendment and will accept the definition that we propose. I shall discuss amendments Nos. 11 and 12 in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have some difficulty with the way in which the Minister distinguished between influencing the Government and activity undertaken by the sort of movement that would attack, for example, my party or another party. In a democracy such as ours, there is no reason to advance that argument because the institution of government is intended to and, I hope, does, reflect the interests of society as a whole. No dividing line exists between the interests of my party or another movement in a democratic system and the interests of the Government.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I was trying to explain that it is not enough simply to focus our definition of terrorism in the Bill on people who want to influence or overthrow the Government. Organisations sometimes have wider motives related to undermining democracy itself. It might be argued that influencing the Government is the same as democracy, as the hon. Gentleman argued. However, that argument does not stand up to close scrutiny. Many people believe that influencing the Government involves seeking to change Government decisions on particular matters, by seeking to change the views of Ministers, civil servants or the Government, broadly defined. For noble motives, the hon. Gentleman is trying to define the interests of the Government more widely than that body of Government decisions, to include an interest in sustaining the body politic and the democracy in which we live. I understand the force of that point, which is perfectly legitimate, but it is better to be clear about what we mean than to allow a definition of what ``Government'' means to rest on his proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister mentioned the Oklahoma bomber, an individual without an organisation or a clear motive, and suggested that such a person would be deemed a terrorist under the Bill. It was concluded that he was a terrorist because he used explosives. Would a serial killer who targets prostitutes or homosexuals be deemed a terrorist?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The two examples are not comparable. The definition in the Bill reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause''{**4w**}.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It is clear that there are individuals who have a political, religious or ideological cause. I was not linking that to explosives; there are other conceivable activities in which people can engage. With all respect to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, it is stretching the issue to include a serial killer in the definition of a political, religious or ideological cause. I understand from the novels of Patricia Cornwell that there are people with a religious cause who go about killing people. It can happen in fiction and sometimes in fact as a result of a religious motivation. I can understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but his argument would not stand up in court. Even more significant, the Bill will give the police practical guidance on how to operate at particular times. The legislation must meet that test, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to press the Minister because the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has touched on a good central point. Let us consider someone who believed that he had a religious conviction to stop people committing adultery. Or someone may feel that he has a duty to punish people who have sex before marriage. Why would that not come within the definition if someone was stalking or using violence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause . . . an action which . . . involves serious violence against any person''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that such action falls four-square within the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I do not believe that that is the case. I concede, as I have done from the outset, that it is difficult to find a definition, but I believe profoundly that the thrust of what we are doing is to target those who seek to undermine democracy. That is the form of words that we want. That targeted ambition is different from that of someone who seeks to kill a string of individuals as a result of some obsession. There is a distinction that will be well understood by the courts. More important, it will be well understood by society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> What would it matter if that serial murderer were included in the definition? Why does the Minister feel that he has to answer that point? It is daft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I sometimes wonder that about many of the points that are put to me, but I shall not detain the Committee with my reflections on that issue. It is important to answer the point because the fact that we are giving the police greater powers to deal with a series of crimes raises serious questions for the body politic. The action of a mass murderer, serial killer or whoever is a different matter from a threat to democracy itself. That is why I feel obliged to answer the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that the Government are saying that the Bill is intended to deal with another type of activity, but the Minister knows that what we say in Committee or on the Floor of the House is secondary to what is contained in the proposed legislation. He has been perfectly considerate, but will he reflect on the point that I and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone have made? I do not think that anyone outside would expect the Government to give anti-terrorist powers to police who are hunting a stalker or a disturbed sex fiend. That is outside what the Bill intends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall certainly give further consideration to that matter and the others that have been raised by hon. Members. The distinction is clearer than was suggested, in good faith, by the hon. Members for Fenmanagh and South Tyrone and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The definition in the Bill stands against that charge.
<P>
We have gone on for some time, so I shall not detain the Committee on the other two amendments, save to say that I agree with the hon. Member for Aylesbury that their unintended effect would be to widen the definition of terrorism rather more than any of us would want.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall deal with the last point first. I think that there is all-party consensus on the fact that amendments Nos. 12 and 11 are inappropriate. Those who tabled them will doubtless read what we have said, they may reflect that the amendments do not say quite what they intended. That must be for them to judge.
<P>
I thank the Committee for this entirely rational and considered debate. The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) may be surprised that I should be so generous and kind to him, but his point was perfectly valid. The hon. Member for Basingstoke made a similar point. As the Minister said, the definition proposed in amendment No. 1 started from the traditional, narrow definition of terrorism. It is in contradistinction to the Government's widely drawn definition and it clearly would not deal with the point made by either of the hon. Gentlemen. It would deal with acts against governments, but not with action against countries that have no government or with action between warring factions. That is a perfectly valid criticism of the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that the amendment would not deal with tit-for-tat killings committed for purely political ends. We must make a collective decision about whether we want to include such acts, but it is certainly reasonable to argue that something that has a political end should be included in the Bill. It takes us beyond action against governments, whether de jure or de facto, but it is a perfectly reasonable next step. The hon. Member for Aylesbury made a similar point. He said, for example, that much activity in former Yugoslavia would have come within that sort of definition. Ethnic cleansing would not necessarily be aimed at attacking the Government in Croatia or Bosnia; it would be aimed at attacking one of the other power bases in those countries. We are dealing with not only national but international terrorism, so we must be sure that we encompass that fact.
<P>
In his own interests, I want to ensure that what the hon. Member for Aylesbury said has not been misunderstood. He can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the Conservative party supports the Lord Lloyd proposal rather than what the Government propose in the Bill. As I said earlier, the Lord Lloyd proposal is better than the Government's because it includes the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to intimidate or coerce a government, the public or any section of the public''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will also remember a slightly different definition of the objectives. Lord Lloyd proposed the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``political, social or ideological objectives''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government propose the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``political, religious or ideological causes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government's version is probably better, as ``social'' could lead to a definition that was too wide. It would be better to rein it in to traditional species of ideology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Aylesbury indicates from a sedentary position that that is so.
<P>
I thank the Minister for his considered replies today and on Second Reading. One of the purposes of today's debate has been to test the Government in a slightly more considered way than we are able to do on the Floor of the House, and to ensure that our conclusion commands the widest agreement. If we can come to an agreement, I shall certainly be willing to subscribe to it.
<P>
I flag up the fact that there are still matters between us, but I shall shortly beg leave to withdraw the amendment, not least so that the justifiable concerns expressed by the Committee can be accommodated. If there can be wider agreement on an alternative form of words, it is clearly in everyone's interests to achieve that. I shall take on board comments that members of the Committee have made and see whether we can find something that more accurately meets common concerns.
<P>
The Minister's first point was that the definition should go wider than acts directed against the Government. I have accepted that there is an argument for that; in this day and age, it is probably wise to draft legislation to accommodate that. I accept that the Minister's intention was to deal with activities that undermine the democratic process, widely defined. That is a proper starting point. However, one cannot have that in the wording of the Bill. As he said, to do so would include attacks on political movements, parties or positions, not necessarily on the Government, both in democracies such as ours and in places without proper democratic government. We should also accommodate that. If a party or movement in England or in Northern Ireland were under attack, we should have the potential to protect it.
<P>
The second issue that the Government have not fully addressed is that of attacks solely against property. I understand the Minister's argument about the differentiation between property and persons. I was not seeking to suggest that a property-aimed activity, to use the legal terminology, which was reckless about whether it might also cause injury to people should be outside the definition. I was concerned only about activity that was clearly and solely intended to damage property. To take a minor example, it would be inappropriate to include in the definition spraying politically inciting graffiti—as happens all the time in Northern Ireland and occasionally here; in inner cities, it is often racially motivated, with a political party sometimes behind it—that were clearly intended to have consequences only on property. I understand that spraying graffiti is a serious offence that constitutes criminal damage, but I am keen that the legislation should not cover a property offence that is absolutely and solely a property offence, as opposed to also being an offence against the person. There is a big difference between the two and none of us would seek to justify defining as terrorism an activity intended to damage only property, with no intention to hurt people.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I disagree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) disagrees; that is an issue between us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman has conceded the point that I was going to make. The definition is clear; it involves serious violence against property. It would be difficult to support the inclusion in that category of such activities as graffiti spraying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that, but one can think of serious offences that do not involve attacks on people. Arson is an obvious example; interestingly, the right to trial by jury for arson is about to be changed if the Government get their way, but I will leave that subject until the debate in the Chamber on Thursday. Arson on a building that is known to be empty, such as a barn in a field, with no one living nearby, would be a serious offence against property that would have no direct effect on people. We can debate that, but I am trying to make the point that there is a property issue that remains to be debated.
<P>
There are two remaining issues. The Government have set out in the Bill a cumulative set of conditions that would allow us to define an activity as terrorism; persons or organisations would need to be included. I understand the weakness in the definition of terrorism in the amendment as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acts of persons acting on behalf of, or in connection with, any organisation''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We may need a definition that covers someone acting on his own because a terrorist can be a person acting alone. Such a person might be obsessed and have a determination to act violently against the First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister of United Kingdom, the First Minister of Scotland, or whomever. A terrorist does not have to be a member of an organisation. That is a perfectly reasonable objection.
<P>
My last point is that, still missing from the Government's definition, is the point that Lord Lloyd understood and included in his report: there must be a link between the action, the mind of the individual and the outcome. I accept the Minister's argument that we cannot rely only on the intention, but that we must look at the indirect consequences. However, I still consider that Lord Lloyd was more circumspect and more justified in his proposals than the Government were in theirs. The Minister was good enough to admit that the form of words was drafted from within the Government machine. It is therefore open to proper scrutiny.
<P>
We have had a good and reasonable debate that has flagged up certain issues. A form of words from both the amendment and the Government's definition may produce a better way forward. I hope that we can achieve that on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No 13, in page 1, line 14, after `Kingdom', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except in such countries or parts of countries as the Secretary of State may designate by order under Schedule (Designation<P>
</UL></FONT>)'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 14, in page 1, line 16, after `situated', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except in such countries or parts of countries outside the United Kingdom as the Secretary of State may designate by order under Schedule (Designation<P>
</UL></FONT>)'.<P>

<P>
New schedule 1—Designation—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>.—(1) The Secretary of State may by order designate countries or parts of countries outside the United Kingdom to which subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) of section 1 of this Act shall not apply.
<P>
(2) Any such order shall cease to have effect at the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the day on which it came into force.
<P>
(3) The Secretary of State may by order provide that an order made under this Schedule shall cease to have effect.
<P>
(4) An order under subsections (2) or (3) shall be made by statutory instrument and shall only be made if a draft has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I tabled the amendments to give the Committee the opportunity to discuss in great detail the extent to which the Bill should bite on acts of violence that are committed in foreign countries. I am not claiming that they are perfect, but many concerns were expressed on Second Reading from both sides of the House about the scope of the Bill and I hope that the Government might be willing to consider making changes to it. Will the Minister explain in greater detail than was possible on Second Reading what sort of checks against the abuse of anti-terrorist powers there should be for actions committed overseas?
<P>
All members of the Committee understand that it is right that a Bill designed to combat terrorism should cover, for example, attacks on British citizens, armed forces personnel, other British interests and property overseas. It is also right that it should allow the police and other authorities in this country to use counter-terrorist powers against groups, such as the Euskadi Ta Askatasung in Spain, the Red Army that used to operate in Italy and the Bader-Meinhoff gang that operated formerly as a terrorist organisation in the Federal Republic of Germany.
<P>
Concern was expressed about whether the language of the Bill would allow the police to use powers against individuals and organisations, that were opposing, in foreign countries, regimes that most people in the United Kingdom would find odious, as, indeed, would the British Government, of any political party. Worry was also expressed that people could be criminalised by undertaking what all of us would probably regard as perfectly reasonable democratic political activity on behalf of people living under oppressive Government regimes elsewhere in the world.
<P>
The amendments are designed to accept the general presumption that acts of violence against persons or property overseas should be defined as terrorist, but to provide a mechanism to make exceptions to that general rule. Amendment No. 13 would amend clause 1(2)(a) so that the definition of action in clause 1(1) would include action outside the United Kingdom except in a country or part of a country that the Secretary of State had designated as exempt.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 14 would introduce a similar power of exemption in clause 1(2)(b), and the new schedule would establish a mechanism under which the Secretary of State would seek the agreement of Parliament to statutory instruments to designate certain countries or parts of countries as exempt from the general presumption in clause 1. If the mechanism were established, my assumption is that the British Government might decide to exempt actions in respect of a specific country, such as Serbia or Iraq, from the general presumption of terrorism in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I am worried about the implications of that. It could even be described as the ``safe haven for terrorism'' schedule. Let us give a few examples to assess the reality. If we exempted the Punjab, the Jaffna peninsula or Kashmir, that could imply that the British Government are not opposed to terrorist actions in those areas. The logic of that would be serious for the minority communities in this country, whatever the reason. If we were to exempt Serbia, which the hon. Gentleman gave as an example, would that mean that the British Government approved of terrorist organisations blowing up buses and bridges there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> No, I do not mean that, and I quite deliberately did not move any amendment that would give any powers of exemption in respect of clause 1(2)(c), partly for the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman. I ask him to accept that, in the accounts that Ministers gave on Second Reading, it was explicit that there should be some distinction in practice between violent actions in different countries. Ministers asked us to accept that that decision should be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecution Service rather than openly and transparently by a Minister in the way that I suggest might be made through the amendments.
<P>
Let me give the hon. Gentleman am example. Sierra Leone was referred to earlier. President Kabbah's Government were overthrown and he sought through armed intervention to secure his restoration. The British Government gave him strong diplomatic support in those efforts. My concern is that people who organised meetings or raised funds in this country to support Mr. Kabbah's armed campaign to be restored as the leader of Sierra Leone would find themselves at risk of prosecution, even though the policy of the British Government was aligned with the actions of those individuals.
<P>
The Government say that we need have no fears because the Crown Prosecution Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions understand that such judgments have to be made and that we can trust them to reach sensible decisions. I do not wish to attack the probity or the professionalism of either the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Crown Prosecution Service, although most Members of Parliament will have had occasion—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can hear the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. Perhaps he can go outside if he has things to discuss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Most Members of Parliament might have had occasion to question whether the Crown Prosecution Service always makes a correct and sensible judgment in every case that it considers. The principle of its operation is that two conditions must be satisfied. First, there must be sufficient evidence to make it likely that a case will succeed before a court and, secondly, that it is in the public interest that such a case should proceed. My understanding of the Government's position is that we can trust the DPP and the CPS to accept that it is in the public interest that a prosecution should not go forward in respect of action against an individual or country that the British people, or the British Government—it is not quite clear—find objectionable, autocratic, totalitarian or dictatorial. The DPP and the CPS will ensure that people are not prosecuted for organising meetings about the overthrow of Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic. I wonder whether it is right or fair to lay that burden on the DPP and his staff.
<P>
My time a decade ago as a Whitehall special adviser leads me to believe that there is a curious osmosis within Whitehall. Different Departments seek to influence the direction of policy and I fear that, if the Bill remains unamended, there could be such osmosis in prosecutions. I can recall a time when the British Government had poor relations with Iran. There were strong arguments to maintain sanctions and to refuse diplomatic relations with Iran, which supported international terrorism. That was at the time of the affair involving Mr. Rushdie and when there were British hostages in Beirut. I can remember at the same time the siren voices at the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence telling the Foreign Office, ``Look boys, we must be sensible about this. The Italians and the French are already there getting the contracts. Isn't it time that Government policy was changed? We have to look at the wider national interest.''
<P>
Given the relationship between Whitehall, the Government and the media, I am worried that those responsible for making decisions about whether to prosecute could be influenced by political considerations. My intention in tabling the amendments is not to claim that my alternative is perfect. I do not intend to press the matter to a vote. From what Ministers have said, there will be a system to distinguish a terrorist action overseas from an action overseas that is deemed acceptable. Would it not be better if such arrangements were out in the open and transparent, involving Ministers who are clearly accountable for their decisions to the House of Commons, rather than leaving them to professional lawyers and civil servants, who should not have to bear that burden? Is it any more objectionable in principle to move in that direction than to proscribe individual organisations in the way that the Bill allows? Is it more objectionable to move in that direction than to follow the United States, recognising the concept of terrorist states and applying it to particular sovereign Governments who the United States Administration believe sponsor international terrorism?
<P>
I believe that hon. Members of all parties have anxieties about the matter. Although I do not claim that my amendments are perfect, I look for some reassurance from the Government that they recognise the widespread fears that have been expressed and will try to meet them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The purpose of the Committee is open and frank debate. I hope that I shall not incur the wrath of my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury if I gently question the thrust of his argument.
<P>
I sympathise with the points made by the hon. Member for Ilford, North—
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I apologise—by the hon. Member for Ilford, South. I am extremely alarmed by the implications of the Secretary of State's effective issuing of a licence to kill in certain countries. The underlying theme of my hon. Friend's argument is right. Although we understand the need to use force in political opposition in some countries, to allow that to happen in this country, from this country or to be supported in this country is a different matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand why the hon. Member for Aylesbury tabled the amendment. It is genuinely a probing amendment that relates to a difficult and problematic matter, as I acknowledge. However, I associate myself with the anxieties that my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South and the hon. Member for Basingstoke expressed about the substance of the amendments.
<P>
It would be dangerous for the Government to state that terrorism in certain territories is acceptable. In the example that the hon. Member for Aylesbury cited, of the United States concept of terrorist states, almost the reverse is true. Even though the United States recognises a concept such as he describes, no United States concept makes it acceptable to engage in terrorist activity in order, for example, to kill a leader in those states. The United States uses definitions in foreign policy, but even in that network they do not extend to meaning that terrorism is acceptable. It would be extremely dangerous for us to move in that direction.
<P>
The question of what criteria would apply is extremely difficult. The need for the Government to reach a fixed view, which the amendment implies, in publishing their conclusions in the schedule, would involve setting out the matter extremely clearly and dangerously.
<P>
The third problem relates to confusion about the good and the bad, and about who is taking the action. Most such areas are experiencing conflict, with people on both sides of the argument. In the event of a terrorist act, who would be responsible?
<P>
In what sense do we approve of one side being responsible for the act, but not the other? That is difficult and dangerous to pursue. I fear that almost any definition would fail the test that the hon. Member for Aylesbury wants to set. We would steadily go through a process of osmosis to say in a public and direct way, ``Certain action in this state is okay'', which would be a dangerous course.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman was talking, I thought about Serbia, the murder of Arkan in Belgrade the other day and all the speculation about who was behind it. Perhaps that could not be said to be a terrorist act according to what we are discussing, but the difficult question of who had a motive would be opened if the amendment were to be accepted.
<P>
I want to reassure the hon. Member for Aylesbury that we are thinking seriously about how to get the definitions right, although they are difficult. We shall continue to consider proposals that might deal with them. With all respect, however, I do not think that the amendment is acceptable, although his probing into the matter is perfectly reasonable.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and for the assurance that the Government continue to consider the issue. I am quite prepared to accept his criticisms of the amendment. I hope that we will have the opportunity to return to the subject at a later stage, but in the meantime I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No 4, in page 1, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) ``serious violence'' includes serious disruption to economic and commercial life'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would change the definition of ``serious violence'' in clause 1 to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``serious disruption to economic and commercial life''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister referred to Lord Lloyd's consideration of acts of violence that might not endanger life or public safety but might nevertheless cause severe economic or social disruption. Lord Lloyd gave examples such as disruption to telecommunication systems and, as the Minister mentioned, computers that manage air traffic control systems. A terrorist group could inflict severe damage in this country by attacking communications or IT systems of other sorts. So many businesses ate now dependent on information technology that disruption of computers might cause grave economic harm, put jobs at risk and dissuade investors from maintaining operations in this country.
<P>
If I understood the Minister's earlier comments, he felt that the Bill would cover that point, but I am not certain that it does. The definition in clause 1 falls short of covering the sort of disruptive attack on computers and communication systems that Lord Lloyd saw as a problem and which the Government have acknowledged. Such an attack remains a threat. I hope that the Minister can persuade me that the Bill as drafted covers the point, or that he will be prepared to consider amendments to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand the amendment, but I am troubled by it because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``serious disruption to economic and commercial life''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
need not be violent. An entirely peaceful mass demonstration in the City of London, with a huge number of people walking up and down the streets, could be said to have caused serious disruption to economic and commercial life. However, no violence would have been involved. The suggested definition, although well intended, is dangerous and wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I am interested to know how the definition would relate to industrial action. For example, if a worker locked the factory gates and walked off with the key or put Superglue in the lock, could it be defined as terrorism simply because it had caused serious disruption? Such things have happened in industrial disputes, and I should be very worried if the Bill included an open-ended, blanket clause that could result in people engaged in trade union activity being charged with terrorist offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand why the hon. Member for Aylesbury tabled the amendment, and I have some sympathy with his motivation. We looked carefully at his definition, however, and we believe that it is wrong. It is a question of balance.
<P>
In rejecting that approach, we took note of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South. It is important that the definitions in the Bill should not catch actions in connection with industrial disputes, large demonstrations of the sort mentioned by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey or even politically motivated mass boycotts of major oil companies. To define those things as terrorist activities would infringe too far on the definition that we spoke of earlier.
<P>
I have no difficulty with the way in which the hon. Member for Aylesbury moved the amendment—it was a reasonable effort to seek further clarification—but we decided not to go down that route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I entirely agree with the Minister that industrial action should not be caught by a definition of terrorism. However, I am worried that that may already have been achieved in clause 1(1)(c). Would not a dispute in the health service be in danger of being caught by that definition of terrorism?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We do not think so. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I say again that a difficult judgment must be made on where to draw the line, and which actions should fall on what side of that line. To suggest, for instance, that the nurses' dispute could be a terrorist act is wrong. It would not cause a serious risk, nor would it be driven by a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``political, religious or ideological cause''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be a trade dispute, which is not a political, religious or ideological cause. However, I am worried that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Aylesbury would further widen the definition. That would make it more dangerous, because perfectly legitimate acts of the sort that we all understand might fall within the ambit of the Bill.
<P>
The Computer Misuse Act 1990 creates specific offences in cases of computer hacking. I acknowledge what was said by the hon. Member for Aylesbury in that context. Many of the other provisions of the clause 1 definition cover some types of attack that terrorists might make with the aim of disrupting economic life. For example, bombing the stock exchange or hacking into the national grid computer system would both be caught under other definitions.
<P>
The Committee should not accept the amendment. I do not say that because it is completely out of order or because it has been put in the wrong way but because, on that balance of judgment, we believe that it widens the definition too much. We urge the Committee not to do as the hon. Member for Aylesbury suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I remain concerned that some actions that terrorists might choose to take severely to damage this country would appear to be excluded from the Bill. For that reason, the police and other agencies would lack special powers in preventing such actions or in seeking to catch those responsible for perpetrating them. I understand and sympathise with the points made by the Minister and the hon. Member for Ilford, South. No Opposition Member would want legitimate industrial actions—or demonstrations, to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred—to come inadvertently within the scope of the Bill's definition of terrorism. I shall reflect further on the matter between now and Report. I also believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke hit on an interesting matter, which we may wish to debate in later proceedings. There may be scope for interpreting the Bill in the way that he suggests and I am sure that that is the last thing that the Government wish to see. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 21, after `organisation', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or of a member or members of a proscribed organisation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a minor probing amendment. It would add the reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a member or members of a proscribed organisation''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to subsection (3), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``action taken for the benefit of a proscribed organisation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seek clarification from the Minister. The sort of case that I had in mind when tabling the amendment was that of an attempt by a terrorist group to secure the release of one of its members from prison. The member might be an elderly comrade who had been imprisoned for a long time and whose release might not therefore be of great advantage to the organisation. Does the Minister consider that subsection (3), as drafted, would cover such an eventuality or does its scope need to be broadened a little?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Again, in the Spirit of our discussions so far, I welcome the tabling of the amendment in order to clarify the situation. However, its effect would be to class all actions taken for the benefit of a member of a proscribed organisation as actions taken
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purposes of terrorism''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could lead to an unacceptable overlap of issues. It is important, therefore, to stick to the definition in the Bill. By no stretch of the imagination should actions about promoting terrorist activity be caught up within the definition of terrorism.
<P>
We have thought carefully about clause 1(3) and believe that our definition is right. While I acknowledge the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, we resist any suggestion that would widen the definition and make the ambit and impact of the Bill broader than members of the Committee would want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I sympathise with the Minister's response. The amendment is clearly too wide because it could cover circumstances in which an individual within an organisation, whatever one thinks of it, could gain personal or financial benefit.
<P>
However, Northern Ireland is a good example of the issue that remains. I hope that splinter groups and other such organisations, especially in the early days, are the only ones that are likely to be proscribed. What about when someone or a group acts unofficially on behalf of a cause or organisation? I do not have an immediate answer to that problem, but perhaps we should think about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have listened to what the Minister and other colleagues have said, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> When speaking to the amendments, we touched on the substance of clause 1, which we have agreed is the definition clause. Our Second Reading and Committee debates have flagged up the points at issue and given us a good basis for further consideration. If we proceed in a businesslike way, as the Minister hopes, we shall have time to see whether we can come to some agreement about the changes that we want. We Liberal Democrats believe that the definition should be restricted along the lines that we have suggested. We are not there yet, but it is a debate for another time. It would be pointless to vote against the clause. I shall not vote for it, but I shall not record a vote against it today. I have made my objections clear, and would rather be seen at this stage to be constructively seeking a solution. We shall come back to the matter on Report if we are still unhappy. We hope by that stage to have offered the Government something decent to accept, but I shall not press our position now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's sentiments Problems remain in clause 1, which were touched on in the debate on the various amendments. I have not been completely reassured by the Minister's answers and I hope that there will be further consideration of these matters on Report. I flag up again the point that I made about clause l(l)(c). An industrial dispute could be ideological. They have been over the years, and could be again. An undesirable effect could be achieved by the Bill's definition of terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I think that all members of the Committee who have taken part in this morning's proceedings have approached the Bill constructively. There are still some points on which the Government might reflect further, although I do not share the dissatisfaction of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the Government's definition of terrorism.
<P>
One point that was not covered in our earlier proceedings and to which the Minister might refer in his concluding remarks, concerns the reference in subsection (1)(a) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``serious violence against any person or property''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand why the Government have chosen to raise the threshold from simply ``violence'' to ``serious violence'' and I concede that that must be part of the overall judgment about the correct balance to strike. I have no quarrel with the idea that there should be a test of serious violence when referring to action against property. My question is whether the test of serious violence is adequate when it comes to violence against people. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee an assurance that the Government have no intention of seeking to distinguish between bombings or shootings, which are designed to kill, and the sort of punishment beatings and shootings that terrorist organisations have perpetrated all too frequently in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I appreciate the spirit in which members of the Committee have conducted the debate. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, it has been a constructive discussion about difficult questions. The matters at issue are not easy and we are obliged to consider them carefully. I am even prepared to be warm-hearted and tolerant towards the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey on the question of principled abstentions. In my time in politics, I have known a number of principled abstentions that have been motivated by important factors, so I accept the principle of them.
<P>
We will continue to look at the issues. I reiterate the genuine commitment that I gave on Second Reading that we are ready to keep matters under review and to wait for other amendments that would improve the definition in the clause. Although we have resisted the amendments tabled today, important points have been made in the debate and we shall consider them carefully and whether we should introduce changes, although I have to say that no proposal advanced so far seems compelling enough to justify our finding a way to add it to the Bill. However, I remain absolutely open to any proposals from members of the Committee. I am not taking a rigid, stonewalling position—to use the phrase used at the beginning of our discussion. I am taking a sceptical position, in the hope of endearing myself to at least some Opposition Members, on the effect of any amendment. It is important that our aim to fight terrorism is not in any way diminished.
<P>
The purpose of using the word ``serious'' was to raise the threshold, which we saw as important in the context of generally widening the definition to reassure people that we were not seeking to use the legislation in inappropriate areas. There is no intention to distinguish between particular forms of action, and we think it an appropriate word to include in the definition. I believe that it fulfils the criterion of providing a tougher test that will none the less give the police and the courts clarity. I thank members of the Committee for their helpful contributions.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
