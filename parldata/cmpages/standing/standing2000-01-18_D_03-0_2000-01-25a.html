<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>PROSCRIBED ORGANISATIONS</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): We partly debated schedule 2 on Thursday, during our debate on clause 3. However, following the Minister's answers to Opposition Members, I would like to pursue a couple of points.
<P>
First, my reading of what the Minister said was that the Government did not have it in mind actively to consider adding United Kingdom organisations to the list, but that they were minded to add international organisations. If so, by what process do they intend to enable that consideration? Would they consider consultation, at any level, with members of the Committee from other political parties? Would they consider consultation between the Secretary of State and his opposite numbers? Would they consider consultation at Privy Council level?
<P>
It is obviously desirable to be able to add to the list. However, additions would be more controversial than deletions; they would have to be the subject of political agreement. Self-evidently, that applies also to Northern Ireland and Irish organisations, although—based on our experience of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 over the past 25 years—the Irish list is relatively stable.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister has said that such matters are kept under permanent review. It will help us to know whether the Government expect to make additions to the list as soon as the Bill is enacted or whether it will not happen until a minimum period has passed. I understand, of course, that one must respond to immediate events. However, by definition, a process is being gone through. As we said the other day, the Bill will introduce, for the first time, new ways of defining terrorism, and new categories of organisations can therefore be included. I hope that the Government will be as forthcoming and as open as possible. Do they expect to start considering the matter with colleagues as soon as the Bill becomes law, or do they envisage that, unless something untoward happens, no organisation that could be a candidate for addition to the list will be added for three or six months—or whatever minimum time has been decided? I am trying to discover how the Government see the process of starting to review the list given in schedule 2, and how it will be done in the political context.
<P>
Lastly, the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), I and others said last week that the information on which the Government based their decisions should be objectively checked and tested. We explored the idea that that might involve the diplomatic service, the foreign service, the secret services, international police networks and so on. Will the Government undertake to consult human rights organisations and international political watch organisations—for instance, Amnesty International was consulted by the Home Secretary in the Pinochet case—as they have an interest and a network of information? Any Government who proscribe an organisation internationally risk endless controversy, not least in the House of Commons, unless they tread carefully and act on the best balanced advice. By definition, significant controversy in and beyond Parliament would be likely in the case of, for example, Kurdish organisations active in Turkey or elsewhere in the middle east. Would it be appropriate to proscribe an organisation that was campaigning for the freedom of its people from a power that was a NATO ally and—let me put it neutrally—a developing democracy?
<P>
The matter is sensitive. It is important that the Government are seen not to act only on the advice of those within Government and their agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am following the hon. Gentleman's arguments as closely as ever. I invite him to contemplate whether another nation's security services, official so far as that nation was concerned, might be susceptible to proscription in this country, where we perhaps have a different set of values.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is an interesting and perfectly appropriate question. Security organisations of other Governments have been publicly reported to be active in this country. Would it be possible to proscribe an agency of a foreign power? I shall be careful because my recollection is a little hazy—I had not expected to have to recall the case—but I think that it was suggested that the Bulgarian official who was killed on Blackfriars bridge was killed by a Government agency from his home state.
<P>
My questions and the point made by the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) are important because they relate to how freedom of information legislation impinges on the Bill. It is no good the Government saying that the subject is internationally delicate, dealt with by Interpol, other crime and intelligence services, secret services, the foreign service and our diplomatic service, and that everything must be kept confidential at the heart of government so that no one can know anything about it. That is why I seek to give a range of options and tell the Government that they cannot hold all the decisions inside. There must be some agreement with other democratic representatives so that the power of the Executive is not untrammelled.
<P>
I raise that subject because the Bill makes it clear that the quasi-judicial process will not bite until after a proscription has been made. The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and other hon. Members raised concerns about that, and it will come up today. There would be a safeguard if a process had to go through the courts before proscription, but the Bill gives all the power at the front end to Government. Only after that can people start to challenge and undo a decision. Whatever party we come from, whatever our view on terrorist organisations from left or right, we all have an interest in ensuring that the Government get things as right as possible the first time. The more they do so, the fewer judicial challenges are likely to occur. I hope that Government Members will appreciate that those are proper issues to raise and that the more forthcoming they are at this stage, the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): Our debate on clause 3 stand part last Thursday was very short and I am glad that we can return to some of the relevant points in debating the schedule.
<P>
In our previous sitting, the Minister acknowledged that proscription involved
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a finely balanced judgment and difficult issues''—[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 20 January 2000; c. 68.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am aware of the finely balanced nature of the argument and I want to probe that in respect of the schedule. In paragraph 4.14 of the consultation paper ``Legislation Against Terrorism'', the Government state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An advantage in extending the current UK proscription powers so that the whole range of terrorist groups covered by the proposed new definition of terrorism could be caught is that it would provide a mechanism to signal clearly condemnation of any terrorist organisation whatever its origin and motivation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that principle. I see its purpose and I acknowledge the force of that line of argument. However, the consultation paper also acknowledges the complexities and difficulties when that principle is put into practice. Paragraph 4.16 states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Although the Government recognises there would appear to be some advantage in extending proscription-type powers to non Irish terrorist groups, it is also aware that there could be attendant difficulties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The paper goes on to talk about the practical and policy difficulties involved in drawing up and maintaining such a list.
<P>
The real risk, as the Government acknowledge in their paper, is that such a list would speedily become out of date. I wonder whether even the short, relatively simple list of 14 Irish organisations in the schedule illustrates the difficulties of maintaining an up-to-date list of proscribed organisations. To my knowledge, the 13th organisation on the list, the Orange Volunteers, does not exist in any practical sense. In my understanding—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—it came into being only shortly before the highly inflammatory press release of October 1998 and in any event it merely assumed that title, which was used by a previously existing organisation, as a flag of convenience.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend is making valuable points. Perhaps he is moving towards making the point that it is in the very nature of those organisations that they are, to use an unfamiliar word, fissiparous—they are always breaking down into smaller fragments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point that I was seeking to make. That particular organisation, the Orange Volunteers, came into being for a very short time, and to all intents and purposes does not exist. I shall not attempt to pronounce the Gaelic of the second and third organisations, but the same argument applies to them. They, too, had a brief existence and to all intents and purposes no longer exist. One may ask, ``So what? Does it particularly matter?'' However, including organisations that do not genuinely exist discredits the principle of a list of proscribed organisations. That leads me to another broad theme. Since our previous sitting, I have read the elaborate briefing notes that Liberty has provided for the Committee. That organisation argues strongly against proscribed lists in principle. It is the act of supporting terrorism, or being involved in terrorist activity that should be the offence, rather than membership of an organisation, which we know is extremely hard to establish, from the few prosecutions that have been made. The problem with proscribed lists is compounded by the fact that convictions can be more readily achieved by use of other provisions in our anti-terrorist legislation.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph 4.7 of the consultation paper, ``Legislation Against Terrorism'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In Northern Ireland, in particular, proscription has come to symbolise the community's abhorrence of the kind of violence that has blighted society there for over 30 years.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I support the concept of the community's abhorrence of such organisations, but can that level of abhorrence occur when considering international terrorism, or organisations that have a presence or support in London, but whose activities do not impinge on the lives of British people to anything like the same extent as Northern Ireland terrorism? The force of symbolising the community's abhorrence does not apply in those circumstances. We should question further the validity of the Government's approach in widening proscription to international terrorism.
<P>
Our argument has three aspects. First, there are immense problems in maintaining schedule 2 on the lines envisaged in the Bill. Secondly, we shall continue to question the principle of proscribing. Thirdly, we acknowledge that proscription has the purpose of indicating abhorrence, but wonder whether such abhorrence applies as forcefully to organisations involved in international terrorism as to organisations involved in Northern Ireland terrorism.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke brings knowledge, long experience and a gravity to these matters, and I endorse his arguments. I add a word of welcome from the Conservative Front Bench to the Government in that we are pleased that the schedule applies to the whole of the United Kingdom, rather than Northern Ireland or Great Britain specifically.
<P>
I have a lighter note on which to conclude before the Minister replies. I am not insisting on an answer today; the Minister can reflect on my inquiry and let me have a note, in which case, the normal courtesy is for that note to be sent to you, Mr. Stevenson, and the whole Committee. This is not an exclusive dialogue between the Minister and me, but a collective decision by the Committee. The fourth entry in the list of proscribed organisations in the schedule refers to the Red Hand Commando. Is that a collective noun or a singular notoriety? If the latter, that would be rather remarkable, or is there an absent plural? It is a lighter inquiry, which should be treated as such by the Committee, and you, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I have no real problem with the schedule; I have only a few questions for the Minister.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. The Government and the Home Office machinery need to be able to respond quickly and flexibly if the list is to have gravitas and not be discredited. No doubt, if a new splinter IRA terrorist group emerges, or issues a press release tomorrow, the Government should have the flexibility to respond quickly to add it to the proscribed list. I think that that machinery exists. Thank goodness, I do not know any of the organisations listed in great depth, but let us say that the Orange Volunteers, for example, existed for only one day, or that its sole terrorist act was to issue a bloodcurdling press release and it then fizzled out. It is important for the Government not to leave gaps or loopholes, and, if there is the slightest suspicion that an organisation still exists, but is lying dormant, of course, it must be on the list. However, I accept that if one of the organisations has died off, or mutated into some other evil form of terrorist organisation, it must be removed from the list. Otherwise, the list will become longer and longer. It will be discredited if it contains a variety of old-hat organisations that are no longer active.
<P>
I want to probe the Government's intention on schedule 2. What can we expect to see on the list in future months or years? I understand that the list can contain any terrorist organisations from around the world. Schedule 2 was set up because of clause 3 and it also refers to clause 1(2), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```action' includes action outside the United Kingdom . . . a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that terrorist organisations proscribed under clause 3 can include foreign ones. The 14 listed in schedule 2 are United Kingdom, home-bred, terrorist organisations. I can understand that the Government do not want to go down the route of adding foreign terrorist organisations that may not be active in this country. For example, I do not know—nor do I wish to know—whether ETA has any contacts, base or people in this country encouraging it. It is the general perception that ETA is not active in Great Britain or the United Kingdom, so why should it be included in the list? However, if we are to co-operate with Interpol, Europol and our overseas allies, if ETA is a proscribed organisation in Spain, should we not be making a practical or solidarity gesture by including such organisations on the list?
<P>
I can see the sense of picking on foreign organisations that are actively involved in terrorism and including them on the list, but where do we stop? What quality controls can be exercised? Through the intelligence services, the Minister has quality controls on 14 organisations at present. I know from my time in the Home Office that various people told us about Combat 18—a very nasty, poisonous group that pumped out vile propaganda. People would ask for it to be a proscribed terrorist organisation, but the official response was that while it was a nasty group, it was all bark and no bite. It was not actively involved in terrorism; it could not change a light bulb, never mind make a bomb. That was the view, although the people involved were very nasty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): For the right hon. Gentleman's information, I am afraid that that organisation is more than all bark and no bite. A number of its leaders have been sentenced to prison for terrorist offences and some of its people were implicated in the sending of letter bombs and other material through the post—including, in recent years, two leading sports and television personalities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful for that information. I stand corrected. However, if they have that terrorist potential, or if they have sent terrorist bombs, why cannot they be included in the list as a proscribed terrorist organisation? Do they still not meet the quality threshold?
<P>
I do not want the Minister to answer the specific point about Combat 18, but it is a good example. Combat 18 and another group of young people were turning out vile anti-Jewish propaganda at the universities. I hope that I am right that they were not involved in terrorist activity, although they certainly encouraged it overseas. They were encouraging the destruction of Israel and the Zionist state. It was nasty stuff, but it would not technically satisfy the quality threshold set out in clause 3.
<P>
I want a steer from the Minister. I know that he cannot answer my specific points without revealing security information, and I have no intention of ascertaining it, but does he see a time when groups such as Combat 18 that turn out anti-Jewish propaganda, or the Animal Liberation Front or other groups in this country, would get to the stage of wishing to send devices? Clause 3(5)(c) states that an organisation is involved in terrorism if it ``promotes or encourages terrorism''. The word ``encourages'' may have moved the threshold slightly lower than it was in my day. Then, one could say that although a group that published filthy leaflets was nasty, it was not involved in terrorism because it did not put together any devices or even buy chemicals, although it certainly encouraged terrorism. Now, if a group encourages terrorism through dialogue or leaflets, it could be caught. Can we expect to see that happen?
<P>
On a related point, can the Minister give me a steer on foreign organisations? I can understand his saying that it is a route that the Government do not want to go down. The Government may have the power to take on any foreign terrorist organisation if it starts to pose a threat to the United Kingdom, starts operating here or sets up bases here. The Minister will know that Saudi Arabia and other countries allege that people who actively encourage terrorism overseas are based in London. Indeed, it was alleged that someone continually broadcast to Saudi Arabia on the BBC. However, when we investigated the matter, we found no evidence that anyone was personally involved, or that anyone had raised money to promote or encourage terrorism.
<P>
The new definition in clause 3 may enable the Minister to take action against groups based in London that overstep the mark. I do not want this country to lose the right to freedom of speech. We should not make it impossible for people to escape from an evil overseas regime by obtaining asylum here. We should not prevent those people speaking of the bad conditions in the country that they have left or stop them encouraging democracy in other countries. However, a number of organisations and many people have abused the hospitality of this country by actively encouraging terrorism against our allies and against friendly states. We should be able to take action against those people or their organisations in limited circumstances, even if they are merely encouraging terrorism.
<P>
Can the Minister guarantee that the list will be as flexible as possible and that we shall be able to remove names as soon as they are thought to be no longer relevant or active? What is his view on adding foreign terrorist organisations to the list, and might we expect to see more domestic, British, home-grown terrorist organisations listed that are not involved in the Irish situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Simon Hughes) has left the Room, as he will not hear my response to his questions. It seems that we are repeating some of the debate—legitimately, obviously—on clause 3. It also seems that we are warming up to many aspects of the Bill now that we have had a substantial debate on the schedule.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) opened the debate by asking several questions, and did so in a probing spirit that was shared by all hon. Members who have spoken. He asked what consultation would take place before decisions were made to proscribe or deproscribe and referred to a range of bodies that could be consulted. He also asked whether the Secretary of State would engage in debate with them through Privy Council terms or other means. That is not the means by which we arrive at our conclusions. That does not mean that under certain circumstances the Secretary of State would not want to talk to others who have an interest and knowledge of the subject. I cannot speak for what the Secretary of State or his successors would do in every set of circumstances, especially as circumstances do not repeat themselves. Different applications and groups come into play. As we move into the question of international terrorism, international considerations become involved as well.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The important aspect of consultation is that any decision to proscribe or deproscribe made by order is then subject to a debate in Parliament. What greater transparency could there be in terms of the quality of a Government's judgment than their having to justify conclusions to Parliament? The relevant Ministers will be asked how they arrived at their conclusions and on what they were based. Of course, the conclusions are often coloured by highly sensitive information, which is difficult to divulge as it may put at risk the lives of those who gathered the information and turned into certainty the accusations and allegations about groups and the potent threats that they posed. Such information would not usually be divulged, and rightly so.
<P>
There are methods of protection within the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission but, to take a belt-and-braces approach, we do not simply rest on them. An independent assessment would come into play. We may return to some of those matters on clause 5, and I suggest that hon. Members may want to explore them in terms of the amendments that they have tabled to it.
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Basingstoke argued that there should not be a list of proscribed organisations in the schedule. I recognise that he has considerable experience in relation to Northern Ireland, but our opinion is that the list successfully acts as a deterrent. That is difficult to prove, and leads to the question of how many people have been charged under the provision. In police investigations, who knows what triggers the move from suspicion to the decision to charge? That can be tested only in a court. Membership of an organisation becomes a subsidiary cause for a charge and does not feature in an important way. We argue consistently that the list is a deterrent. Although that is difficult to prove, the converse—that greater deterrence to terrorism would be provided by the removal of the list—cannot be proven. The legislation has been a reaction to a potent, evil force that existed not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom—and, indeed, internationally. Everything that the Government did in preceding years to deal with it has been proportionate to the level of threat and based on the best intelligence available.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke raised a question about specific groups on the list—Cumann na mBan, the women's section of the IRA, and Fianna na hEireamn, which means ``soldiers of Ireland''. It could be argued, because of the way in which the provisional IRA has reorganised over the years, that those groups are not extant. The provisional IRA may use a particular organisation at a particular time; it then reorganises and that organisation falls into disuse. However, if one of the groups on the list were taken off it, one of the dissident groups could then take up the banned name—which could easily happen because they are potent names in the lexicon of such organisations. It is better that we deal with the threat by retaining those organisations on the list.
<P>
The hope is that we will move into a different environment in the year ahead—or perhaps in the immediate period—and those issues can then be revisited. That process is allowed for under the legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I realise that this is a sensitive issue, but one cannot argue for the proscription of an organisation that may not or does not exist. That cannot be justified. If an organisation exists but is dormant and has members, that is fine, but I hope that the Minister is not trying to persuade us that we ought to include on a list organisations that have no current membership, no activity and which do not, to all intents and purposes, exist. If that is the case, the law is a nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The law is not a nonsense. It could be argued that an organisation is not extant merely because its name does not appear in terrorist legislation. We know the detailed way in which those organisations organise themselves. They may restructure themselves, but they tend to keep their brand name—which is probably a facetious way of describing it, but it is the best word that I can come up with. People identify with that name, as they have identified with it in the past, and such a group may become a reality at any time. We are still in a period of uncertainty about the way forward. We hope that change will come and that we can move to deproscription—that is a vital point. Therefore, in the interests of protection, it is better to retain the proscription of such groups as the Orange Volunteers.
<P>
The issues are kept constantly under review. I cannot give the Committee detailed information—I can offer only a general reflection of the way in which we have to deal with them. It is surely better for the protection of society that we maintain that approach, and ensure that groups do not become active when we have deproscribed them because of a misjudgment or in response to pressure. We would not then be able to take effective immediate action against such deproscribed organisations, whereas if they had been proscribed, action could be taken earlier, preventing the loss of life or damage to individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The Minister could have demonstrated his point by pointing out that the IRA, which dates back 70 years, ultimately became the official IRA and virtually disappeared—but that designation was then adopted by the provisional IRA, the organisation with which he will be familiar and of which two current Members of the House have been chiefs of staff. The IRA is now known as Real IRA by one group and as Continuity IRA by another. It is a never-ending evolution and it is why the IRA is now ``Real'', ``Continuity'' or ``Provisional'' and the old, official IRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman elaborates in his own way on the point that I was making. We could end up having a debate on the nature of Irish terrorism—that may be of benefit, but it would delay the progress of the Bill.
<P>
The list of names relating to Irish terrorism in the schedule is constantly kept under review. It is subject to examination in the normal course of events, as we receive information about the way in which those organisations reshape, restructure and retarget. It would be wrong to drop our guard at any time because such organisations pose a potent threat. That is why we have made recent additions to the list. We add to it after only after much weighty consideration, and based on the security information that we receive, which is good in terms of quality and range. We also have to bring other judgments into play, in terms of how the list of proscribed organisations would stand examination in the wider process, primarily in Parliament, where we have to justify our actions. Proscription is not a kneejerk reaction. We do not instantly proscribe a group that forms, takes on a name and suddenly carries out an evil act; proscription is based on a very detailed, in-depth knowledge of the way in which a group is organised and relates to other groups within the terrorist paramilitary firmament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I wish to test two points that follow on from what the Minister said. As of now, would proved members of Continuity IRA be covered by the schedule? In other words, in a court case, is the advice to Ministers that a member of Continuity IRA would be caught by the list? Is the Minister saying that all 14 organisations are not just dormant or extant in name only, but genuinely exist? Otherwise, the logic of his argument would be that the law should prohibit the use of names rather than proscribe organisations that are dormant or non-existent. There are two separate arguments: one that the use of a name is illegal, the other that an organisation's existence is illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> On the latter point, it is better to move cautiously rather than too prescriptively. While our intelligence information is good, it cannot be 100 per cent. perfect so in regard to proscription and deproscription it is wise to be careful and move only when we are certain. The organisations in question existed and were a potent force, and that is why they were proscribed earlier.
<P>
On the question of Continuity IRA, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the provisional IRA is not listed because the Irish Republican Army covers the whole gambit. We have had the best legal advice on that and the Real IRA, Oglaigh na hEireann, as it calls itself—its use of the IRA name—is that that would be covered by the blanket name Irish Republic Army, although I cannot say what a court would decide.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull took a somewhat contradictory position I may have misunderstood him, but I thought that he endorsed the view of the hon. Member for Basingstoke, who said that the list should not exist. He then congratulated the Government for producing a list that covers the whole of the United Kingdom. He may want to tell the Committee which position his party wants him to adopt. Does he want a list or does he not?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Red Hand Commando was an individual or a group. It is a group—an organisation—that has close links with the Ulster Freedom Fighters. That is our best information on that subject.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Before we move on, I wish to comment on the Minister's replies to my questions. I would be more convinced by what he said if he were to point to probably the strongest argument for proscription—the American example of proscription, which goes under the name of designation. There, designation is necessary to trigger taking action against funds and fund-raising activities. Will the Minister comment on that aspect of the proscription argument?
<P>
During the past 30 years, the Provisional IRA has arguably been the most effective terrorist organisation in western Europe, and we believe that proscription has been no more than a fleeting and momentary inconvenience to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The last point is a matter of judgment. Where is the evidence? I have tried to explain that it is difficult to prove a case against the terrorist. I pray in aid not the political judgments of previous Governments but the views of our security advisers, including the RUC, with the support of Army intelligence and our own security services. A debate rages about the subject, but it should not rest solely on the political judgment that we should ignore the advice that we are given. If we deproscribe those groups and something happens in the interim, and the Chief Constable says that the RUC could have swept up the people involved—that it knew who they were and that it could have stopped that action taking place—it would place a terrible burden upon Ministers. The hon. Member for Basingstoke is clearly prepared to make that political judgment. I repeat that I am now a little confused as to where the Conservative party stands on this. I was answering the hon. Member for Solihull, but he has now left the Room. However, I hope that the Conservative party leadership wants to support us in that matter.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) was trying to get me to speculate as others did on Second Reading, and will doubtless try to do so again—on which domestic or international groups would or would not be included and why. That is an impossible subject to debate, and I can only repeat what has already been said. We have no intention of proscribing any of the domestic groups known to the Government at present. That is a clear statement, but a number of factors must be taken into account, for both domestic and international groups, including the nature and scale of a group's activities, the threat that it poses to the United Kingdom, the extent of its presence within the UK and our need to support the international community in the battle against international terrorism.
<P>
The circumstances dictate the decision. To stand here today and name a particular group would be wrong. Judgments can be made at any point in time and they are based upon a continuing flow of information. I say now what I said on Second Reading: it would be wrong to flag up what we were thinking. It goes back to what I said to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about consultation. Those groups are cunning and clever. They are capable of acting in a very structured way to achieve their ends. They listen to all that the Government say—and they will be watching our debate as well. I hope that he takes my assurances on the domestic groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I want to clarify my remarks. Although I quoted some examples merely to try to illustrate my point, I did not want the Minister to speculate on the thinking of ETA or any other group. However, he has given me the four criteria that he would need to consider in accounting for any foreign groups. That was my main point, and I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have concluded my remarks, and I hope that the Committee will support the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am privileged to have been in the Chair since the Committee began, so I listened to the debate on clause 3. I also tried to be in the House on Second Reading. I am conscious that many hon. Members' contributions in this debate could be classed as rehearsals of arguments that were made on clause 3, and others are twists on those on Second Reading. Before I call the next speaker, I want to make it clear that my co-Chairman and I will take that fully into account in future stand part debates.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to ask the Minister about the consultation issue, which he touched on. The schedule contains a list of organisations, which will take over from the list in the two relevant pieces of legislation if the Bill becomes law, although it happens to be the same list. Is procedure in place for the Northern Ireland parties represented in the Assembly, as well as the parties across the United Kingdom, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police forces and the security services, to be regularly consulted as a matter of course before any view is taken as to whether the organisations exist? If not, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I answered that while the hon. Gentleman was not in the Room. Rather than delay the Committee, I suggest that he reads in Hansard my explanation of what is in place. I explained, perhaps at too much length, the Government's conclusions on the range of consultation. The groups do not sit around waiting for us to consult political parties. Governments sometimes have to act quickly, because the intelligence may suddenly come to hand and the threat may be potent and real.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of working out a process of consultation. If everyone talked to all the human rights groups, the civil liberties groups and political parties, the death of someone might be the result. Ministers would not want that on their conscience, and nor would the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Deproscription application</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I would like to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (2)(b). I confess that I did not table an amendment in time, but the subsection worries me. The Bill states that the appeal can be made only by the organisation or someone directly affected by its proscription. What do the Government have in mind by subsection (2)(b)? How ``affected'' can someone be?
<P>
I appreciate that an active solidarity group could be deemed to be affected by a proscription if the organisation for which it previously acted had been proscribed. Would the Government deliberately exclude a third party? I am thinking of a civil liberties organisation, such as Amnesty International, and wonder whether it could, on behalf of an overseas organisation, instigate or initiate appeal proceedings in London. I am not necessarily saying that I believe that that should be allowed. It is a probing question, to see whether the Government are being intentionally restrictive, as the first reading of the subsection suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I endorse the request for information made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, but I want to add some further questions. First, the clause effectively sets out the procedure for regulations to be made, which will be put to the House by negative procedure. Will the Government reconsider that, and make the regulations subject to affirmative, rather than negative resolution? They relate to the important matter of the timetable between the decision to deproscribe and the beginning of the process, whatever we may think about the process for initiating deproscription.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Unless I am mistaken—I share the point with the hon. Member, and ultimately I must share it with the Minister—under clause 118, which we have not yet reached, we can safely anticipate that deproscription orders require only a negative resolution, whereas proscription orders require affirmative resolution in both Houses. What does the hon. Gentleman think about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is exactly my point. Adding an organisation to the list requires both Houses to have a debate and a vote, but removing an organisation from the list need not be debated in either House. Inaccurately, and unintentionally, the Minister led us to believe in our previous debate that both proscription and deproscription were governed by an automatic vote in the House. The hon. Member for Solihull is right. The procedure for regulations on deproscription should be subject to the certainty of debate and vote, even with the hazards and risk of a vote, rather than to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
We have not seen the regulations. It is not betraying a confidence to say that I asked the Minister whether we could see them in draft as soon as possible. It will be helpful to know what will be the longest period between a proscription decision and, under clause 4, an application for deproscription. Also, what will be the longest period for the Secretary of State to determine an application? If he is allowed to sit on the decision for six months, that will be wholly different from having to make a decision within seven days. What is the longest period that the Government have in mind for requiring an application to state the grounds on which it is made? Will that be linked to the subsection (4)(a) procedure?
<P>
To summarise, will the Minister say what the draft regulations will look like and how soon we can see them and tell us whether the Government will consider changing the procedure from negative resolution to affirmative resolution procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I think that I shall be treading in the hon. Gentleman's footprints, so I can be brief. One of the points that I wanted to make has already been mentioned during an intervention on the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey on the disparity between the two types of resolution seemingly required for proscription and deproscription.
<P>
I move on to clause 4(2)(b). The Committee wants to hear more about what is meant by the words ``any person affected''. How is someone affected by an organisation's deproscription? How do the Government intend the provision to be construed? It could apply to the victims of terrorism, as well as to those connected with the terrorist organisation.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My final point, which is not dissimilar to that made from the Liberal Democrat Bench, is that we shall need to see the regulations, at least in draft, before Third Reading. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> A series of points have been made, which I shall go through rapidly. The current position is that proscription and deproscription both require affirmative resolution. Clause 118(3)(a) shows that that is the case. The regulations required under clause 4 require only negative resolution, as referred to in clause 118(2)(a). Work has not yet begun on the detail of the rules, so I cannot answer the specific question asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the longest period and the other points that he raised. I shall do my best to fulfil the reasonable request of the hon. Member for Solihull that the regulations be available before Third Reading.
<P>
The time to debate whether the procedure should be by negative or affirmative resolution is when we debate clause 118, which deals with those issues. The other point of substance is the question of what will be affected. We have used not the phrase ``directly affected'' but the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any person affected by the organisation's proscription.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a weighty matter, so it is reasonable to set up a process for the Secretary of State to consider it. We have not envisaged that a third party could voice an appeal, although I can see how an argument could be made to the court that ``affected'' is a wide use of language. We have not sought to constrain it because, as hon. Members have said, proscription is a heavy issue. Representations should be allowed to be made to the Secretary of State for organisations to be deproscribed. That is why we have used that language in the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 2, line 38, leave out subsection (1).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 45, page 3, line 2, leave out `Commission' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`High Court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 46, in page 3, line 3, leave out `Commission' and insert

<P>
No. 49, in page 3, line 16, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
No. 54, clause 9, page 5, line 22, leave out `Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`High Court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendments probe the issue of whether the Government are justified in setting up an appeal commission for proscribed organisations. Amendment No. 44 would leave out subsection (1), which would mean that there would be no such commission. Unless someone can prove to me or to other members of the Committee that the court system is incapable of doing the job, we should not be setting up more organisations with more staff, more administration, more resources and more bureaucracy to determine entirely legal questions.
<P>
I know that the Parades Commission was recently set up in Northern Ireland. There is a temptation in Government to set up new forms of tribunal, inquiry and commission if there is a specific new item on the political agenda, but it must be better and more efficient to go to the normal court system with its precedent, experience and appeals procedure as a starting point when dealing with matters of legislation and interpretation. What is the Government's reaction to the proposal that the courts, rather than another body, should deal with this job and this job alone? Ministers have said, understandably, that it is a matter to be determined within Government. It seems that we are going to create an organisation that will, as far as we know, have this one special purpose.
<P>
Amendment No. 45 would replace the word ``Commission'' in subsection (2) with the words ``High Court''. Self-evidently, that High Court sits in Belfast, but it would sit anywhere else in the United Kingdom as well. I appreciate that if it sat in Scotland, different terminology would be needed, but this is more of a probing amendment than a final draft. ``High Court'' refers to the equivalent of the High Court in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom. Amendment No. 46 would have a similar effect and amendment No. 48 applies the same logic to line 7 in subsection (4), so that the High Court would replace the commission in an appeal process.
<P>
Amendment No. 49 would omit subsection (6) and thus the reference to schedule 3 on setting up the commission and its procedures; by definition, therefore, schedule 3 would not be necessary. As I have said that, you will be delighted to know, Mr. Stevenson, that I will not need to make the same speech on schedule 3; that should help the morning along. Finally, amendment No. 54 would substitute the High Court for the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission in clause 9.
<P>
Thus, the amendments would include the High Court at all the places where it is logical to want a court procedure instead of a commission procedure. The argument concerns the appropriateness of the organisation, but for reasons that I shall come to when we discuss other amendments, I would argue strongly that it is better for the courts to deal with matters of judicial review, definitions and the appeal process than to set up a new and entirely different body with no wider experience of the world to deal with this narrow issue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I hope that the Minister will reject the suggestions of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I would be appalled if the issue were subject to the normal processes of law, with the ability of lawyers on all sides of the argument to expose in open court the delicate and sensitive security material with which the commission would have to deal. If the hon. Gentleman wants that procedure for this matter, surely the special committees and the judges who scrutinise the intelligence services should also be abolished and all those issues dealt with in open court—or, even worse, in open session in a Committee of the House. Our secrets would soon be aired on the One o'clock news.
<P>
There will inevitably be material that a special committee and judges will be required to examine. More important, under the schedule the Lord Chancellor will have to make special rules permitting those who apply for de-proscription access to certain information; I would hope to goodness that they are not the normal rules of full and utter disclosure of everything that apply in the High Court. That is why we cannot secure criminal convictions of people who are caught committing crimes red-handed; to apply similar rules to terrorist organisations is the height of woolly-mindedness. I hope that the Minister will reject the amendments—and I hope that that is my party's policy, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border has expressed his views with characteristic pungency. I must share his doubts about the amendments. I appreciate the motives of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but it would not be possible to operate the normal rules of disclosure in court proceedings while also allowing for information to be withheld from the proscribed organisation or its representatives in the way that schedule 3 proposes. Unless the Minister can come up with a way to reconcile those apparently contradictory positions, I do not think that the amendments are a wise way in which to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I agree with the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border that proceeding through the courts would not be the way forward, but I have some sympathy with the amendments, albeit for an entirely different reason.
<P>
We have absolutely no idea of how, or from among whom, the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission would be selected and appointed. In Northern Ireland, there is little doubt that members of the commission would be selected, because of the type of terrorism that we now have in the United Kingdom. Will the Minister assure me that he will not appoint to the commission members drawn exclusively from one tradition, section or opinion in Northern Ireland, as happened with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission? Members of the latter body range from the naïve through the incompetent and the mischievous to—dare one say it?—something verging on the evil. Nothing in the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission suggests to me that human rights are the core issue that it represents. One has only to look at its utterances to have serious reservations about its raison d'etre.
<P>
The Committee would be right to require some indication of from where the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission would draw its members. Reference was made to some of the organisations dealing with security issues; I wonder whether the Minister could appoint a small sub-committee from within that group of people. This organisation will not need all the trappings of remuneration, allowances, pensions and gratuities. It will not be sitting permanently or frequently—unless a huge change takes place, in which case the commission will deal with its duties fairly quickly. Although it will be working under the Lord Chancellor's imprimatur, I wonder whether the Northern Ireland Office will be responsible for recommending members to sit on the commission.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must recognise that, within what appears to be normal society in Northern Ireland, seemingly ordinary people are sleepers for the organisations listed in schedule 2. Hence, we need a huge amount of clarification from the Minister in respect of the composition and why all those remunerations and pensions and gratuities and allowances are necessary. It seems that Parliament is creating something that will be an unnecessary appendage to the processes and procedures that already exist.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the Minister will want to expand on the hon. Member's point, but I point out that clause 5 and the amendments deal with the establishment of the commission. The amendments appear to be in order, but the composition of the commission will be debated under schedule 3. I am sure that hon. Members will not want to rehearse their arguments when we debate schedule 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> In support of the arguments against the amendments advanced by my hon. Friends, one item of evidence should be drawn to the Minister's attention. He may agree that it strengthens our case against the amendments. I have in mind the European Court of Human Rights case of Grady and Smith v. United Kingdom, 1999. Part of the court's judgment was that judicial review is not always an effective remedy. If one is looking for particular as well as general evidence against the amendment, that case provides it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall attempt to be brief. I have only four points to make. First, I am glad that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey acknowledged that it is a probing amendment. He is right to say that the amendment should refer also to the equivalent courts in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Secondly, I do not share the admiration that the hon. Gentleman, who is a barrister, has for the efficacy of the court system. The suggestion that lawyers are more in touch with society than any other body of people does not stand up to scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman presses the point in relation to every aspect of life, saying that if we put our problems in the hands of a lawyer, we shall have a better society; but I am not convinced. Indeed, I believe that many of aspects of life would be better out of their hands.
<P>
Thirdly and more seriously, what the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border said about security was appropriate. If we cannot reveal certain matters in open court, the immediate avenue is an application for public interest immunity. As the hon. Member for Basingstoke pointed out, it is much more intelligent to set up a specific process for that rather than have the full panoply of court action, from which qualifications would necessarily arise if we were to deal with sensitive matters in the context of public immunity. We think that the process established in the Bill is simpler and clearer, principally in how it deals with sensitive and effective information. We also believe that the Bill is compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
The fourth and final point that I want to make relates to the comments made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). He made it clear that we shall deal with the matter under schedule 3, but I shall respond to his point directly, in the spirit in which it was raised. The Lord Chancellor makes the appointment to the commission. At least one member has to be a High Court judge because, as he recognised, judicial issues are involved. That is set out in paragraph 4(3)(b) of schedule 3. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that we intend the make-up of the body to be balanced, so that it can consider issues in the round. We envisage that someone on the commission will have a security background, as well as there being someone with judicial experience. I hope that that meets some of his concerns.
<P>
I do not necessarily accept the remarks made about the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, but I agree that we do not want a great deal of practical organisation, with all the panoply involved. The hon. Gentleman is right that we are not talking about a great process, but it is important that we have the powers to ensure that it can be dealt with in the proper way. That is why schedule 3 sets them out. It does so in legal wording, ``remuneration, allowances, pensions'' and so forth, as the hon. Gentleman knows. I share his perception that we should not and do not seek to create a massive bureaucratic body.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He misrepresents me if he thinks that I always argue that lawyers are wonderful at everything. I do not go to the other extreme of Bardolph's view in ``Henry V'', which is that the first thing we should do is to kill all the lawyers. I physically associate that view with the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is my duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Slowly and painfully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In that case, I withdraw my slur. If we did take that view, we would exclude the career option of about a quarter of people leaving school, because it seems that they all consider consultancy, accountancy and law first, which is not a good thing.
<P>
I am not at all uncritical of the courts, and I do not necessarily think that the fact that we normally have full disclosure means that we cannot have things undisclosed. There are ways to deal with the matter, such as courts sitting in camera. As there are slightly more substantive matters about procedure that touch on the European human rights issues raised by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, and as the Minister has put his case, I do not propose to pursue the matter to the vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendments refer to the same line. I was not aware that the hon. Member for Basingstoke would raise this matter in the previous debate. Despite a declaration by Ministers that the Bill complies with the European convention on human rights, I shall argue that it does not. Indeed, unless it is amended, the judicial review process will be insufficient, and the Government would be liable to a successful challenge under the European convention.
<P>
As the Bill is drafted, I would argue that an applicant is not entitled to a full right of appeal. The commission will not be able to review the facts that were put before the Secretary of State; it will apply the relevant law, but it will not be able to decide whether he had made the correct decision. Instead, it will be limited to considering only whether the decision was illegal, biased, procedurally unfair or unreasonable. Subsection (3) restricts the role of the commission to that played by the divisional courts when they consider applications for the judicial review of decisions of public bodies. It will be able to consider only the manner in which a decision was made, not its substance.
<P>
Case law, including a case that was heard by the European Court of Human Rights only four months ago, to which I shall refer in a moment, has established that a broad range of approaches to this situation may be said to be reasonable. The judicial review definition of reasonableness is very wide, and it is therefore difficult to establish that a decision is irrational unless it can clearly be characterised as being perverse.
<P>
The best argument for the ineffectiveness of judicial review being an adequate remedy is that advanced by the hon. Member for Basingstoke in the previous debate, when he spoke of the Grady and Smith v. United Kingdom case, which was heard by the European Court of Human Rights on 27 September 1999. That case may or may not have been decided after the Bill was drafted. The European court in Strasbourg concluded that judicial review was not an effective remedy and that, as the test of irrationality was so high, it effectively excluded substantive consideration of whether a decision that breached an individual's rights under the convention could be justified in particular circumstances.
<P>
I have been advised that clauses 5 and 8 risk breaching article 13 of the European convention. Article 13 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 13 applies now, even before incorporation of the convention into domestic law, which will happen on 2 October 2000. It applies when one or more of the substantive rights of the convention have been breached. The most obvious substantive right that may be breached is the right to a fair trial, which is the article 5 right under the convention.
<P>
Those who have advised me have taken legal advice, so the matter is not specious or lightly considered. They say that the commission will be placed in an impossible position when considering whether an individual's convention rights have been breached. It will be restricted to considering only the manner in which the Secretary of State had reached his decision, given the obligation placed on it by section 2 of the 1998 Act—which comes into effect later this year—to take into account the Grady and Smith case in the United Kingdom. I am advised that if we do not amend the law, we risk having to make further appeals to the Court of Appeal, under clause 6, as that would be the first time that the point of law could be raised.
<P>
The amendments would allow an argument to be made in the first instance that a decision were flawed, in fact and in law. One could have a decision on both those points. I ask the Minister seriously to consider the amendments, which are based on legal advice on the compatibility of the legislation with the 1998 Act. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a serious point: the compatibility of the legislation with the Human Rights Act. I know that he would be the first to give the Government credit for enacting that legislation and placing that constraint on the way in which we operate. I say to him in all seriousness what I said on Second Reading. The statement on the front page of the Bill which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Mr. Secretary Straw has made the following statement under section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In my view,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—that is, the Home Secretary's view—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provisions of the Terrorism Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is a certificate, as it were, from the Home Secretary, given on the basis of substantial advice. Of course, lawyers are occasionally known to disagree. Although it is not par for the course, it does happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> As a lawyer myself—although I went straight several years ago so I am no longer a threat—I venture to suggest that half of all lawyers are wrong all the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I did my degree in mathematics and I am working my way through the logic of that statement. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Solihull is correct in his assessment. The question is which half: are the Government's lawyers right or are the lawyers of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey right? I can say only that our view is taken in all seriousness and after the most rigorous consideration of the issues, including the judgments to which reference has been made. Our strongly considered view is that the Bill is compliant with the European convention on human rights. That is not to say that it is illegitimate for the hon. Gentleman to raise that point or to be advised by his legal friends, but we have not made our case flippantly or frivolously. The courts will ultimately make judgments on those matters; that is why the Human Rights Act 1998 will have such a wide impact. I cannot say that the Government's view will always prevail in all circumstances. However, I can say that the legislation is a result of our considered view.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 6 and 37—the question has just been asked whether they are alternatives or would operate sequentially—would second guess the Secretary of State on the issues of fact and on the merits of the case. I do not think that that is right. The Secretary of State has, rightly, to bear the responsibility for the judgments that are made. The Bill will enable the commission that we establish to address head-on whether a refusal to deproscribe is justified. It will be able to subject that decision to far greater scrutiny than would be the case if it were the subject of judicial review. We believe that it will give the organisations involved a proper and valuable remedy if they are concerned about decisions that are made by the Secretary of State. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment or the Committee will reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister is certainly right that where two or three lawyers are gathered together, the chance of their reaching agreement is limited. It is therefore not surprising that people have gone to the court in Strasbourg to argue the Government's case. The Government have had lots of practice in facing their opponents as the same people of great academic and legal brilliance are often involved.
<P>
I understand the Minister's view, and I understand the certification procedure. The Bill is presented to the House having been subjected to that process. Treasury counsel and any other advice that the Government have taken will have been used to reach that opinion. Clearly, we shall not reach agreement and neither side can pray in aid on a sort of ``You, the jury'' basis. People will have to argue the case.
<P>
According to the advice that I have received, the same point about compliance arises in clause 8. I should be grateful if the Minister allowed outside the Committee some consideration of whether that might be checked and the advice that is available to the Government and others made public. It would be helpful if we could reach agreement. I do not pretend that the advice that I have received is the last word, although it is authoritative and competent and comes from people who practise in this sort of work, but it may be wise to obtain a second opinion, for the Government and for those who support the amendment, before we enact legislation that results in further challenges in the court.
<P>
As someone who worked on such cases in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe—I should declare that interest—one of my anxieties is that Britain still has one of the worst records on breaches of the convention. I have no interest in Britain being regularly taken to court and found to be in breach. I do not believe that the Government have an interest in that, either. It does not do the Government's credibility any good to spend a lot of money defending a case that is found against them. It is in everyone's interest to get the legislation as right as possible.
<P>
I shall not press the Minister now, but I hope that he will reconsider the matter. On that basis, I am happy not to press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 3, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) The Commission shall make an order under subsection (4) only if it believes that the organisation has ceased to be concerned in terrorism.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another probing amendment which is comparable to the one that we debated last week in connection with the Secretary of State's powers in deproscribing organisations. It provides that an appeal may be allowed only if the commission believes that the organisation in question has ceased to be involved in terrorism. My purpose in tabling the amendment was to give the Committee the opportunity to explore further the Government's view of how the commission should operate and of the criteria that the commission will be empowered to take into account when deciding on an appeal.
<P>
Might the commission conclude that although an organisation was involved in terrorism, it should be removed from the proscribed list? As I understand what the Minister said in response to the previous amendment, the commission will have a duty to explore the procedures with which the Secretary of State is supposed to comply in deciding to proscribe, and will be able to rule that he acted illegally if those procedures were not properly followed.
<P>
What is the Bill's interrelationship with the Human Rights Act 1998? As I am not a lawyer, I shall rely on the Minister's advice about how the two measures will interact. Is it conceivable that an organisation could come to the commission and claim a right under the European convention as imported into our law through the Human Rights Act 1998, and the commission might judge that such a right could override the fact that that organisation was still involved in terrorism? Is there any way in which the 1998 Act could be used to justify removing an organisation from the proscribed list even though everyone concerned accepted that it continued to be a terrorist organisation?
<P>
I accept that these are complicated matters, but one has only to consider the impact that there would be on public opinion if a successful appeal resulted in known terrorists—people that everyone knew to be actively engaged in terrorism—resuming a legal, non-proscribed status. Clearly, we want to frame the legislation so as to avoid that possibility as far as possible. I look forward to the Minister's comments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I have just one observation. My hon. Friend said that this was a probing amendment; if so, it is an extremely important one.
<P>
It is supremely important that such considerations are determined only on the basis of terrorism and not on wider political grounds. One can recall times when, had the Government changed, certain organisations would have been regarded differently. That could well happen again. For the sake of the Bill's integrity, it is important that it eliminates any scope for wider political considerations being taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Member for Basingstoke puts his point fairly, but he is not right to suggest that in the past a change of Government would have led to a change of view on whether an organisation should be proscribed under the legislation that was in place. I know that that is a historical debate, but I cannot let the hon. Gentleman's remarks go without countering them.
<P>
I accept entirely the spirit in which the hon. Member for Aylesbury spoke to the amendment. Amendment No. 15, to which he spoke earlier, probed much the same issues so I will not repeat in detail the argument that I adduced then.
<P>
It is highly unlikely that the commission would be restricted from making an order unless it believed that the organisation had ceased to be involved in terrorism. If an organisation were still involved with terrorism, the commission would be unlikely to allow any appeal against a refusal to deproscribe. If it judged that an organisation's continuing proscribed status was a disproportionate measure on human rights grounds, it might consider an appeal. As I said in relation to amendment No. 15, proportionality is at the heart of the matter.
<P>
We must address the issues that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office set out in his response to the right hon. and learned Member for Penrith and The Border. The simple definition in the amendment that an organisation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has ceased to be concerned in terrorism''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not contain the weight of judgments overall that go into deciding whether or not that organisation should be proscribed. As my right hon. Friend said, other issues, such as the organisation's impact on the United Kingdom, have to be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> May I suggest to the Minister that there is a difficulty which he appears not to comprehend? Let us imagine a situation whereby the greater number and perhaps the perceived leadership of an outlawed organisation deem that its terrorism should cease, but a significant number of its members continue to be involved in sporadic terrorism—perhaps it is not seen as terrorism for a political purpose now, but in preparation for a resumption of terrorism further down the road. Is the Minister suggesting that the commission could take a decision based on the leadership and greater number within that organisation?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand exactly the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has in mind, and he makes a legitimate point. We have dealt with some of the issues in an earlier debate about organisations being dormant and so on. The Secretary of State must judge whether the act of terrorism and the existence of the organisation still promote terrorism. An appeal can be made to the commissioner The considerations referred to by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will be germane both to the Secretary of State's decision and the commission's consideration of that decision.
<P>
The nub of the issue is not about numbers, whereby a majority decision of, say, 60:40 is taken within an organisation, it is about whether or not the organisation continues to act as a vehicle for promoting terrorism, as defined in the Bill. That is the issue that the Secretary of State and the commission will have to consider when deciding how to operate the provision.
<P>
I am acutely aware that I may be treading on the toes of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office in referring to the events that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone may have in mind, so I shall not trespass into that area. The formation of the commission, the definitions that we have agreed and the way in which the Secretary of State makes his judgment all meet the concerns that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone legitimately raised.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, although I am not wholly persuaded by it. I was impressed by the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, and by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
<P>
I acknowledge the Minister's point that there is a distinction between the definition of a terrorist organisation in clause 1 and the additional power for proscription. I accept that not every organisation that might be defined as a terrorist organisation, whose activities might be subject to the special police powers contained in the Bill, would also be proscribed. We are talking about a hypothetical organisation that has already been proscribed and debating the terms under which deproscription should be allowed. We are considering an organisation that has not merely met the definition of ``terrorism'', but which the Secretary of State, on advice from the security services, considers to pose such a threat that proscription is justified. In such circumstances, perhaps we should write into the Bill a clear threshold that should be crossed before such an organisation is removed from the proscribed list. As my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke said, such an amendment would enable Parliament to ensure that extraneous political considerations could not be taken into account. That would also meet the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
<P>
I may return to the matter when I have had the chance to reflect further on the Minister's comments, so despite my reservations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 3, line 17, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) An order under subsection (4) shall not require the Secretary of State to take any action until the first determination or disposal of an appeal (including any first appeal to the House of Lords).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment. There are two points in essence, one of which hangs on the structure of the process. The amendment would add a new subsection (7) to clause 5, which is similar to the Government's drafting in clause 6(3). It would add to clause 5 the rules on the timetable about when the Secretary of State must take action. The substance of the matter is the difference between the amendment and the drafting in clause 6. Clause 6 states that the Secretary of State is not required to act if a deproscription application has been successful,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``until the final determination or disposal of an appeal . . . including any appeal to the House of Lords''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lawyers being what they are, that might take a considerable time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am becoming a bit worried about all these attacks on lawyers. I am one of the non-lawyers in the House of Commons, so I feel that I have a responsibility to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sure that you never seek consultancies, Mr. Stevenson, but I shall tell the relevant agencies that a new candidate, with no prior convictions, is available.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State takes action that is delayed only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``until the first determination or disposal of an appeal''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I appreciate that if deproscription is allowed to take place when the first decision or appeal is made, and that is then overturned, an organisation that has gone through a period of immunity will be put back into proscription.
<P>
There is a serious civil liberty issue involved, which comes up again in clause 7. Someone might be convicted under the offence clauses, which we shall debate later, for association with a proscribed organisation for as long as it is proscribed. When it is deproscribed, the person cannot be convicted. From the moment the first adjudicating body says that an organisation should not remain proscribed, and while the appeal process takes place, people could be liable to conviction for an offence when there has already been a ruling, on the basis of the evidence, that the organisation should not be proscribed.
<P>
I want to make sure that we do not give rise to offences when a decision has been made that the organisation should not be proscribed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the advantage of his amendment would be manifest in the timetable. Are there other factors involving the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to ensure that things work in parallel. If we accept that an organisation is proscribed, offences that flow from that can be committed. However, when someone has adjudicated that an organisation should not be proscribed, and the deproscription procedure has bitten effectively, from that moment, there is no risk of carry-over of the proscription effects, pending possible future appeals. With the best will in the world, none of us can guarantee that the higher courts will deal with the matter on the same day, the next day, the next week or the next month. There seems to be a lack of parallelism.
<P>
I do not pretend that the wording of the amendment is right. I seek to amend clause 5, but I would have preferred clause 6 to have been debated and out of the way first. However, if clause 6 is to stand part of the Bill, a provision will need to be added to clause 5 similar to that in clause 6(3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I accept your rebuke about lawyers, Mr. Stevenson. I shall not say nothing rude about them again, at least not consciously.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey correctly said that the question is at what point the Secretary of State should take action on a successful appeal. The Government's position is simple—certainty in such matters is critical and the yo-„yo effect of going through the various courts is intrinsically undesirable. We believe that it is necessary to achieve a final legal resolution of all the issues involved before acting. To take action at an early stage in the legal process, when a decision might subsequently be reversed in the High Court, would lead to uncertainty, which would be in no one's interests.
<P>
I hear what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey says about the law's occasionally dilatory approach to taking decisions, but in such cases there is every reason to believe that the courts will move rapidly to a resolution, taking the decisions that need to be taken precisely because of the seriousness of the issues under consideration.
<P>
The fundamental reason why I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment is that it is important to have clarity before the Secretary of State acts; the issue must have gone through the whole legal process before finally being concluded.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have one last question. Will the Minister ask his officials to investigate whether we can protect people and stop them being convicted in the interim, yet still protect the overall certainty of the decision? I understand what the Minister said, but could we ensure that the drafting does not render someone liable when the current legal position is that the organisation is not proscribed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am prepared to consider that, but I am sceptical whether we shall succeed in meeting the hon. Gentleman's request. I think that he would agree that the most effective way to do that will be for the legal process to proceed as rapidly as possible. I hope that all Governments would want such matters to be resolved as rapidly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to look at what is a second best option. Not everyone who adjudicates in court proceedings will have read the Official Report of our proceedings, but I hope that the message that speed is required will be passed on at least indirectly.
<P>
When considering the regulations that will decide the timetables, we could ensure that the requirement for speed and certainty was made paramount. Perhaps we can make sure that all stages of all procedures have backstop provisions to ensure that courts make decisions and appeals are heard within a maximum time limit. It would certainly help to make the provision as tight as possible. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In one sentence, Mr. Stevenson, I have reservations about the whole of the procedure, but they have already been enunciated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I shall be brief, as we covered a lot of ground when debating the amendments. I have a question for the Minister about the relationship between the appeals procedures and the parliamentary procedure that is necessary before deproscription can take effect. I understand that the Government propose that orders to remove organisations from the proscribed list should be subject to the negative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. We may discuss that when we come to clause 118.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Just for clarification, I am sure that I am right in saying that a positive order is required to proscribe or deproscribe.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am happy to accept correction on that point, which strengthens the point that I was about to make. Let us assume that an appeal has been successful, and that the Secretary of State either presents an order to Parliament or invokes the urgency procedure provided for in the Bill and has to seek parliamentary assent within a certain number of days. Let us assume that Parliament decides that it does not agree with the Secretary of State's decision to remove an organisation from the proscribed register. Considering the present Parliament, that may seem a remote possibility, but I have vivid memories of the latter stages of the 1992–97 Parliament, when the Government of the day could not always be certain of pushing their measures through, and the same applied in the 1974–79 Parliament. It is possible to imagine circumstances in which there might still be controversy over an organisation whose appeal had been successful. That controversy might arise for reasons to which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone alluded previously. A large section of Members of Parliament might believe that only part of that terrorist organisation's membership had ceased to be involved in terrorism, or that other political factors had influenced the decision and that the organisation whose deproscription was being debated was still involved in terrorism. What will happen if Parliament takes a different view from that of the Secretary of State or the POAC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point, which I considered as he spoke. It is not at all hypothetical; plenty of examples could be found in which that would be a serious issue. My understanding is unequivocal: Parliament is sovereign. That is the long, bottom and sides of it. Parliament decides. I agree that a consideration for Parliament to have in mind when deciding how to deal with such circumstances will be the implications of overturning a decision made by the Secretary of State, which would obviously have major political implications in a variety of ways. A wide debate would be held. Nothing in the Bill removes the sovereignty of Parliament in that respect, and it would be undesirable to do so for a variety of reasons. I acknowledge the political and even security issues that may arise in such circumstances, but ultimately it would be ludicrous to pass a Bill designed to defend our democracy and say that in such circumstances the democracy of Parliament would not stand. That is my understanding.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>THE PROSCRIBED ORGANISATIONS </center></H4>
APPEAL COMMISSION
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Will the Minister glance at the italicised section 3? How will the principle and practice of accountability work? At face value, there seems to be none, and the Lord Chancellor seems to have open-ended powers in relation to remuneration. I am sure that that is not so, but will the Minister explain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Have the Government considered whether the commission could be incorporated into or amalgamated with other existing commissions? As I suggested earlier, drafters of Bills and ministerial advisers have a great temptation to create new bodies and agencies. There is a Human Rights Commission and a Parades Commission in Northern Ireland, although I appreciate that it is now a UK-wide body. Has any consideration been given to whether it would be better to incorporate this process, with all the caveats that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border expressed earlier, within or adjacent to an existing organisation? I am sure that the Minister cannot answer me now, but I should be grateful to know later in writing the number of commission appointments and to which commissions the Lord Chancellor currently appoints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I want to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about how appointments to this commission should take place. Schedule 3 gives untrammelled power to the Lord Chancellor to appoint the members of the commission, subject only to the requirement that the quorum of the commission should include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person who holds or has held high judicial office (within the meaning of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876)''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
I should be interested to know the Government's thinking about the number of commissioners who might be needed and what sort of person might be recruited to the commission.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone expressed concern in an earlier debate that the commission might include people whose experience was wholly remote from that of his constituents and other people who live under the threat of terrorist attack in Northern Ireland every day. I hope that the Government will reflect carefully on the people whom they choose to appoint. A commission consisting entirely of retired judges and permanent secretaries would not necessarily be the right way forward.
<P>
 The schedule makes no provision for any parliamentary confirmation or oversight of the appointments to the commission. While I have not tabled an amendment to seek to bring that about, I hope that the Government will reflect on the relationship between the commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee. That Committee, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King), has a duty to look at what the security and intelligence services are doing. If it looked at the work of the commission it might be an appropriate way forward. I do not propose to oppose the schedule today, but there are a number of points on which the Government might reflect further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> You indulged me somewhat, Mr. Stevenson, when you allowed me to stray into this area earlier. Therefore, I shall be brief now. I am still concerned to know how many commissioners are likely to be appointed and the basis on which their appointments will be made. What part will the Northern Ireland Office play in the selection of those commissioners? I will not elaborate, out of deference to the Minister's colleague, except to say that I have ongoing concerns about the interest of some people who find themselves appointed by the Northern Ireland Office to important positions.
<P>
Proscription has been an important service for those of us who live in Northern Ireland. As the Minister said, it is exceedingly hard to quantify that, but one benefit that the Bill does not confer is the right of appeal by ordinary citizens who object to the deproscription of an organisation. Society as a whole must have confidence in the process and in those involved in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> A series of points have been made. The Lord Chancellor is accountable to Parliament; he has, for example, to account for his spending to the Public Accounts Committee and to obtain funding from the Treasury, and he is susceptible to questioning on any of the issues that have been raised in the normal course of events. That is serious accountability, which I am sure that the Lord Chancellor and other Ministers take seriously. Decisions are made in the knowledge that Parliament can and does have the right to question the people making them in the various ways that we all know about. In that context, I should mention the Intelligence and Security Committee; as I understand it, it would be entirely open to that committee also to look at that matter. The Committee, under the chairmanship of the right hon. Member for Bridgwater, has demonstrated a positive approach.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will excuse me, I will not respond to his invitation to list all the Lord Chancellor's appointments. It is open to him to use parliamentary questions and so on to clarify the range of appointments that the Lord Chancellor makes. That is a reasonable way of proceeding.
<P>
I was also asked whether we had considered incorporating the commission in other bodies. We did consider that, but it deals with a highly specialised and narrow subject and simply to include it with other bodies would not be the most effective way of proceeding. In response to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the clarity that I can offer at the moment is the requirement in the schedule for a lawyer to be present. As I said, we envisage that one of the people on the commission will have a background in security matters and that is important. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that the commission process needs to have the confidence of the community that it serves and that its composition therefore needs to have the general, rounded approach that would lead the community as a whole to have confidence in the process. I take serious account of the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman because he made the point in a very reasonable and straightforward way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> One issue that the Minister could clarify and which I omitted to mention is in regard to paragraph 1(4) of the schedule, relating to the resignation of a member. Would the Minister consider whether it is appropriate to ensure that a member does not and is not able to resign during a specific deliberation on a deproscription? The possibility of resignation may be used to put pressure on other members of the commission—I will not go into the details of my experience of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which he makes well. The reason why we include the phrase ``at any time'' in paragraph 1(4) is that it is difficult to stop someone from resigning if he is determined to do so. I entirely agree that it is desirable for people to serve throughout the course of an inquiry. However, if someone decides to go, he decides to go.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the role of the Northern Ireland Office. I am sure that the Lord Chancellor would take advice from a wide variety of different sources, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that as I know that he is aware, the legislation does not specifically relate to Northern Ireland and therefore advice will come from a range of areas. The suggestion that the commission would in some sense be the poodle of the Northern Ireland Office is not correct. We have put the Lord Chancellor on the commission because we think that it should have the judicial authority that the Lord Chancellor's nomination guarantees.
<P>
In answer to the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I cannot provide further clarification about numbers on the commission. However, as I said earlier in response to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, we do not envisage a large group or a bureaucratic structure. I can give the assurance that we are not thinking in terms of a vast process, but I cannot go further than that today. We would need to consider carefully all the circumstances implied by the Bill.
<P>
On the basis of those assurances, I hope that the Committee will accept schedule 3.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have to ask the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey whether, in the light of his earlier withdrawal of a consequential amendment, he wishes to move amendment No. 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Yes, Mr. Stevenson, I would like to move this amendment. It is a probing amendment, but it brings a harder edge to the second part of the debate. I shall be brief.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 3, line 20, after `law' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or fact'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 6 provides for further appeals beyond the commission—to the courts in the four countries. The Government did not accept an amendment to clause 5, which would have clarified the basis of appeals to the commission, so they should accept this amendment to make it absolutely clear that appeals to the court are allowed not just on questions of law, but on fact. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, he will be taking out of the judicial process the ability to consider a possibly crucial question that relates not to law, but to fact. The amendment would work both ways; it would allow facts supporting and opposing the case for proscribing an organisation to be considered. If a court were unable to hear evidence from members of such organisations—perhaps about the uniform that they were seen to have worn, about whether people were alive or dead or about who may have acted in certain ways—it could only do half the job. That applies irrespective of whether we are on all fours with the convention, as we discussed earlier.
<P>
The Government wish to continue to have a commission, but there should be a review process—not just on law, but on fact. Without such a process, there will be nowhere for the courts to review the facts. That does not apply in other legal processes. Civil liberties are involved, as some people will be convicted of offences. There must be somewhere for people to argue openly that the tribunal has the facts wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey is consistent in his approach. I am not persuaded by his arguments, however, and I am worried about his amendment, which reminds us of some of the points raised earlier by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Penrith and the Border. If the amendment were incorporated in the Bill, would not an appeal that had been rejected by the commission return to the courts, which would then have the power to inquire in detail into the reasons for the Secretary of State's initial decision? All the issues about disclosure of intelligence information and the identity of informants would arise again.
<P>
I fear that some people's safety might be put at risk. If the amendment were accepted, might not the procedure provide an incentive for every member of a proscribed organisation to take the appeal process all the way, in the knowledge that at the final stage, all the information about informants would have to be disclosed? Would that fact not act as a severe hindrance to the police and other law and order agencies in carrying out their duties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns. How does he justify such decisions being made, in effect, behind closed doors with no means of their being reviewed in the open? A Minister will make a decision behind closed doors on evidence that no one—not even the relevant parties—will be able to see, hear or challenge. That decision will then be reviewed by a commission that meets behind closed doors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I think that the model for the subject, as the hon. Gentleman said, applies in relation to other statutes to govern the activities of the security and intelligence services. The analogy with the commissioners set up to check the powers in relation to intrusion on property, or in relation to the interception of telephone calls, also has force in this case. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I do not have a great deal to add to the discussion of the issues.
<P>
I do not believe that the regular second-guessing of the Secretary of State, who takes the decisions, will benefit our society. The Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament, so there is parliamentary scrutiny. Every decision taken on the subject will be debated in detail in a variety of ways. That is as it should be. By substituting that scrutiny for a second-guessing procedure, I doubt that we would be working in the best interests of the legislation or the constituents whom we serve.
<P>
We stand by our judgment of the Human Rights Act 1998. I cannot helpfully take up the Committee's time by saying anything other than what I said in response to similar amendments earlier. I acknowledged the legitimacy of raising the point, as it is a fair point for discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The record will reveal that some issues of the debate are outstanding. The relevant committee, which we have talked about and which has all-party responsibility, might be better plugged into the system to have scrutiny of appointments and of the working of the process. In effect, it would be a statutory Select Committee. We may need wisely to reflect on that at a later stage of the Bill's progress. I do not say that we shall not return to the subject, but I am happy that we have registered the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mrs. McGuire.]
