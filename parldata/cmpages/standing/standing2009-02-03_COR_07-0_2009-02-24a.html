The Secretary of State may apply to the High Court for a certificate
ordering that an inquest be held in
camera.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) The Secretary of
State may only apply for a certificate if he is satisfied that it would
be necessary to prevent material or information being disclosed whose
disclosure would be seriously detrimental to national
security.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) The court may

granting the certificate is necessary to prevent material or

detrimental to national security;

short of granting a certificate would not be adequate to prevent such
disclosure.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4) Where the court
grants a certificate, the following provisions
apply&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) Chapter 2 of
Part 3 of this Act (witness anonymity orders) shall apply as if a
coroner&#146;s court were a court for the purposes of that Chapter,
as if the proceedings at an inquest were criminal proceedings for the
purpose of that Chapter, and as if references to the prosecutor in that
Chapter included a reference to the Secretary of
State;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the Lord Chief
Justice may appoint a judge of the High Court to act as coroner for the

summoned.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(6) The certificate
may require that part of the inquest be held in camera and part in
public, and the court must only issue a certificate requiring the whole
of an inquest to be held in camera if that is necessary to prevent
material or information being disclosed whose disclosure would be
seriously detrimental to national
security.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(7) Where a
certificate has been issued under this section, the coroner or judge
may at any time, taking into account whether any witness anonymity
orders have been made, admit to the proceedings any interested person
he may specify, provided that he is satisfied that doing so will not
lead to material or information being disclosed whose disclosure would
be seriously detrimental to national

made by a judge conducting an investigation by virtue of this section
gives rise to an appeal under section 30, that section has effect as if

Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): At the end of our
previous sitting, we discussing the amendments and the hon. Member for
Cambridge had just
said:</div><a name="09022512000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said, there is some common
ground between his amendments and ours. We are both looking for some
degree of judicial control, and to restrict the conditions under which
certificates relate to national security and nothing else. The
combination of those two points is that the judiciary has some role in
checking whether national security really is at stake. If we do not
have that, national security becomes the Executive branch&#146;s
flexible friend, to be invoked whenever it feels that it does not want
anyone to inquire into what it is
doing.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to
say:</div><a name="09022512000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So
there is some common ground between us, but where we differ, crucially
and unfortunately&#151;I believe that this is the point that the
Minister was trying to make to the hon. Gentleman&#151;is that the
Conservative amendments still exclude the jury, whereas ours do not. In
the end, it comes down simply to this: does one accept that ordinary
members of the public have a role in this kind of case? Are they ever
to be trusted? Our starting point is that often they are more to be
trusted than Ministers and judges, but the Government&#146;s starting
point seems to be the
opposite.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Coroners
and Justice Public Bill Committee, </i>10 February 2009; c.
224.]</div><a name="09022512000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman had also said that the central point of his arguments
against clause 11 was the removal of the jury because that disconnected
any form of democratic input into that judicial process. I agree that
the use of a jury in such an inquiry, as in criminal cases, is hugely
important. I also agree that the Government&#146;s attitude is one to
be deprecated and needs to be scrutinised with extreme vigour by
Parliament as well as those outside Parliament. However, I disagree
with the hon. Gentleman about the extent of the difference between his
party and mine about what we need to do about the
matter.</div><a name="09022512000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
been a member of Public Bill Committees before, the hon. Gentleman will
know that Opposition Members must use devices to put arguments before
the Committee and to get the Government to answer them. The reason that
he alighted on a difference is that we have used a different device to
put the issue before the Committee. I hope that he accepts that what he
said and what my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk said at
the outset of his remarks are but parallel arguments aimed at the same
target. For my part, I do not mind whether we vote on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause or the amendments tabled by the
Conservative party during our proceedings, but I want the Government to
answer the case that has been&#151;and I hope will be&#151;put to
them. That case began with the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk and concluded on 10 February with the speech of the
hon. Member for
Cambridge.</div><a name="09022512000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000385"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I am glad to hear the hon. and
learned Gentleman say what he has just said. As for votes, the most
important vote is that on clause stand part. Only if we get rid of
clause 11 will it become possible to insert a new clause such as the
provision that we have
tabled.</div><a name="09022512000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000386"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Now we have open agreement as well as implicit
agreement. However, the main thing is that the public should know that
the Opposition are deeply 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>opposed to the clause. Whether we achieve that through a vote on clause
stand part, or through votes on new clauses or amendments, makes no
difference&#151;it is a procedural device. I hope that those who are
listening to this debate in Committee and who may read of it later will
understand our purpose.</div>
<a name="09022512000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge is right that clause 11 is an anti-jury
clause, but it is just as much an anti-open justice
clause.</div>
<a name="09022512000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000387"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does my hon. and learned
Friend not agree that clause 11(1) makes clear the motives: that the
matter should not be made public, and that other measures would,
allegedly, be inadequate to prevent the matter being made public? It
does not refer to juries.</div>
<a name="09022512000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000388"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> No, clause 11 is designed to keep juries out. It
is designed to keep the public out and to make the inquest process a
secret one. I believe in open justice, and in the public having access
to the issues in controversy in an inquest, as I do in relation to
criminal trials. If there is no open justice, one cannot have
confidence in the judicial and courts system. Although individual
Ministers and Secretaries of State may be well motivated, once this
sort of clause becomes available to be used by the authorities, they
will use it. One has only to look at the hoo-hah at the weekend over
the coming into force of certain parts of the Counter-Terrorism Act
2008 to see what happens.</div>
<a name="09022512000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under section
76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act, entitled &#147;Offences relating to
information about members of armed forces etc&#148;, it is now an
offence, punishable by 10 years&#146; imprisonment, to
elicit or attempt to
elicit</div><a name="09022512000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information
about an individual who is or has been...a constable, which is of
a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act
of terrorism,
or&#148;</div><a name="09022512000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">if
he</div><a name="09022512000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publishes
or communicates any such
information.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has been discussed over the weekend as giving the police the power to
confiscate, or to delete, photographs taken of them.</div>
<a name="09022512000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example
was given in <i class="I">The Guardian</i> correspondence column this morning, by
a magistrate, of an offence that had taken place on the street that was
not only photographed by CCTV but had been photographed on the mobile
telephone of a passer-by. The police confiscated that mobile telephone
and deleted the photographic evidence on the basis, presumably, that
section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act applied and allowed them to do
so. It was a silly and unnecessary thing for them to have done, but it
is it the sort of thing that happens when authorities are given powers
that may not be intended to be used in that particular way but which
inevitably do get used in that
way.</div><a name="09022512000058"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000389"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is my hon. and learned Friend not concerned that
a photographic record of a police constable who was allegedly
committing misconduct against a member of the general
public&#151;beating them up, for example&#151;might also be
confiscated on the ground that it might prejudice the
constable&#146;s personal
security?</div><a name="09022512000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000390"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Those sorts of dangers are precisely the reason
why we should beware of such ill-thought-out legislation. It is ironic
that we have a Government who seem to want to pry into our private
lives. We have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>CCTV, and identity cards, which require the creation of the national
identity register into which our private information is deposited, and
we cannot audit the information trail. We see all sorts of other ways
in which the Government have reversed the balance of power and the
relationship between the citizen and the state over the past 10 or so
years. In this Bill, the Government are saying that the public cannot
see what they are doing or have done when it comes to the deaths of our
citizens at the hands of the agents of the state. They say,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, a certificate will be issued. If somebody
thinks that the certificate has been issued improperly or wrongly or
under some error of law, the affected parties can apply to the High
Court for judicial review.&#148; However, judicial review does not go
into the substance of the issue; it merely considers the
process.</div><a name="09022512000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
long as the Secretary of State has complied with the procedure that
flows from clause 11, the High Court is unlikely to be able to do much
about it. Lord Bingham, the retired senior Law Lord, wrote about it in
<i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Guardian</i> on 17 February.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I know it is amusing when members

<a name="09022512000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000392"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right to pick me up
on the word &#147;forced&#148;&#151;nobody held a gun to Lord
Bingham&#146;s head as he typed out his article. It was a rhetorical
flourish. I am glad that the rhetorical and right hon. Gentleman, who
has never, as the Americans say, &#147;misspoken&#148;, picked me
up on that. Forgive me, Mr. Cook, if I ever accused a
Welshman of talking too much or inaccurately. I trust I will never fall
foul of that.</div>
<a name="09022512000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me quote
what Lord Bingham said in his piece in <i class="I">The Guardian</i> on 17
February. It is headlined, &#147;Judges possess the weapon to
challenge surveillance. The British are the most spied-upon people in
the democratic world, but only the judiciary can restrain
Parliament.&#148; There is a perfectly good argument to be had about
where the balance should properly lie between Parliament and the
judiciary. Sometimes we get it right, and sometimes we get it wrong. I
am concerned that the judiciary will not be able to exercise any proper
balancing act or controlling power if clause 11 goes through, either as
currently drafted or at all. In his piece, Lord Bingham
said:</div><a name="09022512000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If,
historically, the record of British judges as defenders of personal
liberty has been patchy, the tools at their disposal were rather
limited. They could, in case of doubt, interpret parliamentary
enactments on the assumption that parliament did not intend to infringe
rights and freedoms; yet if the enactment was clear and unambiguous,
they had no choice but to give it effect. But the rules of the game
have changed - if not in the sense or direction that Tony Blair had in
mind when using that expression - for parliament has, in the Human
Rights Act 1998, instructed the judges to protect the main rights and
freedoms enshrined in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>European Convention on Human Rights, providing a much more comprehensive
framework of principles than judges have been able to invoke
before.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
whole raft of arguments based on article 2 of the European convention
emerge out of the current clause 11. A further set of arguments emerge
out of clause 11(2)(c), in which we are told that the Secretary of
State may cite as one of the reasons behind his certificate to hold a
secret
inquest,</div><a name="09022512000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
in order to prevent real harm to the public
interest.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could mean anything and nothing, and it seems that Lord Bingham is
entirely right when he says that out of the Justice Secretary&#146;s
Human Rights Act, which he introduced as Home Secretary in 1998, judges
have been instructed to protect the main rights and freedoms enshrined
under the convention. I have a suspicion that we will see tears before
bedtime if clause 11 goes on to the statute book, because it will
provide opportunities for arguments under the convention via the Human
Rights Act, which will lead to the Government having to explain why
they passed this Bill in this form. It cannot be said that they have
not been warned&#151;not just by members of the Committee, but by
other commentators as
well.</div><a name="09022512000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): On my hon. and
learned Friend&#146;s point about the possible interpretation of
subsection 2(c), is it the case that we may have a similar problem
regarding the lack of definitions for &#147;substantial&#148; and
&#147;real&#148;? Does &#147;real&#148;, in the current
context, mean a substantial, notifiable, obvious and definite threat,
or does it mean something more than just insubstantial, as they are two
different
concepts?</div><a name="09022512000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000394"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Indeed, they are, but I feel that we will be
boxed in by the power of the Secretary of State to self-certify. If he
said, in a memorandum to the court, that there was a real harm to the
public interest through the exposure of certain evidence or processes
to the public gaze, then, just as in the Court of Appeal case last week
regarding Binyam Mohamed, the court would be reluctant to go behind
that certificate. If we let the clause go through, we are voluntarily
giving the Secretary of State a power to restrain the courts from
policing him. As democrats, and as people who respect the proper
balance between the different elements of the constitution, we should
be extremely careful before allowing any Secretary of State, of any
political party, those sorts of powers. As night follows day, we will
end up in the position similar to that under the Counter-Terrorism Act
2008, as I described, in which perfectly innocent and sensible
activities are suppressed at the say-so of a police constable&#151;it
is not the same, but it is of similar character. I urge the Committee
to be extremely cautious when allowing the clause, as it is currently
drafted, on to the statute
book.</div><a name="09022512000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000395"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab): I
have listened carefully to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Is he
saying&#151;I would agree with him if he was&#151;that the problem
lies entirely with subsection (2)(c)? If so, does he accept that the
reasons set out in subsections (2)(a) and (b) are clear and
acceptable?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="09022512000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000396"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right that subsection
2(c) ought to be excised, but that is not the only cause of complaint.
As is clear from the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk and the hon. Member for Cambridge, there are much
wider and deeper concerns&#151;although the right hon. Gentleman
highlights a particularly good reason for not letting the clause go
through.</div><a name="09022512000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that we are worried about how the Secretary of State can
self-certify, and be policed by the courts only under judicial review.
It also seems that the removal of the jury is a cause of great concern,
and that we are giving to the state&#151;this is not a party
political point&#151;powers over the citizen that should be wrested
from the citizen with only the greatest reluctance and at times and in
circumstances of particular exceptionality. It seems that none of the
arguments that I have heard so far from the Government, trailed in
advance of Committee, seem to meet the point, but I accept that the
Minister will respond to the arguments raised against the clause so
far.</div><a name="09022512000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not shrink from admitting that over the course of this weekend, I
read a new briefing from Inquest, which adds to the one that it gave
earlier in the process of the Bill. I hope that the Minister has read
the briefing, and is in a position to respond in detail to the cogent
points that are made by the brief. If she had, she would realise that
there is a mass of rational arguments, which should cause great
concern, and lead her to think again about the clause. The brief
extends to 15 pages, and I would be testing the patience of the
Committee to recite it all. The issues in clause 11 are some of the
most important that we must deal with as legislators during the passage
of this extraordinary Bill. It may well be that other clauses dealing
with coroners, although important, do not hold the same concern for the
relationship between the state and the citizen as clause 11
does.</div><a name="09022512000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk said at the beginning
of our debate on 10 February, the Government, through the
Secretary of State, made it clear that there are two cases that are so
contentious or secret that, if there are to be inquests dealing with
such deaths, a provision such as clause 11 would be necessary. The
Secretary of State rather beguilingly said, &#147;Well, if you can
come up with something better than clause 11, I would listen to
it.&#148; However, the short point is that the Government do not
appear to want to move from the broad position that the Secretary of
State should have the ability to self-certify, that the policing of
that certification should be by judicial review only and that that
should be the only involvement of the court&#151;inquests of this
nature, for the reasons set out in subsection (2), should be held out
of the public gaze, under the chairmanship of a High Court
judge.</div><a name="09022512000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there are only two cases, and the Inquest brief mentions only
one&#151;</div><a name="09022512000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000397"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000398"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Does it mention both? I shall come back to that.
Inquest mentions the case of Azelle Rodney in the following
terms:</div><a name="09022512000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Azelle
Rodney died in April 2005 after a police operation in north London in
which he was shot seven times&#151;the circumstances surrounding his
shooting had nothing to do with counter terrorism&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div><a name="09022512000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">or national security,
but involved criminal
allegations.</div><a name="09022512000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Azelle
was shot after the car he was in was ordered to &#145;hard
stop&#146; after being under police surveillance for more than three
hours&#148;</div><a name="09022512000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
Edgware.</div><a name="09022512000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
July 2006 the...CPS announced that there was insufficient evidence
for a successful prosecution. After the CPS decision, the family was
told by the coroner that the full inquest could not be held because
large portions of the police officers&#146; statements had been
crossed out under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act...2000, which covers information obtained from covert
surveillance devices such as telephone taps or bugs. Lawyers acting for
the family of Azelle Rodney threatened to take the government to court
to show that RIPA was in breach of the Human Rights Act
1998.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not controversial, in so far as it has been said before, but Inquest
and a lot of us believe that clause 11 is a disproportionate and
draconian measure. It falsely equates the existence of material that
should not be made public with the need to remove a jury and give the
Secretary of State unprecedented and wide-reaching powers to intervene
in the investigation of contentious
deaths.</div>
<a name="09022512000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000399"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Is the hon. and learned
Gentleman identifying himself with the strong language that he has just
read out from Inquest? When the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
presented the Conservative amendment about a High Court judge giving or
not giving a certificate to the Secretary of State, I thought that the
hon. and learned Gentleman was with the Government on the public policy
objective, but he now seems to have identified himself as totally
against.</div><a name="09022512000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000400"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> No, the hon. Gentleman is over-interpreting what
I have said. My hon. Friend and I are both concerned that the public
should have access to the coronial system and about the device that the
Government wish to use in order to protect national security and
information that ought to be kept secret. In parenthesis, he, the hon.
Member for Cambridge and I are not so naive as to think that all
secret, security service information can be revealed to the public by a
coroner&#146;s court inquest. However, as the hon. Member for
Cambridge said with perfect common sense at the previous sitting,
espionage trials at the Old Bailey sometimes include juries, juries
that are vetted, and counsel for both the Crown and for the defence who
have been vetted. Indeed, counsel for the defence is provided by the
Government or the Crown Prosecution Service with secure safes in which
to keep sensitive material, so that it does not fall into the wrong
hands.</div>
<a name="09022512000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
existing procedures in the criminal justice system that make justice
possible, and that are, yes, partly in private, but that are much more
open than the system that the Secretary of States wishes to implement
under clause 11. If I can propose something more akin to the system
used by the criminal courts when dealing with espionage and other cases
in the coronial system, I hope that Labour members of the Committee
will come some way towards me. By voting against clause 11 stand part
and in favour of the amendments, we shall have a better and more
sensible clause for discussion on Report or in the other place when the
Government have had more time to think about
matters.</div><a name="09022512000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are huge implications under article 2 of the convention. It is well
established that, whenever state bodies or agents bear responsibility
for a death, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>procedural duty to investigate the death arises under article 2, but
clause 11 does not fulfil those obligations. I am interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s advice about section 19 approval by the Secretary
of State on the front of the Bill. That statement has almost become a
pro forma. It is rubber-stamped on the front of all Bills, but it
strikes me that sections of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
2000, this Bill and many others that I have had the misfortune to have
to read during the past few years are in flagrant breach of the Human
Rights Act and the convention. Some of those pieces of legislation have
been found to be so by our higher courts, yet the Government have
carried on busily stamping section 19 approval all over their
legislation.</div><a name="09022512000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of article 2 in relation to coroners and the case of the Crown
ex parte Amin <i class="I">v.</i> Home Secretary in 2003, Lord Bingham in his
capacity as a Law Lord listed the purposes of an article 2 compliant
investigation. He said that it was, first,</div>
<a name="09022512000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure as
far as possible that the full facts are brought to
light&#148;;</div><a name="09022512000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">secondly,</div><a name="09022512000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
culpable and discreditable conduct is exposed and brought to public
notice&#148;;</div><a name="09022512000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">thirdly,</div><a name="09022512000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing (if unjustified) is
allayed&#148;;</div><a name="09022512000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">fourthly,</div><a name="09022512000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
dangerous practices and procedures are
rectified&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">and,
fifthly,</div><a name="09022512000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
those who have lost their relative may at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that lessons learned from his death may save the lives of
others.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
said
that</div><a name="09022512000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
that the ECHR requirement is for a public investigation, for purpose 1
to have any meaning, &#145;brought to light&#146; must be
interpreted as exposed to public
scrutiny&#148;.</div><a name="09022512000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the intervention by the hon. Member for Stafford. There will
be circumstances in which the full facts cannot be brought to light,
which I touched on when I referred to the criminal trial process and
espionage trials. The full facts need to be brought to light, but that
might not be covered by the expression, &#147;the full glare of the
public domain&#148;. By having judges sitting in private without
families, interested parties and the public having much in the way of
access to what goes on, we are allowing the Government to make a huge
mistake. If we think that that is compliant with article 2, we have
either not read the article and understood it, or we have not followed
the judgment of Lord Bingham in the case of Amin. It is strange that we
are passing yet another restrictive law at a time when the
public&#146;s attention is focused on the delicate relationship
between the state, its agents and the citizen. I want a public
examination of the core facts surrounding the circumstances of a death.
We should not allow anything that is counter to the public need to
ensure that deliberate wrongdoing is
suspected.</div><a name="09022512000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
de Menezes case has obviously been the subject of huge public
controversy. A number of Committee members have asked&#151;either
rhetorically or in direct interventions, on Second Reading or during
the course of these proceedings&#151;whether clause 11 would cover a
de Menezes-type inquest. It is clear that the procedure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>used in that inquest did not require a clause 11-type investigation.
There, we had a High Court judge sitting as the coroner, but we also
had a jury and witness-anonymity orders. A number of the police
officers who were implicated in the death of the deceased were able to
appear by letter as opposed to their full name, and they were allowed
to appear behind screens and were not visible to press photographers or
journalists, as far as I can recall. However, they were visible to
counsel appearing at the inquest, and if not to the family of the
deceased, then to a supporter of the family of the deceased. There was
a form of openness allied to sensible precautions to protect the
identity of police officers who conduct secret
work.</div><a name="09022512000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09022512000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Michael Wright, the retired judge who conducted the inquest, dealt with
applications for personal public interest immunity. He also dealt with
a number of other procedural applications, which afforded those who
needed their identities or particular information to be kept secret to
be satisfied. The jury reached a conclusion&#151;whether we agree
with that conclusion or not is neither here nor there&#151;but the
procedure was such that there was public accessibility, and the family
of the deceased, which was desperately upset and deeply dissatisfied by
the inquest&#146;s conclusion, were at least there and were able to
take part. They would not be able to do that in a clause 11 inquest. I
therefore ask the Government to re-examine the de Menezes inquest to
see whether there are lessons to be learned before they charge into
passing clause 11 and leading themselves into yet further
trouble.</div><a name="09022512000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not say anything about intercept evidence other than to mark out
that issue as one that the Government need to deal with. I also draw
attention to a proposal made right at the end of the brief from
Inquest, which deals with suggestions made by my noble Friend Baroness
Miller in the other place during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism
Act 2008. She suggested that section 18 of RIPA should be amended to
allow RIPA material to be disclosed solely to the High Court judge
conducting a secret inquest, and possibly to counsel to a secret
inquest.</div><a name="09022512000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not propose to discuss that in any detail now, as it is not strictly
germane to clause 11 and is dealt with in approach to another piece of
legislation. However, I urge the Government to be a little more
inventive and not to fall into the default position that they always
fall into of saying, &#147;our first stop is secrecy and only if we
are pushed and pushed will we allow public, or other, access into these
sorts of inquiries&#148;. We know of two cases which have been
stalled because the Government will not allow certain evidence to be
given into the deaths of the man I first mentioned and another person,
whose name is not yet public.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000401"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> My hon. and learned Friend missed the second
paragraph of the Inquest brief, which names the second inquest
regarding the case of Mr. Terry Nicholas, a 52 year-old
black man who was shot by the Metropolitan police in Hanger lane in
2007. Inquest mentioned both cases in the
overview.</div><a name="09022512000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000402"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That paragraph
states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div><a name="09022512000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;INQUEST
is also working closely with the lawyers for the family of Terry
Nicholas, a 52 year old black man who was shot by MPS officers at
Hanger Green, London W5, on the evening of 15 May 2007, after he had
left the rear of restaurant premises. In October 2008, it emerged that
the inquest touching on this death was also stalled because the inquest
could not receive sensitive material and that the Government proposals
in the CTB regarding secret inquests were supposed to make it possible
to resume the inquest into this death
too.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
now know the identities of the two unfortunate people who will be the
subjects of the inquest. As I understand it, the Government&#151;I
hope that the Minister will tell me that I am wrong about
this&#151;are basing the clause on those two cases, and the
possibility that similar cases may happen in the future. But the
numbers are tiny, and the Government are building a vast obstacle to
public acceptance on the basis of two cases, which, with common
sense&#151;as deployed by Sir Michael Wright in the de Menezes
case&#151;could be
overcome.</div><a name="09022512000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge the Government to think carefully about the clause, to withdraw it
before we attempt to vote it down, and to come back with something
rather more sensible, either on Report or in the other place. The
Opposition&#151;I think I can speak for both Opposition parties in
this Committee&#151;are not against all forms of confidentiality. We
accept that there will be occasions when sensitive information must be
kept away from families and the wider public, but mechanisms and
procedures that are already available make the clause wholly
unnecessary and deeply counter-productive. Therefore, I urge the
Minister to take the combined view of the Opposition seriously, because
we are here to
help.</div><a name="09022512000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000403"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I support the Government&#146;s public policy
objective in the clause&#151;I can even vote for some of the proposed
restrictions in the clause, and I am happy to support the Government in
a clause stand part vote. But that is not the same as saying that I
agree with the clause, and I draw attention to the bit that I do not
agree with. As is my way, I will not dwell on my negative views, but
will put forward a positive suggestion of a way
forward.</div><a name="09022512000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has said, we are not so
naive as to think that all national security and public interest
information that is collected by the state should be put on public
display in courts of law or at inquests. In the current case, we have
two real examples of inquests that are not going forward at the present
time, because of an inability to get around the problem of holding the
inquest and getting to the truth of how and why somebody died without
disclosing that kind of information. So, there is a problem, and we
have to address
it.</div><a name="09022512000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not debating a one-stage process, but a two-stage one. The first
stage is certification of an issue of national security or public
interest. The second is the rules for running an inquest to comply with
such a certificate&#151;in other words, to ensure that matters that
should not be in the public domain do not get there. The first of those
two stages, public interest and national security, is the
responsibility of the Executive. The second&#151;how courts and
proceedings are run&#151;is the responsibility of the judiciary. The
clause rolls together those two stages. Once the Secretary of State
gives the certificate, we set out, in the clause, the things that
follow; in other words, the High Court judge sits as the coroner, there
is no jury, and parts of the inquest are held in private.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="09022512000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
convenient for us to give debates titles, so that we understand what we
are talking about. The current title is &#147;secret
inquests&#148;, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the
High Court judge running such an inquest would hold most of it in
public, but the bit that we are talking about would be held in
private.</div><a name="09022512000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue concerns how one protects relevant material that should not be
disclosed. The hon. and learned Gentleman talked about the
naivet√(c) of people who think that all information should be
disclosed. Just to hammer it home, the briefing from the Commission on
Equality and Human Rights
states:</div><a name="09022512000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission appreciates that non-disclosure of sensitive material is
sometimes necessary in the interest of national security and to protect
the public interest.&#148;</div>

said:</div><a name="09022512000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Often
there are very high stakes in such proceedings. Our point is that
safeguards are already in place to ensure that certain individuals are
not identified and that various bits of information are kept from the
jury or the public when such inquests are
held.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Coroners and
Justice Public Bill Committee, </i>3 February 2009; c. 61,
Q133.]</div><a name="09022512000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
an acknowledgement of the principle.</div>
<a name="09022512000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000404"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that,
as Liberty said in its evidence, very high stakes are involved in such
cases belies the argument that the Government adduce from time to time
that such cases are unimportant, because they make up only 1 or 2 per
cent. of inquests. Such inquests are exactly the ones on which both the
general public and the media will
focus.</div><a name="09022512000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000405"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I have not heard Ministers say that because juries
are only empanelled in 2 per cent. of inquests, jury inquests are not
important. Everybody appreciates that the most important 2 per cent. of
inquests get a
jury.</div><a name="09022512000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
say that that certification process, which I think of as stage 1,
should pass from the Secretary of State to a High Court judge. That is
absolutely wrong in principle and in practice, which is why I support
the Government and not the Opposition amendments. In principle, the
Executive have responsibility for national security and public safety.
The top priority of any Government is to keep us safe, and national
security and the public interest are part of keeping us
safe.</div><a name="09022512000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
practical point is that the Executive collect all the intelligence.
They assess it, they interpret what it means, and they have the
knowledge, expertise, context and public accountability to do that job,
which judges do not have.</div>
<a name="09022512000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000406"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The issue is not who has the information, but
whether there is any control over the decision that a matter is one of
national security. If there is no judicial control over that decision,
national security simply becomes a way in which the Executive can avoid
public scrutiny, so it cannot just be either the Executive or the
judiciary&#151;it has to be both. It is not a question of the extent
to which the judiciary will defer to the Executive&#146;s expertise,
nor a question whether the judiciary should be excluded
altogether.</div><a name="09022512000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000407"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I agree. When the hon. Gentleman hears my
suggestion, he will hear that I still see a place for judicial review,
just as there is now of the certification part of the two-stage
process. That means the judiciary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>getting involved in whether the Government are behaving properly in
giving the certificate in the first place, which I would
preserve.</div><a name="09022512000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, the Executive&#146;s accountability for their
judgment includes not only judicial accountability, hence the judicial
review point, but public accountability, which I argue is via the
legislature, so the legislature&#146;s role starts now. When we get
the legislation right, it continues to hold the Government to account
for their decisions.</div>
<a name="09022512000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is currently drafted too widely. The grounds on which the
Secretary of State can conclude that a matter should not be in the
public domain are too wide, which is the issue with clause 11(2)(c),
which goes beyond national security and public interest to include very
general crime-fighting and witness protection. Clearly, that is wrong,
and we need to narrow the grounds on which the Secretary of State can
give a
certificate.</div><a name="09022512000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000408"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> I agree. Will the hon. Gentleman therefore accept
our amendments 42 and 43, which specifically say that there should be
only one reason for allowing certification, namely, national security?
That is quite beside the question of whether we will vote for stand
part. The main thrust of our amendments is that only national security
is a good reason. Will he join us in supporting the
amendments?</div><a name="09022512000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09022512000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000409"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> No, those grounds are too narrow. The hon.
Gentleman was not listening when I said national security and public
protection. &#147;Public protection&#148; can be drawn too widely
and end up including crime-fighting, but it must be read in the context
of national security issues. However, public interest is slightly
different from national security, and it is the two together that are
valuable and that should be
preserved.</div><a name="09022512000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is too wide and too prescriptive in proposing a High Court judge
as coroner, no jury and parts of the evidence being taken in private.
It should separate the certification, which is properly the role of the
Secretary of State and should occur on the narrow grounds that I have
explained. As for the changes to the rules for running the inquest to
which the certificate relates, the clause should provide a menu, not a
single solution, of responses to the certificate, and the judiciary,
not the Executive, should rule on the selection of the options from the
menu.</div><a name="09022512000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
my suggestion, the Secretary of State would issue a certificate that a
matter should not be in the public domain because of national security
or public interest, and it would be subject to challenge by judicial
review, as in the present law. In any event, the Secretary of State
would give the certificate to a High Court judge. I would be happy for
the Secretary of State to give the judge, in addition, the Secretary of
State&#146;s proposals for modifying the running of the individual
inquest from the menu of options. For example, in the most serious
cases, the Secretary of State might say, &#147;I am giving the
certificate. That means that it should be a High Court judge as
coroner, no jury and some bits in private.&#148; However, the judge
might say, &#147;Well, I am looking at what the law says, and I have
a set of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>options.&#148; I assume that we want the law to say that the judge
should choose the options that make the least change to existing
practice in every other inquest, so the options would be in rising
order of seriousness, and the judge would then select from
them.</div><a name="09022512000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000410"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> By logical extension of that argument, next time
we have a serious espionage case, the Foreign Secretary or Home
Secretary ought to go to the court and say, &#147;You will conduct
the trial in this way, select from a number of options&#148;, instead
of, as currently happens, the Crown Prosecution Service going before
the court and saying, &#147;This information is sensitive or secret,
could you therefore devise a procedure for this particular element or
part of the trial that would not allow that to
happen?&#148;</div><a name="09022512000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000411"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman is keen to refer us
to the equality of criminal cases, but there is a difference, which the
Secretary of State gave on Second Reading and which I will repeat in a
moment.</div><a name="09022512000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman is describing what happens now, with the PII
route. The prosecution goes to the judge, with the PII certificate, and
says, &#147;We think that some things cannot be heard in public, so
these things should happen.&#148; In effect, the judge then says yes
or no and chooses from the existing options under the criminal justice
law in this country. I suggest the same for coroner&#146;s inquests.
Whereas some of the briefings and arguments say that an inquest exactly
equates to a criminal trial and, therefore, the usual PII procedures
should apply, I am saying that inquests are something different, so a
variant on the PII procedure should apply. That is what my amendment
suggests.</div><a name="09022512000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,
the judge decides whether to modify the usual inquest rules and, if so,
in what ways. We would have regard to all the issues argued
about&#151;security vetting of the jury, holding parts in private,
banning reporting of some parts and witness anonymity&#151;but I
would argue that in the most serious cases, which the hon. and learned
Gentleman has said occur only once or twice in a number of years, the
other options that the Government already have in clause 11 should be
part of the menu. The High Court judge might say, &#147;Yes, this
case is so serious that these are the options that I have had to
choose.&#148; In that way, we would reinforce the roles of the
Executive versus the judiciary and reinforce public confidence in the
system by getting past that obstacle. Those are my suggestions, which I
put forward for the Minister&#146;s consideration. My actual vote at
the end of the debate will depend in part on the warmth or coolness of
the assurances that I
receive.</div><a name="09022512000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
acknowledged that the clause may need attention, so I hope that my
suggestion will be
considered.</div><a name="09022512000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
reminded us that there is a difference between a criminal prosecution
and an inquest, which is that an inquest has to be held and has to
identify the cause of death and why it happened. In a criminal case, if
the state thinks that some information might come out that it would not
want to do so, the state can choose not to rely on that information in
evidence, but to have a go for the conviction without it, or in a more
severe case choose to abandon the prosecution and not bother at all.
Those are serious choices to make, if the person on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>trial is dangerous, but nevertheless the state has the option to make
those choices, but there is no such option with an inquest, which must
take
place.</div><a name="09022512000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a significant difference, which the Secretary of State was right to
discuss on Second Reading. Some people have run that argument together
with his suggested solution&#151;clause 11&#151;and said that it is
unfair, unjust, against article 2 or
whatever.</div><a name="09022512000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000412"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I trespass on legally thin ice perhaps and seek
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s advice. The situation may not be as
absolute as the Secretary of State has indicated. For example, in cases
involving the parole of existing-sentence prisoners, there would be
judicial hearings before a judge and, in certain cases, even the
special advocate procedure can be used, because of the extreme
sensitivity of such cases. Does that affect the issue at
all?</div><a name="09022512000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000413"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful
intervention, which shows that there are other situations in which such
considerations are wrestled with all the time. I am grateful for that,
but I have put forward other
suggestions.</div><a name="09022512000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a footnote, for completeness, the Commission for Equality and Human
Rights briefing and Liberty&#146;s evidence to us contemplate
situations in which evidence is withheld from an inquest. Even for an
inquest held in public and with a jury, the withholding of information
has problems of its own. The jury is charged with coming to a
conclusion about what caused the death, and we must consider the effect
on that conclusion of some evidence being withheld. The Coroners
Society has pointed out that it is sometimes a difficult decision to
say, &#147;The inquest needs to go ahead with all the evidence, but
not all the evidence can be disclosed to the public&#148;, or that,
because some of the evidence should not be disclosed, it should be
withheld from the jury, which would carry on and make a decision
without it. They are imperfect solutions and sometimes it would be
right to do one rather than the other, but there is no absolute. My
proposal is a variant on clause 11 and new clause 10, and it is a
sensible way forward. I look forward to seeing whether the Minister
agrees.</div><a name="09022512000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000414"></a>The
Chairman:</b> David Howarth&#151;sorry, Jenny
Willott.</div><a name="09022512000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000415"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): Thank you, Mr.
Cook. I have never been mistaken for my hon. Friend the Member for
Cambridge before. I want to discuss amendment 125, which relates to a
slightly different point but which is tied to the openness and
publicity surrounding an
inquest.</div><a name="09022512000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the draft Bill, the Government proposed to restrict the reporting of
certain details at an inquest. When the Government consulted,
significant concerns were raised by a number of different
organisations. They said that they had dropped the proposals to
restrict reporting of certain details, because of concerns about press
freedom and so on. Instead, the Government decided to expand the media
code to ensure the sensible reporting of inquests, including the more
sensitive details, which was done through a media code rather than
laying out restrictions in statute.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div><a name="09022512000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern,
which is picked up by amendment 125, is that clause 34(2)(e), which I
suggest removing, looks like the same proposal, in that it restricts
the reporting by the media of various details at an inquest. In fact,
it looks even broader than the Government&#146;s initial proposal.
Under the original proposal, which was later dropped, the name of the
deceased or an interested person, or information that could lead to the
identification of the deceased person, could be withheld. However, the
Bill refers to the &#147;name or other matter&#148;, which is
significantly broader than what was originally proposed. Rather than
the name or other matter not being published, it refers to its not
being disclosed, which again is broader than the original
proposals.</div><a name="09022512000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tabled the amendment to receive clarification from the Minister about
the intention of the subsection, given that the Government were clear
when they dropped their original proposal that such a power needed to
be placed through the voluntary media code rather than legislation.
They accepted the argument that it was overly restrictive of press
freedom. If the Government&#146;s intention is not to reintroduce the
original proposal, will the Minister explain what can be done to ensure
that it does not lead to exactly what was proposed originally except
that there would be even broader restrictions on press freedom than
under the draft
Bill?</div><a name="09022512000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
110 and 109 relate to secret inquests in Northern Ireland. I am sure
that the Minister is aware of the strong view that has been expressed
by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission about the extension of
the provisions to Northern Ireland. It states that
any</div><a name="09022512000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extension
of these proposals to Northern Ireland would be viewed as bad faith by
the British Government and could seriously jeopardise progress on what
is a very politically sensitive
issue.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is incredibly strong language for a body that is usually more measured.
There is strong public opinion and concern in Northern Ireland about
certified inquests. Following Ministry of Justice questions at which
the issue was raised, the Secretary of State wrote to hon. Members
saying that it would not apply to legacy cases and, thus, not to cases
that are still awaiting inquests on deaths still outstanding from the
troubles.</div><a name="09022512000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the strength of feeling in Northern Ireland among both the public and
those at the Human Rights Commission, and the fact that circumstances
in Northern Ireland are different from those in the rest of the United
Kingdom, the need for the situation and the judicial process to be
absolutely transparent and open is more apparent there than almost
anywhere else in the UK. If that does not happen, it could lead to all
sorts of political issues as
well.</div><a name="09022512000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000416"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> By what they have said this morning, the hon.
Members for Cardiff, Central and for Stafford have shown that their
hearts are very much in the right place. All of us are fundamentally
opposed to clause 11, although our solutions to the illiberal aspects
of the provision might be
different.</div><a name="09022512000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise to the Committee for not having been present at the two
previous sittings and therefore not having been here for the start of
the debate on clause 11. I was in Afghanistan, which my hon. Friend the
Member for Daventry kindly mentioned in my absence. While I was there,
two soldiers were killed&#151;Lance Corporal Kingscott from 1st
Battalion the Rifles and Marine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>Darren Smith of 45 Commando. Both their bodies are being returned to the
UK today through Wootton Bassett in my constituency. The inquests will
be carried out by the excellent Wiltshire coroner, Mr. David
Masters or his immediate successor. He has built up significant
expertise in military inquests, alongside the Oxfordshire coroner.
While thinking of those two young men, I wondered whether the
circumstances surrounding the deaths of Lance Corporal Kingscott and
Marine Smith would be allowed to be made public, if clause 11 were
accepted.</div><a name="09022512000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will come back to that, with particular reference to military inquests,
in a moment.</div>
<a name="09022512000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09022512000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
general flavour of the debate so far this morning indicates that the
terms of clause 11 are excessively wide. On Second Reading, the
Secretary of State made it plain that he was worried about only two
inquests. He reiterated the point in a private conversation afterwards
that he was only bothered about two particularly sensitive inquests and
that this wide-ranging clause had been introduced because of them. The
two inquests that I have mentioned were referred to by my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough and were raised by Inquest. It
seems extraordinary to introduce such a wide-ranging clause, which
would not necessarily be used by this Government, but which might be
used by subsequent, more malign, Secretaries of State in ways in which
we do not intend it to be
used.</div><a name="09022512000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
41 to 43 propose that the reasons that the Secretary of State can use
for certifying the privacy of the inquest should be restricted to
matters of national interest. It seems perfectly obvious that the way
in which the clause is drafted, allowing privacy of inquests in the
interests of the relationship between</div>
<a name="09022512000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the United
Kingdom and another
country&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">could
mean virtually anything. Any trade matter, for example, would affect
the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country.
Another reason is &#147;preventing or detecting crime&#148;, which
applies to preventing or detecting any crime at all&#151;it could be
preventing, not even detecting. We could have a private inquest in the
interests of preventing crime for heaven&#146;s sake. What sort of
crime&#151;road crime, traffic crime, parking offences, who knows?
Will we have private inquests in order to avoid parking offences
becoming
public?</div><a name="09022512000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further reason
is</div><a name="09022512000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
order to protect the safety of a witness or other
person&#148;.</div><a name="09022512000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, we have to protect the safety of a witness or other person, but
to make secret information in an inquest which ought, by definition, to
be available to the public in order to protect the safety of a
&#147;witness or other person&#148; seems extremely
wide.</div>
<a name="09022512000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000417"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman gets too carried away
about the extent of the clause, I refer him back to clause 11(1)(b),
which states that the Secretary of State must be satisfied
that</div>
<a name="09022512000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no other
measures would be adequate to prevent the matter being made
public.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many cases that that would not touch.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div><a name="09022512000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000418"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> That is a misreading of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman
is right in saying that clause 11(1)(b) states that the Secretary of
State may make such a certificate only
if</div><a name="09022512000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
other measures would be adequate to prevent the matter being made
public.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the clause starts with the presumption that the matters
must not be made public and, if the ways in which the matter cannot be
made public are not adequate, then the Secretary of State has an
additional power to keep them secret. It is not a question of such
matters mostly being available to the public; the clause lays down that
the Secretary of State either already has powers to keep them secret,
or that these measures will give him extra powers to keep them secret.
My argument is that they should not be kept secret&#151;they should
be available to the public. That is one of the most fundamental
principles in coronial inquests at the moment.</div>
<a name="09022512000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that
for three reasons. The first reason involves the interests of the
public. It seems perfectly obvious that the public need to know why
people die&#151;in particular, at the hand of the state. Secondly,
there may well be reasons why something went wrong at the hands of the
state and ways in which that could be corrected. A coroner may come up
with conclusions&#151;as David Masters and the Oxfordshire coroner
have done in military inquests&#151;to show that things went wrong.
If such things were heard in secret, there would be no way of knowing
whether the state had corrected them. Thirdly, the family of the
bereaved need closure, and they get closure by having an entirely
public inquest. If that inquest is in private, and the family, or
representatives of the family do not know why the person in question
was killed, can they ever get closure? For those three good reasons, it
seems that most matters should be in public. There may be some extreme
cases of national security where some degree of secrecy should be
allowed, and I shall come back to
that.</div><a name="09022512000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now focus my remarks on military inquests. The arguments can also
be applied to inquests into people who have been killed in prisons or
wrongly killed in other areas, with regard to the public security or
public safety&#151;police shootings and so on come under the same
category. My own particular interest and expertise, such that it is,
concerns military inquests. Virtually every military inquest would fall
under the description of the clause. Almost any death in a theatre of
war or on a battlefield could be deemed to have national security
implications or to place the interests of the Government or our
relationship with an overseas country at the heart of consideration. I
cannot think of any military inquest that would not fall under the
clause&#151;if the Government disagree with that, perhaps they can
raise it in a moment.</div>
<a name="09022512000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
two young soldiers&#151;one was shot by the Taliban, I think, while
the other was blown up by a roadside bomb&#151;aspects of their
deaths could theoretically harm the national interest. Should that
patrol have been at that place at that particular time? Who were the
enemy? Who shot them? Did we have adequate protection for our vehicles
to prevent them from being blown up? With such low-level
deaths&#151;I do not mean that in a bad way; I mean the deaths of
ordinary soldiers on a battlefield&#151;there are all sorts of ways
to argue that an inquest would be against the public
interest.</div><a name="09022512000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Boring
down further, I give the example&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="09022512000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000419"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09022512000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000420"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> I will happily give way to the Minister after I have
given the example. The inquest into the crash of Hercules XV179 was
carried out this year in Wiltshire. That plane was shot down in Iraq
towards the beginning of the war, resulting in the deaths of 10
servicemen. The coroner concluded that there were a number of reasons
for the incident. First, the Americans had not shared with us
sufficient intelligence about enemy activity in that area immediately
before the flight. Secondly, he took the view that had foam suppressant
been fitted into the wing tanks of the Hercules, there would have been
a significant chance that it would not have been shot down. The
Government have been required, as a result, to spend &#163;750,000 a
plane on 40 or so planes. Thirdly, there were a number of other
matters&#151;some of which were excised and not made
public&#151;where the military or the Government had failed, and, to
some greater or lesser degree, contributed to that particular crash.
Incidentally, the Americans refused to come to that inquest to give
evidence. Interestingly, they took the view that the matter was too
sensitive, and despite the fact that the coroner tried to get them to
come, they refused to give
evidence.</div><a name="09022512000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Bill had been in place at the time, it would be a simple matter for
the Secretary of State to rule, under such a licence&#151;and for the
judge to go along with it&#151;that such matters are of great
national concern. Such matters might include the intelligence
relationship between the US and the UK&#151;if we had that inquest in
public, the US might well not share the intelligence in the future.
They might also concern costing the Government a very large amount of
money to fit the foam suppressants on the wing tanks. The Hercules was
on a special forces flight involving a number of people carrying out a
number of duties that I will not mention. The Government could easily
have argued that the matter was one of grave national concern and that
if it went before David Masters, national security would be
compromised.</div><a name="09022512000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that that did not happen, and that the inquest into XV179 was
heard in public. I am perfectly content that the current Secretary of
State would have allowed it to be heard in public, and when the
Minister intervenes, I am sure that that is what she will say. But what
concerns me is that some malign Secretary of State 20, 30, 50 or 100
years from now, will see a case such as XV179 and say: &#147;Thanks
for this excellent Bill. We are now going to hear the inquest in
secret.&#148; That is why I fundamentally oppose the whole
principle.</div><a name="09022512000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000421"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way. I wanted to stop him before he went down too far that particular
road, simply to say that he is wrong to push the argument on the basis
of military inquests, because at the moment all military inquests are
held without juries. Where information can be redacted, it is, and that
is possible in relation to the provision about the anonymity of
witnesses, so the provision will not affect military inquests in the
way that he has
described.</div><a name="09022512000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000422"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> The Minister makes a perfectly good point. That is
the point that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough
made in a more general sense, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>namely, that there are perfectly good procedures in place at the moment
to make sure that matters of national security remain secret. Of
course, there are no juries in military inquests and large parts of the
evidence are redacted, although redacted inefficiently, so it is
perfectly possible to remove the redaction. When the redaction was
removed in those cases, it turned out that a lot of the information
that was redacted was not the slightest bit secret at all, so that is
another example of the state going too far to keep things secret that
they should not have done. However, the Minister&#146;s point is a
good one. The state has perfectly good ways of making sure that things
that should not be made public are not made public. My hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Harborough and my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk made such points extremely well in an earlier
sitting.</div><a name="09022512000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000423"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has said that he fears
that a malign Secretary of State might in future use the provisions of
clause 11 to prevent an inquest being held with a jury in a case in
which a jury should manifestly be involved. Is he overlooking the fact
that that malign Secretary of State would be subject to judicial
review, and if a judicial review were to consider that subsection (1)
or (2) had not been taken into account by the Secretary of State who
was acting from malign purposes, it would almost certainly overthrow
that
decision?</div><a name="09022512000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000424"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right to pick me up on
the loose use of the word &#147;malign&#148;. He is quite right in
saying that if the Secretary of State were bad and wicked and doing
things for the wrong reasons, the High Court judge would correctly pick
that up. My example was not malign, but it could arguably be in the
national interest. At the moment, the inquest would not be heard in
private, but under this Bill it would be. The right hon. Gentleman is
right to pick me up on the word &#147;malign&#148;. However, a
merely over-sensitive or over-cautious Secretary of State, perhaps in a
time of war, would say, &#147;This is a very delicate matter. We must
hear this in private and in secret&#148; and a judge would be
persuaded to agree. We should not put something into statute unless we
are certain that under no circumstances will it be used in a way that
was not
intended.</div><a name="09022512000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why I agree with the amendments that remove the other categories in
clause 11, reducing the effect of the provision to only the most grave
and serious matters of national security. If the Government choose not
to accept our amendments, I hope that people who are concerned about
the illiberal nature of the clause will vote against it at stand part,
as happened during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, when
there was a significant rebellion in the House. Only when it became
apparent that the other place would remove the clauses were they were
deleted by the Government, and I suspect and hope that the same is the
case
here.</div><a name="09022512000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to the Secretary of State on Second Reading, it seems that the
Government are moving towards accepting that some aspects of the clause
may not achieve their perfectly laudable aim. Whether it is the
solution proposed by the hon. Member for Stafford, or solutions that we
have proposed, the Government need to find a solution that achieves
what we all want&#151;namely, we do not want intercept evidence or
our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>intelligence services to be compromised. We all want those things to
happen, but Opposition Members do not believe that clause 11 achieves
that as currently drafted.</div>
<a name="09022512000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In support of
that, I will give two quotes, the first from a letter from David
Masters, the Wiltshire coroner who has been involved in military
inquests:</div><a name="09022512000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Experienced
coroners know how to deal with sensitive PII and classified material
issues. We do not know of any who have acted improperly; they can be
trusted!&#148;</div><a name="09022512000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot of sense in that. Coroners know how to handle such matters and
do not need a new Act of Parliament in order to deal with
them.</div><a name="09022512000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09022512000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Harborough has already quoted the excellent
brief produced by Inquest, which is a modest and sensible organisation
not given to excessive
language:</div><a name="09022512000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposals amount to a fundamental attack on the independence and
transparency of the coronial system in England and
Wales&#148;.</div><a name="09022512000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
claims that the proposals
are</div><a name="09022512000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fundamentally
flawed; unsupported by evidence; disconnected from legal principles and
have come about without any consultation with
stakeholders.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022512000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, the
Secretary of State said that he was unhappy with some aspects of clause
11 and was ready to think about them again. When the Minister replies,
I hope that she will follow up those comments and outline for the
Committee how she will either withdraw or, at the very least, amend the
proposals.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000425"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I sense that, with some anticipation, we are
beginning to move towards the Minister&#146;s response. I rise mainly
to associate myself with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends, and
to give my summary and lay view about why they are important. My mind
goes back to an essay that I wrote at school some 50 years ago. That is
not because I often refer to the record about such matters, but because
I remember the comment that I received about it intensely. The essay
was in defence of free speech and, slightly to my surprise, my teacher
wrote, &#147;Rather strident in your defence of free
speech.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022512000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the whole,
that is a virtue in an MP, particularly one on the centre-right who
happens to be interested in human rights. Since I wrote that essay, I
have come to understand the constraints under which free speech
operates. By way of a pre-emptive strike, I have already suggested that
the Minister should not deploy the argument that only 1 or 2 per cent.
of inquests go to juries, and that only two extant cases are stalled
because they cannot be heard in the way that the clause is designed to
address. Equally&#151;I am sure that the Minister does not think
this, because she is a reasonable person&#151;the Conservative party
cannot be caricatured as not being interested in the issues adumbrated
in clause 11(2), namely national security, our relationships with other
countries, the prevention or detection of crime, witness safety
and</div><a name="09022512000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;real
harm to the public
interest&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">whatever
that means.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="09022512000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
critically important issues, and the question is therefore one of
balance and seeing how we can adjust the mix to produce an acceptable
outcome that serves the interests of openness and justice, which we all
share, while having regard to the other constraints. The default mode
should be justice and openness first and the requirement that an active
case is
made.</div><a name="09022512000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the period that I have been in Parliament, there has
been&#151;particularly under this Government, although not
exclusively&#151;a tendency to say that because we have a problem
with something, we need to legislate. We have started to do things
&#147;just in case&#148;, which is the wrong burden of
proof.</div>
<a name="09022512000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three points
concern me. The first is general confidence in the inquest system,
which is an important issue that I addressed when the Committee
considered legal aid. I make no criticism of the present Government,
but there is a widespread distrust of the establishment and a feeling
that the Executive will fix and conceal things in their own interests.
Wherever possible, that must be challenged by openness.</div>
<a name="09022512000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East will remember our
interesting exchanges about the remarks of the right hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) in the Council of
Europe, who was spot on when he said that if something goes wrong, it
is looked into through an open inquiry and that that is the right thing
to do. That is my starting point, and that of most members of the
Committee. If we want inquests to work, we must ensure that they are
open and assisted by a jury, where
appropriate.</div><a name="09022512000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be problems, and I will return to those in a minute. My second
point is that measures need to be article 2 compliant. As a member of
the Assembly of the Council of Europe, I am bound to think about such
matters. The record shows that Ministers and successive Home
Secretaries&#151;and now Justice Secretaries&#151;have legislated
and produced the kinds of argument that I anticipate that we will hear
today, before being shot down by our higher courts or, ultimately, in
Strasbourg. Sadly, that is a pattern that we should not be proud of,
and we should try to avoid it if we can, by anticipating it. It is a
very special thing, set out in the first substantive article of the
rights, that people have a right to life and that, if life has been
taken, there should be an open process of investigation, certainly when
life has been taken by the state.</div>
<a name="09022512000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then we come
to the third point&#151;what is going to happen? There are two ways
that things might work. First, we might have, as it were, the literal
process of judicial review; the Committee will forgive my rather
flat-footed way of putting that. However, that is simply about whether
or not the Secretary of State followed the process and considered the
relevant factors in reaching his conclusion. Any careful Secretary of
State ought to be able to make a case for that: they will have looked
at the relevant factors; their officials will have briefed them; and
they will have gone through a process. The issue is, of course, whether
or not they made a reasonable decision at the end of that process,
taking all the facts into account, and I hope that the general
prejudice&#151;the bias, if I may call it that&#151;is towards free
speech, as I have suggested.</div>
<a name="09022512000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
all that will happen, as these cases will only be politically
highly-charged ones, such as the de Menezes case or those that have
been cited by inquest, there will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>be a very strong pressure to go through the process. If all that process
does is to say, &#147;Well, the Secretary of State ticked all the
boxes and came to the conclusion that a section 11 investigation was
the appropriate one&#148;, it will not address the wider concerns of
people about justice or the integrity of the jury system. Of course, it
may also give rise to considerations about whether or not actions are
article 2 compliant as well, but it will not meet the
case.</div><a name="09022512000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other possibility, of course, is that judges will look behind the words
and say, &#147;We want to look at the meat of this and see whether or
not it was a reasonable and rational decision&#148;. The more they
widen that process, the more likely they are to overturn what a
Secretary of State may have done.</div>
<a name="09022512000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
most interesting remarks in the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for
North Wiltshire concerned incompetent redaction. He said that some
redactions&#151;of course, he did not say &#147;all
redactions&#148;&#151;are entirely inconsequential. Well, somebody
took a decision that those matters should be withheld from the public
view. That may have been a purely administrative decision and certainly
not, to use a phrase, a &#147;malign decision&#148;, but it was
unfortunate that those parts were not available, because they should be
made available, as much as it is reasonably possible to do
so.</div>
<a name="09022512000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we set up
the system like that, I fear that we will have real doubts about the
integrity of the inquest system and our compliance with article 2. We
may end up with a legal circus in which matters are always poised
between regular recourse to judicial review and, frankly, fairly
regular judicial reversal of the Secretary of State&#146;s decision
in any particular case. That is why what might be called judicial
pre-scrutiny or judicial certification appeals to me as a possible
answer to some of the dilemmas. The hon. Member for Stafford has
suggested an alternative model, where responsibility for certification
stays with the Secretary of State, who then feeds into the judicial
process. I can see tensions in that idea, but it is not
unworthy.</div><a name="09022512000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
some point, however, if a judge is empowered to do such work as a
result of the operation of this clause, they will need to carry out a
full battery of investigation into the other vehicles that are
available. We have public interest immunity certificates, witness
anonymity or screening and the possibility of a special advocate. There
are a number of things that can be done, which the lawyers on the
Committee will be more familiar with than
me.</div><a name="09022512000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a final point about whether or not, as the Secretary of State
suggested on Second Reading, there is something inherently different in
the inquisitorial coronial purpose. I suggested in an intervention on
the hon. Member for Stafford that perhaps it is not a unique case;
there are other circumstances across the judicial spectrum where that
is the case. However, I ask myself, and the Secretary of State needs to
ask himself, whether there is not a prudential judgment to be taken.
The last thing that I want is regular recourse to a situation in which
there is difficult evidence and inquests do not proceed or are
regularly stalled. Two inquests are stalled at the moment, perhaps not
indefinitely, but because some of the information is too sensitive for
the time being, However, they are not able to proceed, which is clearly
undesirable, and it is worth the Committee considering whether that
outcome is better than a procedure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>that threatens the integrity of the judicial and coronial systems by
saying that an inquest has to be held in an untypical way on the
certification of a Secretary of State&#151;a politician, however well
motivated and well intentioned&#151;based on some criteria that are
unduly
wide.</div><a name="09022512000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the point made by the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and
Sefton, East on real harm in the public interest. If we are not going
to secure open justice, for reasons that others have said and I am sure
the Minister will say, we need to tie this down to the smallest
derogation possible that is consistent with national security but
wherever possible enables inquests to be held in the conventional way.
In the end, that comes back to public reassurance with the system. I am
terribly worried that, because there are one or two hard cases, we may
end up with radical damage to the overall structure, which none of us
wants, because everyone in this room values the importance of free,
open and penetrating inquiry into circumstances of death, particularly
where the state is directly or indirectly
involved.</div><a name="09022512000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000426"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I agree wholeheartedly with a lot of what has been
said by many Opposition Members and I have no intention of repeating
their points. There is one specific point that I want to reinforce and
to focus on, which is that clause 11 has no balance in what the
Secretary of State is required to do in order to certify an
investigation. For the reason for that, let us look at what the clause
says. We have done that a number of times, but it is worth doing again.
The clause
states:</div><a name="09022512000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State
may&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09022512000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">if
he or she so
chooses&#151;</div><a name="09022512000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;certify
an investigation under this Part into a person&#146;s death if of the
opinion that...the investigation will concern or involve a matter
that should not be made public for any of the reasons set out in
subsection
(2)&#148;.</div><a name="09022512000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
subsection (2) there is a list of reasons for which it may be
appropriate to certify an
investigation&#151;</div><a name="09022512000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
order to protect the interests
of&#148;</div><a name="09022512000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">three
things.</div><a name="09022512000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East put it to my
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough during the course of
his speech that the real problem might be in subsection (2)(c), but I
am not so sure. I suspect that the real problem is in subsection
(2)(a). What worries me is that the Secretary of State has got to be
satisfied, or of the opinion,
that</div><a name="09022512000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
investigation will concern or involve a matter that should not be made
public for any of the
reasons&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
reasons
being</div><a name="09022512000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
order to protect the interests
of&#148;</div><a name="09022512000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
number of
things.</div><a name="09022512000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
already been observed, rightly, that it will almost always be in the
interests of national security not to reveal certain
information.</div><a name="09022512000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000427"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is the point not only that it may or may not be
always in the interests of national security, but that it may be
arguably in the interests of national security? Someone who wishes to
take a view because they are committed to secrecy will always be able
to produce a plausible case for saying so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div><a name="09022512000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000428"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My hon. Friend is right about that, but the
concern here is that it is always possible to argue that it is in the
interests of national security not to have particular information made
public. It is always possible to argue that, in the interests of a
relationship between the United Kingdom and another country,
information should be kept private. What the clause does not require
the Secretary of State to do, so far as I can see, is to balance that
concern against, for example, the interests of the public more
generally in openness, or the specific interests of the family in an
inquest in determining whether a piece of information should or should
not be kept private. That lack of balance concerns
me.</div><a name="09022512000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09022512000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000429"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Surely it is worse than that. All the Secretary
of State has to do is to hold an opinion. That opinion may, if it is
whimsical or based on an irrational foundation, be subjected to
judicial review, but it is how he couches the wording of the
certificate that will affect the policing of it under judicial review.
Simply to have an opinion that something, if made public, would be
contrary to the interests of national security leaves open a vague area
of issues that cannot be
investigated.</div><a name="09022512000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000430"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Given that judicial review has often been cited in
the debate as a safeguard that should reassure us about the operation
of the clause, my hon. and learned Friend is right to be concerned
about
it.</div><a name="09022512000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with the clause is that it does not require the Secretary of
State to balance the interests of privacy in the interests of national
security or, for example, the relationship between the United Kingdom
and another country against the broader interests of open justice or
the interests of family and other considerations. All that it requires
the Secretary of State to do is to come to the opinion. My hon. and
learned Friend is right to say that the Secretary of State should not
come to the opinion unreasonably, or it will be subject to judicial
review, but the clause requires him to take the view that the matter
should be kept
private.</div><a name="09022512000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry observed earlier, the only
safeguard in subsection (1)(b) is that</div>
<a name="09022512000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no other
measures would be adequate to prevent the matter being made
public&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
that it is necessary to keep the matter private in the overall
interests of justice, balancing all factors against each other. It
provides only that this particular mechanism is required to keep the
matter private. It deals not with the principle, but with the
procedure. My concern remains extraordinarily
substantial.</div><a name="09022512000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
members of the Committee have said that we do not need to worry too
much because, if the Secretary of State were to act unreasonably, the
action would be subject to judicial review. However, if a case of
judicial review were brought before the court, it would look at the
legislation and decide whether the Secretary of State had or had not
applied it reasonably and made a decision within the parameters of the
legislation in an unreasonable fashion. All the Secretary of State is
required to do under the clause is to reach the opinion that an
investigation will concern or involve a matter that should not be made
public for any of the reasons given. It does not require him to have
come to that conclusion and to have decided that it should nevertheless

<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>be kept private because the interests of all of those things that argue
for privacy outweigh the interests of justice more broadly. That is
missing from the clause and it is one of the reasons why it is
fundamentally objectionable.</div>
<a name="09022512000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister can reassure us about what the Government will do to
restrict the breadth of the clause more generally and say specifically
how judicial review will act as a proper safeguard on the actions of
the Secretary of State in such
matters.</div><a name="09022512000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000431"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman dismisses the role of
judicial review in a way that, on reflection, I hope that he will not
hold on to. The matter works in two ways. First, the possibility that
judicial review will be used will weigh on the mind of the Secretary of
State when he is making such a decision; moreover, all those who advise
him will say that the decision could be subject to judicial review so
he must think how he could defend his decision if that were the case.
Secondly, we must bear in mind that the process of judicial review
would never support a whimsical decision, as the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough put it. No serious judicial review process would
support a decision that could manifestly be shown to be
whimsical.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000432"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that a
whimsical decision or anything that could be categorised as
unreasonable would not survive a judicial review. I do not dismiss
judicial review; it is exceptionally important, but I am worried that
it would have only a limited impact given the wording of the clause. As
I understand it, judicial review will operate on the Secretary of
State&#146;s discretion under the wording of this Act, as the Bill
may become. The court would look at clause 11&#151;or section
11&#151;and ask, &#147;Has the Secretary of State reached a
conclusion within the parameters of this section that is
unreasonable?&#148; If he or she has done so, the court will say that
it should be changed. If he or she has not, the court will have to
conclude that there is nothing that can be done about
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000434"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I am spoiled for choice. I give way to the hon.
Member for Cambridge
first.</div><a name="09022512000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000435"></a>David
Howarth:</b><b class="B"> </b>If one looks at the Binyam Mohamed case,
which is the latest example of a judicial review involving national
security, the court simply does not go behind the certificate. It asks
itself whether there were any procedural faults, irrationality or
illegality. In a national security case, that is a very easy test for a
Secretary of State to meet. The only way to ensure that there is more
than that is to build into the statute the court&#146;s more specific
role in deciding whether the test has been
met.</div><a name="09022512000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000436"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Yes, I agree. That is important, but we must also
build into the statute some degree of balance in the Secretary of
State&#146;s consideration. It seems to me that that balance does not
exist.</div><a name="09022512000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000437"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend because he
has been bombarded with interventions. My point was provoked by the
intervention from the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton,
East. The court doing the judicial review does not change the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>decision. It simply tells the Minister to go away and go through the
process again. He may come up with the same erroneous or disagreeable
answer, but the judicial review court cannot change the decision; it
merely polices the process.</div>
<a name="09022512000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000438"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b><b class="B"> </b>My hon. and learned Friend reinforces the
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. It is right not to devalue
judicial review, but it is also right not to over estimate its value in
this context. We cannot rely on the judiciary to save us from the
operation of this clause. It is our job as legislators to ensure that
the clause is drafted properly and not to hope that the judges will
save us later if it is not. It seems to me that it is not drafted
properly because it does not require the Secretary of State to do what
we should expect him to do, which is to balance the arguments for
privacy in these circumstances against the wider issues of justice,
both for the family and for the public more broadly. That is what is
defective about this clause as it is currently drafted, and I hope that
the Minister will correct
it.</div><a name="09022512000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000439"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am sure that everyone in this Committee will
agree that this has been a very constructive, serious and sensitive
debate. I want to congratulate our <i class="I">Hansard </i>writer. A week or so
ago, <i class="I">The Observer </i>suggested that the only people paying any
attention to this debate were a couple of journalists. Nick Beech wrote
back saying, &#147;Never fear, Hansard&#146;s here.&#148; He said
that <i class="I">Hansard </i>will provide a clear and accurate transcript of
proceedings and that with the 24-hour media, it will provide it by the
following day. Therefore, in putting forward very serious and
deliberative ideas and propositions, hon. Members are safe in the
knowledge that they will be recorded
properly.</div><a name="09022512000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the course of this debate it has become clear that there are no easy
answers. No one has said, &#147;Here is a simple solution.
Let&#146;s do that, and it&#146;s all fine.&#148; I shall explain
what the clause is designed to do and then explore how we might be able
to progress and respond to some of the suggestions made by hon. Members
on both sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="09022512000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crux of the issue is that clause 11 addresses how we protect highly
sensitive material that is relevant to a coroner&#146;s investigation
but that cannot be made public. I think that most Opposition Members,
as well as Government Members, recognise that there is a problem and
that a solution is needed. As the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough said, the Opposition have approached the matter by using
parliamentary devices to get the matter aired more fully and in more
detail, and I accept the thinking behind that. It is right that when we
make proposals that would remove juries, there should be full and
rigorous testing of whether those proposals are acceptable and, if they
are, whether they will
work.</div><a name="09022512000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a number of occasions, hon. Members have mentioned the two cases that
my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East
and I have mentioned as being behind the proposals. I want to put it on
record that, in fact, we are now down to one of those two cases. In the
second case, referred to by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, the
coroner has decided that she can progress the inquest without needing
the sensitive material. It might be said that I am arguing against my
own position, but that shows that, through 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>detailed consideration, one of those cases can be dealt with under the
present arrangements, which is a good thing. However, it also
highlights the fact that it would be only very exceptional cases indeed
in which the proposals set out in clause 11 would ever need to be used.
I do not want to go any further into the detail of the cases mentioned,
because I do not want in any way to compromise the judicial
process.</div><a name="09022512000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000440"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> So that we are clear about the case that the
Minister has just mentioned, will she say whether that inquest has been
opened and adjourned and will now be resumed, or has it yet to
begin?</div><a name="09022512000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000441"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It has been opened and adjourned. As I
understand it&#151;I received this information only in the past 24
hours&#151;the coroner now feels that she can continue the inquest
without reference to the sensitive
material.</div><a name="09022512000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000442"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Given that answer, may I ask the Minister a
further question? When did it occur to the coroner that she had the
ability to resume the adjourned inquest on the basis that the hon. Lady
has outlined? There has been a long delay and I think that the public
are entitled to know what influenced the change in the coroner&#146;s
mind.</div><a name="09022512000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000443"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not have that information to hand. As soon
as I do, I will certainly share it with the Committee. I was given the
information only relatively recently. I accept what the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough says. Given that there was a very long
delay and the coroner was quite insistent that she could not continue
the inquest without reference to the sensitive
material&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> An answer may be coming.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>No, an answer was not forthcoming. There was a
long delay when that case first came to public attention. I will try to
get further information about what persuaded the coroner that it can
now go ahead. The inquest was adjourned only in November of last year.
Nevertheless, there was a long gap before it got to that
stage.</div><a name="09022512000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
<a name="09022512000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to say that this part of the Bill is about putting bereaved
families at the heart of the inquest system. As Opposition Members have
said on a number of occasions, it is important that we find some way of
enabling inquests to be held. Nothing can be more frustrating for a
bereaved family than for a case to be left in limbo, so it is important
that we find a way forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
said, no solution will ever be ideal in such situations, and that is
very much the perspective of bereaved families. If any of us lost a son
in the circumstances of the Azelle Rodney case, we would want the full
circumstances of the death to be set out in a way that allowed the
finder of fact to make a proper decision on all the facts.</div>
<a name="09022512000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have a duty to protect and consider the wider public
interest in protecting highly sensitive material, and that involves
difficult, knife-edge, balanced decisions. Let me say again to the
Committee that the Government will not remain wedded to a particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>solution, and certainly not to the arrangements set out in clause 11, if
we come across a solution that makes for a better balance&#151;to use
the words of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth&#151;that
ensures that highly sensitive material that cannot be put in the public
domain remains outwith the public domain and that gives members of the
bereaved family as much of the information as possible so that they can
feel that the coroner has dealt with whatever happened to their loved
one in as sensitive, appropriate and open a fashion as
possible.</div>
<a name="09022512000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
reflect carefully on all the suggestions of the hon. Members for
North-West Norfolk and for Cambridge, who lead for the Opposition
parties, but also on those of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford,
who came in with a third way&#151;I realise that &#147;third
way&#148; is no longer a politically popular phrase, but it is
nevertheless worth throwing into the pot now and again. My hon.
Friend&#146;s alternative solution gives some decision-making powers
to the Secretary of State and provides for some judicial reflection and
resolution.</div><a name="09022512000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to consider those alternatives in a little more detail, although
proposals might also come from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As
yet, we have not had its report on the Bill, but I know that its
Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr.
Dismore), has recently written to the Justice Secretary, and I hope
that we will be able to respond in the near future.</div>
<a name="09022512000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to the amendments. Most Opposition Members, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Stafford, have criticised the breadth of the criteria
relating to the way in which a certificate would be triggered,
particularly in subsection (2). The hon. Members for North-West Norfolk
and for Cambridge described the reference to the prevention
of</div>
<a name="09022512000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;real harm to
the public
interest&#148;</div><a name="09022512000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
a catch-all provision. It has also been said that we have widened the
criteria, compared with those in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. Let me put
the issue in context. In the Counter-Terrorism Bill, there were three
grounds for triggering the certificate: that the material could not be
made public</div>
<a name="09022512000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the
interests of national
security&#148;,</div><a name="09022512000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the interests of relations with another country
or</div><a name="09022512000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
in the public
interest.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accepted that the phrase &#147;otherwise in the public
interest&#148; was too broad, so we redrafted the provision, which
has become clause 11(2) in this Bill, in a genuine attempt to respond
to that criticism. The additional criteria of &#147;preventing or
detecting crime&#148; or
protecting</div><a name="09022512000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
safety of a witness or other
person&#148;</div><a name="09022512000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">were
intended to add specificity and therefore to narrow the otherwise broad
circumstance in which the certificate might be issued. We also tried to
place a bar by replacing the test that was based simply on the public
interest with one that could be invoked only to prevent real harm to
the public interest. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth thinks
that that is too wide as well. Clearly we have failed in our attempts
to narrow down the definition in response to the comments made in
relation to counter-terrorism
provisions.</div><a name="09022512000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000444"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My concern is not necessarily that the provision
is too wide. I am not sure whether it is or not. I am not sure whether
it is clear enough. It would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>be helpful if the Minister would explain what the word
&#147;real&#148; means in the context. Does it mean &#147;not
imaginary&#148;, or
&#147;substantial&#148;?</div>
<a name="09022512000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000445"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I would say that it meant substantial. I
recognise that there are still considerable concerns about the breadth
of the criteria.</div>
<a name="09022512000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000446"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There is another complication about the use of
the phrase in clause 11, which is that it is used again in clause 71,
when the Bill turns to the question of anonymous witnesses. When the
temporary legislation, the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act
2008, was going through Parliament, the Minister said that the phrase
meant something specifically to do with protecting undercover
operations. It does not make a lot of sense for the same phrase to
occur in the same Bill with different
meanings.</div><a name="09022512000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000447"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and I
assure him that we shall look further at the criteria set out in
subsection
(2).</div><a name="09022512000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also deal with another central question: who should be
responsible for certifying the investigation. Clause 11 provides that
it should be the Secretary of State, with the court
performing its familiar role of checking whether the decision is
flawed, according to the usual principles for an application for
judicial review. The Opposition want to transfer that responsibility to
the judiciary. I can see the merit in their arguments, but a question
needs to be considered. There are some significant difficulties in
transferring the responsibility, to which, for example, my hon. Friend
the Members for Stafford and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East referred. Whether national security is
a factor should really be the decision of the Executive. If Opposition
Members thought about it, they might find that the judiciary would not
be overly keen to make decisions about whether something had a national
security implication. We need to reflect on that as we try to reach a
sensible conclusion about clause 11.</div>
<a name="09022512000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022512000448"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): The Minister
puts her argument cogently and constructively, but does she not
recognise the points of my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire
that there would be a danger of Executive creep? In the first year,
there might well be two or three inquests in which the certification
process would be used; but there would be a temptation to use it more
and more. Everyone knows the pressures that Ministers are under. We
were thinking about perhaps taking that stage out of ministerial hands
and putting it into the hands of someone who would not be subjected to
that Executive and administrative
creep.</div><a name="09022512000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000449"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman puts his case very
reasonably. I have some sympathy with the view that Executive creep can
occasionally occur. That is why the suggestions of my hon. Friend the
Member for Stafford are worth considering in more detail. Some of them
might give the balance and distinction between when the Executive
should make a decision and when the judiciary can have oversight and
show how that decision should be reflected in
inquests.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="09022512000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000450"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The crucial point&#151;I tried to make this
point during an intervention on the hon. Member for Stafford&#151;is
the degree of oversight and the degree of deference held by the court
for the decision of the Executive. Under ordinary judicial review, the
court pays a great deal of deference to the Executive&#146;s view on
national security. Some of us feel that that is simply not enough, but
we are not calling for the court to decide on national security by
itself. We are calling for the Executive to apply to the court for an
order on the basis of national security, and for the court to be able
to go behind that certificate to some degree to ask the Secretary of
State on what basis the Secretary of State wants the court to make the
decision. Nevertheless, when that happens, the court will still
ultimately defer to the Executive&#146;s view of the facts of the
matter, because the court has no independent way of judging those
facts. It is about the balance between the two. It is not just about
one thing or the other.</div>

Prentice:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument perfectly. That is why we need to reflect further on how to
strike that balance, so that the interests of national
security&#151;which are, of course, crucial&#151;are
protected.</div><a name="09022512000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000452"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In light of the exchanges this morning, would the
Minister also consider that, as my hon. Friend the Member for North
Wiltshire said, there will be a security, international relations or
crime angle in virtually all such sensitive cases for a Secretary of
State to latch on to in order to make a decision for secrecy? My hon.
Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth implied that it could be a
judicial function to consider whether the Secretary of State is capable
of balancing those considerations against the wider interests of public
justice and openness. In an effort to seek that balance and prevent a
Secretary of State from just going down the track of saying,
&#147;There must be some security angle here,&#148; we are anxious
to build in further
safeguards.</div><a name="09022512000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000453"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying. I would just say two things to him. One is, of course, that
clause 11 is expected to be an exception rather than a rule. The other
is that even as we edge our way towards a balance between the Executive
and the judiciary, we should not forget the balance that comes from
proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive. That is built into the
system too.</div>
<a name="09022512000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
themselves have recognised the sensitivity involved in national
security. In the case of the Secretary of State for the Home Department
<i class="I">v.</i> Rehman, Lord Hoffmann said
that</div><a name="09022512000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
question of whether something is &#145;in the interests&#146; of
national security is not a question of law. It is a matter of judgment
and policy. Under the constitution of the United Kingdom and most other
countries, decisions as to whether something is or is not in the
interests of national security are not a matter for judicial decision.
They are entrusted to the
executive.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to say in a postscript written after the 9/11
attacks:</div><a name="09022512000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not only that the executive has access to special information and
expertise in these matters. It is also that such decisions, with
serious potential results for the community, require a legitimacy which
can be conferred only by entrusting them to persons responsible to the
community through the democratic process.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div><a name="09022512000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are powerful

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000454"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> To some extent, does that not answer the
point made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk about the
potential for Executive creep? In my experience, having been involved
both in Northern Ireland and, formerly, in the Home Office, in
decisions about individual cases&#151;as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth will have&#151;there are no
circumstances in which any Minister of whatever party would
rubber-stamp such decisions. My experience is that people take such
decisions carefully, taking all the advice possible. That being so, I
cannot see how Executive creep could possibly come into
it.</div><a name="09022512000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09022512000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000455"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My right hon. Friend makes a good point. It is
true. Given the particular sensitivity of these cases and their rarity,
it is highly unlikely, to the point of being unimaginable, that any
Secretary of State, regardless of party, would make a decision without
thinking carefully about all the consequences. We too need to think
carefully about shifting between the significant and respective roles
and responsibilities of the Executive and the
judiciary.</div><a name="09022512000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000456"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am sorry to jump the queue ahead of my hon.
Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. The de Menezes inquest was
conducted by a retired High Court judge, sitting as the coroner with a
jury. It is fair to guess that, during the course of that inquest, Sir
Michael Wright will have had to consider matters to do with national
security, the relationship between the United Kingdom and another
country and, no doubt, the prevention and detection of crime. It may
well be that&#151;if we know what it means&#151;he would have had
to consider other things that may have caused some real harm to the
public interest. As I said earlier, that seems a perfectly sensible way
of having open justice as well as some hold on the escape of highly
sensitive information into the public domain, contrary to the public
interest, or whatever it may be. Why do the Government not pause for a
bit and use the Sir Michael Wright coroner&#146;s inquest as a lesson
or template from which they can redraw clause 11, if they still think
it is
necessary?</div><a name="09022512000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000457"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am asking the Committee to pause for a bit and
look at the flaws in the amendments proposed, albeit with every good
intention, as well as the flaws highlighted in clause 11. Some
campaigners argued that the de Menezes inquest would have been held in
secret, had the Bill been in force. That is simply not true. It was
possible to use all the other operations and measures that are
available under clause 11(1)(b) to enable that inquest to go
ahead.</div><a name="09022512000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000458"></a>Jeremy

Government will reconsider all of this and return to it on Report. If
she is saying that, perhaps she can be clear about it, because I am
sure that all Committee members will welcome
that.</div><a name="09022512000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I return to some remarks that the Minister made a moment or two ago and
ask two questions? First, she mentioned parliamentary scrutiny as a
restriction on the activities or the decisions of the Secretary of
State 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>in this context. I am not sure, because of the nature of the material
that we are talking about, how that helps us. Perhaps she can outline
in a little more detail how she envisages parliamentary scrutiny
playing a part in the Secretary of State&#146;s exercise of
discretion under clause
11.</div><a name="09022512000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
in relation to the point that I was making earlier, I do not
dispute&#151;I doubt that any Conservative Member disputes
it&#151;that it is for the Secretary of State to make a determination
about what should or should not be kept private, in the interests of
protecting national security, for example. I am concerned that, at the
moment, all the Bill would require the Secretary of State to do is to
make that determination and decide whether it is in the interests of
national security or the relationship between the UK and another
country to keep a matter private. The Bill does not require the
Secretary of State to balance those interests against wider interests.
I hope that the Minister can comment on that
balance.</div><a name="09022512000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000459"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is correct. First, I shall ask the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk to withdraw his amendment, because I want
to reflect on the issue further&#151;today&#146;s debate highlights
the concerns clearly. I hope that that is helpful. We will come back on
Report with more detail, which I hope to be able to discuss with
Opposition Members between now and Report stage, so that we can reach a
positive and satisfactory conclusion. With all due respect to the
Committee, I felt that it was important that I set out in some detail
why we are where we are.</div>
<a name="09022512000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of balance, I accept the point that the hon. Member for Rugby
and Kenilworth makes, but it can also be argued that, although the
rights of the bereaved family have to be taken into account, the public
and national security interests may outweigh those rights. It is on
that point that we have to discover how we move
forward.</div><a name="09022512000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cambridge talked about the importance of having a jury
and drew a comparison with juries in criminal trials, but as has been
reflected in today&#146;s debate, that is not an exact comparison
because&#151;I will not repeat the argument in detail&#151;it is
possible in a criminal trial for the prosecution to drop the case if it
feels that it cannot protect the sensitive material, whereas that is
not the case here. He also talked about authorised jury checks. Those
can take place exceptionally with the permission of the Attorney
General, but the level of vetting in those cases is limited in some
ways&#151;more limited than full, developed vetting. In order to view
the type of sensitive material that might be relevant in the one case
that we are talking about, juries may have to be security-cleared to a
higher level; that is simply not feasible, and it may not be
appropriate.</div><a name="09022512000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000460"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I was anticipating the Minister&#146;s remark,
because I thought that she was trying to be helpful to us, but I am now
disappointed by her closing point. It is not clear why any person
cannot be security-vetted to a higher and appropriate standard. There
may be information they have to dig, but by the nature of the case, we
know that there are only a handful of cases that are likely to be
referred. Will she at least reflect on that
further?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="09022512000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000461"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will reflect on it. However, in the general
way of life, the idea that we go through a high level of vetting on
randomly selected juries just does not seem to be the most appropriate
way of approaching the subject. But I will certainly look at the case
in more detail.</div>
<a name="09022512000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
about public interest immunity certificates being the answer has
already been addressed, both on Second Reading and by my hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford. A jury cannot be expected to reach a
meaningful verdict if it cannot have access to all the
information&#151;my hon. Friend made that case again clearly. I know
that that argument has been made, but I, as a juror, would not be
satisfied if I were trying to make a finding of fact, and material was
being withheld because of its sensitivity. It is not feasible to
suggest that a jury could come to a proper finding of fact in that way.
Nevertheless, I reassure the Committee that all measures short of
certifying an investigation will be considered as a matter of course
and that the investigation would be certified if, and only if, no other
measures were adequate to protect the public interest at stake. The
clause requires the Secretary of State to go through such a
process.</div>
<a name="09022512000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">For most
cases involving sensitive materials, special measures of one kind or
another would almost certainly provide the answers, as the de Menezes
case showed. But it might be the case that that is not always possible.
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice has already
made clear that we expect the certification process to be invoked
rarely, and I reiterate that to the Committee.</div>
<a name="09022512000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
briefly to discuss military inquests, which the hon. Member for North
Wiltshire mentioned, and to put on record our thanks to the Wiltshire
and Oxfordshire coroners for their commendable work. It would be
appropriate at this stage for the Committee to send its condolences to
the families of the two young men killed while the hon. Gentleman was
in Afghanistan. Military inquests will not be subject to the clause
because they are already heard without
juries.</div><a name="09022512000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have listened carefully to the points made today and in our sitting on
10 February. I assure the Committee that I have registered the strong
desire to narrow the criteria against which a certificate may be issued
and to have a greater measure of judicial oversight. I will reflect
very carefully and, of course, we will come back to it on Report. In
the meantime, I ask the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk to withdraw
his amendment.</div>
<a name="09022512000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000462"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Before the Minister sits down, will she comment
on the Northern Ireland aspect and on amendment
125?</div><a name="09022512000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000463"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central suggested
that amendment 125 was an extension. There is no extension. The
provision reflects the issue raised before of protecting the names of
members of special forces and their families, and we will continue to
work the Ministry of Defence to do that. However, if a family does not
want their family member&#146;s name to be withheld, the coroner will
not make a direction to have it withheld. I hope that that gives some
reassurance.</div>
<a name="09022512000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the Bill
applies to Northern Ireland because the situation is the same there. I
would like to make it clear that there are no cases in Northern Ireland
in which it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>would be necessary to apply a clause 11 certification. I hope that that
will provide sufficient reassurance to the hon. Lady. The Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland has made very clear that the provisions will
not apply to investigations into the legacy cases. He knows from his
experience in Northern Ireland about the sensitivity of those cases, as
do I. The legacy cases will not be affected; nevertheless, highly
sensitive cases or material may come before an inquest in future, so
the provisions will be available in Northern Ireland as
well.</div><a name="09022512000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for my very lengthy response to the debate. I invite the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk to withdraw his amendment and ask members
of the Committee to agree, in the meantime at least, that clause 11
stand part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022512000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000464"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for what she has
said&#151;she has put her arguments in a constructive and
understanding way. The good news is that, having listened to what she
has said this morning, I will withdraw the amendment; the bad news is
that we cannot let the clause stand part of the Bill. I am confident
that, having won the argument and with the support of the hon. Member
for Moray and perhaps some Government Members, we will stop the clause
standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09022512000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a very good debate and I will not rehearse all the arguments
now, but I would like to thank my hon. and learned Friend the Member
for Harborough for his contribution. My hon. Friend the Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth, who as a Whip does not normally speak at length,
made some very telling points, as did my other hon. Friends and the two
Liberal Democrat Front
Benchers.</div><a name="09022512000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09022512000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
points have come out of the debate. One is about public confidence in
the coronial system. Originally, we heard that the problem was caused
by two inquests that had been adjourned sine die and were going nowhere
fast. We now hear that there is only one such inquest. I really feel
that to risk public confidence and trust in the entire system on the
basis of one inquest is to ask a great deal from the official
Opposition in terms of persuading us to support this particular
clause.</div>
<a name="09022512000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing that
in mind, the telling point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for
North Wiltshire when he said that there can be few examples of inquests
where there are more highly confidential, top secret documents and
information that has to be protected, yet we have a system in place
that works perfectly well&#151;one that covers virtually every single
eventuality. Despite what the Justice Secretary said about those two
inquests, we now hear that the current system can indeed cover and
protect the information involved in one of them, so that is 50 per
cent. of the problem solved, as I see
it.</div><a name="09022512000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned, and I think that this is quite telling, that
families are at the heart of the Bill, but there is no mention of
families in the clause, or of the wider interests. I take on board
entirely the spirit of good will and co-operation in which the Minister
asked us to withdraw the amendment&#151;we will accede to her
request&#151;but despite her remarks, we cannot vote to allow the
clause to stand part of the Bill. It will do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>untold damage to the coronial system and undermine public confidence.
Furthermore, what is so sad is that in a good, positive part of the
Bill, which can achieve a great deal, we have a clause that could undo
much of that good work. We will have to vote against clause stand
part.</div><a name="09022512000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000480"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Obviously, if clause 11 had been struck from
the Bill, clause 12 would not have been necessary. Will the Minister
explain when it might be appropriate under the clause for the chief
coroner to conduct the investigation in
person?</div>
<a name="09022512000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000481"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The chief coroner would have to do that only
very rarely. After consultation with the chief coroner, the Lord Chief
Justice would terminate the nomination of the person previously
appointed; someone else would then have to be appointed to carry out
the investigation instead. The chief coroner could get a senior coroner
from the relevant area or someone from a different geographical area to
conduct the investigation, or he could do the investigation himself or
ask the Lord Chief Justice to appoint a senior judge to conduct the
investigation, but I suggest that it would be a very rare
occurrence.</div><a name="09022512000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09022512000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000482"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Clause 13 allows intercept evidence to be used in
coroners&#146; courts, although only in certified cases. I welcome
the breakthrough that the clause represents in principle&#151;it is
the first time that intercept evidence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>has been made admissible in an English court. It would be helpful in
other debates, such as those on 42-day detention or control orders, if
intercept evidence were to be made admissible. The difficulties that
are said to exist before putting intercept evidence into court seem to
me to be greatly exaggerated. Other countries manage to do it, not
without some difficulties but effectively none the less. I think that
evidence from bugging is allowed, but intercept evidence is not. It is
slightly odd that civil liberties should be restricted to protect
evidence that the security services seem to have no intention of ever
using.</div>
<a name="09022512000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
vote on clause 11, I am concerned that clause 13 will link the
acceptability of intercept evidence with the absence of a jury.
Although I welcome the clause in principle, I want to put it on the
record that I do not accept that link. I will not be bound in any
future debates to accept the point that intercept evidence could be
used further only in the absence of a jury. That does not
follow.</div>

<a name="09022512000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000483"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Clause 14 covers the duty to suspend or resume
investigations. The key point relates to when criminal proceedings are
likely to be brought. We are looking at the old rules 26 and 27, and we
need to avoid any duplication.</div>
<a name="09022512000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at schedule 1, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. The senior coroner need not
suspend an investigation where the prosecuting authority or the
director of service prosecutions has no objection to the investigation
continuing, or where the senior coroner thinks that there is an
exceptional reason for not doing so. That puzzled me a little, and I
would be grateful if the Minister could provide some examples. I could
not think of any obvious ones. Perhaps she could put the
Committee&#146;s mind at rest and give some clear examples.
</div><a name="09022512000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000484"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> One example
is&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> My notes actually say: as an
example, the police would carry out an investigation, taking statements
and analysing evidence in the immediate aftermath of a death where
criminality is suspected. The coroner would have a role only as
custodian of the body. Once his or her responsibilities in that respect
are completed, it would be a waste of resources for the coroner to
conduct a parallel investigation taking the same statements. It is
right that the criminal case should take precedence. The
coroner&#146;s proceedings are an inquest or inquiry into the
establishment of fact, rather than the trial of a particular
individual. Perhaps it would be helpful of me to add that the coroner
must suspend an investigation if required to do so by the Lord
Chancellor on the grounds that the death is likely to be adequately
investigated by an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000485"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I beg to move amendment 118, in
schedule 1, page 118, line 21, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;and must be resumed if there is
any likelihood that not resuming it might breach any Convention rights
(within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c.
42)).&#146;.</div><a name="09022512000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
118 relates specifically to article 2 deaths with human rights
implications. The schedule deals with inquests suspended for various
reasons, and with the resumption of that inquest after, for example,
criminal charges have been looked into. The amendment would insert a
requirement that an inquest should always be resumed after a suspension
if there is any chance that not doing so would breach the Human Rights
Act 1998.</div>
<a name="09022512000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
paragraph 7(1) of schedule 1, a suspended investigation</div>
<a name="09022512000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may not be
resumed unless...the senior coroner thinks that there is
sufficient reason for resuming
it.&#148;</div><a name="09022512000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes give an example of one possible reason: if a criminal
investigation does not find all the facts that the senior coroner
thought needed to be found, because it is an article 2 death. It is
welcome that the explanatory notes recognise that the state might have
enduring article 2 obligations following on from a suspended inquest
and criminal investigation.</div>
<a name="09022512000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern
has been raised, however, by bodies outside this House, that it is
questionable whether a criminal prosecution could effectively satisfy
article 2 requirements, given that the obligations of a criminal
investigation are completely different from those of an article 2
investigation. Although the explanatory notes recognise that the state
might well have enduring article 2 obligations, the
amendment would provide for the automatic, rebuttable presumption that,
where such obligations arise, the inquest will be resumed. As the Bill
is drafted, the inquest will not be resumed, unless the coroner thinks
otherwise. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div><a name="09022512000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000486"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Even under the current system, it is clear that
article 2 places considerable responsibilities and demands on coroners,
who are very aware that they must resume an inquest if the criminal
proceedings have not established details of the broad circumstances
surrounding the death. The most obvious example of such a case would be
where a defendant pleads guilty early on in proceedings, which would
establish only the outline, rather than the broader circumstances
surrounding the death. In such a case, a coroner would be obliged to
resume the inquest. The amendment making the resumption compulsory does
not take into account the fact that, under section 6 of the Human
Rights Act, it would be unlawful of the coroner, as a public authority,
to act in any way incompatible with someone&#146;s convention rights.
Under section 6, the coroner is already under an obligation to resume
the investigation in the way that the hon. Lady desires, so I think
that her amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="09022512000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022512000487"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments.
However, despite the general obligation on coroners, under section 6 of
the Human Rights Act, to act in a certain way regarding narrative
verdicts on article 2 deaths, earlier clauses in the Bill recognise
that sometimes it is necessary to make it clear that those obligations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>remain. It strikes me that in the matter before us it would be sensible
to make it extremely clear that the presumption is to resume the
inquest. However, at this point, I do not wish to press the matter any
