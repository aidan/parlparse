<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 41, line 28, leave out from ‘if’ to ‘is’ in line 29 and insert <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘a judge of the High Court’. <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 190, in page 41, line 28, leave out from ‘court’ to end of line. <P>
No. 191, in page 41, line 30, at end add <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘and where a court makes such a grant of bail it shall state in open court what the exceptional circumstances are’. <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This interesting and important clause proposes a change to the law of bail. It amends section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 regarding the law of bail for people convicted of certain offences. As a general proposition, defendants are entitled to bail unless there are reasons why it should not be granted. For example, the court might think, that defendants would be likely to commit further offences, or would fail to surrender to custody, or would interfere with witnesses. Defendants have a right to bail, unless the court thinks that such matters will occur. <P>
There is a bar to bail, however, for defendants charged with, or convicted of, an offence of homicide or rape. Section 25 of the 1994 Act provided that such defendants could not be granted bail if they had a previous conviction for homicide or rape. Clause 53 removes that bar to bail from those defendants. It provides that a court or a police officer considering their case may grant bail, if the circumstances justify it. <P>
When I first read the clause, I wondered why the Government wanted to remove the bar to bail for defendants with previous convictions for such serious offences. I am sure that that was also the reaction of many other people. Why was the removal of the bar such a priority that it was included in this flagship Bill on law and order? How will this assist in the fight against crime, and how will it fulfil the Government’s proud boast that they would be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime? I suspect that many of my constituents, and those of other hon. Members, would not immediately see that the clause was tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. <P>
Conservative Members believe that these matters are potentially of the utmost seriousness. We seek a full debate on the implications of the change, the risk that it creates and the reasons for it. We look forward to the Minister’s comments. <P>
The amendments would introduce safeguards to protect the public from the Government’s course of action. Amendment No. 189 would require decisions about bail in cases of these very serious offences to be taken only by a High Court judge. Amendment No. 190 would prevent a police officer from making such a decision on his or her own. Amendment No. 191 would require any court, which granted bail for a serious case, to state in open court what the exceptional circumstances were that allowed bail to be granted. <P>
As I have said, Conservative Members are puzzled about the Government’s reasons for including the clause. Will the Minister tell the Committee what consultations the Government have carried out about this proposed change in the law? Have they consulted any victims’ organisations? We believe that a vast majority of the public would say that the best possible safeguards should be included in the clause if the Government are determined to have their way with clause 53. We agree. <P>
I turn to amendment No. 189. I mean no disrespect to the lay magistracy or to Crown court recorders or judges—I have to be very careful as I say that [Interruption.] <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind Committee members that they should not have private conversations. Those who wish to engage in such conversations should leave the Room. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall repeat my point, as we are debating important matters. I mean no respect to the lay magistracy or to Crown court recorders or judges by saying that decisions of such importance should be taken only by a High Court judge. <P>
High Court cases are ranked according to seriousness. Homicide or rape are regarded by the courts as class 1 offences and can be tried only by judges of High Court rank. I believe I am right in saying that—I am sure that I will be corrected if I am wrong. Given that High Court judges preside over such trials, we think that it is appropriate for them to take decisions on bail as well. <P>
In tabling amendment No. 190, I mean no disrespect to police officers, whatever their rank. We think that in such important cases it cannot be left to police officers—however high-ranking they may be—to take decisions on bail. <P>
We believe that there are good reasons for the Minister to accept the amendment. However, if he rejects it, I would be grateful if he would say whether officers taking decisions on bail in such serious cases will be of higher rank than would be the case with other types of offence. Will very serious cases be dealt with on the same basis as offences of lesser seriousness? <P>
Amendment No. 191 would require courts to spell out the exceptional circumstances which might justify the granting of bail. Will the Minister assist the Committee by saying what those exceptional circumstances are? We cannot think of any such circumstances, but we shall discuss that in a future debate. The Government are determined to steamroller the clause through, but we think that they should do us the justice of incorporating the best possible safeguards into it. <P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison).  <P>
I wish to express the view that the Government are wrong to make any changes at all. I agree with my hon. Friend that victims are the most important people in the serious cases that we are discussing. It is essential that the feelings of victims and their families are taken into account fully. <P>
I believe that the changes that the Government have put forward are misconceived. I cannot think of any cases in which members of the public feel that bail should be more readily granted. In extremely serious cases, particularly those in which the defendant has previously been convicted of serious offices, we should be aware that there is no support for the easier granting of bail.  <P>
I accept my hon. Friend’s statement that bail should be granted only on the decision of a High Court judge. However, I am not sure that a High Court judge should have such powers. I see no justification for changing the current position. It amounts to a relaxation of the law and victims and their organisations will be appalled when they are made aware that the Government are intending, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, to steamroller the clause through the House of Commons. We are dealing with serious matters and the Government are unwise to relax the law relating to them. <P>
Huge headlines in the press are the result of further offences being committed by people who have been let out of goal on bail. Few matters cause greater outrage—among members of the public as well as journalists—than even more serious offences being committed by those who have already been convicted. Nothing could be more serious than the relaxation of the Government’s concern about this matter. <P>
I hope the Government will think again about the clause. If not, they may run into a storm of protest about their misconceived proposals. I hope that a full clause stand part debate will induced the Government to reconsider. <P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I shall express some concerns about the proposals and add some qualified support to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. When I first read the clause my immediate reaction was to ask why it was being proposed. I could think of no reasons—I hope that the Minister will be able to think of some—to justify it. If the clause passes into law there will be disquiet among the public and the police. At present the police are used to there being a prohibition on bail for homicide and rape cases. In view of the attendant risks, why change that? <P>
We have all heard stories over the past few years—I wonder whether the Minister has done any research on the subject—of convicted rapists managing to obtain bail and subsequently committing further offences. Such stories may be unusual; if the Minister has any statistical evidence, I should be glad to hear it. I echo my hon. Friend the Minister for Hertsmere because the libertarian in me acknowledges that defendants should generally be entitled to bail. I intend to listen to the arguments during what I hope will be a full debate. I shall listen to the views of the Government Back Benchers if they contribute to it. Many of them and, indeed, my  hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) may have something to say: I always respect my hon. Friend’s views and I would be pleased to hear them. <P>
As a general rule, I am duty bound to begin with the defendant’s right to bail. Magistrates, stipendiaries, assistant recorders, recorders and judges all take the issue seriously. The general right to bail is at the forefront of their minds. If bail is refused in a particular case, it has to be said in open court why and under which section of the Bail Act 1976 it has been refused. <P>
<H5>10.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend has said about the circumstances he has to take account of when he considers an application for bail. He accepts that, on occasions, there may be special reasons for refusing bail. However, does he agree that the public and the victims of crime wonder whether there should be such a general right to bail? The popular press makes it clear that the public have grave concerns over whether such a right should exist. <P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend puts his finger fairly and squarely on the alternative point of view. With his experience, he knows that whenever a defendant is released on bail and commits an offence the public are particularly aggrieved. <P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O’Brien):</B> I hate to intrude on private grief. However, does the hon. Gentleman with the hon. member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) think that the best way to gauge the mood of one’s constituents is by reading the popular newspapers? <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend refers to an alternative point of view that is put forward by the groups that represent victims. He has a noble record of paying attention to victim support groups, and I know that from my previous experience. We know that the views of victims’ groups should be taken very much into account. In referring to the popular press, the Minister slightly missed the point that my hon. Friend was making, which was that the views of victims are most important. <P>
A judge must give reasons for refusing bail. He must consider whether the offender will reoffend or is likely to fail to surrender, which is always an interesting question. One must examine an offender’s history to ascertain whether he has failed to surrender on previous occasions. One must also consider whether the offender will interfere with witnesses. Such factors come into play and demonstrate how difficult it is to come to the right decisions on bail applications. <P>
I support the general presumption on bail and what my hon. Friend the Member for Hartsmere said. The clause will remove the previous bar and permit bail if the court or the constable considering the grant of bail is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that justify such action. I shall listen to the arguments, but I believe that homicide and rape are especially grevious offences. That is why I have supported, and will continue to support, the Opposition Front Bench position and previous measures introduced by the Conservative Government to prohibit bail for such crimes. <P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is right to suggest that it is not appropriate for a constable to grant bail. The normal practice in a police station is for the custody sergeant to consider the matter. As I understand it, the clause will permit a constable to consider the grant of bail, but when dealing with offences of such gravity—my hon. Friends and I will be united on this point—it is wrong for the decision to be taken by a constable alone. If the Minister wants to press ahead with the clause, what assurance will he give us that the decision will not be taken by someone below the senior ranks of chief superintendent or commander? My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere made that point with much force. <P>
My hon. Friend has also tabled an amendment about a judge of the High Court. I want to add to his comments because I would also like a judge of the Crown court to be able to consider the matter. <P>
The offences of homicides and rape are extremely serious and are often tried by High Court judges on circuit. The normal procedure is for the High Court judge to travel round the country on circuit, and he or she will often try the most difficult cases. It is not uncommon however, for the High Court judge trying such cases to have little or no criminal experience and to have been a civil practitioner. Although the High Court judge is obviously a man or woman of supreme ability in the law, it does not follow necessarily that he or she has had wide criminal experience. Such experience would be important when making such a judgment. <P>
I wondered about Crown court judges. I know that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but it is my understanding that certain Crown court judges have a licence to try homicide and rape cases. Indeed, if one travelled to Reading Crown court, one would see one of the most experienced and able Crown court judges—His Hon Judge John Murchie. He tries such cases and is hugely experienced. I am not parting company with my hon. Friend—I would never do that—but, in addition to the High Court judge, it would be entirely proper to include a Crown court judge. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that I can make our co-existence even happier than it has been hitherto by saying that there is great force in what my hon. Friend has said. <P>
<B> Mr. Malins:</B> I am delighted. <P>
I do not know whether I would go further and say that such matters could be suitably considered by recorders or stipendiaries because it is strange and difficult territory. The principle is such that if bail is to be considered in extremely serious cases, it must be considered by somebody of the most expert background and of the upmost seniority. <P>
All Committee Members have a duty to study the clause and to question what we mean by “the court”. Will lay magistrates, assistant recorders or recorders consider the case? Where do we draw the line? Should not we draw it higher? It is important to recognise that the matter is not properly decided by a constable. Therefore, if the clause is included—frankly, I am not keen on its inclusion at all—with the message that it sends to and the reaction that it will rightly produce in the community, it needs to be amended according to the spirit of the comments of  my hon. Friend and Member for Hertsmere. We need to toughen it up. <P>
My hon. Friend has argued the importance of amendments Nos. 189, 190 and 191 with considerable force. I hope that the Minister will get an opportunity this morning to respond fully to the questions that we have posed, in the spirit of a good debate. <P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): I shall add briefly to the comments made by my hon. Friends, with which I entirely agree. There is much in the Bill that Opposition Members agree with because it is designed to improve our criminal justice system. Sometimes, when we study the detail, we agree with the Government’s intention, but question the method.  However, the clause does not fit into that category and I cannot understand why it is in the Bill. Therefore, I support the amendments, which would at least make the clause more rational. <P>
The Government have insisted that they want to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, so it is hard to understand why they intend to implement clause 53. It would make the committing of crime easier by allowing people who had previously been convicted of crimes of absolute severity, such as homicide and rape, which we all abhor, not to be automatically denied bail if again charged with such a crime. <P>
It seems to me that the clause concerns only people who, having previously been convicted of serious offences, would have served long prison sentences. The Minister looks puzzled, but perhaps he will confirm my understanding. If it is correct, a doubt arises as to why such a person should be free and on the streets, allegedly having committed another crime similar to the first. We all hope that the Government intend to protect the public at all times, but the circumstances I have outlined would suggest the absence of the necessary protection. <P>
It is to be hoped that the Government intend to balance the freedom of an individual accused of a crime against the freedom of society to operate without fear of crime. That applies especially to the young, weak or old, who should be able to go about their daily lives knowing that they are not likely to be accosted by someone with criminal intentions. The clause would alter the balance for the worse. <P>
I agree that the freedom of the individual not to be imprisoned if he or she has not been convicted of a crime should be protected. Often bail should be granted to people who have been charged but not tried. However, how can the balance of presumption, in the case of people who have shown themselves to be a danger to society, be that they should be allowed to be free except in exceptional circumstances? I do not see how the balance between the individual’s freedom and society’s freedom to live without crime is improved by that.  <P>
Perhaps the Minister has an explanation to answer my questions and persuade me that the clause would improve the balance of freedoms. However, at present I am not convinced, and the amendments to which my hon. Friends have eloquently spoken would go some way to improving the clause. <P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> Opposition Members have spoken as if the clause would create an entirely new situation.  However, during 14 years of the previous Conservative Administration, custody sergeants and magistrates were able to grant bail in the cases outlined in the clause. During that period, there were never any cases in which it was believed that the powers were wrongly used by the police and magistrates. <P>
The previous Government changed the law; they took a view on the law and there was considerable parliamentary debate when they proposed the changes. One of the key arguments against removing the powers from the police and magistrates was that there had never been any cases in which the powers had been abused. <P>
The Government intend that the powers should be used only in the most exceptional circumstances. Let me offer an example from the top of my head—not a case that has actually occurred—about a case in which a doctor had been convicted of a homicide arising from euthanasia. The conviction would probably have been for manslaughter and he would have received a sentence, although not a substantial one. <P>
The doctor then falls under suspicion for a similar offence. He is not regarded as a threat to the general community and it would be easy to impose a bail condition that he should not practice as a doctor. There would, therefore, be no chance that he would reoffend. He had not absconded during the previous case, and has good links with the community, so there is no prospect of him absconding during the second case. In such circumstances, there might be a debate about bail. It would be a matter for the courts to decide whether bail was appropriate. <P>
Hon. Members might argue that it would be better to consider such cases at a higher level than I have suggested. However, the Government are of the view that the laws worked properly in the past. We have built safeguards into the clause, so that the courts are able to consider all the circumstances. However, in very exceptional circumstances—I must stress that they would be exceptional, as I cannot think of any real cases similar to the one that I have just described—it might be appropriate to grant bail. <P>
The Government do not think that it is necessary to remove the right to grant bail in the type of case that I have outlined. It cannot be right to fetter discretion in that way. It is always possible, although most likely, that in exceptional circumstances it would be appropriate for a person to be released on bail. <P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am following the Minister’s argument carefully, but I do not accept it. Even if he is right and there were such exceptional cases as the one that he described, what is the difficulty about giving the power to grant bail only to a person with the status of a Crown court judge? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I might reverse the question. For a period of 14 years during the previous Conservative Government, it was accepted that we could trust the police and the magistracy to deal with such cases, at the level of seriousness expected by the public. It now seems that the hon. Gentleman believes that, despite having been trusted for all that time, the magistracy and the police can no longer be trusted in future, and we do not accept that. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Would the Minister not recognise that throughout that period, many of us within and outside Parliament were expressing grave concerns about bail being granted too easily—particularly to those who had already been convicted of serious offences. The previous Government changed the law in response to that concern. <P>
The Minister sought to poke fun at my reference to the popular press, though my hon. Friend the Minister for Woking (Mr. Malins) was kind enough to refer to my previous work with victim support groups. Will the Minister not recognise the genuine concern about the problem, which the press only reflected? The previous Government changed the law in order to tighten up on bail as a result of some scandalous and serious cases. Surely the Minister would accept that. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman provide me with an example—any example—of a case in which the magistracy or the police behaved improperly? <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not suggest that they behaved improperly but I can provide the Minister with examples—if I can think of any this morning I will mentioned them straight away; if not, I shall write to him—of several cases that caused huge public concern, in which people already convicted of a serious offence were released on bail only to commit even more serious offences. There were many such cases and several were mentioned on Second Reading. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I accept that there was public disquiet about certain cases, and I would have shared it. However, we are dealing with specific circumstances. For serious offences of repeat homicides or rapes, rather than restore the presumption of bail that applies to all other defendants, we have reversed that presumption. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath delivered his point in a knockabout way, but he is making a serious point so let me deal with it seriously. We have reversed the burden of proof for bail in these cases. <P>
In the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, by and large people would have had a right to bail so the cases would have been considered differently. However, we are saying that in certain cases of homicide and rape, people will not be granted bail unless they satisfy the police or the courts that their circumstances are exceptional. We do not envisage that that new burden on the defence will be overcome easily in most cases. However, ruling out the possibility of granting bail would be unjust. <P>
We appreciate the intention behind the amendments, which seek to impose additional restrictions on the granting of bail to a person charged with or convicted of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or attempted rape when the person has a previous conviction for one of those offences. However, we cannot accept them because they add nothing useful to the clause as it stands. The granting of bail in those circumstances would, I repeat, be the absolute exception. That is already provided for. <P>
The amendments would transfer the decision on whether to grant bail from the court conducting the proceedings to a High Court judge. They would also revert the process to the absolute prohibition on granting bail in the case of police bail. The decision whether to grant bail will be difficult. It will be based on a wide range of factors, which should help to determine whether the person is a good bail risk. Magistrates have to make such decisions every day. <P>
Experience in making such decisions and timely and accurate information about the case are probably the two most important factors in reaching the right remand decision. I see no reason to remove the responsibility for making the decision to the High Court. There is already a statutory safeguard to protect against a potentially risky decision being taken in these serious circumstances. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hear what the Minister is saying about the High Court. However, will he respond to the point made by hon. Friend the Member for Woking? Should the decision be taken by a judge or recorder of the Crown court or by magistrates and police officers? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The decision will be taken at the appropriate level, if the matter is appealed to the Crown court. It might come before a High Court judge because of judicial review. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are many circumstances in criminal cases when bail is heard at different levels—by the police officer, by the magistrate, by the Crown court or by the divisional court, for example. There are various stages at which such decisions may have to be considered. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> It is rather odd that, in a murder case, the possibility of bail is first considered by the constable, not by anybody senior. If the constable agrees to give bail, the defendant will be granted bail. The initial decision will not be made by a High Court judge or anybody senior. When one is arrested, taken in or charged, is not it possible that the constable is the first person to consider bail? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> It is a matter for the custody officer, who is a sergeant or acting sergeant, who will consider bail in such circumstances. He will have a statutory duty, which the custody sergeant has had for many years under the previous Administration. In all such cases, custody sergeants discharged their duties in a way that did not give rise to public concern. <P>
I was dealing with the further safeguard, which is an important safeguard because hon. Members have raised serious issues, which I want to address. By virtue of the Bail (Amendment) Act 1993, the prosecution may appeal to a judge of the Crown court against any decision made by a magistrates’ court to grant bail to a defendant charged with any offence punishable by a term of five years’ imprisonment or  more. In such cases, the defendant is kept in custody until the matter is resolved. If the prosecution objects, it has such a recourse. <P>
Under section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, as amended by clause 53, the defendant must show that there are exceptional circumstances. We expect the prosecution to respond to the defendant’s representations where appropriate, and to take advantage of the provisions of the Bail (Amendment) Act in any case where its objections to release on bail have not been adequately addressed. Above all, in such special cases, it must be appreciated that we are reversing the presumption of bail. Where section 25 applies, there is a heavy burden on the defendant to satisfy the court that,  despite his previous conviction for a similar serious offence, his particular circumstances justify his release. We would not expect this hurdle to be overcome in anything but the most exceptional cases. <P>
As to reverting to the ban on granting police bail, there has never been a situation in which any person has suggested that the police have abused their powers by reason of having such rights. Amendment No. 191 is unnecessary because of the existing safeguard to that effect in paragraph 9(a) of schedule 1 of the Bail Act 1976. That states that if a court, after hearing representations that bail should not be granted, nevertheless decides to grant bail to a defendant charged with murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or attempted rape, it must state and formally record its reasons for doing so. <P>
There is a question mark over the current construction of section 25 in relation to the European convention on human rights. The provision, as it stands, fetters judicial discretion when making bail decisions. There are two ECHR cases that are currently sub judice and have been declared admissible by the Commission. As they are sub judice, I shall make no further reference to them, but they make this amendment to section 25 essential. I simply ask the hon. Gentleman  to discuss the matters with those of his colleagues who were members of the previous Government. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. If the Minister is trying to suggest that we cannot debate any matter that we like in discussing an amendment in the House of Commons, we need to hear further and better particulars. I have been careful in my comments. If the Minister is trying to shut us up in any way, we shall not be shut up. <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We cannot discuss matters that are sub judice. I presume that that is what the Minister is saying. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. I may have misheard the Minister, in which case I am sure that he will forgive me and I must be put right. I understood him to say that clause 53 is an essential alteration  to the law because of the requirements of an external court. However, it is strange that we have had no notice, either in confidence or in public, of such a proposition. It is a rum state of affairs for members of the  Committee to be told something without being given the full background, albeit confidentially. <P>
<H5>11.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. I make no comments about what members of the Committee may say. That is a matter for you, Mrs. Michie. The hon. Gentleman worries too much. I do not seek to shut him up; I would do no such thing. He can say what he pleases. The rules of sub  judice are a matter for the Chair. <P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The sub judice rules are very clear. The Minister may wish to proceed. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I simply say to the hon. Member for Woking that I  have not sought to argue that the only reason for making the change relates to the European convention. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman discusses the matter with the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who was a member of the previous Government before the general election. I suspect that he will find that the previous Government would have found themselves in exactly the same situation and I am certain that they would have provided the same reasons for making the change. <P>
Our main concern, which was expressed when we were in opposition, is to enable the interest of justice to be best served in each case. I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw the amendment. They can then decide whether they wish to return to it at a later stage. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I have listened carefully to the debate, and I am sorry that there were not more contributions from around the Committee. Conservative Members would have welcomed them. <P>
As I understand it, the Government originally introduced clause 53 on the basis that the previous law was wrong in principle and that they wanted to change it. They thought it perfectly proper for courts and police constables to be able to grant bail in certain circumstances. I disagree with that view, but I understand and respect it as an argument. <P>
I hope that I have not utterly missed the point, but the Minister appears to have said in rather guarded and brief terms that clause 53 is necessary and that it was brought upon us by external forces and by current discussions at the European Court of Human Rights. It would be outrageous for external forces to oblige the Committee to change our criminal law. <P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): My understanding was that the Minister said that we are not yet under an obligation to change the law, but that we are pre-empting a decision of the European Court of Human Rights. We are making the change now rather than amending the law later as we had to in the Chahal case. That is an interesting explanation. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Indeed. Is the Minister saying that his purpose in introducing the clause is to pre-empt a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, or is he introducing it because he believes in it in principle? It must be one of the two. It seems outrageous that we, elected Members of the House responsible for passing the laws of the land, should be in this position. Do not let us forget that this is a matter of domestic criminal law—not external trade law or tariffs, but what happens in the streets of our towns and cities. It is utterly domestic law. The matter needs to be raised on another occasion and in another place. <P>
The Government seem to be arguing that the clause is necessary not because they believe in it in principle, but to pre-empt what will be forced on us from outside before long. If that is so, it is a sorry state of affairs, and all Committee members should regard this morning’s sitting so far as a waste of time. If we could never have done anything about the provision, what was the point of a debate? <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to reply to some of the Minister’s remarks. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Woking that, in the light of what the Minister said, we are dealing with something more fundamental than we have come across so far in this Committee. Conservative Members have for a long time been worried about the prospect of a British Government telling hon. Members, “Whatever you say is irrelevant; we shall be told what to do by Europe anyway.” Our constituents are worried about that too. What will happen when Labour members of the Committee are held to account by their electorates, to whom they will explain, “When I went to the House of Commons I was told by Ministers that I could not say anything on the issue, because the the European Court of Human Rights would in a short while tell us what to do, and we had no room for manoeuvre”? <P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): Does the hon. Gentleman know that under every Conservative Government since 1951, judgments of the European Court of Human Rights have been binding in international law in any event? <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Of course I am aware of that. I am glad that we have finally provoked a Labour Member other than the Minister to contribute. However, this is the first time in my six years in Parliament that I have heard a Minister say that it does not matter what is said in a Parliamentary Committee about domestic criminal law, because the European Court of Human Rights is about to decide against us. <P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not mean to mislead the Committee. I did not say what he just told the Committee I said. Please will he be precise. If he has views, he should express them for himself, but he should not attribute to me words that I did not say. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> No doubt the Minister will explain on clause stand part precisely what he meant. My hon. Friend the Minister for Woking and I are very concerned about the implications of his remarks. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I have listened to what has been said, and have looked through the notes on clauses. This morning I looked at the notes on this clause for a suggestion of what was expected. However, there was nothing like that. Why have we been kept in the dark? <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. In such a fundamental matter, if the notes on clauses were to be helpful to the Committee, some advance warning should have been given that the views of the European Court of Human Rights would be a major part of the Minister’s response. <P>
Labour Members will have to explain the proposals to their constituents and tell them that they will make it easier for people who have already been convicted of extremely serious offences to be released on bail when charged with a further such serious offence. When, if the clause is passed, another Winston Silcott case arises, Labour Members will not feel comfortable with their consciences, knowing that they made it so much easier for people who had already been convicted of a serious offence of homicide or rape to be given bail on a second charge. <P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am worried about the comments made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I do not think that anyone in the House would support the idea that we should make it easy for rapist or those who have committed homicide to be freed on bail. The debate about principles and human rights in our criminal legislation is not about releasing people on bail. It is about whether the law allows for exceptional circumstances that may occur within a human rights framework. I am interested in the view that such decisions are mandated to us from Europe, because the Human Rights Bill is being debated on the floor of the House this week. That Bill will bring similar provisions into British law. <P>
We are keen to ensure that British law conforms to the convention to which we have been signed up for many years and to the human rights legislation that will be incorporated into our domestic law. The human rights framework contains no suggestion that one should be soft on rapists or individuals who have committed homicide. We would not support measures that might lead to the large-scale release on bail of rapists or murderers. <P>
I remain anxious, however, because I cannot envisage practical circumstances in which a person who has committed rape and who is accused of the offence for a second time would require bail. The operation of the measure must be extremely sensitive in cases in which exceptional circumstances are proven. I hope that the test set by constables, magistrates or those in the Crown court or the High Court will be extremely high, especially in rape cases where there are significant extenuating circumstances.  <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying about exceptional circumstances. However, does he accept that the Government are proposing to make a change in the law that will remove an absolute bar on bail for those who have committed serious offences and are charged with them again? The Bill makes provision for defendants in some of those cases to be granted bail. That will be perceived by the public and by commentators on our proceedings as a weakening of public protection. <P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s anxiety. That is why it is important that we should talk in broadsheet—and not tabloid terms. We seek to explain the complex interaction between domestic law and the conventions and statutes on human rights that we are incorporating. I hope that we can assure the public that we respect human rights across a range of issues, and that we will build those rights into our law without being soft or letting people go. <P>
I return to the point about rapists. I am a little anxious about tests that may be applied in cases in which rape has a dramatic impact on victims and their families. Those who test exceptional circumstances may not treat the offence with sufficient seriousness. Some individuals within the criminal justice system have not taken rape as seriously as we would wish. Judges, for example, have made unfortunate comments in cases where the test set has not been sufficiently high. Despite that concern, I am happy that our law should conform to general principles of human rights. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Earlier this morning I asked the Minister a genuine, and not a rhetorical, question. Why, I asked, is the clause in the Bill? When I read the clause, I genuinely wondered why the Government would wish to make it possible for those in the exceptional category of being convicted murders or rapists to be allowed bail, abeit in exceptional circumstances. The question was genuine, because I do not understand why the law should be loosened in such a way. <P>
I do not understand why we should put such a massive burden on High Court judges, constables and other individuals who decide on the granting of bail. Parliament, as a legislative body, is putting the huge burden of decision making on those people. For the past four years that burden has not existed. The Minister said, quite rightly, that for 14 years under the previous Conservative Government that was the state of the law. However, in 1994, Parliament decided that developments in society made it necessary to tighten the law. There was tremendous support for that decision at the time and it still has great public support. Parliament must protect the public. <P>
<H5>11.30 am. </H5>
</P>
<P>
Previously, someone convicted of rape or of murder would not be out on the streets and able to commit such crimes again. We are discussing an exceptional class of person. Why, therefore, do the Government want to change the law? How can the Minister imagine that there could be any circumstances in which a previously convicted murderer or rapist, who has been charged with another offence of murder or rape, could be granted bail? <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> If the hon. Lady had listened to my comments, she would have heard my example. She does not understand the purpose of the clause, if she seriously thinks that bail would be granted to a multiple rapist or a multiple murderer, who had committed the serious offences about which the public are so worried. <P>
The Government want to reverse the burden of proof in such cases. The hon. Lady can give the Committee no examples of cases in which we should not trust the decisions of the police, the magistracy or the courts. No such examples were offered before the changes were made in 1994; there are no examples now. Why does the hon. Lady not trust the police and the magistracy? <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I understand the point that the Minister is making. I listened carefully to his earlier comments. The question is not about trusting the police. I trust the police and the magistracy. I am sure that any magistrate, or police constable or sergeant would treat such cases with the greatest seriousness, and that in most cases they would decide that bail should not be granted. I take that point, but why is the clause in the Bill? <P>
I can only assume, from the Minister’s earlier remarks, that the introduction of this new provision is related to the European Court of Human Rights. I now begin to understand the reason for the clause. There is no other logical reason. The Minister’s intervention, a few moments ago, merely convinces me of that. <P>
It is not a question of trusting the police or the magistracy. It is not a question about exceptional cases. We are not dealing with the problems that existed in earlier times. We are considering a law that was tightened, in 1994, and designed to deal with the problems of the 1990s. <P>
I have listened to the Minister and I still cannot understand why the clause is in the Bill. I am not being obtuse. I may have begun to understand when I heard the Minister speak about cases before the European Court of Human Rights. I appreciate the sub judice law and I do not expect the Minister to go into details this morning. However, if the clause is in the Bill because of a complicated reason relating to another body of law, we should know about it. If another body of law is being incorporated into our domestic criminal law, we should know about it. When the Minister provided an explanation, it may become clear that clause 53 is a reasonable and logical clause. However, as it stands now, it most certainly is not. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I am not sure—perhaps the Minister will convince me with chapter and verse—that the sub judice rules apply to this Committee in relation to cases coming before the European Court of Human Rights. I would like to know what authority lies behind the Minister’s proposition that sub judice rules apply, because it has prevented us from being furnished with even the briefest of particulars. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for— <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall try to help the committee by reading this statement from “Standing Committee Procedure”: <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Matters which may be before the courts may be referred to in debate on the committee stage of bills, since the sub judice rule does not apply to bills. Such references should be used with restraint, and they should be directly relevant to the question before the committee.” <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Which court? <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Any courts. I hope that that is helpful.  <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I shall quickly conclude my remarks and allow the Minister to develop the issues that we have raised in the light of your judgment, Mrs. Michie. <P>
If we are talking about human rights, that is exactly what the United Kingdom’s criminal law is about. The Bill is about human rights: it is about balancing the human rights of one individual against those of another. The Committee—and Parliament more widely—is perfectly capable of making a judgment about how those rights should be balanced. That is an integral and fundamental point about our purpose here, our role as legislators and why we are sitting in Committee to deal with crime and disorder in the first place. As legislators for United Kingdom society, we wish fairly to balance the rights and freedoms of one person against those of another. <P>
I would argue as vigorously as possible that our Committee is the right forum for such arguments to take place. It is our duty as members of the Committee to make up our minds about the correct balance of rights. Indeed, I would go further and say that what happens in the European Court of Human Rights is irrelevant to what happens in Committee and in Parliament. It was set up after the second world war to investigate people’s rights and freedoms in oppressed countries in other parts of Europe. The Under-Secretary looks puzzled but yes, it was. It was never designed to deal with the criminal law of England, Wales and Scotland. <P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> The European convention confers rights on British people which can be enforced at Strasbourg. Does the hon. Lady deny British people—I note that she mentioned only England, Wales and Scotland—access to those rights? The hon. Lady seeks to deny our people those rights not only in the British courts but in Strasbourg. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Far from it. I take the Minister’s point. I did not intend to leave out Northern Ireland. I gave way to him before I reached that point in my list. I usually speak about the United Kingdom. Nothing makes me more angry than hon. Members talking about England as if it were the United Kingdom. I argued for many months in another Standing Committee that this legislature is the correct and competent one to make laws for the whole of the United Kingdom. That is precisely what I am arguing now. I do not seek to deny access to justice to any person in this or any other country—access to justice is a fundamental human right. All I am saying is that the justice that we design for our citizens in the United Kingdom, in Bills such as the one before us, is the right way to decide justice. We are a competent authority. <P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the hon. Lady recognise that human rights conventions, such as the European convention on human rights, also specify the relationship between the individual and the state, and limit state powers over the individual? Does not she recognise that it is better to have such legislation incorporated domestically than to leave it to Europe? Why did no Conservative Government seek to take us out of the convention to the 40-odd years that we have been signatories to it? Does she recognise that human rights often require measures to be included in legislation that one hopes will never be operated, but which, because they define that relationship, need to be there? <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman’s point. I would never argue that we should stop being signatories to the European convention on human rights. It is a matter of balance and opinion as to whether clause 53 is necessary. I argue that it is up to the Committee to express an opinion about that. It is up to the House of Commons and the House of Lords—our United Kingdom Parliament—to decide how criminal law should operate in our country. <P>
It is possible that the opinion of the European Court of Human Rights might vary from that of this Parliament. That does not mean that the European Court of Human Rights is correct and that the United Kingdom Parliament is wrong. That is the fundamental point. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend’s comments. Opposition Members are great supporters of human rights and if the debate gets into the merits or otherwise of human rights, we are missing the point. The real evil of the debate is that, apparently, we—as elected Members of the House of Commons—are being told by the Government that we have to agree to this clause because the European Court of Human Rights tells us so. Furthermore, we are not even allowed to discuss the merits or otherwise. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. He makes the point most succinctly, eloquently and correctly. There is no reason to suppose that, if the European Court of Human Rights is likely to come to a conclusion in a particular case, which would affect the criminal law of the United Kingdom, that the European Court of Human Rights is correct and that this Parliament, which makes the laws for the United Kingdom, is wrong. <P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon) rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> A Government Back Bencher! <P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Perhaps the hon. Lady could remind us how many times the previous Conservative Government lost to the European Court of Human Rights and whether she disagrees with any of those decisions made against the previous Government? <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Yes, I am happy to take that question from the hon. Gentleman the answer is that I disagree with  most of them. That is the very point that I am making. <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must return to the amendment that we started discussing some considerable  time ago. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I shall restrict my remarks to the amendment. <P>
This legislature—the Parliament of the United Kingdom—should decide on the balance of human rights between one individual and another in the United Kingdom. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Labour Members’ constituents who heard the serious points being made by my hon. Friend and saw the levity with which Labour Members treat such matters would be most surprised. Those hon. Members seem to think that fundamental issues concerning human rights and the powers of Parliament and the Committee are matters of amusement. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is surprising that hon. Members who are debating an exceptionally serious aspect of criminal law are in gales of laughter? <P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I do not see anything amusing about the matter. The question of who makes the laws that define the balance of freedoms in the United Kingdom is a fundamental and serious one. If the Committee, as part of Parliament, is not competent to do it why are we discussing the matter? <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> Given that what is said will be in Hansard, I should point out that Labour Members are so delighted at the Opposition response to a reference to Europe because the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing) has been very subdued during the Committee’s proceedings and a reference to Europe has made her enormously animated. She keeps telling me that now she understands me; perhaps she will try not to understand me quite so well. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I cannot give in to the Minister on that point. I shall continue to try to understand him during the Committee’s proceedings. It is my duty to do so and he is wrong to suggest that my interest in the clause is particularly related to the European aspect. I am not one who grows animated about Europe particularly. [Laughter.] Oh, I see where Labour Members’ amusement is coming from. Anything that I have said in Committee or at other times will reveal that I am not what is known as a Eurosceptic. I am quite a supporter, in  many respects, of our relationship with the European Union.  <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien rose - </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I will give way, but I think that I am stretching the point away from the clause. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I must mention that the hon. Lady’s comments are not leaving only Labour Members in gales of laughter; even the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has, beneath his hand, a broad smile on his face. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I am glad to bring some amusement to the Committee, but I am sure, Mrs. Michie, that you will call me to order if I continue to do so instead of discussing the serious nature of clause 53. <P>
The balance of freedom between one individual and another is the basis for our making laws at all. It is our reason for being here today, and the reason most Bills go through Parliament. Making laws is all about that balance. It is our duty as legislators to understand why we are scrutinising the clause. <P>
If the Minister is suggesting that the clause must become part of the Bill because of an expected judgment by the European Court of Human Rights, he is wrong to do so. It is not the Governments duty to include a clause in a Bill because they fear a judgment of that court. It is the Committee’s duty to scrutinise the Bill—including clause 53—and to decide whether the reference to exceptional circumstances justifies the inclusion of the clause. In my view it does not. <P>
Where the law has to deal with people who have been properly convicted of murder or rape, the protection of society should be the ultimate concern. The clause would weaken that protection and should not be in the Bill. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate, which has taken turns that I did not foresee when I moved the amendment. <P>
Before I come to the points about sub judice rules and Europe, I shall deal with the Minister’s arguments. I have not been reassured by his remarks and I disagree with what he said about magistrates and the police not dealing with the matter properly. I understand that he may not have considered his remarks carefully and that such things are said in the heat of debate, but I was not saying that magistrates, the police, judges and recorders of the Crown court do not do their best when taking decisions. I did not suggest that there is anything improper about the way in which they take, and will take, decisions. However, if decisions are not taken at an appropriately senior level of the judiciary, there is a risk that the wrong decision will be made. <P>
My fears have not been allayed by the Minister’s response. He seems content for important decisions to remain in the hands of constables, custody sergeants and magistrates and not to be taken solely by judges. He said that prosecution decisions could lead to matters coming before judges, but that is a haphazard way of approaching the problem. If one wants the decisions to be made by judges one should say so, and not leave it to the prosecution to take a matter from the police and magistrates courts and before a judge. <P>
I am not clear how the prosecution would appeal such matters to a judge when the decision has been taken by the police. The Minister told us that, subject to the exceptional circumstances outlined in the Bill, important decisions in serious cases will be taken in the same way as other decisions about bail are taken. However, if the decision is taken by a custody sergeant at a desk in a police station, the defendant will be admitted to bail long before the case has come into the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. The files will not even have been sent to it. A police officer will make a decision to admit a defendant to bail and the Crown Prosecution Service will not come into the picture. <P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. I have repeatedly made the point that, for 14 years under the Conservative Government and for a long period before that, custody sergeants and their predecessors were able to take such decisions. At no stage did anyone suggest that the police had made improper decisions. In the vast majority of cases, the police would not decide to release such defendants. They would almost certainly refer the decision to the courts and the prosecution would be able to exercise the rights that the hon. Gentleman wants. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is not an answer to my question. The Minister had the answer to that point from my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath. If the Minister is right, the decision will be left in the hands of a police constable and cannot be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service. The Minister shakes his head, but the Crown Prosecution Service will not even know about the case because the files will not have even reached it. We cannot rely on that route as a way of bringing the matter to a court. <P>
I thought that the Minister was going to be receptive to my arguments and would see the need for judicial discretion. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking, who is a recorder in the Crown court, made a powerful case and I am surprised that the Minister did not respond to it, particularly given what he said in 1994. I give the Minister credit for being consistent because he voted against section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which introduced the bar on defendants charged with serious offences receiving bail. However, his argument then was different from the one that he has made today. He said that the decision was a matter for judicial discretion—something that he does not see the need for now. He argued: <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Such a provision would give some discretion to the judge, which would prevent an injustice . . . The circumstances may be one in which the public, the judge and the court in general may feel that the person does not need to be held in custody until his trial.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 25 January 1994; c. 277.] <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
His speech implied that such matters would be considered by judges using their discretion and not by the police and magistrates courts. I thought that the Minister was going to advance the clause on the basis that it would provide discretion to judges. I thought that he might be responding to agitation and that he had seen hordes of judges marching with banners saying, “Hand us back our discretion” and “Free the Court of Appeal Three”. The clause will not provide hands off judicial discretion, and the Minister is not prepared to guarantee that such matters will be considered by judges. I am disappointed by his remarks. <P>
I have been placed in a difficult position because the Minister asked us to provide an example of someone with a previous conviction for a serious offence being granted bail. I cannot immediately bring such a case to mind. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I touched on a case that may be relevant and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Woking for suggesting it. Like him, I am not exactly sure that it is a good example, but we thought of the case of Winston Silcott. As I said when the Minister challenged me earlier, I will look into the matter and I am sure that Conservative Members will be able to provide a number of examples that were raised in the debate in 1994 on the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.  <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My Hon. Friend makes an important point. However, let us assume that the Minister is right and that there was not such a case in 14 years of Conservative Government or before that. Even if he is right, I will not be convinced by the clause because a risk will remain. At present, no risk exists and the Minister is creating one. It would need only one such case for the law to be changed again, but that would be one case too many and one case too late. <P>
The Minister is a bit like someone who has dug a hole in the road, put fencing and covering around it and who says, “Everyone can see where the hole is so I’ll take the fencing and covering away.” He then waits for someone to fall into the hole. If the Minister had to defend someone against such a charge of negligence in a civil case, he would not get very far. We will be risking negligence if we allow the Bill to become law without the best possible safeguards. <P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> It almost seems that the hon. Gentleman is arguing that anyone charged with any serious offence should not be granted bail. Where does he draw the line? <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I draw the line where it was left by the previous legislation. It should apply to anyone with a previous conviction for a very serious offence and who is charged with or convicted of another serious offence. I am happy to leave the line where it is. <P>
The Minister has introduced two additional considerations into the debate. The first was his suggestion that my remarks may have been sub judice and that I should think carefully before pressing the amendment. The second was that this matter might be  considered by the European Court of Human Rights. He suggested that our amendment might be inconsistent with a future decision, but we will come to that point in the stand part debate. <P>
On the issue of sub judice, the Minister said that I might consider withdrawing the amendment and discussing the matter with colleagues. That leaves me in some difficulty. I was careful not to refer to any case at all, so it is difficult to see how I could be in breach of the sub judice rule. Furthermore, I did not say anything that would lead anyone to believe that I was referring to a particular case. <P>
I was arguing for judicial discretion. I understood that the Minister was concerned about cases involving judicial discretion, and that fits in with what is in the amendment. <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes, I will give way but before I do so I should like the Minister to explain why I should not press the amendment to vote. If he has any definite reasons, I should like to hear them now. I am not convinced by his arguments. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> At no stage have I suggested that the hon. Gentleman has been in breach of the sub judice rule. I have not asked him to keep quiet about anything. He must decide whether to press the amendment to vote. That is entirely up to him. He can say whatever he wants. Let us be clear about that. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am slightly puzzled by that statement. The Minister introduced the matter at the end of his speech. He suggested that I should think about withdrawing the amendment after discussing the matter with colleagues. He then made some remarks that I understood to be a reference to some other issue. Is he now withdrawing that part of his speech? The Official Report will record his words. Will the Minister come clean and give me a reason why I should not press the amendment to a vote? If he does not, then I shall press the matter to a vote. <P>

Question accordingly negatived. <P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Malins:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Miche. I have the impression that neither the Minister of State nor the Under-Secretary replied to the debate. My hon. Friends and I asked a number of questions and raised several points during the latter part of the debate, but the Under-Secretary did not refer to them. He stood up at the end of the debate, but he said absolutely nothing. Is that what we are to expect in future? <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a matter for Ministers whether they rise to reply. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Miche. I thought that I had dealt well with the serious arguments of Opposition Members relating to criminal law when I made my earlier intervention. I made a passing reference to Europe in the final paragraph of my speech, which produced the usual result among Conservative Members. They take flight and begin a big debate; I did not intrude on their private grief. <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you. [Laughter.] <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 41, line 30, at end insert <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘unless at the time of the commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate the defendant was on bail for an offence to which this section applies, in which case the defendant shall not be granted bail in those proceedings.’ <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It might assist the Committee in considering the amendment if I refer to an earlier remark made by the Under-Secretary. He said that it was not possible for a defendant with multiple convictions for rape to receive bail. The Under-Secretary is looking puzzled. He might have said that it was not likely for such a person to be granted bail. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I said that it was not likely that a police officer, or someone else, would grant bail to a person with multiple convictions for rape, who was currently on a serious new rape charge. Can the hon. Gentleman give the Committee an example of circumstances in which that has occurred? If so, we can consider it. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The circumstances are outlined in the Bill. It is not just that a person with one previous conviction would receive bail after being charged with a new serious offence; under the Bill, a person with two convictions for the same sort of offence, such as rape, could be granted bail. It is common for such a person to commit multiple offences of rape. The amendment is intended to explore the wording of the Bill. The Bill includes the words “or convicted of” and that means that a court—but not a police constable because that would be impossible under the circumstances—may consider granting bail to a defendant awaiting sentence for such an offence and who has a previous conviction for such an offence. <P>
Will the Under-Secretary confirm that someone with a previous conviction for rape, or one of these other serious offences, who is then convicted of another such offence, could receive bail under the provisions in the clause? I thought that the wording of the Bill left no doubt about that matter, but I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would confirm it. <P>
In the light of that assertion, I offer the Committee an example that illustrates amendment No. 192 and I invite the Under-Secretary to consider it. Let us suppose that a defendant is convicted of an offence of rape. He is granted bail, pending sentence, and while on bail commits another offence of rape and is duly convicted again. Under the clause, it would appear that he is again eligible for bail, pending sentence for the second offence. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that it would be possible for a defendant convicted of two offences of rape, committed one after the other, to be granted bail? <P>
Amendment No. 192 would place a bar on such a defendant being granted bail. The Under-Secretary will say that such an event is unlikely and that it will never happen. I want to ensure that it is not just unlikely, but impossible. The Under-Secretary tells us that the reason for allowing the provision is that the circumstances to which it would apply are unlikely. As the law stands at present, it would be impossible for bail to be granted in such circumstances. The Under-Secretary has said that we should allow the provision because it is unlikely to be used. That is not a convincing argument. I hope that he can improve it when he responds. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The amendment would prevent the granting of bail to a person who, having been convicted of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or attempted rape, is subsequently charged with, or convicted of, any such offence on a second occasion and, notwithstanding the reversal of the presumption of bail in those circumstances provided for in section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, as amended by clause 53, is released on bail and is then charged with, or convicted of, a further offence of that nature, allegedly committed while on bail. <P>
I cannot imagine for a moment that such a person—for example, a potential triple murderer, or rapist—would be granted bail by any court or any police officer. I think that that would be extraordinary. It is so unlikely that it would never happen. The hon. Gentleman can press the amendment only if he has no confidence in the police or in the magistrates courts and thinks that they would be likely to do such a thing. <P>
We can make laws to prevent the absurd, but we need to make sensible laws that deal with practical situations. The fact that the defendant commits an offence while on bail is sufficient ground for refusing bail. Paragraph 2(a) of schedule 1 of the Bail Act 1976 provides an exception to the statutory presumption to bail, where it appears that the defendant has committed any indictable or either way offence while on bail. <P>
Clause 53 removes the total prohibition on the granting of bail introduced by section 25 of the 1994 Act, replacing it with a rebuttable reversal of the general presumption to bail. The provision aims to return to the police and to the courts the power to exercise discretion in the light of circumstances in individual cases. The amendment runs counter to the principle that we are seeking to establish in the clause. I believe that we already have the necessary safeguards to protect the public in such rare cases. Those safeguards are the reversal of the presumption to bail and the existing exception to the right to bail for those who commit serious offences while on bail. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not entirely surprised by the Minister’s answer. However, I am surprised to hear him refer to the police, to whom I adverted in my opening remarks. How will the  police make such decisions when a person has just been convicted of such an offence? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The police will not be placed in the position described by the hon. Gentleman. We must ensure that the clause makes provision for police and magistrates to exercise their discretion in the most exceptional cases in which they have to make decisions. I do not expect that bail would be granted in any of the extraordinarily serious circumstances described by Opposition Members. I would be amazed if it were. My respect for the common sense of our police and of our courts is great enough for me to know that they would not do that. <P>
It is possible, as I suggested at the start of the debate, to imagine circumstances in which we might wish to allow a limited degree of discretion to the police or to the courts. Such cases would be so exceptional that the clause would not place the public in extra danger. I would not support the clause if I believed that the public would be placed in serious risk as a result. We have introduced the clause because we believe that we can trust the police and the courts. We can ensure that the safeguards in the Bill will work. The rebuttable presumption means that serious criminals who are quite rightly feared by hon. Members—and by me, too—will not get bail. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I must make it clear that I do not agree with the Minister. The public will not feel that there is any justification for exceptions in such cases. <P>
Does the Minister find it surprising that although lady Labour Members always speak so passionately whenever such issues are debated in public?, only one of the Minister’s lady colleagues has bothered to stay in the Committee to debate the crucial matter of rape defendants? <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I will treat that comment with the utter contempt that it deserves. The hon. Gentleman served on a number of Committees when his party was in Government, so he will understand why that might be so. <P>
It is a convention in this place that hon. Members should treat one another with a degree of courtesy. Hon. Members sometimes slip in that approach—that is regrettable. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath will feel that he should withdraw his comment. <P>
Every hon. Member in this Room takes the view that no serious criminals or rapists—not even the double or triple murderers about whom the hon. Member for Hertsmere seems so concerned—should be granted bail in normal circumstances. <P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the clause—and nor will it be its effect—to create wild circumstances in which serious criminals will be granted bail. Rather it will allow bail to be considered for certain cases—and that would probably be viewed as appropriate by the general public—but the circumstances would have to be so exceptional before bail would be granted in most of the cases about which Conservative Members are so concerned. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way at this convenient point in our proceedings. He was kind enough to assist the Committee earlier when we were debating the circumstances in which bail should be granted. Will he now turn his mind to the circumstances—even exceptional circumstances—in which bail might be granted to someone with a previous conviction for an offence who has received another conviction for the same offence? Will he tell us about the circumstances in which bail would be granted when a conviction has been followed by a conviction? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to create scenarios, which are becoming increasingly bizarre, and then suggesting that the absurd might occur as a result of the clause. It seems that the hon. Gentleman believes that police officers, magistrate’s courts, Crown court and High Court judges are in the habit of making absurd rulings. As I said, the sort of circumstances envisaged by the hon. Gentleman would not occur. We want to provide for the possibility of bail only in most exceptional cases, and in those circumstances we shall trust the judgment and discretion of our judges and others involved in the process. <P>
The hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of all this. For 14 years under a Conservative Government the rules worked satisfactorily. It now seems— <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> Just a moment. It now seems that the Right hon. Gentleman believes that that will not be the position in future. Before the hon. Member for Surrey Heath intervenes, I accept and share his concern about persons who have been granted bail inappropriately. He would accept that in most if not all of those cases there has been a presumption in favour of bail. However, as I have tried to make clear before, the clause will not support that presumption. In the case of the most serious criminals, the presumption will be against granting bail. <P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with the point more seriously. However, it is for him as a Minister to justify the reasons for changing the law. I rose to intervene because most Conservative Members did not accept that everything worked satisfactorily for 14 years. It was because some people were granted bail inappropriately and committed further serious offences that the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was introduced. It was a response to major public concern about scandalous cases. It is for the Minister to justify why he is now seeking to water that measure down, which we believe is entirely wrong. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> When the 1994 legislation was considered we did not believe that the change was justified. We are now in a position to embody our view in legislation and that is what we are doing. The hon. Gentleman will recall—he was on the Committee considering the Bill that became the 1994 Act—that the Conservative Government were unable to provide any instances of cases such as the triple murderers mentioned by the hon. Member for Hertsmere in which the action of the police, the courts or anyone else was a matter of great public concern. <P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath is right to say that in other circumstances, where there was a presumption that bail would be granted—not cases such as those we are considering, about which the public have expressed concern. I and my hon. Friend’s might have felt that bail was granted inappropriately. However, the cases that we are discussing have not given rise to such concern. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I shall give way for the very last time to the hon. Lady, because we are making rather heavy weather of the debate. We have had a long debate about the influence of the European convention on human rights and all sorts of other points that have gone very wide of the amendment. It will be for you, Mrs. Michie to determine whether we need a stand part debate or whether we have already had one. However, the Government are taking seriously the issues that the clause raises. The clause will provide the protection that the public need and make it possible to treat exceptional cases—which the public would want to receive exceptional treatment—in an exceptional way. <P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I agree that the matter is very serious and should be treated as such. What would lead to the granting of bail under the clause? In what exceptional circumstances would someone with a previous conviction for murder or rape who was again charged with one of those crimes be allowed out on the streets? <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> That is the second time that the hon. Lady has asked the same question. I refer her to my opening comments in the debate on the previous amendment. I set out an example which, when she reads Hansard tomorrow, will, I hope, show her that her question has been answered. I do not want to delay the Committee further by recounting the same example. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sorry that the Minister says that we are making heavy weather of the matter. <P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> You certainly are. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In view of the importance of the subject of bail for such serious offences, the least that we can do for our constituents is to examine the issue thoroughly. They would think it strange if we did not, bearing in mind the risks involved. Perhaps the Minister should reconsider that aspect of the matter. <P>
The question of whether a stand part debate should take place on the clause has nothing to do with the Minister. A casual observer of the Committee’s proceedings might just get the feeling, from the Minister’s remarks about the clause, Europe and the rest—although I know that the Minister would not intend this—that he did not want to discuss the subject and felt uncomfortable about it.  <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> I am very happy to discuss the subject, Mrs. Miche—and, obviously, the issue of a stand part debate is a matter for you, not me. I made my comment about making heavy weather of things because the hon. Member for Epping Forest asked me the same question twice. I have repeatedly been asked to explain matters that I have already explained. Opposition Members have made some good points, which I have tried to answer seriously. They have done their duty in questioning the Government and I hope that we have done ours in putting forward clear arguments for acting as we think necessary. <P>
I do not want the debate to degenerate into party political bickering. It is too serious. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the Minister’s courtesy. Perhaps balance, which was slipping a little—though not in my remarks—will be restored now. <P>
The Minister called the scenario that I described bizarre, but it appears on the face of the Bill. I was not talking about triple murders, but about two such events, which should be enough for anyone. Perhaps the Minister would consider the wording of the Bill. It would allow the admission to bail of a person with a previous conviction for one of the serious offences, following a fresh conviction for such a serious offence. That follows from the phrase <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“charged with or convicted of”.<P>
</UL></FONT> <P>
I think that the Minister said that it would be bizarre for anyone to consider granting bail to someone in such a situation. We agree. My hon. Friends and I think that it is incumbent on a Government who want to change the law to have in mind some reason for making that change, other than, “We think that it is very unlikely that it will happen. Therefore, we are bringing about the change.” That is not good enough. The Government must be prepared, particularly when dealing with such a serious issue, to explain what they are trying to cater for. In what circumstances might there be an injustice? <P>
Committee members and those who read the debates will notice that, when I asked the Minister to give an example in the previous debate of the circumstances in which it would be justified to grant bail to somebody who had a double conviction for one of the most serious offences, he was kind enough to do so. I shall leave it to others to judge whether it was far-fetched. In this debate, the Minister cannot give us a single example, fanciful or not. We have scratched our heads and we cannot think of a single example. <P>
It would be wise to include in the Bill the safeguard contained in amendment No. 192, which would avoid the scenario, which I invited the Minister to consider of somebody committing an offence, being convicted, being granted bail—in accordance with the terms of the Bill—and then committing a further offence. In the event of a conviction for the further offence, the court would have to consider granting him bail for that offence. That would be unthinkable, which is why we believe that amendment No. 192 is a reasonable safeguard. We have made our points sufficiently on this and on earlier issues. I am deeply unhappy with the Minister’s comments, but I apprehend that he will not accept our amendments. <P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 193, in page 41, line 31, after ‘offence’, insert <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘save for the determination of mode of trial for an either-way offence’ . <P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 244, in page 42 line 5, at end add— <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(6) This section does not apply in the case of a defendant aged under 18 years’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come now to the new subject of television link-ups between a defendant in custody and a court in preliminary hearings. It may assist the Committee to explain that it was proposed on security grounds in the Learmont report and supported by the Government as a means of reducing delay. Television links have been used for several years for child witnesses under the Criminal Justices Act 1988. Initial concerns were expressed but they seem to have worked well in practice. <P>
Linking up defendants to courts through television is entering new territory and important considerations apply. We need to explore the circumstances in which these links should take place and to provide safeguards, particularly regarding access to legal representation. Amendment No. 133 would prevent the use of television link-ups to defendants in proceedings where the mode of trial for an either-way offence is being determined. Clause 54 applies to any proceedings <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“before the start of the trial”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Does that cover pre-trial proceedings in the Crown courts as well as in magistrates’ courts? It seems that in magistrate’s courts television link-ups could be used where the mode of trial was being determined, which raises several issues. <P>
The decision about the mode of trial is one of the most important of the defendant’s pre-trial decisions. As we know from previous debates, a large number of offences may be tried either in the magistrates or the Crown court—they are said to be triable either way. Broadly speaking, decisions may be taken by the magistrates or the defendant that will result in a full trial taking place in the Crown court. <P>
This is the defendant’s opportunity to elect for a trial before a judge and jury at the Crown court and it is obviously very important to him. Its importance is recognised in law under section 18 (2) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, which provides that a defendant must be present while the mode of trial is determined. He will be present unless the court considers that, by reason of his disorderly conduct before the court, it is not practicable for the proceedings to be conducted in his presence or if he is represented by counsel or a solicitor who signifies to the court that the accused consents to the mode of trial proceedings being conducted in his absence. The court must be satisfied that there is good reason for the proceedings being so conducted. <P>
I hope that the Committee will accept that determination of mode of trial is an important occasion on which the defendant should be present save for in certain carefully defined circumstances. The defendant may have to make important decisions and we must bear in mind that the defendant needs access to his legal representative in the course of such a hearing. <P>
We look forward to the Minister’s response. We want to know whether any arrangements will be put in place for a defendant to communicate in private with his legal representative at the time of the hearing of the determination of the mode of trial. For example, will there be a link-up in private between the defendant and his legal representative just before the hearing? If there is not to be such a link-up, how will access to legal representation take place? <P>
If legal representatives are expected to see the defendant at some time before the day of the television link, we need to know what will be done if, because of unforeseen circumstances, the defendant wants access to legal representation on the day itself. What will happen if, for some reason or other and perhaps through no fault of the defendant, the legal representative has not seen the defendant before the hearing? What if—those who practice in the courts know that this commonly happens—the defendant wants to change his mind and wants further legal advice? <P>
Those are hypothetical examples, but I am sure that the Minister will agree that they are not unknown circumstances. Therefore, we need to consider access to legal representation out of fairness to the defendant and to avoid delay and money being thrown away. We look to a full explanation from the Minister. Some organisations, including Liberty, have expressed concern about the need for communication between a defendant and his legal representative. <P>
Amendment No. 244 covers slightly different territory. It deals with defendants who are children or young persons. We stand open to correction, but I presume from the clause’s wording that it is intended to apply to such defendants and that youth courts may have television links. I assume that the security argument for television links does not apply as strongly in the case of children or young persons and that the Government are concerned to avoid delay in the hearing of their cases. <P>
We invite the Government to give special consideration to children and young people. The Minister will agree that we need to handle their cases with particular care. The younger the defendant, the less likely he or she is to grasp the significance of court proceedings and the more likely it is that he or she will need access to guidance or advice from his or her legal representative. The arguments about access to legal representation apply even more strongly to children and young people. We look to the Minister for a full response. <P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I welcome the introduction of television links into the criminal justice system. I have more experience of the civil courts and such links are being used in them for interlocutory matters with great effect. They save money and time. <P>
On amendment No. 244, it is not appropriate to exclude entirely under-18-year-olds from television links in the way that the Opposition suggest. Before Second Reading, I visited my local youth court in Barnet and what I saw there illustrates one of the problems that might result. A young offender was being held near Oxford and was to be brought to the court by Securicor. He was taken to the wrong court, to Hendon instead of Barnet. <P>
The magistrates had to wait for about an hour until he was brought to the right court, although we made good use of that hour by discussing the Bill. The magistrates welcomed the Government’s proposals, but that is hardly the point. <P>
When the young offender eventually appeared, he was obviously confused about all the mix-ups that had taken place. It then took only five minutes for the magistrates to decide that his case should be remitted to his home magistrates’ court in the midlands, as it had dealt with him before. If there had been a television link between the young offender’s institution and the court, it would have saved an hour or so of the court’s time and would also have been less distressing and confusing for the young offender. <P>
Furthermore, when young offenders appear in court, their supporters’ club sometimes turns up to try to reinforce their macho image, even  if the hearing is held in private. An additional benefit of the television link might be the prevention of such events. <P>
Nowadays, young people have greater experience of videos and computers, and it might be less unsettling for them to interact with a television than to face the full panoply of the youth courts. <P>
There are many arguments in favour of the use of television link for young people aged under 18. There would be by-products in the speed of proceedings and in the saving of costs. The amount spent in transferring the young offender from Oxfordshire to Barnet in the example that I have given would probably have met the cost of providing the magistrates’ court with the equipment for a television link. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I give a cautious welcome to the clause, although I support the amendments. <P>
We all know about the sort of scenes described by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). One might arrive at a magistrates’ court, either to represent a defendant, or to sit in a judicial capacity, to find that the case list starts at 10.15 am, but that the defendant has not been produced from prison. <P>
It is the same story at the Crown court. What has happened to the defendant? It might be the case that one vehicle has to collect defendants from a prison and deliver them to three or four different courts. The defendants who have to go to the third or fourth court do not arrive until late morning. In another case, there might be a shortage of vehicles, or there might be industrial action. There might be heavy traffic. <P>
The result is that a huge number of person hours is wasted by the failure of court lists to start on time because no defendant has arrived. I do not know whether any study has been made of the matter, but I imagine that many hours of court time are wasted each year through delayed arrivals and that it must cost a great deal of money. <P>
The introduction of a television link would be welcome, although I have a couple of caveats, which I will come to in a moment. I assume that there would be an initial pilot scheme, but that the Government intend to introduce television links throughout all the courts—both magistrates’ courts and Crown courts. Perhaps the Minister could tell us, on advice from his officials, the total amount of magistrates’ courts, Crown courts and prisons that might be served by such a facility. Those figures would be useful, as well as an estimated cost of the service, once it was up and running nationally. Such a cost should be compared with the current cost incurred through the vehicular transport of prisoners to court and the time and money wasted through delays. <P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Giving the clause a cautious welcome, I add a strong “but”. If I stray into the next two amendments to be debated, I hope that you, Mrs. Michie, will tell me. I want to refer to the issue of the defendant’s consent. It is vital that the defendant’s consent is obtained in any event. <P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is quite correct. He is speaking to the next amendment. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Then I shall stray into that argument when we reach it, but not before. I had a funny feeling that I was wrong to move on to that topic. Having said that, it might be an appropriate moment for me to resume my seat. <P>
<B>Mr. Mike O’Brien:</B> The clause is aimed at creating the possibility of video links, which would enable defendants to have their case dealt with in the courts without their presence being necessary. They could monitor the case and engage in the process. <P>
The hon. Member for Woking asked whether it would be piloted. I can confirm that it will be. The aim is to pilot it in several areas to ascertain the problems and to ensure that we can deal with them. We shall seek to expand the operation of the facilities, as and when resources allow. The hon. Gentleman asked how many courts we anticipate would benefit from the facility. In the long term, possibly all the courts would benefit. We want to create the legal basis so that, as technology enables us to work more effectively and more cost effectively, we can take advantage of the facility. <P>
We do not want to rush into things. We shall have a proper pilot stage to examine the issues. The hon. Member for Hertsmere was right to identify the Learmont report, and the facility might be particularly useful in high security cases. He also raised the valid question of contacts between lawyers and defendants and stated that defendants want to ask questions. Lawyers will have taken most of their instructions beforehand, but he rightly said that they should be able to talk to their client on the day in court. The client may well have a further or different instruction that he wishes to give to the lawyer. <P>
Amendment No. 243 deals with the matter of legal representation. Our pilot studies will allow for private and secure telephone links with lawyers before and possibly during the hearings. We want to see how that develops. It may be possible that a note could be passed by a clerk to an advocate through a telephone link. Exactly how it would work will be explored during the pilot study. Before the hearing, though, it is anticipated that the defendant would be able to talk to his lawyer. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the advocate would not normally be in discussion with the client during the hearing. <P>
If the court wishes the advocate to speak to the client, as sometimes occurs, it may be possible to create machinery and facilities to enable such communication to take place. <P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I am getting worried. In pre-trial hearings one is often leaping back and forth in discussion with the client: making it impossible to do so could seriously delay proceedings. Often a quick whisper in the ear between advocate and client is enough and virtually no time is wasted. Sometimes a solicitor or pupil is sent to achieve the same purpose. However, if the whole process is stopped, we could be wasting more time than we gain. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Woking has already answered the hon. Member for Gainsborough. As he said—and I well recollect it myself—proceedings can be substantially delayed in the morning because vans carrying the defendants fail to arrive or other circumstances have prevented a defendant from leaving prison. Such delays are not uncommon in the courts. <P>
We anticipate that opportunities to use video links will be examined carefully during the pilot. We shall work out the precise circumstances in which it will be appropriate to use them. We are all agreed that their use is a good idea as long as the circumstances are right. That is what we will assess in the pilot scheme. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister is right. I did refer earlier to delays caused when defendants arrive late in court. However, does the Minister not accept that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made a good point—that whatever else happens, nothing should be allowed to interfere with the normal hitherto fully accepted interchange between the lawyer and the client? That must not be restricted. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> The aim of the clause is not to restrict but to enable the interests of defendants and those of efficient justice to be met. I cannot provide the hon. Gentleman with a guarantee that there would be no circumstances in which the clause might make matters more difficult. However, we want to ensure that in the normal course of events it is possible for a lawyer to communicate effectively with his client so far as he needs to in the interests of justice. <P>
Taken together the amendments would severely restrict the use of live television links and undermine the benefit of reducing delay and costs to the prison service. Amendment No. 193 would prevent the conduct of mode of trial proceedings—the plea before venue procedure—taking place over a television link. It is often difficult to anticipate whether the mode of trial stage will be reached in a particular hearing. If the amendment were accepted, many straightforward hearings which could be dealt with effectively would be excluded.  <P>
Mode of trial hearings often lead to further preliminary hearings or to the fixing of a trial or sentencing date on which the defendant will be physically present. If a defendant pleads guilty during the plea before venue procedure, we recognise the need for an adjournment for the defendant to be physically present for sentence or committal for sentence. In other circumstances the hearing could proceed. <P>
Amendment No. 244 would further limit the scope of the link by preventing its use in all criminal youth court cases. Although we do not anticipate that the provision is initially likely to be applied in many youth cases, we believe that the courts should be able to use the link where appropriate. In his fine contribution to our debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon suggested such a possibility.  <P>
As with adults, the use of television links will help to speed up cases and cut prison service costs. Delays in processing youth cases are particularly damaging. There were 11 escapes from escort or court by young offenders in the year to March 1998. Nine of those were from the magistrates’ court. <P>
Where the interests of justice, or any welfare concerns, exist, the courts will have the discretion to require the physical presence of the defendant. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was going to ask the Minister to say a little about the Crown court, something that I mentioned in my initial remarks. I am curious about whether it would be possible for television links to be used there. <P>
<B>Mr. O’Brien:</B> My understanding is that Crown courts will be able to use that facility as and when they consider it appropriate. We do not envisage forcing any courts into using it. The pilot scheme is intended to examine how it would work. Once we had got it right, we could discuss further with Crown and magistrates’courts its practical application. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Our reading of the clause was that it would allow the facility to be used in Crown courts for preliminary proceedings—all proceedings up to trial. We focused our attention on either-way offences, because we view the decision about mode of trial as one of the most important events—if not the most important—in preliminary proceedings. The Minister is right to refer to the Learmont report, because security must be at the front of our minds in this context. Many practitioners are concerned about security. It is not just the use of police time that is an issue, but the risk of escapes when high-risk offenders are transported to court. <P>
I know of an example of a high-risk defendant, who escaped from custody during a visit to a magistrates’court, and went on the rampage, committing appalling offences. <P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I quite understand the arguments about high-risk offenders, but I am worried that the provision is a further chipping away at the rights of defendants. It will be extended until suddenly we shall find that virtually everyone is treated in this way. For reasons that I explained, the arrangement could damage the interests of the defendant, and his right to consult his lawyer. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That was to be my next point. In tabling the amendments we are not trying to be obstructive or prevent desirable security measures. However, for the important reasons set out by my hon. Friend we need to explore the implications and extent of the measure, and secure the appropriate safeguards. <P>
The Minister has told us that the proposal is at present subject to the pilot scheme and that it is intended that defendants should have access to legal representation immediately before the hearing, and possibly—but he did not make a firm statement on this—during it. <P>
It is very important to get such details right. The defendant should have full access to legal representation throughout—not just in fairness to him or her, though that is important, but because otherwise just the sort of delay that the hon. Member for Hendon mentions, and which hon Members know about from experience, could occur. Perhaps defendants would not receive the necessary consultation at the time, and delays would result as adjournments were sought to allow them to see their legal representatives. <P>
The Minister will appreciate our wish for precision in the information about this matter. We are not opposing the clause or ruling it out. We think that it may have value, on security grounds and for reducing delay. However, we are very worried about access to legal representation. We do not want courts to become a legal sausage machine, where defendants are processed with full consideration being accorded to their rights, and where they are not expected to be present and they feel that they have not received a fair hearing. <P>
The Minister mentioned access to legal representation before and during the hearing. I ask him to bear in mind the importance of access to legal representation immediately afterwards, too. Often, defendants do not understand what has happened during a hearing. They may be anxious about it and want further details. <P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that during hearings it is frequently important for a lawyer to go through documents with a client? That facility would not be available if everything was done by television. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point and has also made some valuable points about young people, about whom he is particularly concerned. <P>
In view of the time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. <P>
