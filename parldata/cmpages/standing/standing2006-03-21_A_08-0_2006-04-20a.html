David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): I beg to move that the

clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042041000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a

pleasure, Mrs. Anderson, to see you back in the Chair after the Easter

break. New clause 3 is quite specific: it would allow police officers

to present one more category of case in court; it is in addition to

those that they can present already.</div>

<a name="06042041000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I was a young solicitor

there was no such thing as the Crown Prosecution Service. When

desperate motorists who faced disqualification as a result of road

traffic offences asked for my representation to help them save their

driving licences, I would go to the magistrates court and find the

courtroom filled with others who had similar cases. The prosecutor was

a police officer in uniform, who presented the cases one after the

other until the whole list had been finished. That was quite common in

those days.</div> <a name="06042041000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

reasons that I understand and with which I agree, Parliament decided,

through the Prosecution of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>Offences Act 1985, that prosecutions should not be undertaken by the

police but by a separate organisation, and the Crown Prosecution

Service was established. From then on, most prosecutions have been

conducted by CPS employees or agents. However, a small number of minor,

summary-only offences, including many road traffic offences, could

still be presented by a police officer. They were known as specified

offences. Even those offences ceased to be specified, and they had to

be handed over to the CPS in two set circumstances.</div>

<a name="06042041000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first circumstance was when

the accused pleaded not guilty. Once a trial was required because of a

not-guilty plea, legal judgments and other legal issues might benefit

from the presence of a qualified CPS prosecutor rather than a police

officer. That is understandable. The second was when a person simply

ignored the court process and did not turn up. Even so, the argument

would have been that some legal judgments were required. For example,

the court would have to be satisfied that the person accused of the

offence knew that he was supposed to be in court, so evidence would be

needed that they had received the paperwork. Next, a judgment has to be

made on whether to call witnesses to prove the case or simply to serve

the statements on the accused and then read them out in court. But why

should we expend time and effort on people who are irresponsible enough

to ignore the process? Inevitably, therefore, a CPS representative

would turn up in court and read out the statements, and the case would

be proved.</div> <a name="06042041000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the

new clause, in that second class of cases in which the procedures are

ignored, the police officer can present the case to the court as the

CPS would have done. To show how important it is, I shall give a case

study, as it were, concerning the Metropolitan police. Although this

example is of what happens in London, I stress that the problem affects

all police forces; the new clause would benefit the administration of

justice throughout the country.</div>

<a name="06042041000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, the Metropolitan

police reorganised the way in which it dealt with road traffic

offences. It formed a pan-London traffic criminal justice operation or

command unit. As a result, all London&#146;s traffic offence

prosecutions go through one office. That has ended the postcode lottery

of whether the police would decide to prosecute, so we have

consistency, and with it come economies of scale, standardised

processes and improved IT support

systems.</div><a name="06042041000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,

the police depend on a good strong partnership with the CPS and the

courts. Between them, the three partners have developed a system of

five specialised traffic gateway courts. All cases go through one of

those five courts, and the system has resulted in an effective use of

everyone&#146;s time and the consistent enforcement of traffic law. I

would argue that, if people cannot get away with breaking road traffic

laws, the system also makes an effective contribution to road

safety.</div> <a name="06042041000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The police in

London would like a similar model to deal with camera fines and other

fixed penalty notices that have to go to court&#151;for example, when

cases are contested. The volume of work would be too much for the five

gateway courts, and the police are currently negotiating for additional

operations courts. Except for the specified proceedings, the CPS still

has to provide 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>the prosecution staff in all courts for all cases. As the Metropolitan

police has found, however, the CPS is unwilling, because it is

stretched, to devote resources to matters such as safety camera

prosecutions.</div> <a name="06042041000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

police are quite willing to provide the prosecution&#151;except, of

course, in not-guilty trials. They can prosecute the specified

proceedings, except when the accused ignores the process, because there

has to be proof in absence. In that situation, the court has the

discretion to allow the case to be presented by a police officer,

rather than a CPS prosecutor. Clearly, it is not possible to build a

strategy on the hope that all courts will grant a police officer

permission to do that on the day. If the new clause were passed,

however, it would allow prosecutions to proceed in an orderly way. In

any case, what is wrong with going that slight step further and using

the law to allow police officers to carry on as they usually would and

prove the case in absence? A fixed penalty notice system is good, but

it must be underpinned by the ability to take people to court, which

means proving the case in their absence if they ignore the

process.</div> <a name="06042041000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3

is narrowly drawn and deals only with the mischief that I have

identified. It would give the police new powers and provide for new

procedures, allowing the police to speed up the criminal justice system

to the extent that it is in their power to do so. The Metropolitan

police has used such new powers and procedures most effectively in

dealing with road traffic offences, but it has alerted us to a

bottleneck that it encounters at the court stage. It foresees it

growing significantly, and as I said at the beginning, it will extend

to other parts of the country. It is incumbent on us to remove that

bottleneck, and we have the opportunity to do so today. That is why I

tabled the new clause.</div>

<a name="06042041000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042041000307"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): Conservative Members give new

clause 3 a cautious welcome. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for

making available to me some of the briefings that he has had from

various organisations. As he rightly said, the new clause is designed

to tighten up procedures and end an anomaly by giving police officers

rights of audience when offenders do not turn up. Where no plea has

been entered, and the prosecution believes that the case could be

proved at first hearing, court presentation officers should have the

right of audience.</div> <a name="06042041000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

the hon. Gentleman said, such an arrangement would have the advantage

of relieving an overworked CPS. If the new clause came into effect, the

CPS would deal with traffic offences only where more serious,

non-specified crimes took place or where cases relating to specified

crimes had been adjourned for trial. As the hon. Gentleman said, the

CPS was previously needed in such cases simply because the courts were

required to hear a statement of evidence. Such statements would be read

out by the CPS, so the case could be presented and proved only by the

CPS.</div> <a name="06042041000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause

would make it the norm for court presentation officers to be used for

all minor offences. It would remove the anomalous power of individual

courts not to grant rights of audience. I note from the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s comments and from representations from the police

that the police are pressing for the right of audience in such

cases.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="06042041000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I looked at the contrary

argument, which seems to be that a person who is absent has no defence.

They would therefore require an independent prosecution, and that would

be of the highest importance in such cases. As the hon. Gentleman said,

however, why should the whole process be held up by people who are, in

effect, thumbing their noses at the system and saying, &#147;We are

not going to attend court&#148;? As we and the Minister have said

throughout, we aim to deal with the hard core of offenders, and

non-attendees at court are often the very serial offenders we are

talking about.

</div><a name="06042041000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we give

the new clause a cautious welcome. I say cautious because no one should

assume from our support for extending the rights of audience in this

specific case that we would necessarily support extensions elsewhere.

In this case, however, such an extension would end an

anomaly.</div>

<a name="06042041000037"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000308"></a>The

Minister of State, Department for Transport(Dr. Stephen

Ladyman):</b> I hope that you had a good Easter, Mrs.

Anderson, and I welcome you back to the Chair.</div>

<a name="06042041000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to my hon. Friend

the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for raising this issue. I entirely

understand his point and agree with his intentions, but I am afraid

that for several reasons I shall advise the Committee not to accept the

new clause. The first is that there is already judicial discretion

about who can appear in front of the court in a routine case.

Therefore, judges can, and sometimes do, allow police officers to

present routine cases. The cases that my hon. Friend has identified are

the sort to which judicial discretion could be applied.</div>

<a name="06042041000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s

preference is that we should leave the matter to judicial discretion,

rather than putting in place an automatic power to allow certain

individuals to appear before a court, which would be impossible to

remove without further legislation. As the new clause is drafted, there

is a tension between whether an officer who is to act as a court

presentation officer needs to have had a certain amount of training,

and whether the court presentation officer should just follow guidance

as to how he should behave. If the new clause were accepted, it would

not be possible to take the power of appearance away from individuals

even if things were not to work out in the way in which my hon. Friend

assumes that they will, and people were to present to the court

defective cases that held up its procedures.</div>

<a name="06042041000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it is the

Government&#146;s view that the matter is best left to judicial

discretion, I hope that I will go some way towards satisfying my hon.

Friend if I tell him that the Metropolitan police, the Department for

Constitutional Affairs and the Department for Transport are working

together on it. The Metropolitan police has agreed to put together

information for the DCA about the rights of judicial discretion, and

how it could be used to improve the presentation and efficiency of

routine cases. We undertake that, when we have that information, we

will do what we can to ensure that all courts realise how they might

use that discretion and think about how they can improve the efficiency

of presentation of cases.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000309"></a>Mr.

Kidney:</b> I am disappointed because, as I explained, the

Metropolitan police has developed a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>system to deal consistently with road traffic offenders. On Tuesday

afternoon, when my hon. Friend asked us to vote against several clauses

in the Bill, he said that the laws were adequate and that we just

needed to enforce them consistently and effectively. Does he not

recognise that there is an inconsistency in his argument if he thinks

that a whole strategy can rely on thinking, &#147;One day the court

might grant a discretion to allow the officer to present the case when

he gets

there.&#148;?</div><a name="06042041000042"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000310"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> My point is that the Metropolitan police has

already gone a long way towards making the presentation of such cases

more efficient, using the existing law. We believe that that can go

further, bridging the gap between what the Metropolitan police is doing

and what it wants to do, without the introduction of the power

suggested in new clause 3. I am confident that, working together, the

Metropolitan police, the Department for Transport and the DCA can

resolve the issue to the satisfaction not only of the Metropolitan

police but of my hon. Friend, without running the risk of creating a

new power that could not be removed if it turned out to have side

effects that my hon. Friend does not intend.</div>

<a name="06042041000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">My strong advice is that the

Committee should not accept the new clause, and I hope that my hon.

Friend accepts my assurance that the DCA, my officials and the

Metropolitan police and others will work on the matter to find a way of

resolving it without the need for the new

clause.</div>

come back to the matter on Report. Having listened to the Minister, I

realise that I need to lobby not just his Department but the DCA. I

urge him not to be so timid about changing the law that was passed in

1985. Parliament has changed it in other regards. A good example is the

Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which amended the Crown Prosecution

Service provisions in the 1985 Act to allow, when suitable, non-legal

staff in the CPS office to present cases on behalf of the

CPS.</div>

be sufficiently bold, recognise that there is a bottleneck, and make

that modest amendment, because when the Bill is passed, our next

opportunity to do that could be many years away. So I shall not press

Kidney:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042041000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here I am again.

The new clause would require that, each year, the Department for

Transport report on the effects on road safety of the way that clocks

are set in the United Kingdom. I have in mind that we would receive

reports like that from the Royal Society for the Prevention of

Accidents that commented on the way that we changed our clocks in

2004:</div><a name="06042041000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In 2004,

the same with pedestrian deaths: there were 56 in that October, then we

put the clocks back and the figure rose to 76 in November, and to 78 in

December.</div><a name="06042041000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">People who

have analysed the matter year after year have shown consistently that

at the end of October, when we put the clocks back and evenings become

darker earlier, the casualty rates in this country go up. Clearly,

there are road safety benefits from doing something different with our

clocks in order to preserve lighter evenings, especially in the

winter.</div><a name="06042041000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042041000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Tom Harris</b> (Glasgow, South) (Lab): My hon. Friend will

know from Second Reading that I, unlike many Scottish politicians,

support a move away from British summer time to allow lighter evenings

and darker mornings in Britain. Is it not the case that in winter it is

inevitable that days become shorter, regardless of whether we put the

clocks back? Is it not possible that the increase in the number of road

accidents is simply a result of that inevitable physical

phenomenon?</div><a name="06042041000054"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000314"></a>Mr.

Kidney:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point.

Greater minds than I, particularly those at the Transport Research

Laboratory, have researched that matter, and it seems that casualty

rates are highest at dusk. Is he asking whether, if we change the time

of dusk, that casualty rate would move to the new time, or whether we

would actually remove it altogether? The TRL&#146;s judgment is that

we would remove the accidents and casualties an hour later because most

people make their journeys by the clock. For example, it is the time,

not dusk, that determines when people finish and go home from school or

work, or go somewhere before going home. Nevertheless, we must be

careful not to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>turn this into a debate about putting the clocks forward or back,

because that is beyond the scope of the Bill or the new

clause.</div> <a name="06042041000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

provide some background so that people understand. Currently in this

country, in winter time&#151;October to March&#151;we are on

Greenwich mean time. In the summer months&#151;March to

October&#151;we are on Greenwich mean time, plus one hour, and moving

the clocks forward by one hour in March means that we have one extra

hour of daylight in the

evening.</div><a name="06042041000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Between 1968

and 1971, an experiment was carried out. In March 1968, the clocks were

put forward by one hour, and were left there until October 1971. That

was known as British standard time, during which road safety was

monitored. After making the necessary adjustments, the Transport

Research Laboratory concluded that, per winter, during the experiment,

1,120 fewer people were killed or seriously injured on our roads. That

included 230 fewer fatalities. That was, to me, quite a significant

change.</div> <a name="06042041000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have

been some further assessments of whether the effect that was seen in

1968 to 1971 would still hold good today. I asked the Minister a

written parliamentary question and he confirmed that the TRL had

updated its estimate of the effects of changing daylight time. He said

that the conclusion was

that</div><a name="06042041000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there could be a

reduction in road casualties of over 400 people killed or seriously

injured per year in Great Britain, including 100

deaths.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 9 November 2005; Vol.

439,c.

514W.]</div><a name="06042041000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In actual

fact, looking at the research, 450 fewer people would be killed or

seriously injured, which includes between 104 and 138 fewer

fatalities.</div> <a name="06042041000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can

clearly make road safety gains if we change the way in which we set our

clocks in this country. If a report set out year after year the trend

that every October, November and December saw a rising number of deaths

on our roads coinciding with when we put the clocks back, one day the

penny would drop that there is a good safety argument for not putting

the clocks back. For completeness, my favourite approach would be in

the winter to have GMT plus one hour, and in the summer GMT plus two

hours, which people call single/double summer time.</div>

<a name="06042041000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is not the vehicle to

change the way in which we set our clocks. That is a reserved matter

for the whole of the United Kingdom, although I note that in the other

place Lord Tanlaw suggested a pilot for three years of single-double

summer time in England only, allowing the devolved authorities to join

in with the experiment if they wanted. Clearly, there are wider

implications than just road safety. There are many positive reasons

beyond road safety for why we should make that change, but for today I

am asking for the Minister to agree that there should be an annual

report on the road safety consequences of what we do with our clocks in

order to see whether the Department for Transport, at least, would

support making that change.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000315"></a>Stephen

Hammond:</b> I was remiss earlier, Mrs. Anderson. I welcome

you back to the Chair after Easter and I trust you had a good

break.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div><a name="06042041000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause, as the hon.

Gentleman has said, would require a report on the impact on road safety

for 12 months and another for each subsequent 12 months, and would

allow the Minister to publish those reports and lay them as and where

he sees fit. It does not call for any action at this stage.</div>

<a name="06042041000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of us will have received a

briefing from the Longer Day UK group, which makes some claims about

the number of road deaths that could be avoided. It gave the TRL

estimates of how many casualties could have been avoided over 25 years

if we changed to what it calls the daytime-saving timetable: 20,000,

starting from 1971. Unfortunately, the table that it presents for us

only starts from 1975, so it is difficult to make a real estimate of

whether that is right. It also brushes aside any comments about safety

to cyclists that have been raised. I am sure that there is detailed

methodology in it somewhere, but we have yet to see it. It also talks

clearly about a number of other benefits outside the scope of the

Committee&#146;s deliberations.</div>

<a name="06042041000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened to the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s comments about the experiment between 1968 and 1971,

prior to the Summer Time Act 1972, when we had the extra hour in place

for three years. He cited a set of numbers, which were supposedly the

benefit of that experiment. However, there are other quotations. The

Government have said that the method was piloted between 1968 and 1971,

and that some findings estimate 2,500 deaths and serious injuries

occurred each year as a result. The hon. Gentleman talked about the

most up-to-date evidence from the TRL and quoted the Minister from

November last year, but the Minister was probably just citing the

numbers relating to the savings that were already established as a

result of the 1968 to 1971 survey. Lord Sainsbury, who was answering

for the Government in another place, said that the facts were that

we</div><a name="06042041000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would save 100 lives

and 300 serious injuries each year.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 November 2005; Vol. 675, c.

389.]</div><a name="06042041000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those figures are based on

the 1968 to 1971 survey, and seem to be the established numbers. There

is some controversy about the numbers, and we clearly need to examine a

number of other sources, not just the road safety ones. The Government

say that the experiment proved unpopular at the time.</div>

<a name="06042041000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it difficult to support

the new clause, because it is likely to be highly restrictive. If we

were to think about moving to GMT plus one for the whole year, we would

need to look at considerably more aspects than road safety, which would

mean another report and another set of costs. The experiment has been

done once before in relation to road safety and we know the

facts.</div>

<a name="06042041000067"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000316"></a>Mr.

Kidney:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that

there are much wider implications than road safety and there are other

issues to take into account, but on his point about Lord

Sainsbury&#146;s claim that the Transport Research

Laboratory&#146;s information is simply going back to the findings of

1968 to1971, I refer him to the 1998 report by Broughton and Stone from

the Transport Research Laboratory, which assesses the effects of

single/double summer time. It is different from the 1968 to 1971

experiment and takes into 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>account casualty figures between 1969 and 1994. It is clearly a more

up-to-date assessment and is not simply rehashing old

figures.</div><a name="06042041000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000317"></a>Stephen

Hammond:</b> I accept that point, but the hon. Gentleman is

using a different set of numbers than those proposed during that

experiment. The findings of that experiment are well founded and on

that basis we would find the new clause difficult to

support.</div><a name="06042041000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042041000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): This is probably the

only time ever that I am likely to find myself in agreement with the

hon. Member for Stafford, whose general views on road traffic matters

are that we should bring back the carrying of a red flag in front of

cars. I find myself with him on this issue. Approximately 400 deaths a

year are caused, along with many serious injuries, by our adhering to

this ridiculous ritual of putting our clocks back every

autumn.</div><a name="06042041000070"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000319"></a>Stephen

Hammond:</b> I just wanted to clarify the point: it is 100

deaths, but 400 deaths and serious

injuries.</div><a name="06042041000071"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000320"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I am grateful for that clarification. In my view,

if we can preserve just one life, an experiment is worth pursuing. I am

with the hon. Member for Stafford on this issue. He is quite right: the

new clause would not bring about a change in our hours, but he is

clearly seeking to knock at the door and to get Ministers to think

about making a change. For that reason, I find myself supporting him. I

do not like the wording of his clause and I do not like provisions in

legislation that call for unnecessary reports and bureaucracy, but I

can see why he has called for it.</div>

<a name="06042041000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument I have heard for

not making the change is that it would upset the Scots; a handful of

Scots living in the north-west of Scotland would not like it if we made

this change. Well, they have their own Parliament. Although this is

currently a reserved matter, I would give Scotland the power to choose

its own time zone. Let the Scots give themselves their own time zone if

they do not want the implementation of this particular

provision.</div><a name="06042041000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

heard it said that the Government may have sold the pass on this issue

by giving to the European Union an undertaking that we would not

interfere with the time zones in force in the UK without EU permission.

I hope that the Minister will confirm that there is no substance to

that rumour.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000321"></a>Dr.

such commitment has been given, it was by some other

Minister.</div><a name="06042041000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000322"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I find that partly reassuring. I hope that when

the Minister responds, with respect to my hon. Friend the Member for

Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), he will throw away his civil service brief

and embrace the new clause. However, if he is not prepared to do that,

I hope that the hon. Member for Stafford will be prepared to withdraw

the motion and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>new clause with a view to returning to it on Report. On this subject, he

will have friends in all parts of the

House.</div>

<a name="06042041000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042041000323"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Alistair Carmichael</b> (Orkney and Shetland) (LD): It may

surprise some people when I say that I also support the new clause,

although for different reasons from those outlined by the hon. Member

for Stafford.</div> <a name="06042041000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every

year the clocks go forward, and as sure as they change, somebody in

this House or the other place introduces a private Member&#146;s Bill

to embark on the same experiment as before&#151;the sort that the

hon. Gentleman outlined. Journalists go to the file marked &#147;Time

zones&#148;, and they say, &#147;Ah, yes. The Member for Orkney and

Shetland is bound to feel concerned about this, because he lives so far

away from the rest of us.&#148;</div>

<a name="06042041000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every year, as sure as the

clocks change and the private Member&#146;s Bill is introduced, I end

up trotting down Millbank to the radio studios to explain my views on

the subject. It is not because I live closer to Norway than London.

That is where I take issue with the uncharacteristically ill-informed

view of the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight). There is

no north-south split; it is more east-west. I suspect that people in

south-west Cornwall feel much more strongly about this than people in

Orkney or Shetland, because no matter how extravagant the claims made

by those who seek to visit the change upon us, nothing but nothing will

make the days in Orkney and Shetland longer in the winter. I hope that

nothing will change the fact that we enjoy almost continual daylight at

the height of summer. I was going to say sunshine, but we are not

always that lucky.</div>

<a name="06042041000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a constituency point of

view, it remains dark in Shetland in the depths of winter and does not

get properly light until 9 to 9.30 in the morning. In the afternoon, it

gets dark again by 3 to 3.30. The changes that the hon. Member for

Stafford talks about will make no difference to that

whatever.</div> <a name="06042041000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

there is some merit in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause, because

it states that a report should be made to Parliament about the way in

which we order our time zones, and the impact that it has on road

safety. I fear that many claims made on behalf of change are somewhat

inflated and overstated. If we had from the Minister and his Department

a proper and rigorous assessment that was open about not only its

conclusions but the modelling and methodology used to reach them, we

would enjoy a much more informed debate. It would allow the drawing of

clearer lines than those that I have witnessed over the past five

years, trotting down Millbank every spring. We might all benefit as a

result.</div> <a name="06042041000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

confident that my views are right. The report that would be produced as

a result of the new clause would demonstrate as much in

time.</div>

<a name="06042041000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000324"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising an

important issue. As he observed, his proposed new clause calls on us

neither to introduce nor reintroduce single/double summer time; it

calls on us to do a piece of research each year and to report the

findings of that research. My hon. Friend, who is a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>solicitor, knows that my background is that of a scientist, so as a

Minister I am usually the first to leap at the opportunity to

commission research, because I am occasionally given the opportunity to

throw a few bob to the boys in the lab. The only reason to do research,

however, is to provide answers to questions to which we do not have the

answer, but we already have the answer to this

question.</div><a name="06042041000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my

written answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s parliamentary question, I

said publicly, and I shall reiterate now, that changing to

single/double summer time would have road safety benefits. It is not in

doubt&#151;the research has been done. It was done following the

experiment to which the hon. Member for Wimbledon referred, and we have

the report from TRL in 1998 that examined the impact of single/double

summer time more closely. We know it will have road safety

benefits&#151;that is not in doubt, so there is no point

commissioning any more research on it. I buy the argument and I have

heard nobody either disagree with it or challenge the

data.</div><a name="06042041000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">How many lives

and injuries would the change save? Something of the order of 100

lives, and something of the order of 400 people killed or seriously

injured. One has to accept that, back in 1998, a slightly higher rate

of people were killed or seriously injured. Since then the rate has

been falling in general, so we must assume that a reduction is

occurring too in the total number of people whose lives would be saved

as a result of single/double summer time or who would not receive

serious injuries. Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept that

approximately 100 lives would be saved and approximately 400 people

killed or seriously injured would be spared that

fate.</div><a name="06042041000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as hon.

Members said, it is not a matter for the Committee or the Road Safety

Bill, nor indeed it is a matter just for the Department for Transport.

It is a matter primarily for the Department of Trade and Industry,

because it has things to take into account about the economic

performance of the country. It is also a matter for the Department of

the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which represents the interests

of agriculture, although I have never quite understood why farmers are

always quoted as the reason why we cannot move the clocks forward,

because I would have thought that farmers could get up whenever they

wanted to get up, and I assume that those who deal with livestock get

up with the cows, rather than when the Government say they

should.</div><a name="06042041000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matters go

beyond the scope of the Department for Transport and beyond road

safety. If my hon. Friend wishes to campaign with those Departments for

a permanent change, however, he is welcome to do so. He can quote both

me and the research, and say that I entirely accept that there would be

significant road safety benefits. I hope that, having taken away my

commitment to back up his lobbying expeditions, he will then accept

that there is no point burdening us with the need to repeat and

republish the research every year, when we already accept his

argument.</div><a name="06042041000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000325"></a>Mr.

Kidney:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s contribution is helpful

and I am grateful. I have one question. The TRL report that I mentioned

was from 1998, so clearly it updated its thinking, and it would be

desirable if they updated their thinking from time to time in future

too. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>Will he assure us that it should do that if it were

relevant?</div><a name="06042041000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000326"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Absolutely. If we came to the conclusion that for

some reason the research was becoming out of date, I would certainly

commission an update. I suspect that if my hon. Friend and his

colleagues were to begin to convince Ministers in other Departments

that we should change our clocks,there would be wide

consultation and all Departments would have to pitch in and explain

their attitude.I would expect, in the normal course of

events, thatwe would want to update the evidence as part of

that debate. In the meantime, we accept that there would road safety

benefits, but that road safety is not the only issue to be considered

and many other things must be taken into account. The Government must

take a wide view of the subject and consider the difference throughout

the country, north and south, east and west, as the hon. Member for

Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) said. Many more issues than road

safety must be taken into account, but I accept that there would be

road safety benefits in a change to single/double summer

time.</div><a name="06042041000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000327"></a>Mr.

Kidney:</b> The debate has been helpful and has clarified many

things. I shall accede to the request from the right hon. Member for

East Yorkshire to withdraw the motion and new clause&#151;it is not

every day that he offers to stand with me under the red flag&#151;and

save the argument for another

day.</div><a name="06042041000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with my

hon. Friend the Minister about the value of research. It is not only

scientists who value research; politicians also like to make

evidence-based decisions. He is right to remind us that scientists have

a role to play in providing evidence from time to

time.</div><a name="06042041000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to

the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, who agreed with the new clause

for reasons other than the time issue. He reminded me why we should be

hesitant about a change as big as altering an entire time zone by Act

of Parliament. I shall be cautious about wanting to do

that.</div><a name="06042041000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd

that the Conservative Front Bench does not support my wish to consider

the matter more deeply. On Tuesday, it argued for us to do more about

level crossings. If we eradicated every death on a level crossing we

might save 20 lives a year. At a previous sitting, I argued for a lower

drink-driving limit, which might save 50 or 60 lives a year. The

measure that we are discussing would save more than 100 lives a year.

Important as the other measures are, they pale into insignificance

compared with the one before

us.</div><a name="06042041000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000328"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000329"></a>Mr.

the advice of my hon. Friend the Minister and lobby other Departments

that you are similarly

revived.</div><a name="06042041000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

and I attended a meeting of the all-party group on motorcycling

yesterday and there was agreement on the new clause, which simply

proposes that all bus lanes should be open to motorcycles as long as

they move in the same direction. I shall be brief because I am

conscious of the time and also of the blood pressure of the Government

Whip, the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy). I shall not

plough through the large report published by Transport for London on

the interim

results.</div><a name="06042041000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bones of

the report are that there is convincing evidence that the use of bus

lanes by motorcycles reduces the vulnerability of motorcyclists without

affecting the vulnerability of other road users, such as pedestrians

and cyclists. It is common sense to move motorcycles away from other

road vehicles such as lorries, heavy goods vehicles and so

on&#151;not mixing traffic seems to work. Motorcyclists would be more

visible to other road users, and lack of visibility is often cited as

the cause of accidents. I can find no studies that indicate that the

risk to cyclists and pedestrians increased when motorcycles were

allowed access to bus

lanes.</div><a name="06042041000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Motorcycles

pollute less on any given commuter journey because they do not get

stuck in traffic and sit with their engines idling. They do not

contribute to traffic congestion, as they keep moving. Allowing them

into bus lanes recognises that they are an important part of commuter

transport, which I believe reflects the Government&#146;s motorcycle

strategy to promote them as a mainstream transport

activity.</div><a name="06042041000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

pm</div><a name="06042041000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

interesting to note that motor cycles in bus lanes do not slow up

buses. The buses set the speed, and, as a result, motor cyclists tend

not to speed. None of the local authorities that have allowed motor

cycles to use bus lanes have reported safety problems, and the evidence

in the Transport for London report is that there was an 8 per cent.

reduction in powered two-wheeler collisions on the A23 and a 31 per

cent. reduction on the A41. If we combine those figures&#151;as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>a scientist, the Minister will agree with this&#151;that is a 19 per

cent. reduction in all PTW collisions. The reduction of such collisions

in the control areas was0 per

cent.</div><a name="06042041000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

said on Tuesday that such a provision would be redundant because local

authorities can already allow motor bikes to use bus lanes. The problem

is that more oomph is needed to promote such change. The new clause

would provide that

oomph.</div><a name="06042041000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some

authorities allow motor cycles to use some bus lanes. In Bristol, the

policy is city-wide, and there have been no problems. In South

Gloucestershire, it covers the whole local authority area, and there

have been no problems. In North Somerset, the policy again covers the

whole local authority area, and there have been no problems. In

Peterborough, it relates to one bus lane, and there have been no

problems. In Hull, there is a trial involving one lane, and there have

been no problems. In Swindon, the policy covers the whole borough, and

there have been no problems so far. In Reading, all the bus lanes in

the borough are covered and the problems that were expected by cyclists

have not materialised. In Essex, the policy is county-wide, and there

have been no problems. In Derby, where the policy applies to Nottingham

and Uttoxeter New roads, there have not been any problems. In Kingston

upon Thames, half the bus lanes in the borough are covered by it, and

there have been no problems so far. In Sheffield, one bus lane is open

to motor cyclists, but there will be two next year, and there have been

no problems. In Richmond upon Thames, motor cycles are allowed to use

three bus lanes, and there have been no problems. In Westminster, motor

cycles can use eight bus lanes out of a proposed nine, and there have

been no safety problems. That brief summary indicates that the measure

does work.</div><a name="06042041000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister will tell us that giving motor cycles access to bus lanes is

allowed by legislation and is subject to local government decision. My

contention is that this is a major safety measure. Also, it is a pity

that part of our road capacity is underused&#151;buses do not use the

capacity the whole time. This common-sense new clause would allow all

motor cyclists to use all bus lanes immediately, rather than wait for

decision making by local governments. Until yesterday, I did not

realise that local authorities had discretion on

this.</div><a name="06042041000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042041000331"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I am mandated to

speak on the new clause by my office manager. If I were not to speak on

it, I would not get the same excellent service that I have always had

from her. She is a biker, and she has lobbied me on this matter

continuously since I was elected to Parliament in

1997.</div><a name="06042041000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main reason

I support the new clause is that there is complete inconsistency across

the country, as exemplified by the comments by the hon. Member for

North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). We must seriously consider the use of

bus lanes. For example, there are bus lanes on two parallel arterial

roads into Bolton town centre. Motorists can travel on one of them

outside peak hours but not on the other. For a motorist entering the

town for the first time, it is complete confusion. They must read the

signs very carefully, but, frankly, that is not easy in congested

traffic.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div><a name="06042041000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same argument applies to

other vehicles using bus lanes. It is necessary to review how bus lanes

are used across the country. In some authorities, taxis can use bus

lanes; in others, they cannot. I am arguing for consistency in the use

of bus lanes, which is currently confusing not only for bikers but for

other vehicle

users.</div><a name="06042041000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the

imposition of the congestion charge in London&#151;it will no doubt

come in in other cities&#151;there has been a huge increase in the

use of motor cycles, exemplified by the sales of them across the land.

I occasionally drive in London, and it is frankly terrifying to see the

way in which not only motor cyclists but cyclists zip in and out of the

traffic. That must undoubtedly lead to collisions. I do not have any

statistics and I have not studied the subject, but it is common sense

to reach that conclusion. I therefore support the idea of allowing all

motor cyclists to use bus lanes. I would go even further and impose on

them the requirement to use bus lanes, to stop them going in and out

between other vehicles, as we see in such an exaggerated way in our

capital.</div><a name="06042041000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,

even if the Minister urges us not to support the new clause, he will

take our views back to his Department so that we can examine and

rationalise the use of bus

lanes.</div><a name="06042041000113"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000332"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> The hon. Member for North Shropshire alluded to

the fact that he and I were at a meeting of the all-party group on

motorcycling yesterday. I made it clear, and reiterate for the record,

that I have seen no evidence that there is any negative safety impact

of motor cycles using bus lanes. Indeed, I see positive benefits to it,

because as part of our national motor cycling strategy we want to make

motor cycling mainstream. We see it as one way in which we can help to

relieve congestion and improve social mobility, as long as we can do so

while maintaining the safety of motor cyclists and other road users.

Motor cycles using bus lanes would contribute to

that.</div><a name="06042041000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Motor cycles

should not be able to use every bus lane in the country, as the new

clause would require them to do. I draw the line at that. I suspect

that there will be some bus lanes that, because of their construction

and the way in which they are commonly used in their local environment,

will not be suitable for motor cycles and therefore need to be

restricted to buses. Those lanes will be exceptional cases in one or

two places where the local authority has a good reason not to want

motor cycles in a bus lane. However, in 99 per cent. of cases I do not

see any disadvantage in a motor cycle using a bus lane. Local

authorities have the power to allow that to happen. It is entirely at

their discretion.</div><a name="06042041000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall go on to explain how we have reached a situation whereby most bus

lanes exclude motor cyclists. I want the Committee to realise that I

believe that most bus lanes are suitable for the use of motor

cycles.</div><a name="06042041000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000333"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I have been pleased to hear what the Minister has

said so far, but will he put his money where his mouth is? Local

authorities may indeed have discretion, but his Department should give

guidance 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>that unless there are circumstances in which it would be unsafe, as he

alluded to, the default position should be that motor cyclists can use

bus lanes. Will he consider changing his Department&#146;s guidance

to that

effect?</div><a name="06042041000117"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000334"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> The right hon. Gentleman brings me to the point

that I was going to make about how we have ended up in this position.

In 1997, when the document &#147;Keeping Buses Moving&#148;, which

described the construction of bus lanes, was produced, it said that

motor cycles should not normally use bus lanes. I was not involved in

the production of that document, and I do not know the rationale for

that. There may have been a perception that there was a threat to

pedestrians from motor cycles in bus lanes, and that may have been why

the recommendation was

included.</div><a name="06042041000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To me, it

would have been more obvious to point out that the people who should

not be in bus lanes are pedestrians. Pedestrians should be on the

pavement, not walking over bus lanes. If they do cross a bus lane, they

need to take the same care as they are expected to take when crossing

any road. That requires them to be alive to the possibility that not

only buses but motor cycles might be in the bus lane. Nevertheless, we

are discussing the position that was established in 1997, and the

guidance on the Department&#146;s website reflects

that.</div><a name="06042041000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since then, we

have carried out a number of experiments and some local authorities

have used their discretion. I understand that that discretion is used

in Bristol and Birmingham. Indeed, it is used in respect of the most

high-profile bus lanes for which the Department for Transport has

responsibility&#151;the M4 bus lane allows motor cycles&#151;so we

have shown that we believe that motor cycles ought to be allowed in bus

lanes.</div><a name="06042041000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That discretion

is being used in London for an experiment. It was due to finish last

year, but the statisticians believed that sufficient data on accidents

had not been accumulated for them to be able to draw clear conclusions,

so it was recommended that it continue. As the hon. Member for North

Shropshire said, however, the interim report shows that there is no

evidence of a safety problem. In my view, the report is sufficiently

convincing that we should start moving to a position whereby we remind

local authorities that they have discretion, and I have taken steps to

do that.</div><a name="06042041000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming that

there is no major change to the outcome of the experiment, I give a

commitment that I will ensure that the guidance on the

Department&#146;s website is completely rewritten as soon as the

experiment is finished, so that it is clear that there appears to be no

safety risk in allowing motor cycles in bus lanes. In the meantime, we

shall take steps to remind local authorities that they have that

discretion.</div><a name="06042041000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000335"></a>Mr.

Carmichael:</b> If the situation is as the Minister says and

in 99 per cent. of cases it would be perfectly acceptable to allow

motor cycles in bus lanes, would it not be more appropriate to give

local authorities the power to exclude motor cycles from certain bus

lanes if they thought that the safety case for that had been made,

rather than giving them a power to allow motor cycles in bus

lanes?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div><a name="06042041000123"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000336"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> That is the current position: local authorities

have the power to exclude and the power to allow motor cycles in bus

lanes. Originally, the Government guidance asked them to take the view

that, normally, motor cycles would not be allowed in bus lanes. My view

is that, as soon as we have the final data to confirm that allowing

them in bus lanes is appropriate, we are likely to change the guidance

to say that normally they should be allowed

in.</div><a name="06042041000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there

might still be one or two circumstances in which local authorities want

to exclude motor cycles from bus lanes. For example, it might be

inappropriate for motor cycles to be allowed in a bus lane leading

directly to a bus station. It might be appropriate to be very strict

about who is allowed in bus lanes in roads around schools, because of

the way in which the roads are engineered and the layout of the roads

and because of how the children&#151;kids being kids&#151;are

likely to behave when getting off school buses. A local authority might

want to exclude motor cycles from bus lanes in those areas, but my view

is that, by and large, local authorities should be using their

discretion to allow motor cycles in the vast majority of bus lanes, and

we need to work to change the guidance to reflect

that.</div><a name="06042041000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000337"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> The Minister makes a sensible point: it might

not be appropriate to allow motor bikes in bus lanes near schools and

so on. However, the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) made

a good point, too: the inconsistency is muddling for motorbike riders.

A consensus seems to be emerging between my right hon. Friend the

Member for East Yorkshire and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland

that it would be better for it to be the general rule throughout the

country that all bus lanes are open, unless a bus lane is clearly

marked as an exception. That would be much easier for motor bike riders

to understand; it is a response to the point about muddle and

inconsistency.</div><a name="06042041000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

encouraged by the Minister&#146;s comments, and this is a probing new

clause, but when he puts statements on the website, would it not be

better to switch the presumption? The presumption should be that motor

cycles are allowed in bus lanes unless a bus lane is near a school, a

bus depot or whatever. Those are perfectly sensible exceptions and they

should be clearly

marked.</div><a name="06042041000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06042041000198"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000375"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I can

see a practical advantage in what he suggests. At present it would be

necessary for all the local authorities around the country to get out

little pots of paint and put little motor cycle signs on everything to

say that motor cycles are now allowed in. If excluding motor cycles is

to become exceptional, it would be much cheaper to say that they are

allowed unless there is a sign with a motor cycle with a red line

through it. It would be much easier to identify that. I will certainly

take that on board as we prepare the new guidance based on the outcome

of the experiment.</div>

<a name="06042041000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000376"></a>Dr.

Iddon:</b> My point is the same. The lack of consistency

across the country on the usage of bus 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>lanes by all vehicles, not just motor cycles, causes confusion. When a

driver is entering a very busy town, paying attention to the movement

of traffic in front of him is often more important than observing the

signs approaching a bus lane. I find it difficult to read the signs on

the usage of bus lanes for that reason. The consistency argument is

very important.</div>

<a name="06042041000200"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000377"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I entirely accept what my hon. Friend is saying,

not just in respect of motor cycles but in respect of all users of bus

lanes. I find it incredibly confusing in London that some bus lanes are

7 till 7 while others are 7 till 10, 4 till 7 and 24-hour. Once a

driver has missed the first sign at the beginning of the bus

lane&#151;his mind may have been on avoiding a traffic

hazard&#151;he has no idea whether the bus lane alongside him is

empty at 8 o&#146;clock at night because it is a 24-hour bus lane or

because all the other drivers have also missed the sign and do not

realise that they are allowed to use it. I would be interested in

looking for some consistency and greater clarity in

signing.</div>

<a name="06042041000201"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000378"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> We are having an interesting debate. My view is

that we should never have 24-hour bus lanes when we do not have 24-hour

buses. When in 2007 will the report conclude its work? Will the

Minister give us a commitment that when he changes the guidance he will

let us know by way of a written parliamentary

statement?</div><a name="06042041000202"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000379"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> I will certainly make a statement when we change

the guidance. My understanding is that the full data should be

available this summer, so we do not have to wait much longer until we

can carry out the analysis. I take the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s

point that there should not be 24-hour bus lanes when there are not

24-hour buses, although I am happy to say that there are 24-hour buses

in London. There are night buses. I now have the benefit of a

ministerial car to get me home to my flat, but before I became a

Minister I occasionally had to take the night bus. It was rather like

one of the Quentin Tarantino vampire films; I would wonder whether I

was the only person who was not about to turn into a werewolf.

Nevertheless, we have 24-hour buses in London and they should be able

to run congestion-free where appropriate. That is a matter for local

authorities.</div><a name="06042041000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that the hon. Member for North Shropshire will be prepared to withdraw

his new clause, given my assurances, and that my hon. Friend the Member

for Bolton, South-East will explain to his assistant that I am entirely

committed to her cause. I perhaps cannot move as fast as she would want

me to, but I am determined to ensure that she can use bus lanes at some

point in the very near

future.</div><a name="06042041000204"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000380"></a>Mr.

Paterson:</b> I am very encouraged by the Minister&#146;s

comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): I beg to move, That the

clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="06042041000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I

originally called for pedicabs to be banned totally, I am pleased to

speak in favour of new clause 14. It seeks to apply traffic and parking

restrictions to pedicabs or rickshaws and specifically to apply

penalties to the owners of pedicabs. I have received petitions and met

a number of organisations, including the Licensed Taxi Drivers

Association. Its members have direct and daily experience of problems

caused by pedicabs in London. Up to 300 pedicabs now operate at any one

time in central London, and they also operate in Bath, Cardiff and, I

understand, Newcastle. The problems are common throughout the country,

but are most intense in London.</div>

<a name="06042041000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pedicabs are currently not

subject to parking or traffic regulations. Pedicab drivers are not

tested and are not required to train. They ride and park wherever they

choose. As a result, they cause obstructions for road users, taxis,

buses and emergency vehicles, particularly outside theatres and

restaurants in central London. They use and block bus lanes, pedestrian

crossings, pavements and box crossings. They also obstruct emergency

vehicle access points, which has implications for the safety not only

of road users, but of the wider public.</div>

<a name="06042041000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus, applying parking traffic

regulations to pedicabs is an urgent necessity. We seek to apply them

to the owners because of the nature of the industry. Many of the

drivers are employed casually and it would not be practical to apply

penalties to them. It is the owners who must take

responsibility&#151;after all, they are the ones making huge

profits.</div> <a name="06042041000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as

being untested and untrained, and often casually employed, drivers are

not vetted, which of course contrasts with every other licensed taxi

trade. The dangers of unlicensed minicabs have been widely recognised

over the years. The same considerations apply to pedicabs. As an

illustration of the dangers, it is worth noting the tragic case that

concluded on 18 March last year, when a pedicab rider was sentenced to

eight years&#146; imprisonment for the rape of a 23-year-old female

passenger who had been in their care.</div>

<a name="06042041000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pedicabs themselves are

dangerous. No standards are applied to their construction. They are

often poorly constructed and not subject to any tests, such as MOTs.

The Transport Research Laboratory&#151;the independent body used by

the Government&#151;was asked to examine one of the most common

pedicabs. It concluded that, in its professional opinion, the passenger

compartment would provide little or no protection in the event of an

accident.</div><a name="06042041000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

a result of all those points of concern, Transport for London

and Westminster city council, among others, have sought to regulate

pedicabs and apply a licensing regime to them. Licensing has been

promised but much delayed. As all parties, including the Government,

agree that unlicensed pedicabs cause obstructions to road users and

that the way in which they operate puts pedestrians, their passengers

and other road users at risk, there is no reason to delay imposing

traffic and parking regulations on them.I therefore urge the

Committee to support newclause

14.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000383"></a>Stephen

Hammond:</b> I am disappointed to hear that response from the

hon. Gentleman. Let us cut to the thrust of the argument. The pedicabs

and rickshaws operating in London exploit a legal loophole that permits

pedal-powered vehicles to operate outside the hackney carriage and

private hire vehicle regulations. Their construction and maintenance is

not standardised or regulated, and most of them have no insurance. The

riders are often untrained and are usually overseas students being

charged a fee by owners to operate them. The riders have no experience

either in the operation of the vehicles or in the routes.</div>

<a name="06042041000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no set fee. Clearly,

we are in favour of the free market, but the potential to rip off

customers and exploit overseas tourists, which is bad news for London

business, contrasts with the regulation of most vehicle hire in London.

The green, alternative argument that is often put is a fallacy, because

most of the journeys that pedicabs operate are short and could be

walked. Very often, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr.

Scott) pointed out, their obedience to traffic regulations is somewhere

between zero and none. They block west end streets, they congregate at

theatres, blocking roads, and there are problems with complying with

red lights, which we have discussed on numerous

occasions.</div><a name="06042041000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">More

importantly, this is the Road Safety Bill, so let us expand on three

points made by the Transport Research Laboratory on the safety of

pedicabs. It

said:</div><a name="06042041000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

literature review considered existing regulations and standards that

could be applied to Pedicabs and found that although both construction

and use regulations and the Highway Code could be applied to Pedicabs,

no specific mention of them was made in either. The Pedicab tested

failed to comply with certain aspects of the regulations

reviewed.&#148;</div><a name="06042041000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on to

say:</div><a name="06042041000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Braking

and Handling trials tested the braking performance and stability of the

Pedicab under various conditions. The braking performance of a laden

Pedicab was found to be significantly lower than that of a

car.&#148;</div><a name="06042041000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, as my hon.

Friend said, the

TRL</div><a name="06042041000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;concluded that the

passenger compartment would provide little or no protection in the

event of almost any

accident.&#148;</div><a name="06042041000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there was

ever a compelling case for a clause to close this legal loophole and to

make registration compulsory, this is

it.</div><a name="06042041000221"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000384"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Should pedicabs be licensed and properly managed?

Yes, of course they should. Everywhere else in the country, outside

London, they are licensed as taxicabs and local authorities control

them well. We have received no requests or lobbying from anybody

outside London for any changes to the existing system or law. In those

areas, the pedicabs seem to co-exist happily with the local community.

Inside London, I agree that there is a different 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>problem, because currently pedicabs fall outside the licensing regime.

Transport for London is intending to bring them inside the licensing

regime very shortly. I hope that when it does so the problems

identified by Conservative Members will be

resolved.</div><a name="06042041000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may

introduce a note of controversy in what until now has been a pretty

consensual Committee on most issues, I suspect that the Conservative

Members&#146; briefs were written for them by the taxi associations.

Those associations do not want pedicabs to be managed or to be brought

within a licensing regime. They want them off the road, because they

perceive that pedicabs are taking away some of their money. The hon.

Member for Ilford, North says that pedicab owners are making profits,

but what does he think taxi drivers and the people who own taxis are

doing?</div><a name="06042041000223"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000385"></a>Mr.

Scott:</b>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000386"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Let me finish. The hon. Gentleman has made his

point; I am entitled to put the alternative case. The hon. Member for

Wimbledon says that people have to pay to pull pedicabs, but how does

he think most of the hackney cabs in London are financed and put on the

roads? It is exactly the same situation. If managed properly within a

licensing regime, pedicabs could provide an additional level of

diversity in the way in which people may move around the

city.</div><a name="06042041000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not imagine

that pedicabs will be the transport of choice for people who work in

London, but they may be the occasional transport of choice for

tourists, people attending the theatre, or those out for a romantic

evening who feel that it would be fun to be pulled through the park. If

that is what they want to do, why not allow them? <i class="I">[Laughter.] </i>I

probably did not phrase that very well. Never having been pulled in the

park, I did not realise how that would sound until it came out of my

mouth. Pedicabs can add to the diversity of transport in the city, so

long as they are properly licensed and the issues about the people who

pull them and the ways in which they are parked and use the streets are

managed

properly.</div><a name="06042041000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pedicabs

must follow the same rules of the road as everybody else and they are

subject to police enforcement. We discussed cyclists in earlier

sittings, and the police should be stopping pedicabs that are breaking

the rules just as they should be stopping cyclists who are breaking the

rules.</div><a name="06042041000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

am</div><a name="06042041000227"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000387"></a>Mr.

Scott:</b> Licensed taxi fares are regulated, but pedicab

fares are not regulated by

anyone.</div><a name="06042041000228"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000388"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> That is an extraordinary statement for a

Conservative to make; are pedicab fares not regulated by the

marketplace? If people are being charged too much, will they not simply

not get in to pedicabs? I know that the Conservative party is

chameleon-like and is trying to change its image, but I did not think

that it had completely divorced itself from market philosophy. Clearly

that change has happened today. I hope that my colleagues will relay

that message to the Prime Minister so that he can take account of

it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div><a name="06042041000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, pedicabs should not

rip people off, and should be within a licensed regime. That is what

Transport for London is trying to achieve.</div>

<a name="06042041000230"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000389"></a>Stephen

Hammond:</b> The Minister is at his most disingenuous today.

As we have seen throughout our proceedings, his inspiration usually

comes not out of his own mouth or mind, but from some gentlemen or

ladies who sit at the top table&#151;as does most of his

briefing.</div> <a name="06042041000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had

several representations on this point. This is not about stifling free

enterprise. If the Minister wants a taxi drivers&#146; regime across

London with no regulation, he should introduce it. That seems to be the

thrust of his recent argument, although I am sure that that is not what

he meant to say. This is about a group of people who currently act

outside the law and potentially exploit visitors to this country. If

the Minister or I were to walk this afternoon to a theatre in

Westminster and decide afterwards that we wanted a ride back to the

House of Commons in a pedicab, we would know the going rate for that

trip, but a tourist from anywhere in the world might not know that the

going rate from a theatre in Westminster to the House of Commons is not

&#163;50.</div><a name="06042041000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">All we are

trying to do is bring pedicabs inside a proper licensing regime. We

have heard a lot of nonsense about chameleons and the free market, and

I am sure that on reconsideration the Minister will want to

disassociate himself from that burst of comedy. Let us get back to the

serious point behind the new clause: the regulation of pedicabs, and

correcting the loophole that exists only in London. Any fair-minded and

sensible member of the Committee should want to support the

clause.</div><a name="06042041000233"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000390"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> First, let me defend myself. The hon. Gentleman

might not have noticed, but I have used the copious packs of briefing

put before me every day for precisely one clause during our

proceedings. I have not otherwise referred to any of it. In any event,

the officials who provide me with inspiration and briefing do so

according to instructions that they were previously provided with by me

and other Ministers. That is different from using a taxi association

briefing, which is truly disingenuous, because it is from people who

see pedicabs as competition and want them off the road.</div>

<a name="06042041000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s new

clause argues for what I hope he accepts is the appropriate way to deal

with this: for pedicabs to be properly licensed, brought within a

licensing regime, allowed to compete with taxi drivers, and made to

follow the rules of the road. Enforcement of those rules is a matter

for the police.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000392"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Transport for London is already bringing pedicabs

within its licensing regime, so new legislation is not required for

that. The rest of the country seems to have managed this issue

perfectly satisfactorily without new legislation, so I do not see any

need for the new clause. Does the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire

want to intervene?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div><a name="06042041000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000393"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I did want to intervene, but the Minister answered

my point in that summing up. I was going to ask whether Transport for

London needs any further powers from us to make that change, but he

covered that point. However, I must say, in passing, that he is

beginning to sound rather demob

happy.</div><a name="06042041000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042041000394"></a>Dr.

Ladyman:</b> Demob happy is probably a good way of putting it.

It is rather a lot of work for a Minister to have to take a Bill

through a Committee by himself. It is lonely work, but I can now see

the distant light at the end of the tunnel. Nevertheless, I shall

answer the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s serious point.</div>

<a name="06042041000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transport for London has not

asked for new powers to deal with the problem, and I believe that the

matter can be properly managed under the law as it stands. In any

event, we will not legislate to take pedicabs off the road simply to

give others the free use of the marketplace. Pedicabs have a

contribution to make&#151;not a major one, I suggest&#151;and with

a proper licensing regime they will be satisfactorily

managed.</div>

a near neighbour of the Minister&#146;s&#151;my hon. Friend the

Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)&#151;for bringing this matter to

my attention. It is not particularly controversial. It is partly to do

with the welcome expansion of the European Union and the enormous

increase in traffic between us and the continent.</div>

<a name="06042041000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is simple. We have

the steering wheel on the right-hand side of the vehicle, and on the

continent 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>it is on the left. Continental trucks have no need for a wide-angled

mirror on the passenger side when they are on the continent&#151;but

in the United Kingdom that is what would be the driver&#146;s

side.</div> <a name="06042041000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wife of my

hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury had a horrible experience when

overtaking a Hungarian lorry on the M2 near the Minister&#146;s

constituency. She was pushed into the central barrier, and the young

Hungarian driver was aghast and horrified at what had happened. His

lorry was completely legal according to Hungarian regulations, but did

not have a wide-angled mirror fitted to the passenger side of his

lorry. As a result, he simply did not see her.</div>

<a name="06042041000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend had a similar

simple; it would require all HGVs in this country to have such mirrors

Belgium have already gone down that route. They have gone ahead of the

Commission and made it compulsory to fit class 4 wide-angled mirrors to

all HGVs. Analysis shows that the retrofitting of mirrors has been

effective. There is clear anecdotal evidence of the danger. The
