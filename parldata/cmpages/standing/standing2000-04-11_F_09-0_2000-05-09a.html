<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 9, line 6, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`—(1A) The Secretary of State may, by an order subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament, after consultation with such persons as may seem to him to have an interest,
<P>
(a) amalgamate,
<P>
(b) divide, or
<P>
(c) vary the area of operations of
<P>
one or more of such local learning and skills councils.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On a lovely late spring morning, we do not want to raise the temperature unduly. On casual perusal, the amendments tabled my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and myself for debate today might seem to be technical probing amendments that apply only to the nuts and bolts of the Bill. In a sense, they are technical, but they are no less significant for that. It is important for us to tease out of the Minister some of the Government's thinking on the balance between the Learning and Skills Council and its local committees with regard to the organisation, administration and delivery of educational resources. That is the serious and real-world issue that is at stake, although many of the Opposition amendments that will be debated today deal with more specific matters.
<P>
We are still concerned that the broad parameters set by the Government will reduce the role of local discretion in the provision and delivery of educational services. That risk is well illustrated by the Government's indicator figure of 10 to 15 per cent. as the proportion of the budget that will be used for local activities within the discretion of local learning and skills councils, although I appreciate that that figure may be subject to consultation and modification. The most generous interpretation of the total spend post-16 is approximately £6 billion. The maximum percentage specified would produce a total local spend of some £900 million. That must be set against a current total spend by the training and enterprise council movement of some £1.4 billion, plus local authority spend, either on adult and community education or on the youth and guidance services.
<P>
We shall discuss those figures in more detail later, but they show that there is something of a funding gap in relation to local discretion. Will the Ministers explain their intentions on funding and tell us how it will work? As I understand it, the broad intention is that most funding will be allocated by formula. That is important; for example, it could be a means of avoiding interference with the day-to-day business of further education colleges that have a reasonably certain means of obtaining funding. At the margin, however, a degree of discretion and flexibility for LLSCs will matter quite a lot, and, if such discretion is to mean anything, the funds must be adequate.
<P>
The amendment is, in a sense, a dry run for the wider argument. Ministers are faced with two options. On the one hand, they can argue that local learning and skills councils are a branch of the national Learning and Skills Council, although I was berated by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), for describing them as such. On the other hand, they can tell us that they are wonderfully autonomous, free standing and lively local agencies. Whichever they are, we need to know more about their role. The Minister can be allowed some latitude in expressing the Government's intentions in that respect. We do not want to give people who reply to LLSC advertisements the impression that they have nothing to do. None of us believes that—they will have a great deal to do. The amendment seems to go to the heart of the relationship The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council must establish a committee (to be called a local learning and skills council) for each area of England specified by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the Secretary of State has now, albeit after consultation, specified 47 such areas. The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for establishing the committee for each area. Ministers have made a great deal of the change from 72 TECs to 47 LLSCs, but they decided that.
<P>
In parenthesis, and given that inevitably we carry our constituency and local experience with us, I have no objection to the Minister's decision about Northamptonshire. It is very helpful that there is to be a single local learning and skills council, coterminous with the local education authority and, indeed, the existing TEC operations. In my view that was the right decision, although it was not an easy one. However, there will be other places where the relationship is less clear and the fit less perfect.
<P>
I expect that we shall several times discuss what is to happen in London. I understand the difficulties for Ministers. They could have adopted a London-wide solution with a single local learning and skills council, which would have been disproportionate to the rest of the country; a segment solution, with each one flowing to the centre; or a compromise, which is what they did. I do not say that their compromise is the least suitable. It was probably the best that they could reach, but they may want to explain their thinking about that. However, it is very much a top-down solution. The Secretary of State picks the areas and the Learning and Skills Council establishes the committee and, in effect, selects the membership. All that is within the general remit of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The amendment is designed to act as a fallback should the Secretary of State have made a wrong decision about the areas, or should his decision be overtaken by events. I defer to greater ministerial knowledge of the Bill if I have overlooked something, but I can see no provision in it to alter the areas, yet in local education authorities or almost any administrative structure, things change over time.
<P>
The amendment would enable the Secretary of State to make such changes. Probably—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—he would have the power to do that under the Bill. If he took the view that he had made a mistake, or if circumstances changed, he could, for the sake of argument, decide that instead of allowing Northamptonshire to stand alone, fewer areas, with an east midlands designation, would be preferable. That would not be welcome to me but perhaps it would be welcome to the regional development agency. I think that he could by fiat change the areas, although it is not clear from the Bill that he would have that power once they were established. Like the law of the Medes and the Persians they might not be alterable.
<P>
The Secretary of State should have the power to make changes, but not an unfettered power. It should require local consultation—or, strictly, consultation with such persons as may seem to him to have an interest—and should be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses, which would provide an important democratic filter. Whatever people may feel about established institutions, they often acquire an affection and commitment that is not justified by the facts. People become used to the arrangements and reluctant to change. We are not suggesting that a Secretary of State would say, ``I am going to cut all this out and I am only going to have 10. There it is, I am going to re-assign councils''. We are suggesting that the Secretary of State should have to act by consultation and with the approval of Parliament. If he goes through the relevant processes, then he should be able to alter the designation of the area.
<P>
Also covered in the group of amendments are a number of detailed points in relation to local learning and skills councils, including situations in which they operate cross border or in conjunction with other authorities. The specific amendment provides a procedure to allow the Secretary of State to change the designation of an area after consultation and democratic scrutiny. That would be a helpful power for the Secretary of State. The present difficulty goes to the heart of the problem I raised in my introduction. Either the LLSCs are the tool of the national council and ultimately the Secretary of State—and he may do with them as he wills—or they have a degree of local autonomy and local identity. If they are to have the latter, it is only right that the areas should be established and alterable only though a democratic process.
<P>
The amendment addresses this issue. We do not intend it as a wrecking amendment. It enables the Minister on behalf of the Secretary of State to define his powers and to give the Committee some idea of his thinking on this important, sensitive and potentially difficult relationship. This relationship is essential if this measure is to succeed. If it is not well thought out or is over centralised, and if the local learning and skills councils are merely adjuncts to the national agenda without an important local interest and discretion, then it will fail. That would be to the regret of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> Good morning, Mr. Benton.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has introduced a specific amendment that raises an important issue. He has talked in general about the local learning and skills councils. In his argument, he touched on themes that were discussed on Second Reading and that will arise at different stages during the Bill.
<P>
On the more general points, we emphasise that the learning and skills councils will have local discretion. I stress that that does not mean merely a 10 to 15 per cent. discretion. Local learning and skills council, will have a great deal of influence over the whole volume of business to be transacted. For that reason, we seek the very best men and women in local communities to serve on those bodies. There is much work to be done and many local decisions need to be taken. No public body—and certainly not this one—has to be at one end of the continuum or the other. The hon. Member was asking us to compare and contrast. A body does not have to be either fully autonomous or merely a branch of a national bureaucracy. Many bodies are neither one nor the other. I do not want to draw any comparisons with local government. However, anyone studying local government will realise that it is not a branch office of national government; nor is it fully autonomous, as it is subject to Government powers. It is important to emphasise that local learning and skills councils will be stronger, just as we want strength from the national strategy.
<P>
I sympathise with those hon. Members who seek reassurance that changes to LLSC boundaries, however small, will not be taken lightly and that they should come about only after extensive consultation with all interested parties. We have powers under clause 19(1) to make changes. I shall not be tempted into discussing the selection of particular areas. Such matters will always be difficult. The hon. Gentleman mentioned London as being a particular difficulty. Making local decisions was the subject of controversy in some localities. However, all my hon. Friends are now talking to me again, despite one or two of the decisions that were taken.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am happy to give an assurance about consultation. Indeed, we expect it to be normal practice for the LSC to propose changes to local boundaries if shortcomings in the current structure became evident. The Secretary of State would doubtless look favourably on all reasonable and considered proposals.
<P>
In earlier debates we repeatedly stressed the importance that we attach to the new arrangements being a partnership. That will mean a close and continuing dialogue with the full range or stakeholders in the new framework. It has always been our intention that the LSC should consult others when proposing structural changes to its method of operation, including decisions relating to LLSC boundaries. It is good practice and we expect it to happen as a matter of course.
<P>
I am happy to give the clear commitment that we expect the LSC to consult key partners, including RDAs and local authorities, before proposing changes to the local LSC boundaries. That expectation will be reflected in the LSC's management statement. However, we do not believe that parliamentary scrutiny of the internal boundaries of a single unitary non-departmental public body is appropriate. Regional development agencies produced the recommendations on which almost all the local LSC boundary decisions were based. It is entirely in keeping with that initial approach that we should expect proposed changes to local LSC areas to emanate from local concerns via the LSC itself.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to an important matter, but I hope, in the light of those assurances, that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suppose that the Minister's response was all right as far as it went. It certainly elucidated several matters. First, it became clear, in the absence of provisions such as those embodied in the amendment, that the council would, after taking advice, have the power to change the boundaries at will. That suggests a certain democratic deficit.
<P>
I have made a mental note—I do not often do so—to congratulate myself on having avoided using the words ``control freak'', but control clearly remains at the centre. That was reinforced by the Minister's wondering whether Parliament should interest itself in demarcation within what he described as a single unitary non-departmental public body—that is, the Learning and Skills Council. It is clear that we are not dealing with a federation of bodies under the broad tutelage of a national council, but with a single body that happens to have local operating arms.
<P>
I understand the Minister's sensitivity about control being a continuum. There is not an absolute moment when a body is either completely autonomous and can do what it likes—not least because it is constrained by other Acts of Parliament—or is totally controlled from the centre. I had a brief and slightly disconcerting experience of control freakery when I recently gave a speech in the post-lunch slot to a group of political scientists on behalf of the British Council in Berlin. At the very moment I opened my mouth, the building works at the French embassy, which is next door, opened up with a pile driver. I had to say to the assembled group—the alternative was to walk out in a huff—that I knew that Alastair Campbell was good but not that good.
<P>
It is clear that the body has become central. Ministers are now saying that they would be happy to consult about changes in the local demarcation. The Minister said that he wanted great flexibility, and that there would be many important decisions for the local learning and skills councils to take. He would want to say that to encourage recruitment to membership. I am sure that there will be important decisions to be taken. However, there is a difficulty if we shrink the discretionary budget available to the LLSCs and compare it with the budgets available to the existing training and enterprise councils, let alone to the local authority moneys that will come through community education or guidance—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Mr. Campbell is at it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, I am being overflown this time. As the man said, ``Just because you're not paranoid, it doesn't mean that they're not out to get you.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has delusions of grandeur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have been brought down to earth by the Minister. I will begin to close the point quickly.
<P>
The Minister said that there would be many important local decisions. We have shown the Committee—the Minister has not developed a contrary argument—that the sum of money with which discretion will be exercised is diminished. Although there are important decisions to be taken, not many can be taken because there is less money to finance them. I say to the Minister with the greatest respect that fine words butter no parsnips. His resistance to the amendment shows a readiness to countenance a democratic deficit in the Bill and insouciance about the importance of the local councils. I do not like that, and am minded to persist with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I should have intervened with regard to an earlier point at the beginning of the hon. Gentleman's speech but was enjoying it so much that I did not want to interrupt the flow. I would certainly never want to separate the Minister from his parsnips, buttered or otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Shadow Minister.
<P>
I should make one point clear because there was a misunderstanding. It will not be for the Learning and Skills Council to change the boundaries. Recommendations will flow from the locality, but the decision will rest with the Secretary of State. With regard to democratic deficits or the lack of them, I note that the Secretary of State is responsible to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily accept the Minister's correction just as he—possibly too readily—accepted my correction of his description of me as the Minister. In other circumstances I would say that that was a proleptic remark on his part.
<P>
We do not feel that the amendment is unreasonable. I am minded to test the mind of the Committee by persisting with it.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 9, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Not less than 40 per cent. of the members shall include persons who have current or recent non-public sector business or commercial experience.
<P>
(2B) In making appointments to a local council the Council shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the interests of small businesses in the area are represented on the local council.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Before appointing a Chairman of a local council the Secretary of State must consult organisations which appear to him to represent the interests of business in the area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The debate that we have just had helpfully foreshadows this one, which I hope will reach a more constructive conclusion.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 brings us back to the composition of local learning and skills councils, which is linked to the issue that we just debated about their autonomy. We have also touched on the issue of funding, to which we shall return in a moment, but it is important for the Minister to recognise that if the Government are to attract on to learning and skills councils businessmen and local leaders of the quality that they want, they will have to give them useful and important decisions to take. If I can put it this way without adopting wholeheartedly the approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry; the master chef will not come out of the kitchen from where he is preparing his piece de re´sistance in order to butter the parsnips. The Government must give learning and skills councils something important to do.
<P>
Turning to the composition of those councils, as the Bill stands, local learning and skills councils will be appointed by the central Learning and Skills Council, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. It would be helpful to know how the Government envisage using that power of approval and, perhaps, to have some idea of the circumstances in which approval might be withheld. Apart from that requirement to obtain the Secretary of State's approval, the Bill includes no other requirements relating to composition. We make no apology for returning to the issue of composition in order to emphasise the need for business experience. It is every bit as important, if not more important, that local learning and skills council should include members who have business experience as it is for the central Learning and Skills Council to include such members. Of course, the Committee will be aware that business leadership and representation is a key feature of the current system. Two thirds of the membership of training and enterprise councils at local level is made up of local business people. It seems all too likely to us that business leadership will be diluted under the new system. We hope that that does not prove to be the case, but it is our fear.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 offers Ministers another opportunity to give statutory backing to their assurances about business representation. Ministers have assured us that 40 per cent. of those committee members will have business experience—
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is helpfully nodding. If that is the Government's approach, they should have no objection to including a minimum figure in the Bill. We are aware of the Government's reluctance to prescribe membership either of the central Learning and Skills Council or of the local learning and skills councils, but we believe that it is necessary to put the matter on a firmer footing. If the Government are prepared to give that assurance, why should they not include a provision in the Bill? That is not to say that we regard 40 per cent. as a satisfactory figure, but it is the minimum figure suggested by the Government, and we want that minimum figure to be entrenched in the Bill.
<P>
We are also concerned to ensure that the interests of small businesses are represented, which is the purpose of paragraph (2B) of the amendment. We also want to give more say to local authorities, which is the purpose of paragraph (2C). Local authorities seem to be frozen out of the new system in many ways, and the amendment would at least give them more of a say.
<P>
Amendment No. 129 is slightly different. We believe that it would introduce a modest requirement. The Secretary of State, rather than the central Learning and Skills Council, will appoint one of the local learning and skills council members as chairman. It is interesting that that decision is in the hands of the Secretary of State. On the face of it, the fact that that power is reserved to the Secretary of State rather than granted to the central LSC seems to be yet one more example of a top-down approach. If the Secretary of State is to take the decision and not delegate it to the central LSC, it will, at the very least, be worth while for him to consult local business organisations on the decision. Will the Government explain their thinking on the provision?

<P>

<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): My concern about the chairman of the local LSC is not the same as that which the hon. Gentleman has expressed, and relates to whether the existing chief executive of the local training and enterprise council will automatically become the chairman of the new body. In my locality, there is concern that the new LSC approach will not work in that way, and that the existing chief executive will not automatically take over. Does the hon. Gentleman share that concern?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady makes an interesting point. The question whether the TEC chief executive is more likely to take over if the decision is in the hands of the Secretary of State rather than taken by the central LSC is moot. However, I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree that it must be in the interests of local business to be consulted by the Secretary of State before he takes the decision. Business may or may not have confidence in the chief executive of the TEC in question, but at least let us find out whether that is the case. One imagines that the Government would want consultation to occur; the amendment would specify that it should do so. We believe that the views of local businesses should be taken into account when the chairmanship of the local LSC is decided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The debate gives us a good opportunity to talk about the balances that should be struck in the membership of the local councils.
<P>
I turn first to amendment No. 128. Proposed paragraph (2A) would provide that not less than 40 per cent. of the membership of LSCs should be persons with current or recent business or commercial experience. The pros and cons of such amendments were debated at some length several times in another place. I reiterate that it is our firm intention that 40 per cent. of local LSC members will have recent business and commercial experience. We will do everything that we can to ensure high-quality applications from business people are sufficient to make that possible. We shall reflect in the guidance that we issue to selection panels our desired specification for the range and depth of different types of experience that we see as necessary for a local council that is capable of delivering the LSC agenda. However, the inclusion in the Bill of a requirement to that effect might cut across Nolan principles, under which the appointments will be made. We seek individuals who can bring their experience to the local LSCs rather than represent the organisations from which they come.
<P>
Paragraph (2B) would specify in the Bill the need to have regard to a particular sectoral interest—in this case, that of small businesses. Apart from causing practical difficulties of definition, such a change would open the door for amendments from other groups to be afforded the same treatment. I can, however, reassure hon. Members that the interests of small businesses will be represented in the new arrangements. It is important that we attract good applications, as, ideally, the different sectors of the economy should be represented. Another balance should be struck between what have been called the old and new economies. We will look to the range of business representation on LSCs to include people with different experiences, not least of small or medium-sized enterprises. We shall ensure that the LSC services meet the needs of small firms.
<P>
The Small Business Service, often working with national training organisations, will have a key role in promoting and giving advice on workforce development as part of its seamless service to small firms. Local LSCs will contract with Small Business Service franchises to provide support for SMEs on workforce development, including support for Investors in People and access to foundation or advanced modern apprenticeships and management development. The LSC will, however, remain accountable for meeting the national learning targets for Investors in People.
<P>
Paragraph (2C) seeks explicit representation of local authorities on local LSCs. I believe that our post-16 reforms introduce a new era for local authority involvement in post-16 education across the board. For the first time since 1992, local authorities, through their involvement in LSCs, will be fully connected to decisions on further education college provision. We are connecting them to work-based training. Through the new ConneXions service, we are providing for the first time a statutory basis for youth support in which local authorities, together with other agencies, will play a leading part.
<P>
Local authorities will, therefore, be at the heart of the work of LSCs. They will not just be deliverers of learning but key partners uniquely placed to provide vision and leadership for local communities and to ensure coherence between compulsory education and post-16 learning. As we will see during consideration of forthcoming clauses, that is why local authorities must be consulted early on the proposals for learning that local LSCs will draw up. It also explains why those LSCs must set out in their plans the adult provision for which LEAs will be responsible and for which the LSC will provide them with funding.
<P>
That central role requires effective local authority presence in local LSCs, which is why the Government have repeatedly said that we expect both the national LSC and the local LSCs to have members with current local authority experience. I would be delighted if local authority members were to apply successfully for positions on local LSCs. However, as I have said many times, we will not stipulate a quota for any particular group, and I do want members to act as designates of any particular sector, which is what the amendment would require.
<P>
Some months ago, we set out in our prospectus the sort of interests that we would like to see on local LSCs. We mentioned not only people with local authority experience, but those from the voluntary sector and employees involved in trade union representation. In addition, we referred to those concerned with the needs of young people, of people who have special learning needs, difficulties, disabilities or adult learning needs and of those who face discrimination. It would not be helpful in any of those cases—over and above the special case for business, in relation to which we have a stated aim of 40 per cent. representation—to play a numbers game and say that particular interests must have one or two places. That would not make sense.
<P>
I turn finally to amendment No. 129. I appreciate the concern of the hon. Member for Hertsmere to ensure that local businesses are represented on LSCs, as I have said they should be. However, I see no merit in stipulating tightly that the Secretary of State should consult local organisations before appointing a local LSC chairman or chairwoman. We have made clear our objective that the majority of chair positions on local LSCs will be filled by people with current or recent business or commercial experience. As I said, 40 per cent. of members of the national and local councils will have a business background.
<P>
We will ensure that Nolan principles of open recruitment are adhered to in making those appointments. Selections for the positions will be made purely on merit rather than as nominations for representation on the council. The local chair positions have therefore been advertised widely in order to attract suitable applications from a range of people, including those from business. We have worked closely with the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and other business organisations to encourage employers to become involved. We have held a series of regional conferences to promote awareness of the learning and skills councils. The chairman of Vauxhall Motors, Nick Reilly, has convened a business champions group, to encourage those with business experience to apply for the post of chair and/or membership of the local LSCs. I thank Nick Reilly and his colleagues for their hard work. We have taken extensive action to ensure that the interests of business are fully reflected in the LSCs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's clarification. As he has mentioned Nick Reilly, who is active in the motor industry, I am prompted to refer to the Rover situation—which is at last coming to an acceptable conclusion. Can he see the lead in such a case being taken by the local learning and skills council rather than the national council in future? As we move on from TECs, it would be useful to know whether or not there will still be a proper local handle on what is clearly a serious local, as well as national, employment issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It would be for local learning and skills councils to become involved in such a situation, or one involving a smaller company, alongside other partners, such as the Employment Service, in consultation with the RDA. Their role would be to examine the situation and the skills and training and learning implications arising from it. That is a valuable point.
<P>
It would not be right to specify who the Secretary of State should consult before making appointments. The matter should be left to him. Also, it would not be right to specify that he consult one set of interests only, albeit important ones.
<P>
Two other issues arose during the debate. In terms of the Secretary of State withholding approval of membership, we expect that to happen rarely, if ever. The Government have given commitments on the balance of local councils and there should be a reserve power to ensure that the balance can be secured in the unlikely event of a local LSC failing to achieve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister could describe more fully the balance he is referring to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The balance I refer to is between business—and we are aiming, subject to the Nolan principles, at 40 per cent. of the membership—and other sectors, such as local government, those with trade union experience, those in the voluntary sector and those interested in other aspects of education, adult education and community education. We are confident—given our commitments and the guidance we will be issuing—that the balance will be struck, and that the Secretary of State's reserve powers will not be used. However, in the unlikely event that the proposed membership of a learning and skills council did not strike the proper balance, the Secretary of State would require the reserve powers.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) raised a fear that has been expressed to her—if I understood her correctly—that a key character in a local TEC would take over the learning and skills council. I assure her that that will not be the case. Our objective is to draw on the good experience and good practice of the TECs, the FE sector and others such as those in adult and community education. That is our objective. Bad practice may have occurred in the past, but we want to be positive about utilising good practice. Although it can be complex, because TECs vary, we are giving as much guidance and reassurance as we can to the staff of existing organisations, not least to TECs. We hope that many of them will be bold and join the new Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Similarly, we are encouraging board members of TECs to apply; but they will have to apply because of the Nolan principles. I say that to my hon. Friend because, as I go around the country, I hear of misplaced fears that one or the other body will somehow take over the learning and skills councils. Some say that it will be a TEC takeover; some tell me that there will be a FE takeover. It is not like that. They are new bodies with a new policy and new institutions, and we need good men and women and true to come forward as employees or board members to help. There is no takeover.
<P>
With those reassurances, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response. I am slightly disappointed by it, but not entirely surprised. We have made a little progress, however, in that the Minister said that it is the Government's firm intention that 40 per cent. of local TECs should be business representatives.
<P>
I wondered whether the latter part of the Minister's remarks did not contradict his earlier comments, particularly when he said that he did not want to become involved in a numbers game. It seems that that is precisely what the Government are doing. The Government chose 40 per cent. as the minimum figure for business representation, and the amendment does not suggest a number, but uses the number given by the Government. It does not quibble with that figure, nor does it endorse it. It does not seek to introduce a different figure. It takes the figure given by the Government. The question is whether that figure should be included in the Bill. We shall want to reflect upon the reasons given by the Minister for not including it.
<P>
The Minister also spoke about balancing business representation with the other groups that he wishes to be represented on the committee. That, too, would be playing the numbers game, though without saying that particular interests are unworthy and should not be represented. If the committee is to consist of between 12 and 16 members, if between four and seven of them are to be members of the business community, and if the other interests that the Minister described in his list of balances must also be accommodated, the Government may use the power to withhold approval rather more often than he wishes.
<P>
I was a little concerned by the Minister's remarks about small businesses. He said that he did not wish people to represent particular sectors and speak for them alone. The Minister may not have taken into account just how important are the interests of small businesses. I draw his attention to the fact that proposed new Sub-Section (2B) does not set out a figure for small business representation. It merely asks councils to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the interests of small businesses in the area are represented on the local council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that the Government's proposals are in parallel with their proposals for the small business service, and that delivery will generally be co-extensive and coterminous with that service. Would not it be sensible to ensure that small business interests are intimately involved in the learning and skills side of the equation as well as in the small business side?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We want people who have a passion, as many people do, about learning and skills—our overall agenda—to apply to become members of the learning and skills councils, nationally or locally, rather than councillors, small business people or those with an interest in adult education who see themselves as delegates from those interests. We shall draw on experience of business, which is why we want people from small business. However, they will be involved not as delegates of any sector, but because they see the importance of the subject in the round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We would hope that all members of the committee would have the enthusiasm and passion described by the Minister, but the amendment is intended to ensure a hearing for the views of an important sector, particularly with respect to needs. The purpose of the local learning and skills councils is, among other things, to meet local needs. The people best placed to know those needs, especially for local small businesses, are the small business men. We hope that they will have the passion that the Minister described, but it is important for their needs to be met locally.
<P>
We are worried that everything is becoming more remote from small businesses. There are to be fewer LSCs than there were TECs; the power of appointment is to be vested in the central Learning and Skills Council; and the chairman is to be appointed by the Secretary of State. There is a slight danger in those circumstances that the interests of small businesses will not be attended to as they should. The best way to ensure that local needs are borne in mind by the local LSCs is for people from local business to be members—not disproportionately, but in a way representative of local business needs.
<P>
The debate has been useful, and we have taken it as far as we can. I shall want to reflect on the Minister's words, and to make progress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister say more about how he envisages the local learning and skills councils operating practically as they replace the TECs? Can he say a little more about obligations under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and about likely transfers of engagement of staff? What will be the relationship with the national Learning and Skills Council? Will the local staff be employed by it, with a single payroll, or will there be separate arrangements? What are the likely staffing and administrative costs of the local councils, bearing in mind the important points that have been generally accepted in the Committee, that local flexibility is needed, and that they will not and should not all be identical in scale?
<P>
Finally, may I hammer home the importance, in pursuit of balance and of the running of appointments by Nolan principles, of preserving a broad degree of political balance. We have already had a useful discussion about further education corporations, but with respect to the councils, whether we are considering local authority representatives or a wider range, it would be helpful in establishing credibility if appointments were seen to be made strictly on merit. None of us, however partisan we might be in other respects, would like to claim that our party was the sole repository of the relevant expertise or skills. It will go down much better if politically active opposition people with genuine relevant qualifications are not excluded, even when the Government changes. They should be seen as being properly able to do a local job. Will the Minister comment briefly on the way in which the local learning and skills councils will work and what they will cost? I am not suggesting that they will not give value for money; it is essential that local operations should deliver the Government's agenda. How will the difficult matters of staff transfers and undertakings be approached? It would be helpful for the Committee if the Minister could give us an assurance on political balance.
<P>
There is much detailed work to pursue. I do not intend to go on at length about other matters related to the principle of the clause—they either have been or will be covered by other amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): We have not supported a prescriptive method of selecting people for the local learning and skills councils. I am interested in points surrounding that matter, some of which came up in earlier debates. During debates on the role under the early clauses of the regional development agencies, the Minister clearly noted that RDAs would expect to be represented on each local learning and skills council. Will he confirm that there will be that they will be so represented?
<P>
Will the Minister spell out the way in which he will improve recruitment to the councils? Does he recognise that an historical problem with many such bodies has been that the same people on the same circuit have tended to be appointed to all of them? We probably all have experience in our local areas of meeting dynamic people, especially in the business sector, who are completely detached from local bodies such as TECs and LSCs. A concern is that we might replicate the situation with the same faces appearing on new organisations.
<P>
Does the Minister have ideas about how to attract people from the small business sector specifically, given that they frequently cannot spare the time? In some large local learning and skills areas, the question of whether an individual who runs a small business at one end of the county and cannot be spared for long can participate in a local council at the other end of the county will be determined by major factors such as travel times.
<P>
Will the Minister say whether the Government have learned lessons from the example of the police authorities, over which the previous Government attempted to create greater central control? In particular, the Secretary of State appointed the chairmen. Will the Minister say whether the Government will seek to be as hands off as possible in terms of the Secretary of State's involvement and that they will allow local bodies to appoint their own chairmen and get on with work when competent to do so, rather than seeking to interfere. There are examples of people being appointed to police authorities who were felt to have no significant local connection. A person might run a business locally but not be perceived as being part of the local community. Too much involvement from the centre might result in wrong appointments of people who look good on paper but who do not command local credibility or have local information, even though they own a business in an area.
<P>
Will the Minister suggest the extent to which local learning and skills councils will be co-ordinated with the Small Business Service? In my own area, Sheffield chamber of commerce and industry has just been awarded the small business service contract. However, the department and structure are different there—we did not have a combined community consortium for education and training.
<P>
Some TEC staff transferring to the new local learning and skills council will have a role for the Small Business Service. Will there be sufficient flexibility for people to take all their skills forward, or will some be lost as the SBS and the TECs diverge? We have regeneration partnerships in urban areas—an objective 1 structure is being established in my area. We are concerned that local learning and skills councils should be able to mesh effectively with such organisations. If staff are required to be seconded between bodies, local learning and skills councils should be able to participate without being too hidebound by their own interests.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will also be able to address the local learning and skills councils' style of working. To return to my point about attracting business people, there is a Yorkshire attitude, which I am sure is also common elsewhere; people feel that they are getting on with running their businesses and want to call a spade a spade. Those people are put off by the exclusivity of some of the language used. The Minister talked about engaging people who are passionate about learning and skills. Many business people will not use even that sort of language. They will be passionate about their businesses and about generating more business, but the phrase ``learning and skills'' is difficult for them. When the university for industry was set up, a poll was carried out to test the word ``university'' as a concept among the people whom the university wanted to attract. Many people found the word off-putting. They also found the word ``industry'' off-putting, so the university now markets itself as Learning Direct.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a serious issue here. I often talk to representatives of the Engineering Employers Federation, which is not involved with many of the bodies that we have mentioned, although it would like to be. They are put off because when they say, ``The engineering sector needs more electricians'', they are faced with papers, jargon-ridden statements about units of delivery and grant funding and people who are talking a different language. If we are to rejuvenate structures and engage new people, it is important that to use not only those who have experience of the delivery of learning industry, but those who are engaged with their own businesses who have a feel for the needs of business in their area. I hope that the Minister will assure us that local LSCs will work in such a way that people can say, ``We need more electricians'', and receive an appropriate response without being excluded by technical jargon and ways of working to which they cannot relate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> There has been a flurry of questions, and I shall do my best to deal with them, but I shall examine the record afterwards and, if I need to provide more detail, I shall do so in writing.
<P>
On the important issues of TUPE and staffing, this is a critical year because we are involved in a substantial management of change operation. Although we look forward to an ambitious future, I understand that this might be a worrying time from the point of view of the individual staff member who thinks about his or her own future. We expect the majority of staff to transfer under TUPE arrangements to new organisations. The difficulty is that TECs vary a great deal; the TEC is not a single creature. In one area, it might have links with the chamber of commerce. In another, it might not. Therefore, in some cases, staff and inspectorates will be transferred to the new LSCs, but others may wish to transfer to the Small Business Service or to the Employment Service. Similarly, although I do not think that this was specified, some functions of the Further Education Funding Council will be transferred to the Learning and Skills Council, but others will be transferred to the adult learning inspectorate and others still to Ofsted. Therefore, there are different possibilities for the transfer of staff.
<P>
I want to reassure the Committee that we have been in close contact with both individual TECs and the TEC national council in trying to oversee the management of change operation as wisely and sensitively as possible. We issued a detailed statement on the last day of March about the TUPE arrangements, and we believe that the management of change is being undertaken as efficiently as possible. My colleagues at the Department are working very hard on that.
<P>
On pay and who employs the staff, both the local and national LSC staff will be employees of the Learning and Skills Council. In that sense, there will be a single payroll. The issue of politics was raised. We are monitoring the political interests, where they exist, of those joining learning and skills councils. However, we are not interested in a person's politics or party political activity. We are eager to see people with an interest in learning and skills appointed to the councils. We expect to find people with different party political interests—and with none—serving on the councils. I assure the hon. Gentleman of our good intentions in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I am grateful for the Minister's thoughtful and sensitive response to the issues raised. Would he agree with me that the crucial requirement is that council members should be able to work closely, effectively and in a non-partisan fashion with others holding different party affiliations, or none?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes. Indeed, the diplomatic approach adopted to this issue and the relationships fostered will be a test of the local councils. I see no barriers to the councils achieving a positive outcome.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about staff levels. We think that there will be 4,700 staff all the learning and skills council, about 4,200 of whom will be employed by local councils. The exact number of staff for each LSC will vary according to the size of the community it serves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I apologise for my late arrival today. Does the Minister anticipate any offsetting reduction in staff levels in other organisations, particularly local education authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I do not anticipate any staffing implications for LEAs. However, the Further Education Funding Council and the TECs will be wound up.
<P>
Many of those employed by those organisations will transfer to the new ones. As the hon. Gentleman will understand, there will be an annual saving of £50 million because of the new arrangements, which will be spent on front-line learning and skills provision.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) raised a number of points. One concerned the RDAs. We will have other opportunities to discuss these. We have already had occasion to discuss the relationship between the LSC and RDA. A senior figure from the RDAs will attend meetings of the local learning and skills council, which is one way of ensuring a relationship between the two bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Minister confirm that the RDA official will not be a member of the council, but an observer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, they will not be members, although I shall seek clarification on that point, as it is possible that I am wrong.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam suggested that we need some new faces on these bodies. I understand his point. However, I do not want to typecast those who have given good service on TECs and elsewhere as old faces to be despatched to the dustbin of social history. I see much of the success of the councils— and we are determined they will be successful—depending on our ability to attract such people, including TEC board members. I believe that many people, given encouragement and access, would be excellent members of the bodies. They may not always understand the jargon, but we need to attract them to join the organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree with the Minister that many of those who have already given service have done a good job. It is they who have often reported to me their difficulty in funding or persuading people to join them. I am worried that unless we get it right, we shall have the same difficulty. We may be able to identify the right people but not persuade them to become involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are doing our utmost to persuade such people, and in a variety of ways, including national and local advertisements. I have also written to every right hon. and hon. Member urging them to encourage good people to come forward. I repeat now that we need to encourage the best and those with the greatest experience to come forward, and not the usual committee types. I hope that all hon. Members can help in their own communities.
<P>
The relationship between the LSC and the Small Business Service is vital. I repeat that we must be sensitive to the needs of small businesses, and that must be reflected in the membership of the Learning and Skills Council. It is important that the SBS and the LSC should work closely together when considering the skill needs of local businesses. I take on board and shall reflect what was said about communication and the language that we use. I shall answer the hon. Member for Daventry on the question about RDA membership shortly.

Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local councils</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 61, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Director
<P>
Al.—(1) The Council must appoint one of its employees as the director of a local council.
<P>
(2) The Council must seek the advice of the chairman of a local council before appointing a director.
<P>
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply to the appointment of the first director of a local council.
<P>
(4) If a person to be appointed as a director of a local council is not already a member of that local council, the Council must appoint him as a member of the local council for the same term as the term of his appointment as director.
<P>
(5) If a person to be appointed as a director of a local council is already a member of that local council but his term of appointment as such ends before the term of his appointment as director ends, the Council must extend his term of appointment as a member so that it ends when the term of his appointment as director ends.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 177, 178 and amendment No. 163, in page 62, line 2, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but such persons shall not thereafter be employed in a dual capacity'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 176, 177 and 178, and I shall deal with amendment No. 163 once I have heard what the Opposition have to say.
<P>
The amendments were tabled in response to the representations that we received when the provisions were being discussed in another place. They are designed to ensure that the executive director of the local learning and skills council should also be a member of that local council. The provisions of amendment No. 176 correspond to the provisions relating to the chief executive of the national council in schedule 1, which we have already discussed. Amendments Nos. 177 and 178 are consequential.
<P>
Having signalled our intention to make this amendment, we stated in recent advertisements that the executive director would be a member of the local LSC. That seemed only right and sensible if we were to attract the best candidates. The post of executive director of the local LSC will be challenging and demanding. He or she will be responsible for an average of £100 million a year of public fund, and for the key task of improving the quality and choice of learning for more than 100,000 learners. The director will also be responsible for managing a team of 80 or 90 staff.
<P>
If, as we expect, the local LSCs enjoy substantial flexibility in their response to locally drawn up statements of needs and priorities, it is essential that the executive directors play a full part in the decision making process of their local LSCs. The local chairman will, of course, play a leading role in appointing and appraising the performance of the local executive director, but the latter will be accountable to the chief executive of the LSC for the propriety and efficiency of the budget and the management of resources locally. To allow that accountability to work, the executive director must have a real say in the allocation of the council's resources. That can be brought about only if the executive director is a member of the local council.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) for explaining his position.
<P>
We have already heard about the Government's position on the incorporation of the chief executive into the national council. If we were to do that, it would be consistent to do it in both cases, although we still have some reservations about the wisdom of having a chief executive on a board as a matter of course, rather than as a matter for separate decision. I appreciate that there are special considerations in the public sector, because of the director's role as accounting officer, but the Minister rather slipped over the point about whether am executive director must be a member of a board in order to meet his responsibilities for carrying out the decisions of that board.
<P>
Our amendment deals with positions of difficulty and possible friction. The Minister said that he would return to that issue. It has become increasingly and depressingly clear, as successive Ministers have answered questions about the operation of local learning and skills councils, that the local councils will be very much under the control of the centre. Their employees will be employees of the centre, as will the local director, notwithstanding his membership of the local council. The scope for the local autonomy, flexibility and discretion that Ministers want will, arguably, be prejudiced from the start. Ministers will need to show that the people who become executive directors, following advertisement and the whole process of appointment, are big hitters in their own right, have a mind of their own and will be able to do the job. Inevitably, there will be suggestions that they might be the centre's narks, that they are accountable to the national council and that their loyalties may be stretched. That may apply especially in cases in which there is a difference of view. That is the subject of our amendment.
<P>
The national council may set its own finding, according to a formula or by nationally definable criteria, and say that beyond that—and within the 10 to 15 per cent. zone of flexibility identified by Ministers—it is for local councils to decide their priorities. The question of whether that is the right figure is for discussion on another occasion. In that case, the local councils should be able to make their decisions as they wish. However, it is at least theoretically possible that a local decision could be contrary to a national decision, and there might be a good reason for that. None the less, the director and his staff, all of them employees of the national council, would find themselves with torn loyalties, because the local learning and skills council, for which Ministers want the maximum flexibility and local voice, has taken a different view. My concern is that both sides will say that the director is not on their side—[Interruption.] As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) says, sotto voce, the director may find himself in the position of the third way. I am sure that hon. Members will remember the unfortunate position of those who try to ride both horses—they find that they fall victim to nasty accidents.
<P>
If the national council simply lays down national formulae and criteria and the local council does everything else, there should never be a clash, because the local council's discretion will always be additional to the national effort and never contrary to or qualifying it.
<P>
Otherwise, conflict could well arise. With a national council and 47 local councils, which are bound to see things in slightly different ways, there is a real possibility of conflict. I do not envy a director who finds himself caught in the crossfire.
<P>
I am sure that Ministers will have thought about all that and will say that directors need to be paragons of tact in handling the various pressures, but they must find a way of doing their job without deconstructing themselves in the process or giving rise to recrimination. Can the Minister take us through how he sees the provision working?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall first address a couple of points that the hon. Gentleman has made, beginning with a general point. There is no institution in this country where there does not have to be a proper balance between the national and the local, but balance is not the same as clash and conflict, and we have made it clear throughout the Committee's proceedings that we envisage a proper dialogue between the national and the local. We are talking about balancing those interests. The executive director will have to do that, but we do not envisage the inevitable institutional conflict suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I should make it clear that we view only the executive director in this way. Apart from the local executive director, we do not intend to allow individual members to be appointed both as local council members and as LSC employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. Indeed, I was hoping that he would be able to give that assurance, but paragraph 4(2) of the schedule says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council may appoint such of its employees—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as modified by amendment No. 178—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as it thinks fit to act as the staff of a local council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore fairly clear that they remain council employees, although they are staffing and conducting the activities of the local council. Therefore, there must still inevitably be some tension between their position as employees of one body and their need to answer to the instructions of the local council. I simply say that to qualify what the Minister has just said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that, but at the heart of his worries is a familiar refrain that we have heard from Conservative Members. We are doing our best to reassure them about it, but they seem pretty defiant in refusing to be reassured, no matter what we say. However, I shall continue to try to reassure them, as will my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment.
<P>
Although local staff will be employees of the LSC, which will be a unitary organisation, it is clear—and has been clear in everything that I and my hon. Friends the Education Minister and the Welsh Minister have said—that decisions on local provisions will be made by the local council and carried out by local staff. We do not accept that there will be the conflict of interest suggested by the hon. Member for Daventry. The National Council will not second guess every decision.
<P>
I return to the fundamental reason for this provision and for tabling the amendment. I think that we all accept that the executive director is in a special position. With the financial accountability that comes with the post, which I hope that all members of the Committee agree is important, it is clearly essential that directors play a full part in the council's decision making. It would make the job very difficult, if not impossible, if they did not do so. Therefore, we have tabled the amendment to ensure that executive directors are full members of local LSCs. I have told the hon. Member for Daventry that we are determined that local LSCs will play a full part in the decision-making process, and I can also assure him that the executive director will not be a nark, as he put it. In the light of those reassurances, I hope that he will not press his amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 161 in page 61, line 24, after `member', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or Chairman'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 162, in page 61, line 25, leave out `to the Council'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Amendment No. 161 mirrors an earlier debate. Paragraph 1(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is to hold and vacate office as a member or as chairman of a local council in accordance with the terms of his appointment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, paragraph 1(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On ceasing to be a member a person is eligible for re-appointment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that a person who was a chairman but not an ordinary council member might not be eligible, which seems odd. However, I may have misread the paragraph, or the Under-Secretary may intend to reconsider the provision, and I should be grateful for his reassurance.
<P>
Amendment No. 162 relates to circumstances where notice is to be given that a member has resigned. Clearly, a local secretariat for local learning and skills councils—Ministers have mentioned the numbers involved—will have to meet, produce minutes and so forth. However, I presume that the appointment of, and resignation of, local council members will be dealt with centrally by a council secretariat, which will no doubt have a database from which Ministers can draw information on declared political affiliations and ranges of interest.
<P>
I am not seeking to overturn the Government's proposals, but it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could explain who will run the secretariat for local learning and skills councils, and keep score in respect of members. With regard to those with important jobs and responsibilities, there must be clear evidence of membership, the tabling of resignations, and to whom resignations are tabled, so that responsibilities can be terminated at that point, or in accordance with law. We must all know where we stand, so it should be made clear whether a person is a member or has resigned.
<P>
In sum, as I said, amendment No. 161 mirrors an earlier debate on a potential slight inelegance in the Bill, and amendment No. 162 would ensure that the proper score is kept in relation to important appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am having a difficult time this morning. I habitually resist amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry, but, somewhat strangely, I am tabling one of our own. I am yet more confused, because I welcome amendment No. 161 and want to thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling it. It makes a useful drafting change that will help to ensure consistency between the provisions in paragraphs 1(1) and 1(2). We intend that both a member and a chairman of a local council should be eligible for reappointment. Members of the Committee may be aware that, having discussed the matter in another place, we agreed that we must ensure a consistent approach by allowing chairmen and members of both the national LSC and local LSCs to be eligible for reappointment. We are looking carefully at what can be done to that end, and if the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment we will consider tabling a Government amendment to that effect on Report.
<P>
I revert to type with amendment No. 162, which would require that members of local LSCs will have to give written notice if they want to resign, but that they will not have to give it to the national LSC. We oppose the amendment—I am not sure what its intent is meant to be. Opposition Members value the Secretary of State's important role in this regard. Their suggestion may be that the resignation letter should be sent to the Secretary of State instead. However, the expression on their faces does not suggest that that is their intention, so I shall move on.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
As we established earlier, local LSCs and the national LSC form one unitary organisation. The national LSC will appoint members of the local LSCs. Although appointments are subject to the Secretary of State's agreement, it would be appropriate for the LSC to be informed in writing of a member's intention to resign.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked who would maintain and perform the role of what might be called the secretariat, which would keep a register of members. The national LSC will do so. I hope that that clarification will encourage the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. I assure him that on Report we shall introduce an amendment that will have the effect of amendment No. 161.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It was my first political mentor, and the predecessor of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, the late Iain Macleod, who memorably said that one should not set out to shoot even a one-legged Santa Claus. If the Under-Secretary wants to cast himself in the role of Santa Claus—he has taken note of Opposition amendments and given an undertaking to improve them—who am I to discourage him? I shall help to facilitate his undertaking by not pressing the amendment. We tabled amendment No. 162 to seek clarification, which the Under-Secretary provided perfectly satisfactorily. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 61, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Committees
<P>
( )—(1) A local council must establish a young people's committee and an adult learning committee.
<P>
(2) Members of a committee may be (but need not be) members of the council.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment explores the role of adult learning in local LSCs. We do not want the Government to reject the amendment on the grounds that it contains technical mistakes. We therefore used the wording of schedule 3, which states that the national LSC will have a young people's learning committee and an adult learning committee. The amendment would apply that arrangement to local LSCs. The Government said that they will issue guidance to encourage local LSCs voluntarily to establish an adult learning committee and a young people's learning committee.
<P>
We believe, for various reasons, that that arrangement should be prescribed in the Bill. If the national structure involves a young people's learning committee and an adult learning committee, it would help the national LSC if that structure were replicated at local level. There would be direct channels of communication between the committees and the local organisations.
<P>
We are also concerned about the role of adult learning in the overall structure. Adult learning is currently patchily provided for across the country. If the Bill's structure is to improve the situation, we must secure better provision for adult learning across the country. If we simply rely on voluntary guidance that suggests that such steps should be taken, those areas in which adult learning is currently weakest will receive the least emphasis in the new structure.
<P>
A particular concern is the fact that the Bill emphasises and prioritises learning for 16 to 19-year-olds. While we do not dispute that that is a major issue, it should not be prioritised to the exclusion of provision for those over the age of 19. If local learning and skills councils were required to set up the proposed committees, it would help to ensure that they bear in mind the twin focuses: learning for those under 19 and for those over 19.
<P>
In the context of our recent debate on membership, the amendment's proposal that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Members of a committee may be (but need not be) members of the council<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would add additional weight to the local learning and skills councils. Assuming that we are able to overcome the recruitment problems, it will be difficult to satisfy all the relevant interests in an individual local learning and skills council, which will have a relatively small membership. The committees could broaden overall membership by bringing in interested parties with specialist knowledge of various sectors. For example, it may be appropriate to include in the membership of the young people's learning committee LEA representatives who could not be accommodated on the main local learning and skills committee. On the adult learning committee, a significant role could be played by people on the training provision side who could not be accommodated on the main committee.
<P>
The committees could create a positive, dynamic tension. As we have already discussed, there may be competition for resources between the two sectors. Young people will have a greater mandatory entitlement to services than adult learners, who will receive them on a more discretionary basis. It would be advantageous to local learning and skills councils if their structures reflected the honest tension in the distribution of resources between the two sectors. Properly constituted committees could present serious and costed plans for debate in the local learning and skills council, having established separate priorities for the two sectors.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary recognises that the amendment is intended to be constructive, and that he will seriously consider making it a statutory requirement. That would give much encouragement to the adult learning sector in particular. The issuing of guidance will not be strong enough to ensure that the local learning and skills councils offer uniformly good provision and are a genuine improvement on the structures that have gone before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have to disappoint Liberal Democrat Members by saying that I shall not be advising my hon. Friends to support the amendment. Were my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) here, rather than engaged in important duties for the House, I would embark on some Latin by way of explanation. However, as he is not, I shall quote in English the principle of Occam's razor, by which one should not multiply entities beyond necessity. A degree of restraint is advisable in imposing statutory committees. While we do not oppose the committees that the Bill proposes on a national level, we do not seek them at local level. A level of tension will be necessary—that point was well made—and I hope that Ministers will respond positively in envisaging how that might work.
<P>
I should like to draw on two points from the comments of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. First, it is important to involve a number of less conventional people in the process. It often becomes necessary—especially on reaching the mature, decision-making years—to try to break out of the circle of people whom one knows, understands and has confidence in. Some wackier, less typical people may have a real contribution to make. That is especially true in relation to young people. Regardless of whether there is a statutory committee, I hope that Ministers and the national and local councils will take account of the fact that young people themselves are among the best to ask about these things. They should be involved and asked how they see matters from their end of the telescope. We must get hold of people who do not normally fall into the net of public appointments but who can contribute from their own experience. There need not be rivalry or division across the Committee on that issue, which Ministers should consider in making appointments.
<P>
My second concern, which may be embedded in the proposals of the hon. Member for Hallam, is that there should be no displacement of adult education interest. This Standing Committee is fortunate, and perhaps to some extent unusual, in having a fairly strong representation of Members with a commitment to adult and continuing education. I do not wish to single out individuals, but that is evident across the Committee.
<P>
From the point of view of competitiveness and personal fulfilment, it is important that people should participate in education and training at all ages. I have no difficulty in principle in subscribing to the lifelong learning agenda. Therefore, we must represent those interests in some way or have regard to them. In view of the pressures on young people, who have a clamant interest in obtaining qualifications and starting their career, we must guard against the tendency to marginalise or to treat as the solely important figure that for expenditure on adult education. I said earlier that including all the socially excluded young people would cost us another £500 million, which would have a remarkable tip-over effect on the adult education budget, unless the total budget was expanded.
<P>
To go back to earlier discussions, relating to fee charging, there would be an effect on the total budget if the Government were to remit part-time fees for under 19-year-olds, and that might affect adult learners, unless the budget was increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): If I may follow the hon. Gentleman's line of thought, did he understand the Minister to say in Committee last week that the Learning and Skills Council would pick up the tab for remitting fees for 16 to 19-year-old part-time students in further education, or that the colleges that provided the education would pick up the tab? That was not clear from the Hansard record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The short answer is that we do not know yet, and a number of people are asking that question. Indeed, I left the Committee earlier to have a telephone conversation about that matter. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that.
<P>
The point remains that, unless we are to assume a boundless budget, there will inevitably be some tension between the various interests. I have no objection to the hon. Member for Hallam tabling his amendments for a statutory rehearsal of these issues. Whether or not that is done, and I should prefer it not to be done by that format, Ministers must understand, and they must level with the Committee and with their appointees to the national and local councils, that these issues must be thought about and an inevitable clash between claims on resources reconciled. I hope that Ministers will respond positively to the points that are weighing on the minds of a number of hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I assure the hon. Member for Hallam that we are not opposed to the amendment on technical grounds. However, our instincts are very much with the hon. Member for Daventry. We shall resist accepting the amendment for precisely the reasons that he so cogently put forward. As I think hon. Members are beginning to realise, we have a revulsion against being overly prescriptive—[Interruption.] I note gestures and noises of assent from Opposition Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In case animal noises should be misinterpreted, I want to place on the record my view that the jury is still out on whether the Minister has a revulsion against over-prescription.
<P>
<H5>12.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the Opposition are gradually, if not decisively, coming round to our point of view.
<P>
We are sympathetic to many of the points made by the hon. Member for Hallam and I shall come to those in a moment, but I want to explain why we must resist the amendment. It is identical to an amendment tabled by Baroness Sharp in Committee in another place. The Government were able to reassure the noble Lady that her amendment was unnecessary and I hope that, following my comments today, the hon. Gentleman will be similarly convinced.
<P>
One of the prime responsibilities of the national council will be to focus on achieving the national learning targets. It will want to consult the national adult learning and young people's learning committees to obtain help to achieve national level 4 targets. I hope that those ambitious targets for level 4 achievements will reassure hon. Members of the degree of our commitment to adult learning. We have no doubt about its importance. Much of what we have said and the documents that we have issued stress its importance not just for national economic success, but for individual fulfilment. That is common ground in the Committee and I would not want there to be any doubt about our commitment to it.
<P>
At local level, we shall expect LSCs to pursue that agenda and to seek the advice of experts on their locality. Those experts may be in local learning partnerships, RDAs, local authorities, the Employment Service, the university for industry, local economic development partnerships and so on. Local LSCs may wish to consult the adult learning and young people's learning committees. They may want to form such committees at a local level and we have no problem with that. There are many circumstances in which that would be wholly beneficial.
<P>
We understand the point made by the hon. Member for Hallam about the need to introduce fresh blood. We agree with that and I want to stress, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary did a few moments ago, that that has no implications for those who have served so loyally and well already, but, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, we constantly need fresh blood and to rejuvenate our thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify that, if local learning and skills councils decide to set up committees, particularly young people's or adult learning committees, they will be able to put on those committees persons who are not members of their own councils?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Yes, I can confirm that. The crucial point is that we want local learning and skills councils to have substantial flexibility in deciding how best to meet their local needs and how to manage relationships in their localities. It follows from that that they will have the freedom to introduce new blood and it will often be beneficial for them to do so, but it is precisely because we are so keen to allow local flexibility that we do not want to state in the Bill that every local LSC must set up local committees in the form proposed in the amendment whether they deem it appropriate or not.
<P>
The formal status of the local LSCs is clearly set out in clause 19. They are committees of the national council. To specify in the Bill what sub-committees the local LSCs should establish is one layer of bureaucracy and prescription too many. The decision about whether to set up a local young people's learning committee or an adult learning committee must rest with the local LSCs. The Government's advice to the national council will reflect that view. I hope that, in the light of what I have said, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We were seeking to get the Government's views on record about their commitment to ensuring complete coverage by the local LSCs. We have received a clear assurance from the Minister that that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I intervene only to put right an omission. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) asked me a question, which I overlooked in my haste and excitement. The answer is the LSC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his diligence in picking up on all the points made. Would that all Ministers in all Committees were similarly diligent.
<P>
We are grateful to the Minister for agreeing with us that the role of adult learning is important—a point that we wanted to tease out. I was also interested to hear of the flexibility that local LSCs will have. We certainly support that. The fact that they will be able to form their own committees as they wish and draw up their own membership satisfies us in respect of some of the points that we were trying to make in the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I hope to be able to deal with this amendment in short order. Paragraph 7 of schedule 2 provides that a local learning and skills council may regulate its own procedure. Amendment No. 164 would require the council
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wherever possible to make its deliberations available to the general public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have argued in favour of openness throughout our discussion of the Bill, and we would like to explore through the amendment the issue of openness for local learning and skills councils. We wonder whether it will be possible for them to organise their proceedings in such a way as to maximise their openness to the public and to those with an interest in their activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have a great deal of sympathy with the instinct behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I should like to take this opportunity to assure him that it is unnecessary. We shall deal with this issue by means of the code of conduct that will be drawn up for LSC members and staff. The code will form part of the management statement which the Department will agree with the LSC as part of the LSC's framework document, in line with other non-departmental public bodies.
<P>
We briefly touched on the code of conduct and its purpose earlier in Committee, and I would like to restate its functions. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Hertsmere. The document will provide LSC board members and staff with valuable guidance on how they should conduct their day-to-day business. It will provide guidance on several issues, including those at the heart of the amendment: openness and responsiveness. Under that heading, we propose that the code of conduct will advise board members and staff that they should conduct all their dealings with the public in an open and responsible way, and ensure full compliance with the principles of the citizens charter and the code of practice on access to Government information.
<P>
In practice, that will mean that, whenever possible, the national and local LSCs should make provision for access to records of their decisions and should publicise arrangements made. They should ensure that they can demonstrate that they are using resources to good effect and with propriety, and without giving grounds for criticism that public funds are being deployed for private, partisan or party political purposes. We will also expect the LSC to build on good practice in the further education sector. After every council meeting, the Further Education Funding Council publishes a bulletin entitled ``Council News''. The hon. Member for Daventry nods his head—as a former Minister, he will remember the format of that bulletin. It summarises the issues considered and decisions taken at meetings, excluding, of course, confidential matters. It also deals with advice received by the council from its committees, and the decisions that they take. In addition to the regular circulation, the bulletin is also available on the internet.
<P>
The LSC's code of conduct will also recommend that internal procedures should be made available to deal with complaints, including the failure to provide information. The code of conduct will form part of a set of documents that will constitute the basis of the LSC's operating principles. Of course, we will expect all board members and staff to adhere to the code of conduct. I hope that that reassurance will enable the hon. Member for Hertsmere to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It has been a useful debate, and I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his remarks. On the basis of those remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The issue of allowances, which is dealt with in paragraph 3, is an important one that relates to the schedule as a whole. In earlier debates we discussed attracting members. This is not a partisan issue, but tension exists in respect of a range of public appointments. Although people should be motivated by a wish to serve the public, and we do not want to create a class of professional quangocrats who simply claim allowances from various sources, we also want to provide proper recompense. For example, regional development agencies provide their members with an allowance, and I hope that we can consider the issue of regional development agency members' membership of local LSCs in this debate.
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, school governors get no reward. Recruiting members of school governing bodies, particularly from the business sector, is a real issue. Those bodies frequently meet at times that are inconvenient for those in the business sector. Such people rightly feel that they simply cannot afford to get involved in public service if the cost will prove significant. As I have said, in the context of a local LSC that covers a large county, the cost for a member who must travel 40 miles each way to attend a meeting will be significant, in terms not only of his travelling expenses, but lost business and lost time.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain how allowances will work. Will there be a national pattern for LSCs, or local variation in allowances for travel and lost earnings subsistence? Will there be a cash reward, as it were, for people who participate in councils? A clear idea of the Government's thinking on the matter would be helpful at this stage. Has the Under-Secretary undertaken market testing of what is being offered, and will it help to recruit suitable people to these bodies?

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I echo the sentiments that have been expressed, and I have nothing substantive to add to our consideration of the schedule, save a point prompted by the hon. Gentleman's remarks. With all the caveats that he rightly mentioned, we should consider the question of allowances for members of local councils. They may co-opt people into such other advisory bodies—for example, a non-statutory adult learners committee—as they deem appropriate. If such people are then faced with a substantial journey and attendant costs, would members of local LSCs be empowered, or ought we to consider whether they should be empowered, to provide appropriate allowances for such people? The provision of allowances for council members is specified, but provision for staff because of the nature of their employment is a different matter. We should recognise at least some of the expenses that are incurred by other people who may be enlisted to help, and we support their enlistment in that regard.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I, too, will make a brief intervention about the extent to which the schedule will encourage openness. I believe that there is nothing in the schedule that would prevent a local LSC, if it so wished, from holding part of its proceedings in public in the spirit of openness. Is it the Government's policy to encourage such a development? Some of the business, by virtue of its nature, will need to be dealt with in private session, but there is a long and honourable tradition in local government of organising business in that way. The public could have full sight of what a local LSC was doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I thank Committee members for their contributions to this short debate. Many useful interventions were made, and I hope to respond to each of them. Committee members are as one in agreeing that these detailed and important provisions deal with the tenure of members and the circumstances in which they may be reappointed.
<P>
The schedule makes provision for allowances to be paid but, in view of the role that we expect members to play, we do not believe that salaries should be covered for the reason that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) gave: namely, that we want members to have a passion for education, learning and skills. The payment of a salary might send the wrong cultural signal. We accept the point that the hon. Member for Hallam made about expenses. We should offer expenses, including those for child care, and we should consider offering compensation for lost earnings. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be local variations in the allowances that are paid. There should be consistency of approach among local LSCs.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) made an important point about openness and transparency. I assure him that there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent local LSCs from holding their proceedings in public, and that we will encourage them to do so, subject to the caveats that he mentioned.
<P>
We have discussed in detail several specific provisions relating to the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not require a definitive answer today, but will the Under-Secretary undertake at least to consider the point that I raised? I said that if allowances were paid to members of a council, they might also be available in certain circumstances to people who are called in to advise the LSC, who may work on an informal committee. They make real commitments of time and suffer inconvenience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> With the hon. Gentleman's permission, I shall write to him about that matter when I have had a chance to consider it more fully.
<P>
With that exception, I hope that I have reassured Committee members about the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To assist the Under-Secretary in retaining his record for diligence, will he respond to the point about RDA membership of local LSCs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for keeping me so diligently to my task. I intended to clarify the matter. There will be a senior member of the RDA on the national LSC and on local LSCs. I hope that that gives him the clarity that he sought. I apologise for having overlooked it again in my haste to conclude the schedule.
<P>
I hope that, with that reassurance and my commitment to write to the hon. Member for Daventry, the Committee will agree that the schedule should stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 9, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) A local council— 
<P>
(a) must perform in relation to such places outside its area as the Council specifies such of the Council's duties as the Council specifies;
<P>
(b) may exercise in relation to such places outside its area as the Council specifies such of the Council's powers as the Council specifies.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members will remember that when we discussed the funding of designated institutions in Committee before Easter I agreed to consider how we might ensure that an institution operating in more than one location need not be burdened by having to relate to many separate local LSCs. I had in mind an approach whereby a single local LSC might, on behalf of the national LSC, contract with and fund a learning provider that operated throughout England.
<P>
However, on reconsidering the provision in the clause, I came to the conclusion that the duties and powers given to local LSCs would not allow such a sensible arrangement, as they relate solely to the local LSCs' own areas. The proposed additional subsection in the clause would resolve that problem by enabling a local LSC to perform duties and exercise powers outside its area as well.
<P>
The flexibility would also allow other sensible co-operation between local LSCs where, for instance, a local LSC might fund in its locality an institution that was a regional centre of excellence, attracting students from outside its area. That will be particularly important in London, where there will be a good deal of traffic across LSC boundaries, but experience elsewhere will be similar.
<P>
Amendment No. 173 provides for the sensible and flexible arrangements that we have all agreed should apply in the new framework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall respond briefly and, I hope, constructively to the Government's amendment. We have no difficulty in principle with what they are doing. The Minister's primary concern was to handle a situation similar to that of a trading standards body dealing with an issue concerning a particular firm or activity on behalf of a number of local authorities. Thus, it would be possible for an LSC to be based at a particular point and to carry its activities into other areas, which might well be sensible. What might be termed institutional cross-border co-operation could also be carried out under the amendment, and we would have no difficulty with that. We may later wish to consider the needs of individual learners in relation to cross-border activities. That will arise on a later amendment.
<P>
Without wishing to be difficult, I want to raise two points on the amendment. First, the amendment refers to places that the council specifies. Although I have suggested affirmative resolution procedures for other designation issues, mercifully, neither the Minister nor I is proposing that there should be formal parliamentary consideration of this issue, but it would be helpful if he could say a little about what ``places'' are. They could be geographic places. They could be—I am looking at the hon. Member for Hallam—the area of Sheffield city council, somewhere called Macclesfield, or whatever is the appropriate place where the provision might be needed. I suppose that the places could be at a particular institution, where the activity at a further education college could be linked to an LSC because it was relevant and sensible for it to be so linked. They might even be places where the Minister or the council, with a bit of ingenuity by setting up a remit letter, could include in the remit of a certain local council all the places where, shall we say, instruction in fish farming is carried out. The test would be, therefore, whether that was a place in which that instruction was carried out. I am merely taking a moment of the Committee's time to observe that simply referring to ``places'' does not make it clear what sorts of places they might be. We are all anxious to be as flexible as possible.
<P>
My second point is that extending the powers beyond the defined area of a local learning and skills council will have an impact on the operation of other local learning and skills councils. I am not suggesting that the Under-Secretary is trying to stir up trouble between councils, but there should be an understanding that any extension into the territory of another council should take place with the knowledge and consent of that council. If the place specified is, for example, a further education college, most of the responsibility for which rests with the resident local learning and skills council, but in which a particular activity has been designated as within the remit of another council, there will be an overlay of responsibilities. I am not suggesting that the problem is insuperable, but Ministers should be aware that it could happen, and it is important that the councils are consulted and are not caught short by any difficulties. There is nothing wrong with the principle, but the Under-Secretary may wish to consider those details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Gentleman has responded to the proposed amendment and for his broad welcome for it. When it comes to the definition of ``places'', we do not need to have an existentialist discussion about it. We are bearing in mind the relatively obvious cases, such as those—as a London Member, I shall take a local example—from an outer London borough or from outside the Greater London area who may be attending the City Lit or Morley college. We want to ensure that the relevant local learning and skills councils can come to sensible arrangements in such a case. However, I am assured that the definition of ``places'' covers all eventualities.
<P>
At the end of the day, the national Learning and Skills Council will make judgments about such border disputes. We do not anticipate difficulties, and we are sure that sensible arrangements will be agreed. The Committee is not in a position to consider all the specific details. There will be many local variations, but the amendment will ensure that we have the authority to come to sensible arrangements.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 9, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) may carry out other activities in support of the education of persons over 16 provided that additional public funds are not required'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already discussed what might be called the geographic limitations on the remit of local councils, just widened by the Government amendment. I want now to turn the Under-Secretary's mind to whether or not there should be an opportunity for a local LSC to operate outside the transmission belt for resources from the national council, in support of the objective of widening the provision of education or, indeed, training, which is not specified in the amendment. I drafted it rather hastily.
<P>
At the back of my mind is the general power available to local authorities to spend up to the proceeds of a certain rate on activities that support them in fulfilling their local purposes. We could, no doubt, debate that power at length. The buzz word for Ministers—a view accepted generally in the Committee—is ``flexible''. We should be as flexible as possible. In general, I am sensitive to that view, but I am a little more leery about it in relation to the expenditure of public money. Ministers will remember that at an early stage in our proceedings I said, perhaps slightly naughtily, that a little of what they were doing reminded me of the prospectus for the South Sea Bubble Company, which said that it was an enterprise of which further details would be supplied in due course. Our purpose in the Committee has been to draw out what the Bill is about.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not suggesting in my amendment that we should give local LSCs an open cheque to do whatever they wish, certainly not with public money, or that, on the other hand, we should subvert the activities of local education authorities by providing a parallel system of funding. However, in anticipation of subsequent debates that are scheduled, I am trying to pave the way for some of the concepts involved in partnership arrangements, which are set out in new clause 1, and in the holding and disposition of property, which are in new clause 3, by saying that it may be sensible for many activities that are currently carried out by TECs, mostly with public money but with a proportion of private money and involvement, to be continued by local LSCs. If we confine their activities to the transmission belt of the national funding package, even if tempered with local discretion, they might not be sufficiently resourced or feel able to achieve their objectives.
<P>
On the other hand, there may be private funds around—charitable or trust funds, or funds derived from private industry or other contributions—to carry out some local activity, perhaps in partnership with others. An example might be to run a competition for the best further education essay or the best suggestion for widening participation, or for the oldest learner or the youngest learner, or whatever it may be. Such activities might be judged as not proper activities for public funds to be spent on, but they would support the Minister's objectives and our common feeling.
<P>
On other occasions the local LSC may wish to lend its name and perhaps second its staff to carry out a conference on a related issue that was not specifically within its remit but was clearly in the public interest. Subject only to the fact that we do not wish to bust the budget of public money, because that is limited, or to subvert the activities of other public authorities like the LEAs, the amendment questions whether we could allow local LSCs extra flexibility to carry out such activity, perhaps in conjunction with others. Ministers may say that they can do it anyway, but it would be helpful to have clarification of their view on these issues, which would pave the way for more specific debates later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has introduced the amendment in a generous way, which befits someone who told the Committee that he would not shoot Father Christmas in certain circumstances. Therefore, we know him to be an extraordinarily generous man, and some of us will ponder the implications of that in the coming weeks.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are entirely sympathetic to the need to enable local LSCs to use their discretion—for example to identify and fill any gaps in provision at a local level. Our fear is that the amendment would create scope for the local LSCs to drift into areas that may not be consistent or compatible with the broader aims and objectives of the national LSC. Indeed, although this is not clear, the amendment may allow local LSCs to act ultra vires—that is, outside the powers set out in the Bill—which would not be the hon. Gentleman's intention.
<P>
The LSC is, and will therefore act as, a single unitary body. We see that as one of the biggest strengths of the new arrangements and one that we do not wish to lose. However, it is important to strike the right balance between national coherence and local flexibility. That has been a theme of the Committee's proceedings. Of course we want local LSCs to reach out into local communities and to respond sensitively and creatively to the needs and patterns of provision that they find. For example, they must be able to vary the national rate of funding to respond to a particular gap in local provision. As we discussed in relation to an earlier amendment, they must also be able to support local initiatives for development and regeneration. I am sympathetic to the kinds of local discretionary activity that the hon. Gentleman described. They are covered by clause 18(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council may do anything which appears to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of or in connection with the exercise of its other functions.
<P>
I reiterate the assurance that was given in another place and is fully reflected in the LSC prospectus: local LSCs will have decision-making authority over the allocation of the vast bulk of LSC funds—which, let us not forget, we expect to average £100 million per local LSC. They will also have a significant local initiative fund to meet local needs that do not readily fit within existing programmes and funding formulae. Those might include pump-priming initiative funding for small-scale local projects or promoting and supporting equal opportunities initiatives, including activities designed to reach out to non-traditional learners. Local LSCs will make the key decisions in determining how best to secure education and training for people in their areas, and therefore which providers to fund.
<P>
We believe that we have struck the right balance between national and local interests and that the necessary powers will be in place to enable the local LSCs to cover the important examples that the hon. Gentleman gave. Given those assurances, I trust that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Under-Secretary has given helpful assurances, especially in relation to the powers to act flexibly that I sought. I am grateful for his assurance that the two examples that I cited will be covered by the existing powers. I was worried about the potential downside of allowing local LSCs to operate at large without reference to the national remit. Without wishing to reopen the debate about top-down or bottom-up operation, I can see that a degree of sensitivity is involved in that. Subject, as always, to reading the small print, the Under-Secretary has reassured me about the matter, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 20, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Guidance to local councils</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 9, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in doing so must confirm the proportion of a local council budget which may be allocated at the discretion of the local council'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 21 deals with the guidance that the Learning and Skills Council can give local LSCs. Subsection (3) provides that the council must set out a local LSC's budget, which is the subject of the amendment. We are especially interested in the proportion of the local LSC's budget that may be allocated at its discretion, and the amendment would require that the guidance confirms that amount. That is an important matter on which the Government recently consulted in respect of their ``Learning to Succeed'' White Paper.
<P>
We are mindful of the representations that we have received from many quarters about the need for local flexibility. For example, the CBI stated in its submission that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to continue to meet employers' needs, the new arrangements set up by the Learning and Skills Bill need to ensure that . . . local arms of the Learning and Skills Council will have real powers and take into account the needs of the local labour market.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, budget arrangements are very important if local LSCs are to have the necessary flexibility. The Under-Secretary conceded that he wants local LSCs to be more than branch offices—he wants them to take important decisions and to attract people of good quality to take those decisions. Unless local LSCs have the necessary discretion over budgets, they will not be able to do so.
<P>
``Learning to Succeed'', the White Paper, refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>managing a discretionary budget which will be used to address local learning and skills issues by encouraging and supporting, for example new approaches, to workforce development, particularly in SMEs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are the Government's proposals sufficiently flexible to meet that need, which the Government set and which the CBI discussed? The Government said that 10 to 15 per cent. of the LSC's budget was for non-national tariff provision, which can be made at the LSC's discretion. What is the Government's latest thinking on that matter, and how did they arrive at the figure of 10 to 15 per cent.? What responses have they received to the White Paper, and do they have further thoughts on the power to vary national rates? Those rates are separate from the 10 to 15 per cent. discretionary budget. How will the national rates be used to deal with shortages and surpluses of provision? The Under-Secretary referred to his experience of teaching sociology on a wet night in Tadcaster. His remarks returned to me subsequently, because I had occasion to pass through Tadcaster—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a wet night?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No, it was on a fine and sunny afternoon. Although Tadcaster is in the north of England, it does not have ``dark Satanic mills''. It is a rather pleasant market town, and it has a very good brewery. If the Under-Secretary had been offering to teach a national vocational qualification in brewing, rather than sociology, there might have been a greater demand for his services.
<P>
Local LSCs should meet local needs—those of local people who want to take courses and of those employers. It might be possible to overcome the shortages of skills that employers have ascertained. We do not want surpluses to arise, and we want local LSCs to deal with subjects in which there is a surplus.
<P>
We look to the Under-Secretary for illumination of those important matters. How will the Government's framework ensure that local LSCs are more than branch offices of the national LSC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I hear with interest the hon. Gentleman's remarks about Tadcaster. I am pleased that the other day he enjoyed his journey through Tadcaster and the absence of ``dark Satanic mills''. It will not be helpful to get into a quarrel with the Church of Scotland, but I heard that some of the finest hymns in our language, including ``Jerusalem'', may not be in the latest edition of the Church of Scotland's hymn book. I assure the Committee that Labour Members will continue to try to build Jerusalem in England's green and pleasant land—and, I hope, in other parts of our United Kingdom.
<P>
The amendment gives me an opportunity to stress that our messages about local decision making will be translated into action. I confirm our firm intention to allow local LSCs to exercise considerable discretionary powers through their responsibility for allocating the vast majority of the LSC's total budget. Most of the payments will be structured and priced according to a formula, details of which will be set out in the second technical consultation paper on funding, which we expect to issue later this week. It is wide of the mark to say that the system will have little discretion because there will be national rates. Local LSCs will decide on the volumes of provision that will be undertaken by each provider, which will, in turn, determine how much money each provider will receive. Local LSCs will have considerable discretion over virtually all the money that will be allocated to the LSC. Moreover, about 10 to 15 per cent. of funds will be outside the national formula approach for activities, because that approach is not appropriate. That will include work force development and funding to support improvements in the standards and quality of local providers.
