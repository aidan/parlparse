                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
explain why I propose that the Committee should sit more than once. The
Bill is unusual in being the first private Member’s Bill that
has managed to get to Committee without Government support. On Second
Reading, the Government requested that the Bill be withdrawn, the House
divided on the matter, and we now find ourselves discussing the Bill in
Committee. As the Bill is controversial, the advice from the Clerks is
that the sittings motion should provide for more than one
sitting.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
unusual feature of the Bill is that it has come to Committee sooner
than I and others had expected, given our positions in the queue of
private Member’s Bills. Yesterday, there was a debate in
Westminster

                           </strong> It is clear that the West Lothian question, which
was discussed in that debate, is a controversial one in the House, so

                           </div>House today, I think that the matter is sufficiently controversial that

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady mentioned, Mr Gale, one is meant
to say that it is a great delight to sit under your chairmanship, and
she went on to say that she was not even fibbing because it is a
genuine delight. I will not say anything more than that it is a delight
to sit under your chairmanship, not least because I know that you are a
special police constable, so if there are any threats of violence from
the opposite side you will be able to deal with them adequately, both
in your capacity as Chair and as a special constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000017">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
has said that we need more than one sitting. There is at least one
other Welsh Member in the Committee who might hope that any further
sittings are on the same day as the Welsh Grand Committee, which is
meeting as we speak, and that they might therefore be prevented from
going to the Welsh Grand Committee. I honestly cannot see why we should
need more than a single sitting for this three-clause Bill. The hon.
Lady says that the matter is massively controversial. Although there
are people who disagree with the thrust of the direction of her whole
project, if I might put it that way, I note that yesterday only one
Liberal Democrat bothered to turn up for five minutes for the debate on
the West Lothian issue, and only three Conservatives turned up, two of
whom did not make speeches and did not stay for the whole debate. There
is remarkably little appetite for the hon. Lady’s
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000018">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Am I right in
interpreting the hon. Gentleman as saying that he would judge the
importance, or lack of it, of the West Lothian question on the basis of
the number of Members of Parliament who turned up for a Back-Bench
debate in Westminster Hall? I put it to him that the issue has been
bubbling around in this Palace for some 30 or 40 years and
is one of the most important issues in the constitutional consideration

that he suggested. Often, one can determine the significance of a
matter on the basis of the number of people who attend a Westminster
Hall debate on it. The vast majority who attended the debate yesterday
were Labour Members, especially Welsh MPs, rather than Conservative
Members. I am not sure, therefore, that there is the appetite for the
Bill that some suggest. The hon. Gentleman could have proved me wrong
yesterday by turning up for the debate, but unfortunately he chose not
to do so. I am sure that he had something far more important to

Yesterday, I was chairing the Welfare Reform Bill Committee, on which
the hon. Lady was serving, in Committee Room 14, and, therefore, sadly,
I could not have attended the debate. However, I have taken an
extremely active part in debates on the West Lothian question over the
years. Indeed, as shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, I got the
sack on the issue of the West Lothian question, so I am committed to
the issue big time.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000026">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure the hon. Gentleman was unfairly sacked,
because his party is very tough on sensible people, and that is why we
end up with Ministers such as the one we will hear from later today.
The Conservative party would be much better served if the hon.
Gentleman had remained holding that portfolio. Unfortunately, however,
he chose yesterday to chair another Committee, and lots of other
Members chose to do other things, so the argument that I think the hon.
Lady wants to advance later this morning was not really put. Even the
Minister did not put the argument much; he basically said,
“There is a terrible problem here. Let’s set up a
commission,” which, as far as I can see, is broadly the
Government’s position.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whether the
Committee needs further sittings might also be determined by how
controversial the issue is. The hon. Lady is absolutely right that this
is the first private Member’s Bill that has got through the
first hurdle without Government support. Unfortunately, I must confess
to the Committee that it is partly my fault that the Bill has
progressed, because if I, the Whip and a couple of other Members had
not voted for it, the Division would not have been quorate. I am
kicking myself for being prevented from attending the Welsh Grand
Committee this morning by virtue of the fact that I voted and allowed
the hon. Lady’s Bill to go through. All that I will say is that
it is important that we change all the rules in relation to private
Member’s Bills. It is ludicrous that more Bills cannot get
through Second Reading, that there is not a proper system, that the
process of talking out is used, and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000028">&#160;</a>

more important Committee next door that is discussing flight passenger

of the council in an adjoining county. It was very much Tam’s
way to view this issue as important because he was a House of Commons
man. His constituents did not necessarily have any interest in the
matter—to be frank—and they did not see it as relevant,
but if they needed to go to a London hospital for an operation that was
not done in Scotland, they did not see why health should not be
discussed north and south of the border. It is a preoccupation of a

does not deserve or require more than one sitting. It is important that
it is got out of the way quickly. People can have their canter round
the course, and they have been doing so for many years and for many
reasons—mostly political. It is always good to have an enemy
outside to point at as being behind the problems that may occur in
constituencies. I always think that it is better to focus on solutions
in the constituencies rather than pointing fingers at other
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000034">&#160;</a>

about continuing the controversial attempt to say, “It’s
the Scots’ interference in the politics of this place with their

certain constituencies, it is argued that we should not be allowed to
vote on certain matters, and I find that deeply offensive. My brother
lived—and, sadly, died—in Gosport, England. His health
service was as important to me as the health service of my
constituents. And as I have said, some people travel to Scotland for
operations that are not done elsewhere, and some people travel to
England for the same purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000035">&#160;</a>

question as laughable and a matter for joking, and
they have pointed out how few people turned up yesterday for the
Westminster Hall debate, which they claim proves how unimportant it is.
The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk suggested that it was a
matter of no concern to our constituents and that we must focus on
important matters that are of interest to them. None the less, he fell
into the trap—set by that great man, Tam Dalyell—when he
said that he should have an interest in the national health service in
England as well as in Scotland because his brother tragically died in
Gosport. That may be the case, but my mother lives in Dunblane in
Scotland and is currently in the hands of the national health service
in Stirling royal infirmary and, as an English MP, I have no say of any

that this is not a peripheral issue or one that we should deal with

it goes away. Nor is it only of interest to us here at Westminster. It
is actually an extremely important issue of great concern to people
across the nation and addresses the way in which our nation is run. To
dismiss it as somehow unimportant or uninteresting, or needing to be
dispatched quickly, is wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for West
Worcestershire has done the nation a great service by introducing an
imaginative new approach to the West Lothian question and it deserves
detailed consideration. If there were to be a further sittings motion

                           </strong> I appreciate your wisdom in this matter, Mr Gale.
I was speaking in prelude to that discussion, and I wished to point out
that, on Second Reading, the Minister said that if the Bill were to go
into Committee, he looked forward to working constructively with me to
improve it. In addition, the hon. Member for Rhondda said that if the
Bill passed its Second Reading, the Opposition would wish to scrutinise
it robustly and seek to amend it. As the hon. Gentleman noted earlier,
no one has tabled any amendments. I suggest that before we discuss
clause
1—<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000062">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Gale. I thought that we
were discussing clause 1
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> Technically, the hon. Gentleman is right. It is a
formality and I have proposed the question on clause 1. The hon. Lady
has the floor and if she wishes to make a proposition to the Committee
in the course of her remarks, she may do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not questioning your view, Mr
Gale, but I would like some clarity. I presume that it would now not be
possible to table any amendments to clause 1 as we have started
consideration of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11033054000065">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That rather depends on what happens in the next few
minutes, and I cannot advise on that at this stage. It would not be
possible, were the Committee to continue to sit, to table amendments to
clause 1 for debate this morning unless the Chair decided to take a
manuscript amendment. But that is hypothetical, because no manuscript
amendment has been submitted to me.
