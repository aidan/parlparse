<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume consideration of the Bill, I should inform hon. Members that from Thursday the Committee will meet in Room 9 rather than here in Room 5. Room 9 is one of the designated Standing Committee Rooms and should be more convenient. I understand that the Committee Office will send cards to hon. Members confirming the change of room.
<H4><center>Clause 46</center></H4>
<H4><center>Payments, services etc. not to be</center></H4>
regarded as donations
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 38, in page 28, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(h) any payment made by an individual or organisation in respect of, or any facilities or services provided in pursuance of, education activity by the party for the benefits of its members'.—[Mr. Walter.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I presume that Room 9 has television facilities so that our proceedings will be available to those who want to watch them.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 is a probing amendment. Clause 46 may not even be the appropriate clause in which to insert the amendment, which seeks to add paragraph (h) to subsection (1), but if I explain our intention, perhaps the Minister will give us some guidance.
<P>
The amendment deals with our parties' international aspects. Although the Neill report and the whole tenor of the Bill are directed against the concept of foreign donations to our parties, modern political parties have many international links with like-minded parties around the world and with a number of foundations, charitable and otherwise, which are connected with those parties. It would be a shame if, in passing the Bill for legitimate reasons, we cut off those international links.
<P>
I shall speak from the Conservative party's perspective, but I know that there are parallel links in the Labour party. Conservative Members have been on joint conferences organised by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a German political foundation that was set up after the war. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and I have enjoyed their hospitality. I should say that the United Kingdom had a great deal to do with the design of the German political system. The Stiftung is concerned with democratic political education. It sponsors many conferences in the United Kingdom and abroad; it has offices in this country and it has close links with the Conservative party. The so-called Democratic party in Germany has similar links with the Labour party. There are also links across the Atlantic.
<P>
The Democratic party in the United States has an organisation called the Democratic National Institute, with which I have had dealings in the past, and the Republicans have the International Republican Fund for Co-operation. Those bodies are concerned not with propagating political ideas to the wider electorate, but with promoting good international links through international bodies—whether it be the Liberal International, the Socialist International or, in our case, the International Democratic Union—and bilateral links between political parties.
<P>
We would like to ensure that those links can continue. We do not want suddenly to find that we are no longer able, as a political party, to co-operate with the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung. That would be cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.
<P>
I shall give an example in which I was involved last summer. The Conservative party was invited to send a representative to Cyprus to address the annual conference of the Democratic Rally-Liberal party, which is the governing party. The invitation was sent to my party leader, who was unable to go, and asked me if I would attend in his place. I went to Cyprus and addressed the conference. My fares and major expenses were met by the Conservative party and I received some modest hospitality from the Democratic Rally party while I was there. However, the fact that I had a meal paid for by a foreign political party would not be deemed to be foreign funding of the Conservative party. It is essential to continue that kind of linkage between parties, which is why we are seeking to draw out the Minister in the context of the amendment.
<P>
We phrased the amendment carefully so that it would be all-embracing. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``payment made by an individual or organisation in respect of . . . education activity by the party for the benefits of its members''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That money would not be paid to the party so that it could spend it on propagating its ideas or fighting elections or referendum campaigns, but so that it could use it internally in its educational activities. Does the Minister think that the amendment is appropriate, or would he prefer the matter to be covered elsewhere in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I want to add a few points to what my hon. Friend said.
<P>
As he pointed out, there are two distinct issues: first, educational activity in general and, secondly, the foreign element. In respect of domestic funding, of course, there would be no prohibition on such activity—it would be a political donation. Although it may be hedged around with a number of caveats, it would certainly be declarable and transparent. In the case of foreign donations, one of the features of the Bill is that if such funding became a donation within the meaning of part IV, it would then be prohibited.
<P>
One approach may be to review the prohibition on foreign funding. The alternative approach that we have tried to adopt here is to change the meaning of ``donation''. The issue will have to be addressed one way or the other. Otherwise, many activities that most people would regard as beneficial—and far removed from the sort normally associated with political party funding—could disappear. My hon. Friend has given a number of examples; there are many others.
<P>
The Conservative party has a foreign affairs forum—perhaps the Labour party does too—that organises trips abroad for Members and people on the candidates' list, to keep them informed about foreign affairs. I went on a trip to Moscow in 1990 with the forum. I have not the slightest idea how the funding arrangements worked on that visit. However, it was apparent that some of the tab was picked up by the then Soviet Government, which was on its last legs. Some of it was picked up by the Conservative party, and some, ultimately, by the participants who paid to go on the trip. I cannot believe that the Labour party does not have similar complex issues to address.
<P>
It would be regrettable if the implementation of Lord Neill's report were either to make such trips or activities impossible because they constituted fiendish foreign funding of a party's activities, or to make it extremely complicated to disclose, account for and explain such donations. It is a very complicated area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): I propose to speak against the amendment, as it seems to suggest that anything described as ``education activity'' would be exempt from being considered a donation, and having to be openly declared and above board.
<P>
I think back to my time as a councillor in Strathclyde. Every time the social work department made a complete mess of something, it described it as a valuable learning experience. There are few experiences in life from which one does not learn something, although some of the speeches made earlier may be an exception to that rule. For example, an election campaign is a learning experience; winning or losing an election campaign is a learning experience. The amendment has been drafted so widely that it would destroy the entire Bill, and I hope that it will be rejected.
<P>
I understand the point about foreign trips and the need to consider them educational. However, if they had to be declared and above board, one would have to ensure that they were genuinely a means of imparting information through experience, and not merely a means of transferring money to the party in question by defraying costs that the party would otherwise be required to meet. The amendment is so loosely worded as to make nonsense of the rest of the Bill. I accept that it is a probing amendment, but it probes a little too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I certainly would not support the amendment in its present form. However, it raises issues that need the Minister's consideration.
<P>
I should declare a non-interest, because in a previous existence I made two visits overseas courtesy of the Westminster Foundation. There may be an issue here connected with the work of that foundation. Will the Minister confirm that the functions or duties carried out and funded by the Westminster Foundation, supporting international travel and visits by political parties, would not be classified as a donation? Perhaps we should explore that point. Assuming that it would not be a donation and that it would be dealt with in some other way, it might be possible to achieve what the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) wishes through a Westminster Foundation mechanism. The principle is fairly easy to establish. We are talking about expenditure incurred by a member of a political party overseas, not in this country.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Other Committee members may understand the technicalities of the international financing of the Conservative party, but I do not. However, it would seem to me that the route that I have described is one that could be followed. In his response, will the Minister take account of the Westminster Foundation, which does a first-class job in many aspects of international politics? Having seen the parallel structures in Germany, the Westminster Foundation model is one from which that country could learn, but that is a subject for another day.
<P>
I do not support the amendment, but I do support the continuing international participation of UK political parties, particularly in developing democracies. It would be a great shame if the Bill were inadvertently to interfere with that process.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson), whose argument was concise. Some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for North Dorset could comfortably be covered under clause 46(1)(a). On making clear our interpretation of the powers that will be granted to the commission, it is only right for it to establish rules to accommodate that interpretation. The Secretary of State will be able to give guidance on the matter according to clause 10.
<P>
I acknowledge the point that the hon. Member for North Dorset made about the Konrad Adenauer Stiflung, and he is right to point out the educational links through the Frederick Eibert Stiftung. Where such links are strictly educational, we must accommodate them, but we should not adopt the extended definition to which my hon. Friend rightly referred.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell), who advised the Committee to resist the amendment. However, that is not the real issue, because this is a probing amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset referred to the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and the visit to the democratic rally in Cyprus, and argued that those were legitimate and valuable visits. The Neill committee considered the issue and concluded that study tours abroad are worth while and should continue. The hon. Gentlemen who tabled the amendment are right to point out that, at this stage in the Bill's legislative passage, such visits would be prohibited. I do not want them to be prohibited, and I am surprised that this issue has not arisen before. Hon. Members take an interest in such trips, which provide valuable experience.
<P>
The Government intend to make their own proposals to enable trips and study tours abroad to continue, on the basis that reasonable travel and subsistence expenses are covered. Hon. Members who go on such visits will still be obliged to record them in the Register of Members' Interests, but I want to give them the opportunity to travel abroad.
<P>
I am grateful for the comments of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove about the Westminster Foundation. I am not directly associated with it, but I know of its work. My impression is that the work that it does and the support that it gives would be prohibited under part IV of the Bill. Clearly that it is not right, nor is it our intention. Therefore, I reassure hon. Members that we shall table amendments to allow travel abroad, with reasonable travel and subsistence costs. We shall consider the position of the Westminster Foundation and other bodies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said, clause 10, which deals with policy development grants, could perhaps be used as a vehicle to achieve our aim. There may be simpler ways of achieving it, but on the understanding that we will pick up the notion of study trips abroad and the point about the Westminster Foundation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has said that he will table an amendment to take account of the concerns expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I share the slight concern of the hon. Member for Pollok that we had drawn a rather wide definition, but it was a probing amendment to draw out the discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Equally, I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we do not want to end up in the absurd position in which the Americans find themselves. For example, Sir John Hannam, the previous Member for Exeter, who hon. Members will remember is a fanatical tennis player, could not bring a tennis team across from the United States because it was being sponsored by an organisation. The Americans found themselves unable to allow that, even though the team would have raised £100,000 for a hospice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He is right. We must look carefully at the draft of the amendment that the Government intend to table to see that it is sensibly worded and enables us to continue our valuable international links and to continue to educate one another through the exchange of politicians and party members.
<P>
I am happy with the Minister's assurance and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I want to comment briefly on subsection (1)(f) and to ask the Minister, in responding, to consider one or two related issues. It is a subject on which I have not tabled an amendment.
<P>
Subsection (1)(f) states that a donation may not be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provision by any individual of his own services which he provides voluntarily in his own time and free of charge''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a worthwhile and appropriate exclusion.
<P>
I wonder if I can tempt the Minister to say a little more about ``his own services'', They will consist not only of the person's time, but may include shoe leather, the use of his car, his telephone, his house and, perhaps, his garage for storage. A list could be drawn up showing what ``his own services'' consist of and perhaps the Minister will explore that a little so that we can decide whether more detailed consideration is needed. In broad terms, the wider that list is, the better—someone might own a printing firm, and so forth. The Government and the parliamentary draftsmen must have a practical limit in mind. Perhaps the commission will give advice, or perhaps there will be computer claims of cheating or disregard. It would be helpful to have on the record a clear explanation of the scope of the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to an earlier meeting between representatives of political parties. Bemused officials have anticipated the point—I have a note in my hand, which shows that they learn from experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I certainly had no wish to imply that the officials servicing the Committee or in the Minister's Department were deficient of common sense. It is a matter of practical experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As we acknowledged earlier, those of us at the sharp end of the trade are closer to it than those who take a more detached and academic interest. Officials have told me that ``in his own time'' means not being reimbursed for services by an employer or anyone else. The provision is included principally to meet a point raised by Liberal Democrat Members in earlier discussions with the Government. They pointed out, rightly, that it would be absurd if services provided by a party member or an officer of accounting services on a purely personal and voluntary basis had to be regarded as a donation and hence recorded, valued and accounted for.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove tried to stretch our debate by asking about the use of printing presses and whether that would be a donation and have a market value. He also referred to shoe leather and wear and tear on cars. Paragraph (f) refers to labour only.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Value of donations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I rise not to re-emphasise matters that were raised when we discussed donations and sponsorship, but to return to a point that was raised then—the value of donations. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred to prizes and auctions and we are trying to determine who makes the donation and what value is placed on it.
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to a bottle of House of Commons whisky. It is valued in the Souvenir Shop downstairs at under £20, but it might well be sold at auction for several thousand pounds because it had acquired the signatures of various party leaders, past and present. Last year, I got the signatures of all three major party leaders on a bottle of whisky, which was then auctioned for charity. Of course, the provision would not apply in that case, but it does apply to political auctions.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Handbags are another example—[Laughter.] It is not unknown for Baroness Thatcher to donate a handbag that she no longer uses, which is then auctioned to raise money for the Conservative party. The market value of such a handbag in a second-hand shop might be about £15 or £20—if it were of good quality—but it might well sell at auction for several thousand pounds. The question is, has the Baroness or the man bidding at the auction given several thousand pounds, or have neither of them, it simply being a commercial transaction? There is no clear answer to that question in the provisions dealing with the value of donations, but we will come back to the issue at a later stage. If the gentleman bidding for the handbag paid several thousand pounds, would the auctioneer have to decide whether that was a permissible donation by asking whether the gentleman were on a United Kingdom electoral register and therefore eligible to make that sort of donation to a political party? Such questions must be answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> In many ways I wish I had the same problems with these provisions as Conservative Members have. Before the recess, the Minister undertook to consider some of the practical issues. Let us take auctioned items. There are two potential transactions: the gift to the party of the object to be auctioned and the gift of money to the party when the object is sold on. Presumably, as in a commercial operation, one is entitled to defray one's reasonable expenses in acting as the auctioneer, acquiring the venue and so on, so the net donation to the party would be the difference between the value of the item as given to the party and the purchase price. That might be one solution to the problem.
<P>
I remind the Committee that I come from a different culture from that of the hon. Members for North Dorset and for Beaconsfield. I have seen donated items sold for less than they are worth. Bearing in mind that they were donated to the party in the first place, that loss of value is of no concern to the party and would probably never be known to the donor.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is thinking of a party leader autographing, say, a judo outfit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I had no particular circumstance in mind, which is probably just as well. Judging by the body language of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee when I made my remark, the handbag or the bottle of whisky bearing the party leaders' autographs—the more extreme cases—are not the only items that are auctioned. The matter is more complicated than it looks; it could make life very bureaucratic for parties. Auctions and so on at constituency level will not be worth having because of the trouble and hassle involved. No doubt other activities will be found to replace them, but is that what the Minister wants to achieve?
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to clause 66, which deals with property, service and facilities and the difference between the actual charge and the market value. It introduces the concept of a 10 per cent. margin below the market value, which will not attract registration as a donation. I am not sure whether we shall have a further explanation of that when we reach the clause, which I welcome in principle, because market value is somewhat flexible. Perhaps there is some provision in clause 66 which, if it were in clause 47, might simplify some of those marginal cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We have had an interesting discussion with some useful examples. I note that the hon. Member for North Dorset used to be an adviser on the management of foreign currency reserves and that he was an investment manager. He was speculating on the value of a bottle of whisky being more than £2,000 when it is autographed by certain people—he did not specify whom. I should get advice from him as he clearly knows which way the market is working and how I can make a profit.
<P>
I remind the Committee of the de minimis rule that a donation of less than £200 does not have to be accounted for. I suspect that the auctions that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove and I go to are similar. In casting my mind back, I do not think that anything has gone for more than £200 at any Labour party event that I have attended. However, I have been to other auctions that are not connected to political parties, such as charity auctions and those with connections to sports clubs when, clearly, the person bidding wants to support the charity. The price that he is prepared to pay in those circumstances is really a donation that he generously wishes to give to the charity. It is not hard to envisage auctions for political parties where the final bid on an item is way above its market value. A concrete example was a handbag. If a handbag owned by the former Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, were auctioned, it would attract a good price. A handbag, that could be identified as belonging to Mrs. Thatcher and that had her imprint on it, would also attract a decent price if it were on the market. The issue is not as simple as it seems. I understand the sensitivity involved and I shall reflect on it a little more. I make no promises to table amendments, but I understand the difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Let me provide another example, as the Minister obviously accepts that handbags owned by the noble Baroness have a high intrinsic market value. I have attended auctions at which generous bidders have bid as much as £13,000 for the gavel that the noble Lord Archer had used in an auction. In no way could a gavel that could be bought for £15 in a shop be deemed to have a market value of £13,000. We seek clarification on such genuine differences in the value of a donation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman shows how closely he follows the markets. Lord Archer's gavel certainly would not fetch £13,000 now, even at a Tory party raffle. Things go up and down, as has Lord Archer at various stages in his career.
<P>
There is no easy solution to the problem. It reminds me of the philosophical arguments that I used to have with my students. Let me reassure the Committee on the de minimis argument by flagging up the case of £13,000 for Lord Archer's gavel. It could be a donation to the party rather than the market value at auction on a particular night. There is a serious issue here, but I am not sure that I can help the Committee immediately. Fair points have been raised, and we shall reflect further on them.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Permissible donors</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 29, line 12, after `register', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 40, in page 29, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or eligible to be registered in an electoral register'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 29, in page 29, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Secretary of State may by order define the term ``ordinarily resident'' for the purposes of this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> While we digest the fascinating insight into the prices paid at the auctions organised by the Dorset Conservative Association—I am sure that we are all jealous of the hon. Gentleman's fund-raising powers—I shall explain the amendments. Amendment No. 28 would restrict the category of permissible donors to political parties not just to those on the electoral register, as in the Bill, but to those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 29 would allow the Secretary of State to define ``ordinarily resident''. I make no apology for aiming the amendment at tax exiles. I start from the simple premise that British political parties should not be financed from tax havens by people who left Britain specifically in order to avoid paying taxes. That is wrong in principle because someone who does not pay tax in this country should not have a hand in deciding how much tax we pay. By moving abroad to escape taxation in this country, such people should forfeit the right to interfere in UK elections and to fund UK parties. It is also wrong in a practical sense, because if parties can be financed by tax exiles, it gives them a potential interest in maintaining tax loopholes for the benefit of people who do not even live in this country. It is similar to the argument against overseas funding by people who are not even British citizens.
<P>
The amendment does not deal with the right of overseas voters to vote in UK elections—we shall later debate clause 130, which reduces the qualifying period from 20 to 10 years—as my concern is not whether tax exiles can vote in official elections, but whether they can fund British political parties. It is not a question whether overseas voters can give any money to political parties. As my hon. Friend the Minister just reminded us, people can always give up to £200 under clause 45(2), which will be an unrecordable donation. That certainly covers subscriptions to a political party—even the subscription to the North Dorset Conservative Association is not quite that much—but it would affect a person's ability to give more substantial funds to parties.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When I first raised this issue in July when the draft Bill was published, I was accused of trying to tailor the Bill against one person—Michael Ashcroft—and I should like to explain why that is not so. Two things have happened since then that change the situation. First, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has added clause 130 to the Bill to reduce the qualifying period from 20 to 10 years. That will affect Michael Ashcroft who moved to Florida in 1985. Secondly, Mr. Ashcroft announced, of his own volition, that he is going to ``regularise'' his affairs, in his quaint phrase, and move back to this country. I am happy if I have played a small part in forcing him to choose between living abroad and living, voting and paying his taxes in Britain.
<P>
Arguably, Mr. Ashcroft showed more sense than Conservative Front-Bench Members on this issue, because he realised before they did that in the long run it was both indefensible and unsustainable for one of the great parties in this country to be financed by a tax exile. As far as I know he still sends a cheque for £83,300 to Conservative central office every month. I hope that the Bill stops that money being given even before he moves back to this country. That would certainly be the effect of my amendment. Even if Mr. Ashcroft came back tomorrow and started paying taxes, I still would not be happy.
<P>
The amendment was never aimed at Michael Ashcroft. It is aimed at all tax exiles. The Neill committee report was less concerned with the treasurer of the Conservative party than with donors to the Scottish National party and the nationalist parties in general. Indeed at paragraph 5.28, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``To some extent, the Scottish and Welsh diaspora might be assisted by the provisions concerning overseas voters . . . Some who have recently left Scotland and Wales to live abroad would be able to take advantage of these provisions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision has been included almost with them in mind. We can think of members of the Scottish diaspora, perhaps recently knighted, who can take advantage of this provision. I do not know who the Patagonian wool millionaires are who fund Plaid Cymru, but some rich members of the Welsh diaspora may fund it. The Neill committee received evidence from the Scottish National party, which pleaded in favour of an open regime of overseas funding. The report concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we see little difference in such support coming (at a time of globalisation) from London, Lisbon or Los Angeles.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The origin of a donation makes an enormous difference. My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, who is temporarily out of the Room, is very knowledgeable on this subject and keen to raise the issues involved. I base my argument on that put forward in the Neill report. Having mentioned the position taken by the Scottish and Welsh parties and their belief that they should be allowed to be funded from their diaspora, Neill disagrees saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We would expect, however, that parties such as the SNP, faced with a bar on foreign donations, would campaign even more vigorously for funds in other parts of the UK''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then enunciates a principle that everyone should be able to accept:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We have, therefore, concluded that . . . it is right to take the opportunity to lay down the principle that those who live, work and carry on business in the United Kingdom should be the persons exclusively entitled to support financially the operation of the political process here.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not agree more. If one translates that into the rather more relaxed syntax that my hon. Friend believes should be used, it basically says that only people who live, work and carry on business in Britain should be allowed to fund political parties. That was the principle enunciated in the report's conclusion. Unfortunately when it comes to the recommendations it was watered down to those ``registered to vote'' or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``eligible to be registered to vote''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So a tight definition in the conclusion expands to include not only everyone who is registered to vote, but anyone eligible, including some 8 or 9 million British citizens who have moved overseas. It was greatly to the Home Secretary's credit that when he drafted the Bill he narrowed it down to those registered to vote and cut out the other 8 or 9 million who are the subject of an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. My right hon. Friend made the point that it is much easier to tell whether someone is registered to vote than it is to tell whether they are eligible to vote. He thereby demonstrated that he is not tied to the letter of the Neill report, and can disregard it where it is plainly wrong.
<P>
I suggest that he has not gone far enough on this small point to disregard those recommendations. He should go back to the original principle set out by Neill, which is that only those who live, work and carry on business here should fund political parties. Let us not forget that it is possible to be registered as an overseas voter on the electoral register in a constituency, while at the same time being a foreign resident, a foreign national, a foreign dual national, a foreign taxpayer and indeed, as we have seen recently, even a representative of a foreign Government. Mere citizenship coupled with overseas residence is not a guarantee of anything.
<P>
All those problems could be resolved if we could just add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to clause 48. That is the test used by the Inland Revenue to determine whether someone should pay tax. It is also used by the national health service to determine whether a person is entitled to go to hospital and receive free care and attention. We should also apply it to political parties. Residence is defined by custom and practice by the Inland Revenue, but if the Secretary of State felt the need to define it according to the electoral roll, amendment No. 29 would give him the power to do so.
<P>
Overseas voters are already in a special category in many different ways. Their registration is voluntary, whereas it is compulsory for voters in this country. They vote by proxy, not in person. They have to register every year, and if they fail to do so they fall off the register. It would not be inconsistent to add a fourth difference that although they have the right to vote and to belong to political parties in this country, they do not have the right to fund them. Alternatively, if one preferred, they would not have the right to give recordable donations to political parties, which would rule out only large donations over £5,000. That is the argument for amendments Nos. 28 and 29. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reconsider that and take on board some of the points that I have made.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 40 but also to deal with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton). This is perhaps the point in our consideration of the Bill—I hope that this is not taken in a confrontational spirit—at which my mind, which I hope is logical, begins to part company with that of the hon. Member for Battersea, because I have serious reservations about the structure that we are creating. I shall confine myself initially—you, Mrs. Michie, would rule me out of order if I went too far anyway—to our amendment, which simply attempts to restore Lord Neill's phrase ``registered United Kingdom voters and those entitled to register.'' That seems a simple issue.
<P>
A person may have come back into the country and is resident and so will be taxed for the period of residence here, but his name may not yet have appeared back on the register by the time of an election. I know that there will be a rolling register, but there will still be delays. Are we saying that at such times the person's donation must be rejected, or that he cannot make it? The hon. Member for Battersea said that it will be much harder to deal with people who are eligible, but not on the register for some reason. I accept that it may be a little complicated, but surely not that much more complicated.
<P>
<H5>5.26 pm</H5>
</P>
<H4><center>[MR. JOHN MAXTON in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
There may be some complexity, but it is up to the parties concerned to ascertain that it is an eligible donor who is making the donation. It beats me why there should be any real reason for their not carrying out those checks. A donation may be received on day one and on day 15 the person becomes registered, so was eligible all along, and that can be shown in the detailed accounts that the Commission requires. The Minister is aware that under the Bill they must hold on to the money and not spend it until such time as they can satisfactorily show that the person was entitled to make the donation.
<P>
In those circumstances, I cannot imagine why the eligibility rule, which Lord Neill said specifically was the correct test, has been removed. I can envisage the Minister saying that it will be a bit easier, so many aspects of these legislative proposals are extremely complicated that this complexity strikes me as a nightmare.
<P>
The amendment from the hon. Member for Battersea clearly goes in the opposite direction. Philosophically I cannot share the hon. Gentleman's Berlin Wall approach to the way in which national politics should be conducted in future. It seems not to bear any relationship to the real world, and it is a substantial fettering of the freedoms that this country has enjoyed for a very long time. No one has explained satisfactorily why, if there is transparency, all these requirements need to be imposed. I hope, Mrs. Michie, that I am not straying too far, but I feel that we cannot consider amendments such as this without looking at some further—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is all right, our fathers were very good friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I apologise, Mr. Maxton. Your transformation had quite by-passed me. I am glad to see the metamorphosis that has taken place. I welcome you to the Committee this afternoon.
<P>
We cannot divorce what we are considering today from what comes after. As so often happens when a committee of experts sits down with benevolent intentions, the apparent simplicity of Lord Neill's recommendations has already been taken to pieces by a number of inspections that the Government have had to introduce, mostly as a result of the European Union—or at least some as a result of EU rules, and some as a result of the Government's desire to deal with the Irish dimension. Those appear to be the two key reasons. A cart and horses is about to be driven through Lord Neill's report—unless, of course, we succeed in sorting it all out in Committee.
<P>
If certain foreign companies that happen to be incorporated in the EU and happen to be registered Under the Companies Act and are carrying on business in the UK are able to make donations as an exception, I cannot understand why a citizen of the EU should not make a donation.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As a Conservative, I find it rather hard to accept that, now that our law making is in part regulated from Brussels, there are, arguably, legitimate interests that flow on a pan-European basis. That means that people may be interested in other people's politics, and indeed consider that they have a stake in it. For example, we may see the development of pan-European parties. Will individual donations be ring fenced? These are important considerations. I must tell the Minister that we need consistency in this respect. Otherwise, there will be substantial unfairness.
<P>
On amendment 28, for the moment we would be content with the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``eligible to be on the electoral register.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us return to Lord Neill's proposal. Beyond that, let us try to approach the matter in a way that will allow people to say at the end of our debates on the Bill that we have been fair and consistent in respect of who, and which organisations, can and cannot make donations.
<P>
Life has, I fear, become very complicated. It is often said that we live in a global civilisation. The barriers that have been put up sometimes seem somewhat arbitrary to me. While I respect the views of the hon. Member for Battersea on denying access to those who do not pay tax, I found that his earlier comments, which were directed at a particular party treasurer, somewhat coloured his arguments and made me pause to think that perhaps we were not adopting the necessary consistency, especially in the light of the subsequent exceptions which we now seem on the point of making. With that in mind, I welcome the Minister's comments. I stress that this is said in a spirit of discussion, not one of confrontation. However, we would do well to get the issue to the state at which, when people see the legislation, they will feel that a coherent strand of thinking runs through it rather than that a series of ad hoc measures are being forced out of the Government by one pressure group or another, or by European law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I was intrigued by the observation of the hon. Member for Battersea that the Home Secretary considered that Lord Neill was plainly wrong on this subject and by the fact that he also suggested that the Home Secretary was plainly wrong.
<P>
I will confine my remarks to the amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, which essentially brings us back to Lord Neill's recommendation, and examine it from two perspectives. Adding the words in that recommendation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or eligible to be registered in an electoral register''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would deal not only with people who may be resident overseas but still eligible, but with people who are, in the words of the hon. Member for Battersea, ordinarily resident in this country.
<P>
A number of people who are eligible to be on an electoral register do not register, for quite legitimate reasons, such as those who may have been harassed by stalkers. Police officers do not put their name on the electoral register—a public document that can be viewed at any library—because they fear for their own and their family's safety. Some people have been inadvertently left off an electoral register: they may have moved house. We know of many students whose parents fail to put them on their electoral register because they are away at college, perhaps living in houses in multiple occupation to which no form from the local authority is ever sent. Under the Bill, such students would be denied the right to make a contribution to a political party. Neill was correct in that respect.
<P>
People who are resident overseas and eligible to be registered here are also relevant. I hold no brief for any tax exile, or for any Scottish and Welsh diaspora, but we risk denying the political rights of people who may have taken up appointments to the European Commission in Brussels or the European Parliament, for example—people who view themselves as serving their country on a short-term basis, such as seconded civil servants or others directly entering those institutions. People working for British companies that export to the European continent and other parts of the world may work abroad for three, four or five years to run branch offices in South Africa, the far east or any corner of the globe. Such people, while retaining the right to vote in UK elections, will be immediately, disqualified from contributing to political parties, even though they would continue to pay British taxes while they were working for British companies.
<P>
For those reasons, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and believe that we should stick to the Neill recommendation that those eligible to be registered to vote as well those who are registered to vote should be included. On page 74 of the Neill report, a whole section deals with evasion. Anyone who was ineligible but tried to convince someone that they were eligible would be subject to criminal proceedings. Neill placed the responsibility for ensuring that donations were received only for political purposes on the political parties themselves. It would not fall on the authorities to police it. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and return us to the Neill recommendation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It has already been made clear to the Committee that the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and those proposed by Conservative Members would work in different ways. I shall seek to persuade the Committee to stick with the middle way: I shall refer to the third way, as I know that some of hon. Friends have strong views on that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea is a well-known reformer of electoral law and a strong advocate of proportional representation. I was intrigued to hear him referred to in the same terms as the Berlin wall, which does not characterise his position at all—neither where he comes from, nor what he stands for. He has taken a great interest in the Bill generally and this clause in particular. He has corresponded with the Home Secretary and had private discussions with him.
<P>
My hon. Friend acknowledged that the amendment would narrow people's ability to make donations, excluding those who were not ordinarily resident, even if they were on a register. In effect, it would exclude people on the overseas register. Later in our proceedings we will have an opportunity for a lively debate on how long people should remain on the overseas register. My hon. Friend's amendment would deny people living overseas for only a short period the opportunity to vote, and that is unacceptable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's reservations about disfranchising people who are abroad for a short time, but is that not covered by the term ``ordinarily resident''? Someone living abroad for a year or 18 months out of a lifetime could not unfairly be deemed to be ``ordinarily resident'', and any outstanding difficulties could be decided by the Secretary of State. Is there not some leeway in my hon. Friend's amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am interested to hear those comments. It will be difficult to define the term ``ordinarily resident''. In amendment No. 29, my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea would give the Secretary of State the power to define what ordinary residence means, but it would not be an easy task. I understand where my hon. Friend is coming from, perhaps suggesting Inland Revenue-style rules and regulations for the sake of definition. As I said, that would be difficult. In a sense, it is a matter of detail, rather than a key point of principle—that people entitled to register and to vote should be entitled to make a donation. I invite my hon. Friend to reflect on whether it is correct to deprive people registered of their right to donate.
<P>
My hon. Friend has certainly made his views clear on Second Reading, in correspondence and in private discussions. This afternoon, I ask him to withdraw his amendment, though not necessarily his point of principle. I know that he will continue to pursue it. I also tell my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) who, as a Whip, must speak carefully, that I have no objection to further debate on the issue. However, the principle must be right—those registered to vote should have the right to donate.
<P>
Amendment No. 40, tabled by the Opposition, would work in the opposite direction. Where my hon. Friend's amendment is more restrictive, the Opposition's would return us to the Neill recommendations.— I should acknowledge, before it is used in evidence against me, that Neill said that the recommendations should be taken together. The report is not a pick-and-mix or cherry-picking solution; it must be taken on comprehensively. Therefore hon. Members are right to ask why the Government are moving away from Neill on this occasion—it is one of the few occasions where we do.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, it is a simple matter of practicality. The amendment would mean that someone who could establish the right to be on the election register—if it were possible conceptually to be on it—should have the right to vote. There are practical difficulties with that as the law stands, although the Bill may change it. A person would be eligible to vote even if they had been abroad for 20 years. There would be difficulties for all parties in trying to establish that.
<P>
The simple, easy-to-police solution in the Bill is to require that the person's name is actually on the register. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield correctly raised the example of someone coming back from abroad who cannot get their name, automatically and quickly, on to the register and therefore cannot donate. First, the de minimis provision would apply, so a donation of up to £200 would be permissible—someone in that position might want to pay up to £200 as a statement of intent.
<P>
Moreover, we have introduced another Bill modernising election law. The Representation of the People Bill, which has just had its Third Reading in the Commons and is on its way to the Lords, introduces the notion of a rolling register, which will allow people to register more frequently and more often with the minimum of delay. I think that that will cover the example given by the hon. Member for North Dorset. The substantive point, which is where we depart from the amendment, is whereas the Bill's solution of allowing only those who are on the register to donate is easy to police and straightforward, the suggestion in the amendment is more difficult. I invite hon. Members to reject all the amendments and take the third way.
<P>
After considering the draft Bill, Neill said that he was aware that there were points of departures between us. He noted that some were points of detail, whereas others were more substantial. Interestingly, he did not highlight registration as a substantial issue; to use his words, it is a point of detail. The Government believe that being on the register should carry with it the right to vote. This is an operable, easy-to-police measure which is in the interests of donors and political parties. I hope that hon. Members will reflect on that and leave clause 48 as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that we should take a coherent approach to this issue. I could not agree more. The approach that I advocate in amendment No. 28 is based on a simple and coherent principle: no representation without taxation, which is the reverse of the issue that saw us part company with the United States. It is a sound formula, although obviously it is not to be applied literally. No one suggests that people who are too young or too poor to pay taxes should not have a vote, or that people who have just come back from a period abroad and have not yet got back on the register should not have a vote. Nevertheless, it is a clear principle. In this country, one should make oneself liable to tax if one wants to have a vote.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister once or twice inadvertently used the word ``vote'' when he meant fund political parties. My amendment in no way suggests that overseas citizens of this country should be deprived of their vote—merely of the right to be substantial funders of political parties.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield accuses me of trying to erect Berlin wall barriers, but my amendment is based on a simple, easily understood and coherent principle. People who live in Florida, Torremolinos or Hong Kong should not fund election campaigns in this country. Election campaigns are a matter for us—the people who live here and are affected by the choice of Government. It seems strange that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield should use such an extraordinary metaphor as Berlin wall barriers. That is more or less an accusation of extremism, yet this is a simple, fair-minded approach.
<P>
I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend the Minister made about a third way. Although I think that my approach would be fairer in the long run, I will not press my amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 29, line 15, leave out from `l986' to end of line 16.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 43, in page 29, line 16, leave out `European Union' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`United Kingdom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> These are probing amendments. I would not suggest that the Committee should accept them both—they are either/or amendments.
<P>
We are troubled by the category of company that may be able to make contributions. Lord Neill took a simple approach, restricting the right to companies that are incorporated in the United Kingdom, which are therefore subject to the full force of United Kingdom company law. There seems to be a lot of sense in that. There is always anxiety about transparency, but if a company is incorporated in the United Kingdom, the various safeguards in the Companies Act 1985 apply to it in toto.
<P>
Lord Neill realised that it would be possible for foreign subsidiaries that were registered in the United Kingdom to contribute, but it is clear that the Government do not see that as a major problem. It might be made a vehicle, but one can live with it. Those subsidiaries, too, are still subject to full UK company law.
<P>
What I think has happened—the Minister will doubtless confirm this—is that some legal expert has suggested that European companies cannot be excluded from this category. The clause is therefore not only a complete hotch-potch, but philosophically and practically indefensible. If one is going to allow European Union companies to contribute in the way that is suggested, when UK company law can have no control over them, I am at a loss to see why Norwegian, Swiss, United States or Canadian companies should not also be able to make such contributions.
<P>
Let us consider European Union membership, which is contentious in some circles, and the example of the United Kingdom Independence party. As it does not receive funding from EU countries, believing rather in promoting the North American Free Trade Area, why should it not receive donations from United States companies? Company laws in some countries may not provide adequate scrutiny of a particular company's activities, but scrutiny can be as effective in some countries outside the European Union as in those within it. The Minister should recognise that.
<P>
We are deeply concerned about the clause and there are two ways of dealing with it. The first is to leave out from 1986 to the end of line l6. The provision would then refer to any company
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``registered under the Companies Act 1985 . . . which carries on business in the United Kingdom'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which would apply to any foreign company registered here. As long as it carried on business, it could contribute. A company would still need to have some connection with this country and to register for the purposes of business, but it would not have to be incorporated. If we wanted to adopt a global approach, that would be perfectly reasonable. After all, companies that are registered are subject to controls, although not to the same controls as incorporated companies. The alternative approach set out in amendment No. 43 would be to go back to Neill and restrict the application entirely to United Kingdom companies carrying out business in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Either of those alternatives would be better than the drafting. Making exceptions, which were forced on us by European legislation, to Lord Neill's proposals is undesirable and drives a cart and horses through all the concepts so extolled by the hon. Member for Battersea. European Union companies will be able to contribute as long as they are carrying on business, although whether it depends on payment of tax remains an open question, on which the Minister should reflect.
<P>
If European Union law makes it impossible to remove European Union companies, there is no justification for excluding other similarly registered foreign companies. We must accept that. Foreign companies registered in this country and trading here—some may have legitimate interests and some may pay tax—should be able to contribute. If, however, it were possible to delete the reference to the European Union, I would be quite happy to revert to the purity of Lord Neill.
<P>
There is a danger of ending up with an unsatisfactory provision that will be perceived as having been imposed on the Government rather than being what they, or indeed the public, intended. I hope that the problem can be dealt with, though I am not sure of the best way to proceed. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about such an important matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I do not want to speak too long in supporting my hon. Friend, other than to say that Neill took a purist view on the problem—that only companies both registered and incorporated in the United Kingdom should be permitted to donate. That does not preclude foreign companies with subsidiaries here, which could have predominantly foreign shareholders.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In supporting my hon. Friend, I am reminded of the hon. Member for Battersea who spoke earlier about people ``ordinarily resident'' here. Many companies allowed to make contributions—those incorporated outside the EU but registered here—might consider themselves to be ordinarily resident here. They would be registered for tax purposes, employ UK citizens who were taxpayers and contribute to the UK economy. Many such companies could be registered in British Commonwealth countries. As we know, British Commonwealth citizens who are ordinarily resident here and on the electoral register are eligible under the Bill to make a contribution to political parties—and the same applies to those from the European Union. We are thus talking about extending the provisions only to companies that are not incorporated in British Commonwealth or European Union countries.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, it is a probing amendment, so let us try to find a way through it. At the moment, the Government's compromise between Neill and our treaty obligations—on which I await the Minister's clarification—leaves us wide open to abuse. Someone who wanted to abuse the provision could incorporate a company in Torremolinos—mentioned earlier in respect of British residents not ordinarily resident here—and establish a branch office here through registration at Companies House. Such a company would then be eligible to donate to a British political party. I have nothing against Torremolinos, but it is an exotic place not known for its industrial activity.
<P>
We must be careful that the clause does not create circumstances that Neill did not intend, or provisions that are too onerous or restrictive on companies that legitimately carry on business in this country and should be able to participate legitimately in the political process by making contributions to political parties. We must, of course, take account of later provisions on company donations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I shall be brief in raising a couple of questions with my hon. Friend the Minister. One issue that worries me—stemming from a collapsed pension fund in my constituency—is the status of companies whose directors we do not know, particularly in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Could my hon. Friend explain to the Committee—if not, perhaps he would be kind enough to let me know later—whether an exclusion clause would be necessary, making it clear that the provision includes only companies where the directors, as well as the aims and objectives of the business, are a matter of public record?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I, too, seek clarification from the Minister. I understood that the companies falling into the category of permissible donors would have to make their decision to donate public and explicit and, in some circumstances, subject to the control of shareholders. It is not clear from the clause that that would be the case for all the prescribed categories of company. To some extent, this may be the same point that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston raised. If a company that is a permissible donor under the legislation is not required to go through an internal and explicit process of taking a decision to donate which is visible to the outside world, we are creating exactly the kind of exemption that can lead to imaginative and creative action by party treasurers and others to bypass the Bill's intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> In introducing the amendments, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield used the smart phrase ``either/or amendments''. Indeed, they are contradictory.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 would remove the requirement that in order to count as a permissible donor, a company must be incorporated in the European Union. It would therefore be possible for a company to be incorporated elsewhere in the world, as long as it was registered here and carried on its business here. That is clear. If we were minded to accept the amendment, we would, to borrow a phrase that the hon. Gentleman used, ``drive a coach and horses'' through the Bill. We asked Neill to stop foreign donations and he was explicit about that. Amendment No. 42, however, would clearly allow donations to come from, say, Belize—not to be controversial—and other countries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Bermuda?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Yes, Bermuda and others. Amendment No. 42 would achieve exactly what we asked Neill to stop. I accept, however, that it is a probing amendment.
<P>
I listened with interest to what the hon. Gentleman said in regard to Amendment No. 43, because he used the phrase ``some legal expert''. I like it when highly legally qualified hon. Members—I believe that the hon. Gentleman is a barrister—use such phrases. I know that it is meant to denigrate the advice that was given. Lawyers give different advice and often one gets what one pays for. I will not regale the Committee with stories of how in the past I have sought different advice and asked counsel whether this or that change could be made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield is being unfair to some of his colleagues. Amendment No. 43 would stop us having donations from the European Union. I would very much like to go forward with that. That is the Government's intention. We would dearly like to devise a Bill that stopped donations from European companies and limited them to companies that were incorporated in the United Kingdom. If hon. Members could help us on this we should be extremely grateful. We might even pay for the legal advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Would that be a donation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It would be Government business. We would be grateful for advice on this. We would like to restrict the Bill to British-based companies. The matter has been thoroughly explored. We are advised that it is not possible to draw the Bill in such a way as to exclude companies that are incorporated in the EU and operate and register here. I wish it were possible. I know that this is unsatisfactory. The Home Secretary has taken a great deal of personal interest in this matter. As I say, it is not our design: it is not the detail we would want. Let me be perfectly candid with the Committee: it is the best we can offer now. I cannot offer to come back on Report and resolve the matter: clause 48 will have to remain as it is, unsatisfactory though that may be.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked me what happens when one cannot identify the proper legal status of a company that has, for example, shadow directors or that operates from the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. That is a fairly complicated issue and if the hon. Gentlemen will permit, I shall write to them about it. With that most unsatisfactory reply, I ask hon. Members to consider the position and perhaps to offer us alternative and better advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I listened to the Minister's comments. I appreciate very much what he had to say, particularly his expression of his own view. I find the situation profoundly depressing. Some of our liberties seem to have been thrown away, not necessarily by the Government. It shows the extent of the ratchet effect; Lord Denning once described it as the laws of Europe coming up our estuary like a tide and into our rivers. I should be grateful for the opportunity of seeing what advice the Government have received.
<P>
If Parliament decides to impose the restriction and says no to any EU company funding, we shall sit back and wait to see who decides to gainsay it. There is a fundamental issue here. It is difficult to see why, within the context of what the EU is designed to achieve, the rules as they stand should prohibit this restriction being placed on the activities of a EU company.
<P>
My knowledge of European law is fairly limited, but I know something about its main thrust. The objection would be on the grounds of the level playing field of activity. A bit of me cannot help thinking that it is rather funny to say that because one cannot fund a political party, one is prevented from embarking on the level playing field of activity in the country in which one chooses to operate. It would be interesting to see the advice that the Government have received.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This might be an interesting area in which to raise a legal challenge and to point out the effects that this measure could have on national rules designed to prevent corrupt practices. That is after all what the legislation is all about. I should be interested to know what the decision might be and whether it might be possible to establish some new case law, even if existing case law tends to operate in the opposite direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman does not suggest that the Committee and Parliament should be asked to pass a Bill that we have strong advice is outwith European legislation. I half heard him whisper that that path should be the one to follow. It would not be appropriate for a Government to do something that they had been advised was outwith the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I appreciate that the Government, by virtue of the treaties to which they are bound, will necessarily wish to be responsible towards their European partners. I would not wish to encourage them not to be so. I should be interested to read the advice. If there is the smallest smidgen of a grey area, Parliament should do what it thinks is right, and if it thinks that EU companies should not participate for the reasons given by Lord Neill, it should do something about it.
<P>
I return to the other issue. I am mindful of what the Minister said about driving a cart and horses through Lord Neill's report by taking the opposite line and accommodating the issue. But the cart and horses has been driven through by the EU clause. If the EU clause precludes implementing what Lord Neill recommends, it raises the question of the fairness of excluding those outside the EU, unless the Minister can demonstrate some objective ground why EU companies would be under a greater degree of scrutiny or some element in their activities that would make it more proper for them to be favoured objectively. I accept that their being European companies might play some part in this, but some objective reason other than their incorporation in the EU is needed to explain why they should be preferred to companies that trade from what I might describe as respectable countries.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> To use the old adage, it is better to have half a loaf than no loaf at all. That is the route that the hon. Gentleman is inviting us down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I think we lost the loaf when we introduced the EU countries. What was Lord Neill trying to do? He was trying to ensure that dubious donations that might be in breach were removed. That is the objective. Unlike the hon. Member for Battersea, I did not get the impression that Lord Neill was aiming at companies, which are hybrid creatures anyway. A UK company may be largely owned by foreign shareholders. I did not get the impression that Lord Neill was trying to establish a sort of Aryan—or Anglo-Saxon—race clause, defining companies by their loyalty and the number of times that they run up the Union Jack. He was trying to prevent a particular problem. Yet the clause says that he cannot do that. But, to keep the fiction that something is still being done, we are excluding a large number of companies that appear to be just as potentially reputable, if not open to scrutiny, as those within the EU. That is an issue, and I doubt whether it will go away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> It is clear from the exchanges that all of us would like to resolve the underlying principle. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will consider the point that I made to the Minister. Does he agree that one of the criteria that we should go for is total transparency about which company it is and what powers it will invoke to make the donation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree that that is an aim, and I accept that, from that viewpoint, EU companies might be favoured over those incorporated, say, in countries—I must be careful about using a pejorative term—where one might rather doubt the bona fides or the capacity of a companies house there to scrutinise the companies at all. However, I must point out, although I cannot remember precise details, that currently there are some major scandals raging across Europe concerning underhand funding running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and I suspect that it will be found that EU-incorporated companies may have had a role in it. I say that to the Minister not out of some xenophobic zeal—it is very difficult for me as someone who is half French by background, and the French are particularly xenophobic anyway—but because I do think that despite all the problems that we have had in recent years, the standards of probity in the political world in this country stand the test rather well. France is a country that I love, and know well. Nevertheless, I would not swap political systems for all the tea in China.
<P>
I ask for consistency. I cannot help thinking that there may be some EU companies in which foreigners could go off quite easily and incorporate, bring in money under far less scrutiny, and bring it all over here. I do wonder whether we are not establishing that what we want is not a half loaf but no loaf at all and a fig leaf to mask the fact that the loaf has disappeared.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am interested to know what the hon. Gentleman is doing with his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As it was a probing amendment, Mr. Maxton, I did not intend to put it to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 29, leave out line 18.
<P>
I can deal with this quickly. Will the Minister tell us why we have determined that a registered party may fund another? After all, individuals give money to parties and generally they expect the money to be used by them. It may be that parties have mechanisms for telling members that they should transfer funds to another party that has been set up. But, on the basis of taking the shareholder option, if I may use it, it seems a rather strange state of affairs that one registered party should give money to another.
<P>
The other issue on which I probe the Minister takes us to Ireland, which we shall have to touch on later, but it does seem to relate. One idea put forward—I have already spoken to the Minister, I think, about the slight horror with which my hon. Friends greeted it—is that Northern Ireland should have exceptional provisions that allow funding from outside. But if a registered party in Ireland—not necessarily the same party as in the rest of mainland United Kingdom—is able to access funds, under this provision it could transfer them without difficulty to another registered party in the United Kingdom, thereby potentially defeating the whole idea of no foreign funding, even from individuals. So I query that, although I do also appreciate that there could be arguments that a registered party should be able to fund other registered parties. There may be occasions when a party is set up for a particular purpose or campaign, so the registered party may wish to donate registered funds to it. However, the provision is not quite as straightforward as might seem at first sight, which is why we query it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I do not support the amendment, as I think that it is misconceived. We would want to see the system operating in a number of practical situations. Several were hinted at during previous sittings of the Committee. An early mention was made of the fact that the Green party in Scotland is completely separate from the Green party in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is feasible that in a parliamentary by-election or other circumstances it might wish to make a donation to its sister party.
<P>
My own party, the Liberal Democrats, has a sister party in Northern Ireland—the Alliance party—and a parallel situation could arise there. I suggest to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that there could be circumstances in which, say, the Referendum party and the United Kingdom Independent party might find an accommodation over an election in which they chose to support a particular party. However, I am thinking not of an election but a more localised opportunity.
<P>
Let me take the Committee back to our discussions on the fine theological points of federalism. Depending on precisely which amendments were tabled as a result of the Minister's input to the Committee on that point, it may be that the legislation might commonly require there to be a transfer of funds from one registered party to another. It is quite inappropriate to delete the provision that would make that possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I stand before the Committee as the living embodiment of inter-party co-operation, as a member of two political parties which came together to support my election. I belong to the Labour party and the Co-operative party, which traditionally run joint candidates where it suits us. It is often most appropriate under the first-past-the-post system. In those circumstances, the Co-operative party raises money, comes to electoral agreements with the Labour party in particular locations, puts some money into the pot and joint candidates are run.
<P>
That does not mean that the Co-operative party will never run its own candidates. Indeed, in the run-up to the Scottish elections, there was a live discussion about whether the Co-operative party should run in Glasgow in the second ballot, with a separate list of candidates, so that those who voted Labour in the first ballot would then be able to vote Co-operative in the second ballot, thereby maximising the number of Labour and Co-operative candidates elected. Had such a course been followed, Scotland would not be facing the present difficulties of a coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Instead there would be a coalition of Labour and the Cooperative party.
<P>
That is not to say that I would argue in all circumstances against the possibility of co-operation between ourselves and the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, the more I hear them speak of more spending on health and education, and perhaps gainsaying the lp cut in income tax, the more I warm to them. Should we wish at some future point in a by-election to consider the possibility of running a joint anti-Conservative candidate, it would seem reasonable that each party paid a share of the election costs—unless a third, new party were to be established, but I think that we have patented that name. However, one party might put up a candidate while the second contributed.
<P>
I can think of several other circumstances in which it would be appropriate for one party to declare for another. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell), for instance, stood as an independent. Under a system of proportional representation, however, he might not wish to stand as an independent; he might want to set up the Martin Bell party. Under proportional representation with a list system, he might, if he attracted enough support, be able to bring several people on to whatever platform from which he was seeking to gain election. Again, in such circumstances, Labour, the Liberals or other parties might wish to offer financial support in order to damage the Conservatives or anyone else to whom we were opposed at the time.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment, because it would strike out an important flexibility for political parties.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Clause 44(2)(c) deals with political parties giving to sister or other parties. I heard what the hon. Member for Pollok said about co-operation between the Labour party and the Co-operative party, but let us take the example of a national election campaign, for which the Bill prescribes strict expenditure limits. If a party contests all the seats in the United Kingdom, the limit is something short of £20 million.
<P>
It is conceivable that a political party wishing to challenge the governing party of the day or the principal opposition party might put up paper candidates in all the constituencies, thus becoming eligible for the spending limit of nearly £20 million, which could be donated by the other political party that was going to benefit. I suspect that there may be some avoidance of the rules.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> That is a very interesting point, but who is to define a paper candidate? I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Conservatives in Pollok are paper candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about definition, but I would never regard a Conservative candidate in any constituency as a paper candidate, whatever the sitting Member's majority. He should remember that at the next election, the electorate may wish to pass judgment on his stewardship and that of his party. However, that is an extreme example.
<P>
Referendums provide a less extreme example. It would be possible for a political party with a referendum spending limit of £5 million to encourage the formation of a series of other political parties that were committed to the same outcome. It could then donate £500,000 to each of them, as it is permitted to do under the Bill—although that may change when the Bill has been debated on the Floor of the House. It would therefore be possible for such a party to make a contribution to each of several fringe parties, therefore topping up the amount that could be spent in furthering one side of the case in a referendum campaign. That is why my hon. Friend and I proposed the amendment. If it is not accepted, I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what anti-avoidance provisions he envisages for the Electoral Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The intention behind the amendment was clearly outlined by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield: it would stop one party transferring funds to another. I remind the Committee that clause 48 defines permissible donors so that foreign funding cannot be brought into political parties. We discussed that issue earlier.
<P>
I do not see why one registered party should not be allowed to make a contribution to another. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove and my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok gave examples of situations where that could occur. Of course, it occurs in the case of the Co-op, which makes a valuable contribution. Parties can share common aims and a common purpose. In time, politics may become more fluid, with more individual interest groups and more alliances formed. However, that is for the future.
<P>
In principle, I cannot see anything wrong with one party being able to transfer finds to another. Clearly, however, it is important that people know that that is happening. Under other provisions in the Bill dealing with openness and transparency, the ordinary voter would be able to see that funds were being transferred. Indeed, provisions relating specifically to the campaign period require a weekly report to be made to the Electoral Commission, so there will be an immediacy about this matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset raised the issue of what might be called ``front parties'', set up as a pantomime so that funding could be transferred across. I do not think that that will happen in the real world of politics; we have better and more pressing things to do. However, the requirement for transparency—the fact that it would be taking place in the public domain—should counter any move in that direction.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised an important point about Ireland and Northern Ireland. I suspect that when we reach clause 63, we will have a long and important discussion on that. As I said, the Government intend to table amendments to clarify that. I shall outline the situation briefly now, but I will spend more time on it when we reach that clause. The next group of amendments also links into this issue.
<P>
We intend that there should be a separate register of parties in Northern Ireland. People will be able to donate to those parties, but those parties will not be able to transfer funding to parties that are based elsewhere in the United Kingdom. We will table amendments to that effect, although it may not be possible to do that by the time that we reach clause 63. However, I look forward to a more detailed discussion when we get there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Pollok for the cogent reasons advanced for allowing registered parties to transfer. However, my anxieties started to rise again at the end of the Minister's statement when he referred to the Government's exceptional arrangements for Northern Ireland. We may have time to explore the issue in detail later. At present, I must tell the Minister that an arrangement whereby Northern Ireland is ``Berlin walled'' from the rest of the United Kingdom for finding purposes raises important issues of principle.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's and others' remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 29, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) a citizen of the Republic of Ireland resident in the Republic of Ireland subject to compliance with the Republic's Electoral Act 1997'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This may appear to be an intriguing amendment, but it is moved in the same spirit as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. It is important to deal properly with the Republic of Ireland, as well as with Northern Ireland. I quote from paragraph 5.33 of the Neill report, which deals with Northern Ireland and foreign donations:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is necessary to have in mind the provisions of the Ireland Act 1949'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from which the following subsection is cited:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is hereby declared that, notwithstanding that the Republic of Ireland is not part of His Majesty's dominions, the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any colony, protectorate'',{**W4**}
<P>
</UL></FONT>and so on. Banning donations as if they were foreign, though they emanated from the Republic of Ireland, would contravene the Ireland Act 1949, which is still in force. That provides a slightly neater solution to the problem that we will encounter in clause 63, which deals with special provisions for Northern Ireland. Our suggestion is to take account of the 1949 Act and recognise that the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country. Donations from citizens of the Republic of Ireland are not therefore foreign donations.
<P>
Later provisions suggest that donations are permissible for Northern Ireland parties, but not for parties in Great Britain. By widening the scope, we are not thereby accepting foreign donations, because Ireland is not a foreign country. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland who are resident in the United Kingdom are, in any case, eligible to vote and be on the electoral register of the United Kingdom. As I said, we are offering a neat solution, which we hope that the Government will take seriously.
<P>
Citizens of the Republic of Ireland are subject to compliance with the Republic's Electoral Act 1997. Our amendment is phrased in precise terms and would add a paragraph (g) to suggest that a donation from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a citizen of the Republic of Ireland resident in the Republic of Ireland subject to compliance with the Republic's Electoral Act 1997''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would be permissible. It is important to tie in with clause 63, which deals with permissible donations to a Northern Ireland party. It should be a permissible donation to any political party. There would then be no need to have separate provisions later in the Bill to deal with Northern Ireland political parties.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have listened carefully to the points that the hon. Member for North Dorset has made. If he will forgive me, I do not intend to detain the Committee this evening. His points could be discussed in far more detail on clause 63. The Neill report from which he quoted extensively pointed out the unique situation in Northern Ireland. It is a changing situation and it is important that whatever arrangements we make under the Bill should properly reflect the difficulties there. I have already acknowledged to the Committee that the present provisions in clause 63 are not acceptable. There will need to be amendments. The arrangement proposed in amendment No. 41 is a possibility although the downside is that it allows foreign donations into British-based political parties. If the hon. Gentleman will contain himself and withdraw the amendment, we can perhaps discuss the matter in more detail and with greater clarity later this week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In light of the Minister's constructive comments about how we will take our discussions when we reach clause 63, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 29, line 35, leave out from `donor' to end of line 38. This is rather an important amendment. The paragraph that we want to delete reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any donation received by a registered party by way of a donation by a trustee, in his capacity as such, shall be regarded as a donation received by the party from a person who is not a permissible donor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is at variance with Neill. Although Neill was fairly specific about blind trusts, this paragraph would cover open trusts. Neill's recommendation 22 was that open trusts should be permitted and it was my understanding that the Government had accepted that. Paragraph 3.37 of the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In recommendation 22 and 23 of their report, the Neill committee addressed the wider issue of donations to individual members of political parties or to unofficial groups within a party, as distinct from donations to political parties as such. The Government sympathises with the view that the principles of openness and accountability should apply equally to such donations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Consider the case of a trust, possibly set up as a result of a bequest, the purpose of which was to donate funds for political purposes. To suggest, as the clause does, that that would not be a permissible source rather flies in the face of Neill. It also rather flies in the face of what I would regard as natural justice. I hope not to die too soon, but were I to leave a bequest that was managed by trustees and part of my will said that I would like the trustees, at their discretion, to make occasional donations to the Conservative party I would expect my wishes to be carried out.
<P>
The effect of subsection (4)(b) is that the trustees would not be able to carry out my wishes. It would not be a permissible donation. I fail to see the purpose of banning such donations. They would clearly not be from foreign sources, but from United Kingdom citizens. We have already dealt with clauses providing that in the case of a bequest, as long as the donor at the time of his death was a registered elector, or eligible to be a registered elector, it would be a permissible donation. We are now saying that trustees would not be permitted to make donations after the death of the original donor.
<P>
People set up trusts for other purposes. They are sometimes regarded as being tax efficient, although I hesitate to use that phrase because earlier in our discussion the hon. Member for Battersea talked about tax evasion. Tax efficient trust are not the blind trusts that cause so much concern, but are open trusts where the purport is fully declared. They are transparent and we can see where the money is coming from and the purposes to which it is applied. I see no reason why such a trust should not be a permissible donor to a political party.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I have great sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for North Dorset, however I do not want to leave a loophole for some of the trust arrangements that have hit the headlines. There are a number of specific cases where we may find that we have inadvertently done something that was not intended. Trustees of deceased persons' estates are one category who seem to be caught by the provision. I assume that that was not the intention. It would not seem terribly sensible.
<P>
I am also aware of a number of independent trusts, for instance the Rowntree Trust, that make contributions to political parties for the furtherance of certain objectives. That is on the record. It is fully understood and, so far as I can see, it is to the general benefit of the democratic process. Again, unless there is something that I have missed, it might be caught too.
<P>
Later in the Bill we come to the so-called third-party contributions. The Minister could perhaps reassure us by saying that some of the cases that I have just described would be eligible for consideration as third parties. If so, there may be some scope for changing or qualifying subsection (4)(b) to make that clear and explicit. As things stand at present we seem to have managed to catch the wrong animal in the net.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> First, I apologise for not being here at the outset of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset. I am afraid that I had to go out and deal with something that needed attending to rather urgently.
<P>
The issue of trusts needs to be addressed. Lord Neill did not do what the Bill apparently sets out to do. An open trust strikes me as being a perfectly reasonable vehicle for funding a political party. If, on occasion, an open trust poses a problem because of a particular category relating to it, we should consider the category rather than putting open trusts under a blanket and getting rid of them. I shall be very interested to hear the Minister explain why it was felt that open trusts should be treated in this way.
<P>
On the basis that we should seek to eliminate only those sources of funding behind which we perceive that there may be some mischief—I think that the Minister would agree with that—I should be grateful to know what mischief is perceived in open trust funding. Trusts are an ancient instrument in this country; indeed, they have been described as the greatest ornament and glory of our legal system. I find it difficult to see why they should be excluded from the funding of political parties. Transparency should be as great as though the funding were coming from an individual—as long as they are not blind trusts, but we are not talking about blind trusts here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There has been a good deal of quoting from the Neill report. It is clear that Neill examined in depth the notion of both blind and open trusts. The Neill committee was particularly keen to stop situations of the sort that have arisen in both main parties, where senior party members have been able to draw down money from blind trusts. The argument for them is that the recipient of any donations does not know the identity of the people who have contributed to the trust fund. Neill took the view that that was fraught with difficulties and advocated strongly the prohibition of blind trusts, a recommendation that the Government have agreed to. Open trusts are a different matter. As I understood the hon. Member for North Dorset, donors' identities would be known.
<P>
As has been said, trusts are ancient vehicles—some go back for centuries—and they come in many and varied forms. It is not always apparent who gave money for what purposes, so there is a difficulty in identifying the real donors. Perhaps that is not an insurmountable problem, but it is a practical difficulty.
<P>
More difficult is the notion of stopping trusts taking foreign donations and passing them on. This provision is designed specifically to rule out, in crude terms, the possibility of laundering foreign donations. Clearly, a trust could be established into which donors made contributions from abroad; the trust's administrator could then pass that money on to a political party. We must safeguard against that. There is a less problematic scenario in which a donor puts money into a trust with one purpose but the trust applies the fund to another purpose. It is a difficult issue and I want to reflect on it in more detail. I shall keep talking for a short while longer because I want to take further advice and return to the Committee later. As I said, the real problem is that the trust could become a vehicle to source foreign donations into a UK political party.
<P>
The second issue is identifying who lies behind the trust. Over many years, it is not always possible to identify who has donated. That makes it difficult to ensure that trust donations comply with the clause. I hope that hon. Members will reflect on that and I look forward to returning to the issue later. I shall now listen to what the hon. Member for North Dorset has to say.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his constructive approach. If I understand him correctly, he has some sympathy with our points, but wishes to safeguard against trusts being used as a vehicle to take in foreign donations. It might be possible—I leave it to the Minister's draftsmen, who will no doubt burn the midnight oil looking for an acceptable form of words—to allow straightforward trusts, whose donors are clearly identifiable and whose purposes are clearly recorded, to be designated as permitted to make donations for political purposes, if not directly to political parties.
<P>
I have slight reservations about the Minister's comments on ancient trusts—those going back many years—because several of them, though not making direct donations to political parties, do make them to member associations. For example, the Rowntree trusts make donations to research projects, some of which benefit political parties. It would be unfortunate if we were to cut off that useful source of funding to some of those on the fringes of our parties. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
