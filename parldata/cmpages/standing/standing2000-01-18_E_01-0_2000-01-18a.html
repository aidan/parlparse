<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Standing Committee E. I will start with a few housekeeping notes. I understand that we are likely to spend a certain amount of time together during discussion of the Bill. Looking around the Room, I am certain that the proceedings will be conducted with the usual courtesy and absolute relevance to the subject. In this context, I regard myself merely as the air traffic controller, whose job is to ensure that Committee members all land safely some time—depending upon the deliberations of the usual channels—before Easter.
<P>
For the convenience of the Committee, while I am in the Chair, members may remove their coats. It is, of course, for Mr. Benton to determine whether he will permit Committee members the same luxury when he is in the Chair.
<P>
Members will notice that I have permitted the Clerk of the Committee, Mr. Priestley, whom I also welcome, to use a computer to take the minutes. This experiment has been tried in a shorter Committee. Mr. Priestley wishes to discover whether it will work here. As is usual with the hand-written minutes, these will be available to all members of the Committee. I am assured that there are no secrets in this little black box.
<P>
I have been asked how Committee members may discuss the issues relating to the Bill in the context of the sittings motion. The answer is that this is a two-lane road, not an eight-lane motorway. It is not an excuse to debate matters that have already been debated on Second Reading.
<P>
With those welcomes, I call the Minister to move the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Transport Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I have not had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, but I know your reputation for ensuring both proper courtesy in debate and relevance. I am sure that you will insist on those standards being maintained throughout the Committee.
<P>
We have all been given pen portraits of members of the Committee, which contain a large number of often slightly dubious comments about individuals—in my case, some highly misleading ones about size of waistline and IQ, which I will pass over quickly. In your case, Mr. Gale, there is a reference to a tendency to be irascible. I am sure that that must occur only when people have not observed the normal courtesies and that the Committee will not require you to demonstrate that characteristic to keep us in order. I know that Mr. Benton has experience of large Bills. I served under his chairmanship on the Standing Committee that considered the Greater London Authority Bill last year and I am sure that he will ably assist you in your considerable task.
<P>
The Bill is important. It is also a large and complex measure. It has been referred to as the ``Transport 2000'' Bill, and I hasten to add that that refers not to the number of clauses but rather to the year in which we expect it to reach the statute book. It is a complex and important measure and it would honour a range of commitments given by the Government, which were mainly set out in our White Paper on integrated transport. Additionally, it will enable a public-private partnership to be established for the National Air Traffic Services.
<P>
The sittings motion provides for the Committee to meet for at least 10 hours a week, which should give more than adequate time to enable us to fulfil our proper task of scrutinising carefully, thoroughly and rigorously all aspects of the Bill. We recognise that that is the important role of Committees. We are committed to the policies on which the Bill is founded, but equally we do not believe that we necessarily have every detail right and we will welcome constructive and positive proposals that can improve it. I should make it clear at the outset that we do not adopt an entirely oppositionist view towards amendments that are tabled by Opposition members of the Committee. We shall want a thorough and serious debate and I hope that we shall have more than adequate opportunity to cover all the critical issues.
<P>
The Government's objectives are to ensure that we improve the country's transport system by integrating it and making it as safe, modern and efficient as the country deserves. The problems that we inherited are many and they cannot be put right overnight, but we have a clear vision of where we are going and of what a modern transport system should be. We have a strategy of how to get there and we are putting the delivery mechanisms, resources and, by virtue of the Bill, the legislative powers in place to make it happen. It will be one of the most important Bills to be passed by the House this year and I am honoured to be here, together with my two colleagues, to show the importance the Government attach to the Bill. Three Ministers are serving on the Committee and we are all here to ensure that this important legislation receives the consideration it requires and progresses towards the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I echo the sentiments of the Minister, as it will be a pleasure to serve under you again, Mr. Gale. I have served under you before and I recognise none of the pen portraits that is a caricature of the real man. The Minister claims that we have all been furnished with these portraits. He is now so locked into his civil service mentality that he does not realise that we do not get the same amount of information and briefing that he does from his 10,000 civil servants. We have been given no such slander with which to berate you, Mr. Gale, and I am sure that you will manage the safe separation of members of the Committee in the same way that National Air Traffic Services intend to continue managing the safe separation of aircraft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): I was aware when I heard the Minister speaking that he was referring to briefing that I have not received and I assumed that this would be some new Labour briefing. My hon. Friend is making a serious accusation by saying that civil servants are now so politicised that they are providing briefing to the Labour party that describes the Chairman as irascible. Will my hon. Friend please reconsider and perhaps withdraw his remark because it is a serious allegation?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the right hon. Gentleman will find, the Chairman has a remarkably thick skin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) makes a perfectly reasonable point. This could easily be settled if the Minister would arrange for all Committee members to receive his briefing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> These profiles were not provided by the civil service. They were drawn from some other source—I am not sure what that is. I referred to the profile of myself, which is far from complimentary, so I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have absolutely no hesitation in making my briefing available to all other members of Committee so that they can see the quality of the remarks. I am now informed that these come from the BBC's web site, so members can probably obtain them, but I will arrange for them to be circulated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea, has a point. This briefing has obviously been placed in the Minister's folder at public expense, when it is purely a political matter. However, I wish to move on and I welcome the Minister to the Committee. We are delighted to see him in his place and on his feet. He has told me that he is under instructions not to spend too much time with us, but we wish him the best of health and a speedy recovery. We would prefer him to get well and come back fighting, rather than overdo it in any way too soon. He has, I am sure, the best wishes of the whole Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I echo my hon. Friend's welcome to the Minister. Does my hon. Friend agree, none the less, that it is odd that a Minister who until now has not had transport as part of his portfolio, as far as I am aware, should suddenly be drafted in to take part in this Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That matter is relevant to how long we may have to spend on the Bill and to the time allowed by the motion. The Bill is very long—in fact, it is three or four Bills within one. Originally, it was anticipated that air traffic control, buses and local transport plans, congestion charging and railways might have been four separate Bills, so we are dealing with a very big Bill indeed.
<P>
I wish to reassure the business managers of the Labour party that we do not intend to linger unduly over any part of this Bill. Let us suppose that we want to complete our consideration of the Bill around Easter. That would mean 110 to 120 hours of debate in four sittings a week and, by my reckoning, that would allow just under half an hour per clause. There are 220 clauses, so that does not allow any time for debate on the schedules. There are 258 pages and we would be spending a very short time on each page to keep within that sort of time scale. However, I intend that we should proceed with due speed.
<P>
Key points in the Bill are of more importance than others. We will want to debate the key clauses on air traffic control. We will want to debate at length transfer schemes. Ministers must realise that it will slow us down if we do not have the necessary information. It will be difficult to discuss licensing air traffic control providers if we have not seen a draft licence. I understood from informal discussions with various parties that the Government were well down the road with a draft licence, which is a lengthy and complex document. The licence is mentioned in clause 1. How can we start to discuss licensing air traffic control providers if we do not have a copy of the licence? Will the Minister say how soon he can provide the Committee with a copy of that vital information?
<P>
Discussion of, chapter II of the Bill will be equally meaningless unless we have other information and it will take a great deal of Ministers' time. Chapter II is an enabling section of the Bill for Ministers. It would give them the power to do things but does not make it clear what those things are. We would like to see much more detail as to what the Government intend to do under Chapter II. The official Opposition have received a letter from the Minister in the other place who is considering the nature of these transfers. Special articles of association are involved, which we have not seen. A special shareholder's agreement is involved. Could we have an assurance from the Government that they will provide at least a draft of the shareholder's agreement and of the articles of association, so that we have some idea of the sort of scheme to which the Government intend to transfer this business?
<P>
Other parts of the Bill upon which we want to dwell are the assurances enshrined in the golden share and the protection of the national interest in the air traffic services operation. We will want to look carefully at the obligations on local authorities under local transport plans. The quality contract schemes in particular will take up a lot of time. We discussed road user charging and the workplace parking levy at length in consideration of the Greater London Authority Bill, although that Bill was guillotined and certain aspects of those two schemes were not properly discussed. We want to come back to that. The Bill's railways provisions have already been extensively discussed in Select Committee, but it has always been clear that the debating and scrutiny of a draft Bill by a Select Committee is no substitute for the clause-by-clause examination of a Bill in Standing Committee, where the Minister can be cross-examined by hon. Members on each clause. That is our intention.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the select Committee, at the beginning of its report on the railways makes the specific point that its pre-legislative scrutiny must under no circumstances be considered an alternative for, or a reason for the curtailment of, our scrutiny of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the amplification of that point. Our consideration of the Bill takes time. The Committee's time is precious and our programme depends on the goodwill of Committee Members.
<P>
I thank the Government for not contemplating any formal timetabling of the Bill. That shows good faith, but it should not preclude us from discussing informally our timetable objectives so that we can debate all the parts that we want to.
<P>
Without making any ad hominem arguments, I come finally to the composition of the Committee. The Minister for Transport is now a Minister in the other place and transport policy is largely conducted by him. The Minister for Housing and Planning has no direct responsibilities for transport, and I understand that he may have to be absent for much of the Bill. That leaves the transport aspects of the Bill very much in the hands of the Under Secretaries, albeit two extremely nice and capable people.
<P>
There is a trend, particularly under this Government, for Ministers with responsibility for policy to appear in Committee; we talk to the monkeys, not the organ grinder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is so easy to provoke. It is a pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am sorry that we have an element of controversy so early in the Committee's proceedings. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have demonstrated a great deal of knowledge of these matters since they were appointed? Would that some of their knowledge had been absorbed by the hon. Gentleman himself and some of his colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is on the Committee. On Second Reading he complained about the imposition of quality contracts on the bus industry, an industry about which he knows a great deal His contribution will be valuable and the Ministers will benefit from his superior knowledge of that industry, I do not believe that they understand. The hon. Gentleman's minders in his own parliamentary party have clearly shown some wisdom,. recognising that Ministers need some assistance.
<P>
There is an increasing deficiency in the scrutiny of important legislation by the House. Ministers have no responsibility for the policy that they are expounding or are so junior as to be mere functionaries in the process of its implementation. Under the previous Government, Secretaries of State appeared in Standing Committees. The fact that the Secretary of State is not a member of this Committee may be the final confirmation that he has no responsibility for policy. The right hon. Gentleman is the senior Minister responsible for transport and it is reasonable to expect him to be here, He opened the Second Reading debate. If he has any responsibility for policy, why is he not on the Committee? The fact that the people who make policy are not available for cross-examination during the scrutiny of a Bill is a continuing erosion of the importance of Parliament and it betrays the Government's lack of respect for Parliament. As a result, we may well take longer than half an hour per clause to deal with the Bill. Messages will have to be sent to people who are not in the Committee so that they can answer questions and deal with the matters raised
<P>
Finally, Mr. Gale, there are many matters of concern in the Bill. It arrived late—more than half way through this Parliament, during which time the Government have already made a mess of their transport policy. I see in the papers this morning that the Secretary of State's popularity has plummeted, as has that of the Prime Minister. The Bill is now a desperate measure to rescue the Government's reputation on transport, but it compounds the errors as it seeks more state control.
<P>
We may well take much longer over the Bill than four sittings a week. We must be prepared to add additional sittings to the proposed timetable if we are to discuss the Bill fully. I trust that the Government will be prepared to add those sittings rather than resort to the laziness of the guillotine, which is nothing but fear of proper scrutiny.
<P>
 One coda to these comments is that some concern has been expressed about the 9 am start on Thursday. I should not be doing my job as shop steward for the workers on this Committee—especially for the House of Commons staff, the clerks and civil servants, who also have to attend Standing Committees—if I did not raise that issue. I am interested to know what hon. Members think about a 9 am start on Thursday mornings. It is part of what we have to call ``modernisation''. Some of us get up early anyway, but like to do things before we come to the Committee. If we can start a little later, I shall not mind at all. I am interested to hear what my right hon. and hon. Friends have to say on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I have had an opportunity to serve under you on another Committee, Mr. Gale, and nothing that took place there led me to believe that you are irascible and short-tempered. In my experience, you have demonstrated the skills that you are determined to show in this Committee, namely, to ensure courtesy and relevance throughout. It is a great pleasure to serve under you again. I also look forward to serving under Mr. Benton when he is in the Chair.
<P>
You said, Mr. Gale, that you intended to be the air traffic controller of the Committee—an interesting analogy, given that traffic control is one of the major issues in the Bill. You will have to decide, privately during the debate, whether you want to be part privatised, as the Government would like, completely privatised, as Conservative Members would like, or to remain in the public sector, as the Liberal Democrats wish.
<P>
The Minister for Housing and Planning was right to say that the Bill is complex and important. We entirely agree and I am delighted that he acknowledges that it is important for all Committee members to have the opportunity to scrutinise it in detail. I particularly welcome the fact that he said that the Government did not claim to have every detail right and that they would be willing to listen to reasoned arguments put by all members of the Committee and, if they accepted them, to change their minds. Because of that openness from the Minister, which I welcome, it is crucial that we all abide by the undertaking given by the hon. Member for North Essex that we will not unduly delay the Committee and will proceed as rapidly as possible, provided that we can have detailed scrutiny at all stages.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) gave a new meaning to the word ``finally'' by giving us three finallys during his contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It has been done before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> There are Liberal Democrat Members who may have used more than three—but no names and no pack drill, Mr. Gale. I am also surprised that the hon. Member for North Essex was critical of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for not serving on this Committee when I note no sign of his right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) on the Conservative Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I speak in this Committee on behalf of the shadow Cabinet—[Hon. Members: ``Oh!'']. I confess that I am still getting used to it, but there is no representative of the Cabinet in this Committee—we have merely messengers. I speak on transport policy on behalf of the Conservative party. We do not have my equivalent on the Labour side of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have no doubt that the Committee enjoyed that intervention: it was most enjoyable. The hon. Member for North Essex pointed out that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will want to scrutinise, debate and propose alternatives to a number of different aspects of the legislation. That is why it is so important that we have a sittings motion that allows for adequate scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
For example, Liberal Democrats will want to ensure that part I, which refers to the National Air Traffic Services, is amended to put safety at the very top of the list of the Minister's duties. It is strange that a Bill of this importance contains no direct reference to safety, notwithstanding the Secretary of State's acceptance that safety is the paramount issue.
<P>
As we made clear on Second Reading, we will also want to move amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): The hon. Gentleman says that there is no reference to safety in the Bill, but nothing could be further from the truth. The proposals—the separation of service provision and regulation—are directly related to safety in all its aspects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I would draw his attention to clause 1, which specifies what the functions of the Secretary of State shall be based upon. The hon. Gentleman will see that there is no direct reference to safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by referring him to clause 1(2)(a), which identifies safety as one of the only interests to be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We are perhaps going to get into a semantic argument which, Mr. Gale, I am sure you would not want. If the Minister looks carefully at the wording of clause 1 and the separation of subsections (1) and (2) and checks the grammar, he will accept that exercising the function does not in that list include safety.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that we shall have several hours to debate clause 1. Can we return to the sittings motion please?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As I said, Mr. Gale, I thought that you would probably not want to have that semantic debate at this stage. We want to propose some amendments to part II—for example, that there should be consultation with the key stakeholders on local transport plans and an opportunity for local transport Bills to enable a variety of means to be used to reduce congestion, other than simply by charging as proposed. On quality partnerships with bus companies, it is important that there should be a debate about the possibility of those partnerships involving more than one bus company in a particular area and, where that takes place, about how to sort out conflicts of interest over fair trading.
<P>
I have a particular concern about tourist buses in some of our historic cities, including my own city of Bath. I hope that we may be able to persuade the Government to put some reference to the regulation of those vehicles on the face of the Bill. The important role of traffic commissioners and the possibility of strengthening it is another area on which we want to touch.
<P>
We are delighted that the Government are including in the Bill proposals on concessionary fares, but again we should like to use the opportunity afforded by this generous motion to explore the possibility of extending the scope of that policy to consider some of the other modes of transport that may be available to pensioners. We wish to explore with the Government why they appear not to have been so vigorous in pursuing workplace charging as was their initial intention—not least to consider the possibility of workplace charging for out-of-town shopping and leisure centres.
<P>
On part IV of the Bill, there is considerable support on both sides of the Committee for the proposal to establish the Strategic Rail Authority, but some areas of detail need to be explored. For example, the authority will only be able to purchase train services, whereas at present passenger transport executives in some parts of the country can purchase both train and bus services, which enables greater integration. There is concern that that may be lost as part of the proposal.
<P>
I have already mentioned safety, which is particularly important in respect of the role of the Strategic Rail Authority. The Secretary of State has said that he is minded to separate out that responsibility and we hope that during our proceedings we may get more information from the Government about their proposals.
<P>
We hope to raise a number of other issues, but all Committee members will acknowledge what the Minister said at the beginning—that this is an important Bill and one in which there will be a number of controversial areas. However, I am convinced that under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, we will have a constructive debate. As the hon. Member for North Essex said, this Bill has been a long time coming. Whether it will have been worth waiting so long for will depend on the result of the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
Finally—that is my first ``finally''. [Hon. Members: ``That's two!'']—Oh dear, I can see that it is going to be that sort of Committee.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Oh no, it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The pantomime season has not yet ended.
<P>
On the 9 am start on Thursdays, many Committee members might privately have preferred a later start and I know that some are concerned about the impact that it will have on the Clerk and his staff, who have to come in very much earlier. Perhaps Mr. Gale could advise the Committee on this. I understand that if we start later, we will have only a short time before we have to break for prayers. Such brief deliberations in the mornings could result in the afternoon sittings being extended. That could mean a later finish on Thursday evenings than some hon. Members might wish. On balance, therefore, a 9 am start may ultimately be to the benefit of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked for my opinion and I will give it. The sittings motion is entirely a matter for the Government. They and the usual channels must determine at what hours the Committee sits. The Officers of the Committee and its Chairman are here to serve the Committee and for no other purpose. Having said that, I would place on the record the fact that the Clerks Department does find a 9 am start a little difficult when significant numbers of amendments are tabled the night before. Perhaps hon. Members will bear that in mind and, if we are to start at 9 am, at the very least table amendments as early as possible to give the Clerks a chance to process them and have them ready for the start of the sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): First, I draw the Committee's attention to my listing in the Register of Members' Interests. I am a director of a family business that has some interest in building and some vehicles. I wish to make a general declaration and at certain points in the Bill, when appropriate, I will state my interest.
<P>
I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. We have a fairly long road ahead. The Opposition are keen to make progress. Whether four sittings and 10 hours a week will be enough to do justice to the many important matters that we have to discuss I am not sure. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex that if it came down to meeting longer hours rather than guillotining, I would rather do the longer hours because, as we have seen in recent years, some of the issues are so important that they need proper discussion and airing.
<P>
The Bill before us should have been four Bills. It is 258 pages long, and has 231 clauses and 26 schedules. However, the explanatory notes are only 42 pages long. That makes life difficult when we are trying to interpret what different sections of the Bill mean. Some of it is very complex and technical. The more information that we can get from the Government, the easier it will be to make progress. If further information were forthcoming, the four sittings and 10 hours might then be enough.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex mentioned the draft licence. It is important for us to know what form that will take and perhaps even to have some indication of what exemptions there would be. That section is important to the scope of the Bill.
<P>
The Government have given many guarantees and assurances that are not on the face of the Bill. The Opposition would like the Government to explain rather more fully how those clinical assurances on the Bill are to be encompassed: whether on the face of the Bill by amendment, or by letters or further assurances given within the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex mentioned articles of association. The articles of association, shareholders' agreements and how the partnership directors would operate are key matters. They are not directly within the Bill, but are key matters as regards how the scheme should operate. We have heard a good deal about the sale and the division of shares within the sale. However, we do not know whether the 5 per cent for employees is an equal shareholding to all the employees throughout National Air Traffic Services, whether it is loaded in favour of the management or whether those who have retired from the organisation will receive preferential shares or be cut out. We know no details about the sale or the manner in which it will be undertaken, so any assurances in that regard would assist us.
<P>
The Secretary of State issued a press release on 27 July 1999 in which he made it clear that he wanted to provide greater security of employment rights for NATS employees. One means of doing so is through a stakeholder council, but we do not yet know the composition and the manner in which such a council would operate. If the Government are to give assurances about the employment rights of workers, it is important that they are set out clearly as the Bill goes through the House. Whether four sittings a week and 10 hours are enough to explore the issues remains to be seen, but it is important for the Government to offer explanations at a relatively early stage.
<P>
In the Government's consultation document, the suggestion was that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the strategic partner, airport users and the Ministry of Defence would be represented, so evidently the Government have some idea of what they wish to create in terms of a stakeholder council; yet we see no detail.
<P>
The number of hours that we sit may impact on employee pensions. The Deputy Prime Minister has given guarantees that the pension schemes and employment rights of staff will be protected, but the Bill does not say a great deal about pensions. In the summary of the Government's consultations, certain points are made about the Treasury setting out ways in which staff pensions can be protected under public-private partnership deals, but we should like to see more about how the pension scheme will operate and how the rights of the workers within it will be protected.
<P>
Pensions are an important matter that came up time and again in the consultation: both trade unions and workers were concerned about their pension fund and what would happen to the surplus. There is concern about two-tier pensions: existing NATS workers would continue within the scheme, but new workers would be in a different scheme. The Government would be wise to set out clearly at a relatively early stage how they envisage the process operating in order to reassure employees of NATS who are concerned. The consultation document made it clear that most NATS employees did not regard the provision of shares as adequate compensation for the diminution of their pension rights. Whether four sittings a week and 10 hours of debate are enough to explore this important topic for people who work for the company is an important question.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said, it is not clear what receipts the Government would receive from the public-private partnership deals. In his letter to my hon. Friend, Lord Macdonald made it clear that the Government were not introducing PPPs for cash proceeds. The explanatory note that we discussed on the Floor of the House stated that only a net £15 million might be received by the Government. We now have a letter from Lord Macdonald setting out what the situation might be. It is not entirely clear, however; and one needs to reread it three or four times to gain any idea of what the Government expect. It is important to have a much clearer explanation of what the Government expect and what would happen in terms of debt.
<P>
The more information we have up front, the easier it will be to explore certain clauses; otherwise, we shall table more probing amendments or try to put things into the Bill that do not need to be included. If those reassurances are given, either here or in writing, we shall make better progress. I look forward to your chairing our meetings, Mr. Gale, and to making good progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Like other members of the Committee, I have served under you, Mr. Gale. You will know that I am not prone to sycophantic gobbledegook, but I will say that you are an excellent Chairman and, in my view, have always sought to be sensitive to the needs of humble Back Benchers when they go on too long.
<P>
I am pleased to serve on the Committee that will consider this major transport legislation, which is based on local partnerships and solutions set against the backdrop of a national strategic framework and sustained national investment. Parts II and IV will be especially welcomed by people in my Eccles constituency, where car ownership is 10 per cent below the national average. Pensioners, women and children and the poorer families depend on public transport. They want it to be convenient, safe, affordable and on time. It must not shrink to vanishing point at weekends. This Bill will enable a high-quality integrated transport service to be delivered.
<P>

<P>
In Greater Manchester, we have significant achievements on which to build. The Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has been at the forefront of developing integrated transport policies and services with private sector operators and local authorities. The Bill contains a number of extremely helpful provisions for passenger transport authorities. For example, they will be able to devise and implement quality partnership schemes open to any operator willing to meet the conditions of those agreements. I believe that my constituents will benefit from the new local transport plans, which enable traffic pinch points, such as that in the Cadishead area of my constituency to be tackled—to improve public transport, air quality and road safety.
<P>
The new Strategic Rail Authority detailed in part IV is an absolute priority. My constituents are unhappy with the reduction in rail services throughout Eccles and the lack of Sunday services. The response of operators to these complaints is slow and inadequate. Passengers are dissatisfied and disenfranchised. It is vital that local needs are fully taken into account when franchises for rail services are let, and the best mechanisms for ensuring that, must be agreed. We must give careful consideration to the respective roles of the Strategic Rail Authority and passenger transport authorities.
<P>
In the north-west, we have some of the oldest and most-used industrial roads in the world. Motorists experience congestion and local residents suffer pollution, traffic noise and vibration damage The Government's announcement before Christmas of £20 million for the Manchester and Salford inner relief road, to cover not only completion of the inner ring road but public transport and environmental improvements, was welcome. The measures in part III will enable local authorities to tackle these problems with measures best suited to local conditions.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I am conscious of the fact that he is the only Government Member who has sought to speak, but he is in some danger of making a Second Reading speech. He must relate his remarks to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I have only one final statement in relation to the sittings motion
<P>
My constituency is close to Manchester airport. Last year, 18 million passengers travelled through that airport and, like the Government, I want to secure the best possible service and safety standards for them through a modernised National Air Traffic Services. I look forward to our debate on the proposals in part I and I am pleased that the Committee will address that important issue first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I echo the words of my colleagues and others about how delighted we are to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and also that of Mr. Benton. I was concerned when I heard you described as the ``traffic controller''. For a moment I thought, in the words of my late constituent the Rev Awdrey, that you had described yourself as the ``fat controller''. Then I quickly realised, when I glanced at you, that that description far better applies to the Secretary of State who, without a doubt, is the top-hatted fat controller—even if he has not found time to be here with us today. Nevertheless, we do look forward to serving under your chairmanship.
<P>
I declare an interest in that I enjoy pro bono membership of the Baltic Exchange, which has responsibility for air chartering. That is a pretty peripheral interest, but for the sake of good order I am happy to declare it to the Committee.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was talking about the very substantial amount of business that we have to discuss and how we might need more hours or more sittings, it was interesting to see Government Back Benchers raising their eyes in desperation and groaning about the prospect of sitting on those Benches for hours on end. I can well understand their sense of frustration as, having served on several Committees, I know that Government Back Benchers are not allowed to say a single word I hope that and I can well understand their sense of frustration, having sat in a number of Committees in which Government Back Benchers are not allowed to say a single word. I hope that this Committee will be different from that. I see a number of hon. Members below the aisle who I hope will have some useful and interesting things to say on the detail of the Bill, despite what their Whips might enjoin.
<P>
We are delighted to be able to serve and to spend as long as is necessary on scrutinising this lengthy, detailed and badly drafted Bill. I mean no disrespect to the draftsmen, who may well be present. It requires significant tidying up and sorting out. It was interesting that on the Greater London Authority Bill, which was the last large Bill of this size, the Government tabled something like 1,000 amendments. I hope that the Government are able to accept what we have to say about this Bill, muddled as it is, and to table in good time amendments to tidy it up. The other unsatisfactory thing about the GLA Bill was that a large number of amendments were tabled the day before Report and Third Reading when there was no time to consider them.
<P>
I echo the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex about the people who are represented here. I mean no disrespect. When I was a special adviser in the Department of the Environment, I often had the opportunity of watching the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), now the Minister for Housing and Planning and other hon. Members who are now Ministers of State speaking on housing and local government matters. The hon. Gentleman certainly had no interest in those days in transport matters. Even during this Parliament I have not heard him once saying anything about transport matters. As far as I am aware, he has no transport interest, knowledge, experience or briefing. It was obvious that the Government had to find a Minister of State from somewhere, and the hon. Gentleman has been drafted in. It will be interesting to see what happens with regard to housing and inner city regeneration, which are the other areas of his portfolio, while he is busy on this heavy Bill I suspect that they may suffer.
<P>
When we were taking Bills through the House from the Department of the Environment, it was without precedent to have two Under-Secretaries doing the main work on the Bill. I mean no disrespect to them, but it seems rather strange for the Government to have put two Under-Secretaries on the Committee. It perhaps reflects the peculiar structure of the DETR now. Apparently a Scottish Lord has responsibility for transport, the Secretary of State has no responsibility for transport and there is no Minister of State with responsibility for transport. What a muddle the Department is in. I suspect that the composition of the team on the Front Bench reflects that muddled thinking.
<P>
I have the honour to serve on the Transport Sub-Committee and in the two and a half years since the Government came to power, we have studied National Air Traffic Services twice and produced two reports on its privatisation. I wish that it were privatised. We produced one report on aviation safety and, of course, we did the prelegislative scrutiny of the Railways Bill. In addition to that, we held a lengthy inquiry into the so-called integrated transport White Paper. A total of five studies—probably something like a year and a half of Committee time—produced a large number of detailed proposals, including some on the Railways Bill that forms part of this massive Bill.
<P>
The curious thing is that many of the recommendations produced by the Labour-dominated Transport Sub-Committee have been ignored in the Bill. I hope that when we get into discussion of the detail, the Government will begin to learn how to listen not only to the Opposition, although I hope that they will do so, but to their hon. Friends on the Committee who also sit on the Transport Sub-Committee. I hope that they will listen to what was said in the pre-legislative scrutiny procedure and incorporate some of the matters that we went to some length and care to incorporate into the report.
<P>
As I have already said, I believe that the Bill is badly drafted. I suspect that the only bit that many members of the Committee have had time to read with any care is the early part about NATS licensing. That part is extraordinarily badly drafted, as the number of amendments that have already been tabled show. It has not been thought through carefully. It is not clear what some of the provisions mean, and that will have to be sorted out.
<P>
Another matter caught my eye as I glanced through the Bill. I listened to the Secretary of State when he had responsibility for transport, speaking after the tragic Paddington rail crash. He made great play of the fact that the safety and standards directorate was to be removed from Railtrack and that setting that up would be part of the Bill. It seems extraordinary that that important provision, which the Transport Sub-Committee endorsed, the public welcomed, and the Secretary of State went to great lengths to make a lot of noise about the morning after that terrible tragedy, is not now incorporated into the Bill. 
<P>
If the Government are to be taken at their word—after two and a half years of listening to them on transport, I am not sure that they are—they will make some detailed proposals on the safety and standards directorate as soon as possible so that the Committee can properly consider them. Alternatively, they must say. ``We are very sorry, but everything that we said the morning after the Paddington crash was in error and we have now decided not to remove the safety and standards directorate from Railtrack.'' At all events, they must clarify the matter.
<P>
The privatisation of NATS also needs to be studied with some care. NATS should be privatised, as we said on Second Reading. The proposals in the Bill are a complicated muddle which is neither privatisation nor retention in the public service. The question of risk transference—who takes the risk if the company collapses—is muddled The clauses on privatisation need to be scrutinised extremely carefully to work out precisely what will happen once the company has been set up.
<P>
There are many good parts to the Bill. We welcome them, but we hope that we can perhaps improve the detail. Overall, however, having thought about various parts of the Bill in some detail in the Transport Sub-Committee, I believe that the Bill is something of a muddled horlicks, thrown together to try to demonstrate that the Government's so-called integrated transport policy is a reality. The Bill is about the privatisation of NATS; that is what it comes down to. The Strategic Rail Authority is a quango and does not amount to a hill of beans. It is actually about the privatisation of NATS and the section on the privatisation of NATS seems a complicated compromise designed to buy off the Government's Back Benchers.
<P>
I hope, therefore, Mr. Gale, that we shall be given sufficient time to consider the Bill in detail, and that the Government will listen carefully to what we have to say and produce from a muddled horlicks a slightly more workable document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale. Having served under your chairmanship before, I know that you take a robust line in ensuring that members adhere to the question in hand. That is a huge advantage to Back Benchers such as myself because it enables us to get in and have our say. I look forward to working under you and trying to adhere to the lines that you lay down.
<P>
I shall not delay the Committee too long on the sittings motion. It is extraordinary that after 18 years in opposition and two years in government, the Government have come up with this Bill. I speak for the road users of the country. I represent a rural constituency; 67 per cent. of people in Shropshire drive to work in a car, and 97 per cent. of goods move in a motorised truck. All road users in this country have been devastated by the Government's policies in the past two years. We must have time when we discuss road charging and parking charges, which are straight taxes, to take into account what the Government have already done. The average motorist is paying £900 a year in extra tax since they came to power. The road haulage industry has been devastated. It now costs £5,750 in tax for a 38-tonne truck as opposed to about £300 in somewhere like Portugal. When I put those arguments in an Adjournment debate to the then Economic Secretary, she said in her best ``Listen with Mother'' mode that it was all being done in the interests of the environment.
<P>
Here we see a major swing in the Government's policy. The Minister referred earlier to picking up information on the net. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions website told us back in 1998 that Government policy would reduce traffic to ``3 per cent. below the current forecast''. We have seen a drift. As the bite has been put on the benighted motorists and haulers of this country, we have seen the focus groups begin to squeal and Government policy has begun to change.
<P>
Responsibility for transport has been taken away from the Secretary of State and given to a Minister in another place, who appears to have learned some of the lessons from the focus groups. He says that people living in rural areas or disadvantaged people on housing estates are the people who cannot afford a car. We are talking about issues of social exclusion. That was what Lord Macdonald said shortly after he took over the real job of running transport.
<P>
He took over the real job of running transport. I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend for North Essex, that we do not have the real players here. We do not have the Deputy Prime Minister, who may or may not be in charge of transport; we do not have Lord Whitty or Lord Macdonald. It is hard to see how the Committee will work when we have a moving target. The Times today says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Ministers will concede defeat to the motorist today by admitting that they cannot prevent traffic levels rising by more than a quarter over the next decade.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We learn that the real man in charge is not the Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Whitty, Lord Macdonald or either of the Ministers here today, but the man charged with setting up the Government's 10-„year transport strategy: Willy Rickett, a senior civil servant. Not only is the Bill thoroughly badly drafted, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) said, but it may already be out of date. On those grounds I ask that we have the maximum amount of time to discuss the details of road charging. The proposals are extraordinarily sketchy and flimsily put together and we need to take into account the huge increases in taxation already imposed on road users.
<P>
If a further dramatic change in Government policy is announced, as is suggested in The Times today, will it be acceptable for one of the junior Ministers here today to stand down in favour of the Deputy Prime Minister, so that he can come to the Committee and tell us what is going on? We are following a moving target. We began with a transport policy in 1998 that was all about the environment It hit the buffers with the focus groups and is now moving away.
<P>
The Times said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government is not prepared for further conflict with motorists, ministers will make clear that draconian action, such as big increases in fuel tax or road tolls in all cities, is not an option.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that fuel tax take is going up, as table B9 of the pre-Budget report at page 54 clearly shows.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have a Government in turmoil; we do not have the big players here. If the question comes up, Mr. Gale, will you accept that a junior Minister could stand down in favour of the big cheese? If—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has posed a question and I will answer. The Committee of Selection in its wisdom has not chosen to put the Secretary of State on the Committee. There is no question of a member standing down in favour of someone else: that would be out of order, as indeed is the hon. Gentleman. May we return to the sittings motion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am sorry that we shall not have any input from those who are calling the shots in Government transport policy. I repeat that a lot of detail has to be gone through on the impact of road charging. For my constituents, who live in a rural area, there will never be a comprehensive public transport system. They live in one local authority, but almost certainly drive to work in another, they drive out of Shropshire to bigger towns such as Telford, Wrexham or Newcastle-under-Lyme and, as the Bill stands, the money levied by the local authority will be levied on behalf of people other than my constituents. They will see no benefit, because, as the Bill states, the local authority can spend the money raised by parking and congestion charges only on schemes within that authority's jurisdiction.
<P>
I speak for all people in rural Britain [Laughter.] The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East always has a good laugh about this. He is an urban man and does not understand the impact on millions of people who drive from the countryside into a town.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I wish that all the people in rural Britain would concentrate on the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I will adhere to your ruling, Mr. Gale. The detail has not been worked out. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said, the Bill is thoroughly badly drafted. I ask Ministers and you, Mr. Gale, not to impose a guillotine at any stage on the clauses on road charging. They will have a devastating impact on very large numbers of people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): May I say what a great pleasure it is to serve under you, Mr. Gale? I say that as a matter of personal experience. It is always best to rely on one's personal experience rather than going to a website to discover something. My experience with you has always been extremely positive. You are a man with whom one definitely has to watch one's Ps and Qs, but I have never at any time noted any irascibility in you.
<P>
I was rather puzzled, because I have known the Minister for Housing and Planning for a long time. He was the candidate in Fulham in 1986 when I first met him. He was known then as a man of tremendous charm and I was quite taken aback that in his opening bid to ingratiate himself he should accuse the Chair of irascibility. The handbook of how to win friends and influence people has clearly been rewritten somewhat by New Labour.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said that he had observed, when there were calls for us to sit longer hours, that the eyes of certain Government Back Benchers were rolling. I assure my hon. Friend that they were not the only eyes that were rolling: mine were beginning to roll at that point.
<P>
I understand that Ministers—thrusting and ambitious young men that they are—want to demonstrate their keenness and to do this over a prolonged time, but my reaction to the sittings motion was rather different. My feeling was that here was a Government who had spent an inordinate amount of time preparing the Bill, with a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing, a great deal of marching of the troops up the hill and down again and a great deal of uncertainty and confusion.
<P>
Eventually, the Bill arrives in the House. Everybody knows that it is a damp squib, that it is full of disappointments, particularly for the Labour party, that it is a great ragbag of diverse elements and that all the hype about what a great transport Bill it is is complete nonsense. It arrives in the House in this leisurely fashion. Then, suddenly, at our first sitting, the Government propose that we should move almost at once to two sittings a day. I ask myself, what is the need for such a great rush?
<P>
I was already asking myself that question before I focused as much as I should have done on the documents that are simply not available to us to enable us to continue our study of the Bill. My hon. Friends have referred to the special articles of association and the special shareholders' agreement in relation to the NATS privatisation which are not available to the Committee.
<P>
All precedents suggest to me that when a Government attempt to debate a Bill that relies heavily on subsidiary legislation or subsidiary documentation and to push it through before that subsidiary documentation is available, there will be trouble. I am not talking here about trouble from the Opposition. What can we do? We are very few, the Government are very numerous and they will overcome us whenever they want. I do not mean that sort of trouble. I mean confusion of thinking.
<P>
The Government do not know what they are about. They are not able to say convincingly to markets, employees, management, foreign bidders or anybody else who has an interest in this legislation precisely what they are about. Ministers will stand up again and again, particularly Ministers of the rank that we are being offered here, and the notes will come pouring across as fast as they can be written. I notice that the people whom we cannot see here have not been equipped with laptops, so the notes will come only at the speed of handwriting. The Ministers will founder and they will say that everything will be in the shareholders' agreement or in the special articles of association, and we shall not have that shareholders' agreement or those articles of association. As usual, it is Parliament that will be treated with contempt, because Parliament is not the body that the Government want to know what the legislation is intended to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Would not it be good if Mr. Jenkin would vacate his seat on the Front Bench and let the right hon. Gentleman take his rightful place, in view of his experience?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I remind the Committee that we refer to hon. Members by their constituency names. It is only the Chair that calls people by name, even in Committee
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I feel like a subaltern with the field marshal behind him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend is absurdly modest. I have said how pleased I am to serve under you, Mr. Gale, perhaps it is now appropriate to say that I am also extremely pleased to serve under my hon. Friend, who has already has given me distinguished leadership in our background dealings.
<P>
I was saying that we are not equipped to consider the Bill, when one of my hon. Friends made an even more important point about the details of the pension scheme that are not here for us to consider. I do not know whether others share my frustration, but constituents often write or come to see one about matters with which one cannot help them. They might have been involved in a court case, and that is a legal matter about which one cannot do anything. They might have a housing problem; one can do what one can, but we all know that that is a matter for the local authority. How rare it is that somebody writes or comes to the surgery about a matter that is actually the responsibility of Parliament. One can then say, ``As a parliamentarian, it is my responsibility to look after this person's interests.''
<P>
When it comes to a pension scheme and the future of people who have given loyal service to National Air Traffic Services, we should be in a position to offer them protection. We should be able to say, ``Yes, we can give you an absolute guarantee that we will be able to protect you and you may be reassured about your future,'' but that will not be possible unless the necessary documents are available to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that we should not go down the same road as the previous Government and rob the pension fund, as they did to the National Bus Company pensioners? We should look after these pensioners' interests and make sure that we learn from the mistakes of the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I will not participate in this foolish rewriting of history and I will not stray so far from the sittings motion. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about pensions—and for the moment I will take him at face value and believe that he is sincere—he should be on his hind legs demanding that the documentation is made available. He should say that it will be absolutely wrong for us to proceed to two sittings a day, which means that we will gallop through the clauses covering NATS and will reach the end before those vital documents are available. If he has a suspicious mind, he may even think that that is what the Government intend.
<P>
What progress will the hon. Gentleman make with amendments saying, ``leave out subsection (2),'' or ``after this, impose that''? We have to debate the issues as best we can by making amendments to the Bill as written. What he is concerned about is whether this is an equitable privatisation that will achieve its objective of a safer environment for people flying in and around Britain and whether it will protect the interests of those who have worked in National Air Traffic Services. How will he be able to do his job in defending those vital interests if he does not have the important documentation? I hope that he will join me by making a speech, perhaps after this one, saying that he, too, believes that we are rushing too speedily towards two sittings a day when we do not yet have the right documents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Perhaps I should declare one of my interests as a member of the RMT. In the past I have dealt with some of the pension funds of companies privatised under the previous Government. I can name some funds in which pensioners and employees lost their surpluses and some of their protection through privatisation when the right hon. Gentleman and his party were in government, so perhaps later on I will remind him of those.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> That still appears to me to have nothing to do with either the motion or the Bill. I am trying to get the hon. Gentleman to get his nose out of his perverted history books—perhaps I should say books of perverted history—and focus on the matter in question.
<P>
The other reason why we should proceed more slowly towards two sittings and why I think that the motion is inappropriate is a matter that has been touched on concerning the membership of the Committee. You have ruled that it is not in order for any member of the Committee to stand down, Mr. Gale. I believe that it is in order for the Committee of Selection to make changes in a Committee's membership if circumstances so dictate. I have no idea how the Committee of Selection reaches its decisions but it seems plausible that if the Government believe that some change should be made, it might be sympathetic to that point of view.
<P>
I believe that the Secretary of State should be a member of the Committee. I do not know how the Government can claim that this is a great, massive and epoch-making Bill and then offer us the Front-Bench team that they have offered us. Is this the team that one would put on an epoch-making Bill, I ask myself. Clearly epochs are made more easily for the Labour party than they are made for me if the Government believe that this is what constitutes an epoch-making Front Bench.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> One thing to which we have not so far made reference in discussing who is on the Front Bench is the fact that we are privileged to have a former transport Minister, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), serving on the Committee, who I am sure will have some useful things to say about the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> He is so useful that he is not on the Government Front Bench any more but elsewhere in the Committee. We shall probably hear from him.
<P>
In the past, when there were epoch-making Bills Cabinet Ministers frequently served on the Committee. For instance, when I was Chief Secretary to the Treasury I served on an appropriate Bill. Things were not easy because in those days the Government had a small majority, which meant that the balance of the Committee was rather even. I had to attend quite frequently even though I was a Cabinet Minister.
<P>
I have been counting, and there are 15 Government Members here and eight Opposition Members. I believe that we are fully staffed on the Opposition Benches, so there is a tremendous majority for the Government. I am not saying that the Deputy Prime Minister, who is a busy man, should be here all the time; of course not. I do not make such an unreasonable demand. If he were a member of the Committee he could be here at the crucial moments to explain the Government's policy. If we did not agree to the motion but took longer to move to two sittings a day, the Government would have time to reflect on that important point and intercede with the Committee of Selection to see whether, after all, the Deputy Prime Minister could not be accommodated in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): That may explain why the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) is not on the shadow team, or has he gone down the tube and been replaced by the right hon. Gentleman?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I have listened to this discussion for some time now. The fact of the matter is that the Committee of Selection has made its choice. The Secretary of State is not on the Committee. There is no precedent for a Minister to be replaced save only for a change of portfolio. Let me make that plain now. What the right hon. Gentleman is asking for will not happen What other hon. Members are seeking to discuss bears little or no relation to the motion May we please now return to the sittings motion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My question was not to suggest that the right hon. Member for Wokingham should be on the Committee. It was about consistency. If we are being told that the Deputy Prime Minister should be on the Committee, should not the right hon. Member for Wokingham be on it, too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman had popped out of the room when this point was dealt with very forthrightly by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, who speaks for the shadow Cabinet on transport matters.
<P>
I remember Mr. Ridley being on a similar Committee dealing with transport matters when the previous Government introduced a Bill in 1985. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East will remember, as he, too, served on that Committee, as did the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). Mr. Gale, I shall curtail these remarks if you take the view that they are not relevant to the sittings motion, but I feel that a great discourtesy has been done to the House.
<P>
There is no reason why the Deputy Prime Minister should not be here—the Committee could carry him. Certain matters need to be explained: for example, I remember Labour Members saying that our air was not for sale. Does not explaining such an extraordinary reversal of policy require the Deputy Prime Minister, or is it to be left to an Under-Secretary of State? Not only is our air to be put up for sale in the way that the Conservatives might have proposed, via a flotation, but it is to be for sale to a going entity and so is likely to pass to foreigners.
<P>
Are the Government confident that the sittings motion will allow them sufficient time to explain that extraordinary change in policy? Are they confident that, when we reach clause 89(4), Ministers will have enough time to explain why an arrangement for the privatisation of NATS that depends so strongly on the maintenance of a golden share is revealed by that subsection as capable of being swept away by secondary legislation? In other words, the guarantee on which the Bill is hinged turns out to be no stronger than the flimsiest of orders that can be passed by the House.
<P>
Despite your prediction, Mr. Gale, that the Government would not want to change the composition of the Committee, the only way in which I can make a public appeal for that to happen is by speaking to the sittings motion. If the Bill is as serious and important as the Government lead us to believe, then even at this late stage they should have the humility either to bring the Deputy Prime Minister on to the Committee—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale I was under the impression that you had already ruled on this issue.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is absolutely correct. There is no precedent for a change of Minister, save when there has been a change in ministerial portfolio
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> In that case, I have one other suggestion.
<P>
With all due respect—I mean that sincerely—I note that during this Parliament many things have happened that are without precedent. From the monitor, I see that a debate is going on in Westminster Hall, which is without precedent, in all the centuries that Parliament has existed, there has never been a separate debate in Westminster Hall, until now. We have been debating commencing a Committee sitting at 9 am, until recently, that was unprecedented. The reason we now sit at 9 am on a Thursday is that we generally finish the main business on the Floor of the House by 7 pm. That is unprecedented—it certainly has not happened in recent decades of parliamentary history. I therefore propose constitutional novelty, and I do not see why it should not be introduced. I do not see why we should not reject the sittings motion so that the Government have time to think the question over.
<P>
The Government have arranged matters so that the Minister of State in charge of transport policy—the responsibility is now acknowledged in his title, Minister for Transport—sits in the House of Lords. Therefore, a difficulty arises, because this is a House of Commons Standing Committee. As the Commons is the senior of the two Chambers, why should not a constitutional novelty allow the Committee to hold some sittings in the House of Lords, so that the Minister of State could be present? It is self-evident that he cannot be a member of the Standing Committee, but I see no reason why a special sitting or several special sittings could not be convened, attended by the man who is publicly acknowledged as having responsibility for transport policy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In the interests of all hon. Members and of precedent—I am aware that pronouncements from the Chair may be taken as precedent and used in future—I should point out that the change the right hon. Gentleman proposes would indeed require the House to make a formal change to its Standing Orders. Therefore, what the right hon. Gentleman suggests is not currently possible.
<P>
I should also clarify another matter, as I do not wish to mislead the Committee. The hon. Member for Eccles asked whether I had ruled on this matter. I confirmed that there was no precedent for changing a Minister during the course of a Committee, save a change of portfolio taking place. Members of the Committee will notice that I use the words ``during the course of a Committee'' carefully. Technically, the Committee is not sitting until the sittings motion has been passed. To that extent, the right hon. Gentleman is correct.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> He is shocked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am grateful and shocked. Thank you, Mr. Gale. I did not wish to trespass on your patience. I was calling for unprecedented actions and I recognise that they would require the Standing Orders of the House to be amended. As I said, in the two and a half years since I was a Member of Parliament, many developments have been unprecedented and required changes to the Standing Orders. Why should the Government make changes that are convenient to themselves rather than to the House, when they should assist the proper scrutiny of legislation?
<P>
I thank you for your guidance, Mr. Gale, but for all the reasons that I have adduced, the sittings motion is inappropriate. The Government would do well to allow morning sittings for the time being, until they have had time to think the problems through. Afternoon sittings should be allowed only when the proper mechanisms are in place properly to scrutinise the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I speak in the debate on the sittings motion because of the some of the comments made by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, but I have no intention of unduly prolonging proceedings.
<P>
I start by declaring an interest. As the hon. Member for North Essex reminded the Committee, I am chairman of a bus company which is part of the national express group. I shall make a more detailed declaration, if necessary, during the Bill's passage. I draw the Committee's attention to my declaration in the Register of Members' Interests.
<P>
It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. I have served on many Committees over many years. The question of who should serve and whether the Secretary of State and his or her shadow should always serve is a familiar debate. The right hon. Gentleman reminded the Committee that the late Nicholas Ridley served on some Standing Committees when he was Secretary of State. I betray no confidences, as I had a good deal of time for Nicholas Ridley who, though a political opponent, was a respected parliamentarian. He often made comments that he should not have made, which probably endeared him more to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee than did his more politically correct remarks. I remember him saying in early in a sitting, in which the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea was his junior Minister: ``That's my lot. I'll leave it to the up-and-coming chaps''—and off he went. That is not unusual in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am related to Nicholas Ridley by marriage. On the subject of juniors, I spoke to an ex-colleague of the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea who said that when he was appointed to work for Nicholas Ridley, he was told, ``I will give you all the good things to do. Anything nasty, call me in.'' Does that not contrast with Government's attitude to their Front Bench, on which their head man is not present to take the flak on his glass chin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is a relative of Nicholas Ridley, it is singularly unfortunate that he should drag his well-respected name into political controversy, as he tries to do. I shall be going down that road, but I shall return in a few moments to the serious point that was raised.
<P>
The Committee already has evidence of a dilemma, as there is an obvious split among Opposition ranks about the sittings motion. The hon. Member for North Essex, the subaltern, wants as much time for debate as possible, but the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, the field marshal, says that the sittings motion is nonsense. First, he says that we do not have some of the papers we need to do our job. Secondly, although he did not say it in so many words, he implies that it is somehow unparliamentary to meet at 9 am on Thursday morning and to talk of long sessions in the afternoon. Again, the Opposition cannot have it both ways. Either they want sufficient time to debate the legislation, or they want to go home early. I must confess that my sympathies are with the right hon. Gentleman. I have never been one for staying later than I have had to in my undistinguished years in this place. However, I accept the need for the motion because we face a long and complex Bill comprising more than 200 clauses. If we are to debate it properly, some time will be necessary.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to the contribution of the hon. Member for North Essex. He described himself as a shop steward and we are all grateful for that. Having listened to him on numerous occasions, he strikes me as a pretty unlikely Fred Kite. It is a relief to know that the well-being of Labour Back Benchers is uppermost in his mind as we start our deliberations on the Bill. Quite how he will achieve his aims in view of some of the contributions from his right hon. and hon. Friends, I do not know.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) speaks for all motorists and for all rural areas in the United Kingdom, so he will have little time to be in the Committee—we had better say hello and goodbye to him now. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) rightly reminded us of our responsibilities in respect of pensions. I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson): all privatisation measures—those passed by the previous Government and those involving the present one—cause problems. They certainly cause concern about the future of pension funds.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea rightly expresses concern about pension funds today. Would that he had demonstrated the same concern about them in relation to earlier privatisations. It is a concern that we share and we shall look to our distinguished group of Ministers to give us some reassurances about the future for those employees of NATS who have paid considerable amounts of their money into the pension scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire started with a ritual dig at the Deputy Prime Minister with whom I have served on various Committees, as has the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. My right hon. Friend is not someone who seeks to avoid his responsibilities, but, as Deputy Prime Minister and the head of significant Department, he has many other pressing duties that take up his time. He has been described as the Fat Controller: staying with the Rev. Awdrey and ``Thomas the Tank Engine'', was not Gordon the pompous locomotive? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will play the role of Gordon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The humble shunter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That is a pretty unlikely description of the hon. Gentleman—about as likely as the hon. Member for North Essex being the Committee's shop steward. However, they label themselves and I fear that the Committee will pick up those labels and run with them. What we have heard this morning is the usual parliamentary ritual. [Interruption.] I correct that. Normally the Opposition huff and puff and say they intend to keep people here as late and as long as possible because the Bill is so important that it needs the fullest possible debate. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea spoke for all us laggards when he said, ``It would be better not to be here at all, but if we must be, let it be for the shortest time possible.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The matter is rather subtle for the hon. Gentleman. However, the question is one of time phases. The Government should not table a motion for two sittings a day until they have considered the important matters that I raised. I am happy to sit every hour that God sends once those matters have been considered, the Deputy Prime Minister has taken his place, procedures have been sorted out and documentation has been made available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The case may well be too subtle for me. The right hon. Gentleman would be the first to acknowledge that subtlety is not a virtue in my eyes. His speech, although within the rules of order, will provide the Modernisation Committee with much food for thought. I look forward to the day when the thrusting, ambitious young men to whom he referred are part of his Administration. That may be in 2020—certainly not before then. We look forward to the right hon. Gentleman's comments on our proceedings in Committee and in the Chamber.
<P>
Finally, I betray no confidences when I say that Labour Committee members met informally to discuss matters such as our 9 am start. Some of us, including my hon. Friends the Members for Harwich and for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn), are former railwaymen and are not unused to shift work. However, the persuasive powers of my hon. Friends the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth)—the Whip—and the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, stopped us tabling a sittings motion proposing that we start at 6 am and go home at 2 pm. At least three of us are used to a 6 am start, although Opposition Members may not be used to being up and about at that hour. Such a start may have been appropriate, given the detailed nature of the Bill, but my hon. Friends the Member for Coventry, North-East and the Minister persuaded us otherwise
<P>
We reluctantly came to the view that 9 o'clock—albeit late for railway workers—is an acceptable compromise. We are not unused to working late shifts and, occasionally, night turns If the Opposition seek long hours and night work, I must tell them that some of us have not quite forgotten how to stay up all night.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I have not had the privilege of sitting in a Committee under your guidance before. However, I am impressed by your handling of the proceedings, as I am by Committee members' comments. I support the motion, as we need all the time that we can get to scrutinise a most important Bill
<P>
It is a great privilege to sit on the Committee. Transport has been sadly neglected for far too long, and here is an opportunity for everyone in Committee to make a valuable contribution to ensuring that we get it right. I was therefore pleased to hear that the hon. Member for North Essex, who led for the Opposition, does not intend to delay our proceedings unduly. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who spoke for the Liberal Democrats, supported that view.
<P>
However, what was said and what is done are two different things. Although a lot of support was offered, many scurrilous remarks were made, not least about who will steer the Bill through Committee. As a veteran of the Greater London Authority Bill, I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning is guiding the Bill through Committee. Anyone who sat on that Committee will appreciate my hon. Friend's skills and abilities in supervising the parliamentary passage of a complex, detailed Bill—indeed, one of the largest that there has been—to which more than 1,000 amendments were tabled. Those who think that he has no experience of transport should consider that a large chunk of that Act relates directly to transport matters, some of which pre-empt issues dealt with in the Bill. Every member of this Committee will be impressed by my hon. Friend and the work that he and his colleagues do during the consideration of the Bill. There have been several red herrings, including the suggestion that there should be not one but three or four transport Bills. That suggestion came from those hon. Members who have complained about the long delay in introducing a comprehensive transport Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am certain that the Deputy Prime Minister originally intended to introduce a transport Bill in the first Session of this Parliament, but he was denied the opportunity to do so. He was also denied the opportunity to introduce a Bill in the second Session of this Parliament. Therefore, he has a backlog of legislation to introduce, which is why the Bill is equivalent to three or four major Bills. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is satisfactory, he must be living on another planet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman could not be more wrong. The Government's intention is not to rush legislation through the House but to prepare it properly and ensure that we put the right legislation on to the statute book. I am delighted that the Bill covers three or four major areas of transport policy, precisely because the Government's policies constitute an integrated approach to transport. How better to deal with the integrated use of transport than to cover such broad issues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> How would the hon. Gentleman react to the thought that three Bills have been combined because Government Whips feared a major rebellion? If the privatisation of NATS had been introduced in one Bill, its progress through the House would have been difficult. By combining the measures, the Government hope to make the Back Benchers who would otherwise oppose them keep quite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> That is another red herring. We shall find out what support exists for the NATS proposals, which offer a very satisfactory solution to the challenges that we face, especially in air safety.
<P>
Reference has been made to the role of pre-legislative preparation and its effect on the Committee's sittings. I have served on a pre-legislative Committee that considered draft legislation with at least one other hon. Member who is present. Such preparation does not undermine scrutiny, nor is it meant to be an alternative to it; it ensures that better Bills are introduced, which should make our job easier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I sat on the pre-legislative Committee that scrutinised part IV, which deals with rail transport. If what the hon. Gentleman says is the case, why have the Government ignored half of what the Labour-dominated Transport Sub-Committee said?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The Government do what they believe is in the best interests of legislation and this country. We had a terrible task trying to persuade hon. Members unanimously to support the draft proposals to modernise local government in the Local Government Bill, but I am glad that the hon. Gentleman eventually conceded. That was the correct decision, and the result will be better legislation.
<P>
During the Committee's sittings, the temptation will be to raise specific concerns because the Bill is so wide ranging. I have already hinted that I am deeply concerned about air safety and the urgency of producing proposals that will separate the provision of services from safety regulation. Hon. Members will be familiar with the recent Gerona air crash. Miraculously, no one died, but such an horrendous incident has a direct bearing on our debates in these sittings. I am flagging up my interest there. I do not intend to go through a big shopping list, but I am giving examples of issues that we will have to consider in order to show that we will need at least two sittings a day.
<P>
We must also remember that the Bill is post devolution. It is a major piece of legislation affecting the whole of the UK, including Wales. What we scrutinise in this Committee must be considered not just in terms of its impact on territorial areas, but in terms of Government responsibilities in other parts of the UK. I hope that those aspects are duly considered.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I am pleased to see that we will also be serving under Mr. Benton, under whom I have served before. I know that he is a keen cyclist and that he takes an interest in transport matters for that reason. I also know that you, Mr. Gale, are very interested in certain air transport issues, so I am sure that you will ensure that the Committee does its job well. Having listened to the opening comments of both sides and having observed the chemistry that is developing, I think that there are signs of good sittings ahead. I know the Whips well and I am sure that they will get on extremely well. The original sittings motion is exactly what we need.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a lengthy debate which, despite your best endeavours, Mr. Gale, sometimes appeared in danger of straying away from the sittings motion. I shall confine myself to issues relating specifically to that motion and resist the temptation to be diverted down the various interesting byways that were opened up by one or two Opposition Members.
<P>
First, a number of Opposition Members complained about the absence from the ministerial team of the Deputy Prime Minister and about the fact that members of the Government Front Bench were either insufficiently senior or did not have the necessary transport experience. I will quickly knock all those complaints firmly on the head.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is very much the person in charge of and responsible for transport policy, but it is not the practice for the Deputy Prime Minister to attend Committee sittings. I am sure that Conservative Members will recall that the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) did not distinguish himself by frequent attendance in Committees during the last Parliament. Conservative Members might do a little more research before advancing that particular argument.
<P>
As to my experience of transport—some hon. Members suggested that I have not had any—I would point out that I sat in this Room for many hours in 1986 as a member of the Committee that considered the Channel Tunnel Bill. I think that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea also served on that Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I was the Whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Indeed! The right hon. Gentleman will, of course, recall that there was no Secretary of State on that Committee. I am astonished that his research appears not to be as thorough as it might have been. His earlier reference to ``perverted'' history might indicate his failure to do his research properly.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East was also a distinguished member of the Committee which considered the Channel Tunnel Bill. He led for the Opposition and will be able to attest to Labour's real concern about transport policy at that time. I refute entirely the suggestion that either I or my colleagues have no knowledge or experience of transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that, despite the dearth of talent opposite, I have no intention of leading for the Opposition again in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you.
<P>
The Under-Secretaries, my hon. Friends the Members for Streatham and for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), have considerable expertise in their respective fields. Our team of three Ministers will be more than ready to cope with all the issues raised in Committee. By contrast, the shadow team is a movable feast. I am not sure that the word ``feast'' is appropriate but it is certainly movable. We are not entirely sure whether the right hon. Member for Wokingham still has a role but I suspect that the speculation about whether the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea has ambitions in that area may explain his presence on the Committee. We also note that the hon. Member for North Essex recently moved into his position because of the indisposition of the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) so the Opposition ought to be a little more circumspect before criticising the membership of the Government Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister has his facts completely wrong, as I was appointed shadow transport Minister almost 18 months ago. His history is now perverted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my history is not perverted. I am well aware of a mess when I see one, and I am conscious of that with the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. Does he agree with my hon. Friend's comment on 15 November last, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Labour have failed the motorist and they have failed to produce a decent alternative with public transport.''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are delighted to welcome the hon. Member for Witney and his recognition of his past errors in refusing to join the Labour Benches.
<P>
Committee members spoke about the amount of time available to scrutinise the Bill. We heard a fascinating series of contradictory views the official Opposition Front Bench view, the semi-official Opposition Back Bench view, which suggested that two sittings a day was probably too many, and, in between, the views of the hon. Member for Bath, who described the motion as generous, and with whom we agree, as it allows ample time for proper consideration. Provided that members of the Committee are not too reluctant to appear at 9 am on Thursday mornings, we shall have more than sufficient time to do justice to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Since the debate began, I have been informed that it is customary to begin at 8.55, to allow the Committee to adjourn at 11.25, so that hon. Members can get to Prayers. Will that be the practice?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. On a point of clarification, I am advised that Standing Committees on Delegated Legislation meet at 8.55 am. It has been of concern that hon. Members wishing to attend Speaker's Prayers on Thursdays should be properly facilitated to enable them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale I will leave the question whether we meet at 8.55 or 9 am, but an early start—well within the scope of railwaymen and others used to early starts—will enable proper consideration of business within the time available.
<P>
I intend to cover the point about information being available to members of the Committee. We are wholly committed to ensuring that they have all the information that they require to enable them to make informed appraisals of the elements of these legislative proposals. Specific questions related to the draft licence agreement. We intend to have that document available for all members of the Committee by the end of this week; if that cannot be achieved, certainly very early next week.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I appreciate that it may not be in especially attractive form at the moment but a draft of that document was in circulation before Christmas and was seen by various parties. The licence is mentioned in clause 1. To discuss clause 1, we need to see at least a version of the licence. 

<P>It is not too unreasonable to ask to have the information before we discuss the clauses that are relevant to that information. Could the Minister assure us that we can have a copy of the licence, whatever state it is in, or an earlier draft, just so that we can have an idea of the sort of document it is intended to be when we discuss clause 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have already given a clear undertaking to the Committee that we will make the draft licence available at the earliest opportunity, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that clauses 1 and 2 set out the principles that should guide both the Secretary of State and the Civil Aviation Authority, when preparing the licence agreement, and we should consider them thoroughly before we come on to the nuts and bolts of the licence agreement. I do not therefore accept his argument that the draft agreement should be available before we debate clause 1, but we will certainly make it available as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful for the announcement that the Minister has just made, but I share the view of the hon. Member for North Essex. We need this information in time to debate the various clauses. Could he also give the Committee the assurance that copies of draft orders on other matters referred to in the body of the Bill will be presented to the Committee before we reach the relevant clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is certainly our intention. I was going on to discuss the second item, which concerned the articles of association and the shareholders agreement requested by both the hon. Members for Poole and for North Wiltshire. We certainly intend to make those available before we reach chapter II where that will be considered.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea spoke about pension rights. I should it make it clear at the outset that we have already given a commitment that existing employees' pension rights will be fully protected. They will be entitled to continue to enjoy the benefits of the Civil Aviation Authority's pension agreement. Equally, we will be prepared to provide further information and clarification about that when we the reach relevant part of the Bill. As a Government, we are well aware of the importance of providing full information on all matters that are due to be considered by the Committee. We will use our best endeavours to ensure that that information is made available in time for members of the Committee to meet their responsibilities fully.
<P>
This is an important Bill. It is time that we moved from the preliminaries to serious consideration of its nuts and bolts. I therefore hope that I have satisfied the Committee that we have made more than adequate provision in the sittings motion for proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Earlier in the proceedings you gave an important ruling. You said that the Committee of Selection has the power to change the composition of the Committee as long as we have not passed our sittings motion, at which point we become constituted as the Committee of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In that case, would you accept a motion to adjourn the Committee so that the Government can reflect properly on the representations that we have made about the composition of the Committee and have the opportunity to appoint to the Committee a Minister with overall responsibility for the policies in the Bill? If you were prepared to accept a motion to adjourn, we would seek to divide the Committee on that motion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept a motion that the Committee adjourn and I would put the question to the vote immediately without debate. We are in slightly uncharted waters I am advised that we must first dispose of the sittings motion. It will be in order for the hon. Member for North Essex to move his motion before we move to the order of consideration motion, at which point it will have the same effect.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order Clauses 1 to 30; Schedules 1 and 2; Clauses 31 to 33; Schedule 3; Clauses 34 to 36; Schedule 4; Clause 37; Schedule 5; Clauses 38 to 61; Schedule 6; Clause 62; Schedule 7; Clauses 63 to 83; Schedule 8; Clauses 84 to 88; Schedule 9; Clauses 89 to 91; new Clauses relating to Part I; Clauses 92 to 137; Schedule 10; Clause 138; new Clauses relating to Part II; Clauses 139 to 167; Schedule 11; Clauses 168 to 175; Schedule 12; new Clauses relating to Part III; Clauses 176 to 179; Schedule 13; Clauses 180 to 186; Schedule 14; Clauses 187 to 190; Schedule 15; Clause 191; Schedule 16; Clause 192; Schedule 17; Clause 193; Schedule 18; Clause 194; Schedule 19; Clause 195; Schedule 20; Clauses 196 to 202; Schedule 21; Clauses 203 and 204; Schedule 22; Clauses 205 to 213; Schedule 23; Clauses 214 to 221; Schedule 24; Clause 222; Schedule 25; Clause 223; new Clauses relating to Part IV; Clauses 224 to 231; other new Clauses; new Schedules; Schedule 26.<P>

<P>
I join my colleagues in welcoming you as Chairman, Mr. Gale. As a mere functionary—the least challenging of the epithets applied to me and my ministerial colleague this morning—I move the entirely functional motion standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning The motion is a standard procedural device to secure sensible and logical consideration of the Bill. It proposes that the schedules should be considered with the clauses that introduce them. That will avoid duplication of debate and make for speedier consideration.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has already said, the Bill is large and complex. Without the motion, the Committee would have to consider each of the 231 clauses in the Bill and then move on to the schedules in numerical order. The Committee would have to express a view on matters that had already been considered some time previously. That would delay our debate and frustrate progress, when we have so much to consider. Delay and muddle would serve no useful purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I broadly support the principle of the motion. However, certain clauses relate to certain schedules, and the flexibility to cross-refer would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I suspect that that is primarily a matter for the Chairman. However, the Government are anxious to co-operate with the Opposition in order to progress the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. I am willing to listen to representations as, I am sure, is Mr. Benton.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's general duty</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No 1, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (5) below),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No 2, in page 1, line 11, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in the manner he thinks best calculated'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 4, in page 1, line 28, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in the manner he thinks is reasonable'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No 5, in page 2, line 4, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Before exercising any powers under this Chapter and prior to each subsequent year that this Chapter remains in force, the Secretary of State shall lay a report for the forthcoming year before both Houses of Parliament for approval by each House, setting out the manner in which he shall exercise his functions under this Chapter, including—
<P>
(a) a full explanation of the manner in which he intends to exercise his functions;
<P>
(b) the calculations he has used to arrive at his conclusions;
<P>
(c) the objectives he is seeking to achieve by the exercise of his powers; and
<P>
(d) the decisions he will make during the year in question to achieve those objectives.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We begin with a clause relating to the Secretary of State's general duties under this chapter. Our amendments are probing, designed to elucidate from Ministers the intentions behind the Bill. They would ensure that the Secretary of State's duties are carried out more accountably than the Bill envisages. Amendment No. 5 includes a broad list of what should be in the Secretary of States' report and would be an important addition to accountability, especially in the first year of the Bill's operation. There will be a completely new regime, once air traffic control is separated from the Civil Aviation Authority. The Bill is an enabling measure and is not specific, so it would be sensible to make the Secretary of State accountable to Parliament for what he intends to do and the manner in which he intends to exercise his functions. For example, we would expect the report mentioned in amendment No. 5 to include an account of how the Secretary of State plans to initiate the transfers under future chapters and to carry out his supervisory role and how he intends the CAA to continue its supervisory role.
<P>
The Government have already produced a consultation paper and a White Paper. However, in a period of change, it would sensible for the Secretary of State to continue to produce parliamentary papers, which he would be required to submit to Parliament for a vote. He would thus remain accountable for the changes that he is introducing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Does the hon. Gentleman have an idea of how much such a report—which would involve extra bureaucracy and red tape tying up the centre of Government—would cost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is showing admirable keenness on his party's behalf. However, if he wishes to discuss cost, he should explain why the cost of Whitehall has already increased by £1 billion under the Labour Government. There are plenty of ways of reducing costs. If what the Secretary of State will be required to do is not written down, what exactly is going on in the Department? Everything is being done on a wing and a prayer, with not a penny spent on considering how the Secretary of State will exercise his functions under the Bill. The hon. Gentleman should join the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East on another planet, because government is about Ministers and their officials working out what they should do. All we ask is that the proposals for the Secretary of State's functions should be presented to Parliament.
<P>
It is extraordinary that Ministers often change their writings when they are required to submit them to Parliament for public scrutiny because someone else will read them and they will be asked questions about them, but that is what accountability is all about. I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) knows nothing about accountability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> What about the cost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The cost is minuscule compared with the increase in costs that the Labour party has already brought about in Whitehall because of all the extra special advisers and the fact that it has sacked the professional press officers and replaced them with party placemen. The Government should bear the cost because work must be done to produce the back-up paperwork needed to inform and advise the Secretary of State on the exercise of his functions.
<P>
The functions included in the clause are broad. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) to further the interests of operators and owners of aircraft, owners and managers of aerodromes, persons travelling in aircraft and persons with rights in property carried in them;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to promote efficiency and economy on the part of licence holders;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) to secure that licence holders will not find it unduly difficult to finance activities;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) to impose on licence holders the minimum of restrictions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so that they can carry out their functions. We shall discuss safety later, so I shall not dwell on it now, but those broad duties have to be conducted with regard to safety and the continuity and availability of services. We simply want the Secretary of State to set out regularly how that will be carried out.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Shipley that the first report might be a weighty tome because much work will have to be done when the Bill is on the statute book, but such a report will then become much more of a formality and require much less work and cost.
<P>
The purpose of the deletion in amendment No. 2 is to ensure that the Secretary of State does not have a completely free hand. We propose that he must explain how he thinks his duties should be carried out. That explanation would have to include such matters as safety.
<P>
Given that the hon. Member for Shipley and Ministers must be aware that safe air traffic control is a matter of great concern and that the Bill will enable many things to occur, some of which will be controversial, would it not be good to give Parliament the right to approve the proposals and other aspects of safety? We want to lay trip wire so that any hon. Member could raise issues of safety, which is of paramount importance to air traffic control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> You will recall, Mr. Gale, that during the debate on the sittings motion, I said that I had had the great pleasure of serving under your chairmanship in a previous Committee. During that Committee, I proposed an amendment that would have required various orders under an education Bill to be subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament. I argued then that it was traditional for Opposition parties, in scrutinising a Bill, to table such amendments, and I provided examples of similar amendments moved by Labour Members when they were in opposition. I also pointed out that it was the tradition of the Government of the day to resist such amendments.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that in a moment the Minister will stand up and say that the amendment is unnecessary because many clauses will provide the security and satisfaction that we seek. I must point out once again that Labour Members had a very different view in opposition. I therefore support the principle behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex, but not its wording.
<P>
The amendment would require a report to be approved annually by both Houses of Parliament, but there is no need for a report annually. It would be more appropriate to require both Houses to approve such a report when the Secretary of State wished to issue or renew licences. However, if an amendment requiring an annual report were accepted and built into the Bill, it would mean insecurity for any organisation that wished to apply for one of these licences. As will emerge in later debates, my party is not in favour of the licensing proposals in the Bill but, if they are to be passed by the Committee, it is important not to include impediments such as the amendment. If a similar amendment were introduced later, which dealt with circumstances when a licence was to be agreed or renewed, we would have more sympathy with it.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to amendment No. 2, briefly mentioned by the hon. Member for North Essex, which would omit the words ``in the manner he thinks best calculated'' from the clause. I am sympathetic to the amendment, but for a different reason than that of the hon. Gentleman, who simply said that it would pave the way for amendment No. 5. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will explain the peculiar wording of the clause. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State must exercise his functions under this Chapter in the manner he thinks best calculated''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and goes on to specify the various purposes. This morning, I found as many Bills as I could that referred to a Secretary of State having ``general duties'' of one kind or another. Although my searches were by no means exhaustive and the Minister may be able to find exceptions to the rule, the rule certainly appears to be that such phraseology does not appear in comparable clauses.
<P>
I may be wrong, but I think that I last served under you, Mr. Gale, in the Committee considering what became the Education Act 1996, so I chose an example from that. Under clause—now section—11 of that Act, we debated the general duties of the Secretary of State. Section 11(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall . . . exercise his powers with a view to (among other things)''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and goes on to list various activities. There is no mention of the rather strange phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the manner he thinks best calculated'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is found in this clause. I wonder why it is used here. One possible reason that strikes me—I should be grateful for confirmation or at least clarification from the Minister—is that it will provide extra protection for the Secretary of State against possible judicial review. In other words, it will give the Secretary of State greater flexibility and scope without any real scrutiny. If that is the reason, it seems appropriate to delete the phrase because, in line with the broad thrust of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex, we need to ensure that there is an opportunity for real scrutiny of the Secretary of State's concerns.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that I can illuminate that phrase. It is echoed in section 4 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, but there it referred to the manner in which the CAA should carry out its functions. Where that Act describes the Secretary of State's functions—they are functions rather than duties; I am always wary lest giving the Secretary of State duties as opposed to functions confers a wider power—there is no mention of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the manner best calculated'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the functions are simply specified. We envisaged a more accountable role for the Secretary of State in the 1982 Act than is envisaged in this Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he confirms the gist of my concern.
<P>
In conclusion, while we are unable to support amendment No. 5 as currently drafted for the reasons that I gave—as I said, a slight modification at a later stage would win our support—subject to the Minister's response, we would certainly be very supportive of amendments Nos. 2 and 3, were they to be subject to separate votes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I rise principally because I have been provoked by the intervention of the hon. Member for Shipley on my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex regarding the cost of my hon. Friend's modest proposal.
<P>
It seems that it would quite impossible for any Minister to put the clause into effect if he did not clearly understand the manner in which he was to exercise the power. If one has a clear impression of what one is going to do, one can write it down. If one cannot write it down, one does not know one's own mind. It would be extraordinarily alarming if the Secretary of State did not write down the manner in which he intended to exercise these powers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Shipley then asked whether it would not be horrendously expensive to publish that. That is an extraordinary question. My hon. Friend was not proposing to impose some great new administrative burden on the Secretary of State. Rather, he was making a plea for freedom of information and accountability—both are meant to be themes that have some resonance on the Government Benches.
<P>
I will be interested to hear the response because I believe that the Minister who will respond has himself shown a certain amount of interest in the freedom of information. My hon. Friend's proposal would do no more than enable every member of the public, interested party and Member of Parliament to understand how the Secretary of State would use the powers. If the Minister says that it is not possible to publish such a statement, we must conclude either that he is being unnecessarily obstructive or that the policy does not exist in sufficiently coherent form to be written down. That would be a serious inference to have to draw from his response.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend, I am grateful for the intervention of the hon. Member for Bath. Many grave questions are beginning to be asked about the drafting. One reason for our regret at the absence of the Deputy Prime Minister is that we suspect that he personally selected this form of drafting and, given his famous grasp of detail, we would have been interested in questioning him on some of the points. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is bizarre that safety should appear as a sort of afterthought halfway through the clause.
<P>
The drafting is unusual because safety should be our prime consideration. It is, as the hon. Member for Bath also said, extraordinary that the first line of the Bill contains the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the manner he thinks best calculated to''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We seem to be imposing a pretty clear, serious and onerous duty on the Secretary of State. Of course there will always be matters of judgment as to how well or badly he has exercised his duties, but it augurs badly for the beginning of our deliberations and for the future of air traffic provisions that we begin with a rather clumsy, inappropriate and, as the hon. Gentleman said, unprecedented phrase to allow the Secretary of State to proceed merely in the manner that he thinks best calculated to do something rather than imposing on him a firmer duty.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Bath for the support that he has given us on that point. I am not sure whether it will be possible to move to separate divisions on these matters. However, I should like the hon. Member for Shipley to reconsider his maiden intervention in the Committee. Introducing in such an aggressive manner so early in our deliberations consideration of a paltry cost for something that must exist anyway—so we are merely asking that it be published—was an unfortunate beginning to our proceedings. I hope that the Minister will not echo that aggressive tone in his replies.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> First, may I say how pleasant it is to be under your wise stewardship of the Committee, Mr. Gale? As the hon. Member for Bath said, clauses of this nature are fairly standard fare in Bills of this nature. He merely set out a few general principles. The Opposition's amendments are also fairly standard fare in such Bills and I do not think that the Opposition will be entirely surprised that the Government are disinclined to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the Minister accept that the Bill is exceptional on account of its proposals for air traffic control services? Also, may I remind him that the 1982 Act, which might be regarded as more run-of-the-mill aviation legislation, gives no similar discretion? Will he explain why duties rather than functions are being imposed on the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The same phraseology of which the hon. Gentleman complains was used in a number of Bills introduced by the Conservative Government. He quoted section 4 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. The Railways Act 1993 uses the very phrases that he is attempting to delete:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State and the Regulator shall each have a duty to exercise the functions assigned or transferred to him under or by virtue of this Part in the manner which he considers is best calculated to protect''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Protect what? Read the rest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The clause is lengthy but, for students of these matters, it is clause 4(1) of the Railways Act 1993, which the Conservative Government introduced. It uses precisely the same phraseology, so we should not become too excited.
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
