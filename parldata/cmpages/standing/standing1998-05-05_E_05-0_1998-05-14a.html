<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I just managed to finish my first sentence before lunch intervened. I shall repeat it, because my congratulations to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) on a well-chosen amendment reflected a rare spirit of good will towards certain Committee members. I shall further congratulate him on the speed with which his press release, which is a rousing condemnation of the Government's handling of the matter, has reached the leader column of today's Evening Standard.
<P>
This amendment is a good amendment, which we fully support. I have been approached by sources such as Age Concern, to which reference has already been made, and my local senior citizens' forum, which has expressed a serious worry. I have also discussed the matter with the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which is engaged in detailed work on the tax system's impact on the low paid, and which has a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence on the clause's likely impact.
<P>
The abolition of advance corporation tax has resulted in many anomalies. Several hon. Members have been approached by charities that are just beginning to appreciate the way in which last year's changes will affect their activities. Clearly, the Government have tried to neutralise many of the effects of those changes, particularly on taxpayers.
<P>
The amendment seeks to tackle the impact on members of the non-taxpaying community who, almost by definition, are poor. The argument has in one sense already been made. However, I want to emphasise that we are dealing with a category of people who regard dividend income as an important way in which to maintain their limited quality of life. These are not people who have invested for large capital appreciation. They are people who live off a limited dividend income, who are of a generation that was not able to benefit from the state earnings-related pension scheme, and who have not had the chance to invest in private pensions. Many of them are unsophisticated shareholders who inherited a small number of shares from, for example, a deceased aunt. Many have acquired shares through building society conversions. They are not sophisticated investors, but they rely on the limited amount of income that they derive from shares.
<P>
It was estimated this morning that 300,000 people will each lose £75 as a result of the changes information which I believe emerged from a parliamentary question to Treasury Ministers. Many others do not claim the tax credit because of a lack of knowledge and understanding of the tax system. Many more than 300,000 people may therefore be involved.
<P>
We should be worried about two categories of people. Pensioners use a relatively small amount of income from shares. Many of them will lose the equivalent of one week's pension a year on average, which is not a trivial sum. We should also consider people who were made redundant during the last recession. Many of them are not yet entitled to pensions, and live off income generated from small investments to keep poverty at bay. They will be affected as much as pensioners.
<P>
To add insult to injury, many non-taxpayers will receive a certificate with their dividend income, which will refer to a tax credit. However, such people will be unable to claim the tax credit. Only the substantially better off will be able to claim it. That is unfair and insulting.
<P>
The Government's answer to the problem has been for such people to opt into the individual savings account scheme. In a broad sense, my colleagues and I have supported the concept of individual savings accounts, but for reasons that have partly been explained already, they are often not a satisfactory alternative. Quite apart from the financial disadvantages for many people of opting into the ISA scheme, many people are incapable of undertaking that sort of transaction. Large numbers of people are infirm, very old and incapable of dealing with the paperwork and bureaucracy involved.
<P>
One appalling case in my constituency over which I am determined to pursue the Halifax, a former building society illustrates the dilemmas involved for very old people trying to manage their finances. A 99-year-old blind lady was trying to engage in a simple financial transaction moving an account within the institution. Because she was blind and bed-ridden, she could not go to the bank offices. The bank would not accept her carer of 50 years' standing as a signatory on her behalf, so she was required to go through the rigmarole of conferring full power of attorney, with the result that a simple financial transaction cost her £60. I am determined that that should be repaid. However, it illustrates for the purpose of the debate the case of people who are not sophisticated investors, who are not mobile, and who are required by people at the Inland Revenue, who clearly have no sensitivity, to engage in sophisticated financial operations in order to protect their tax position.
<P>
One of the anomalies is that, in other contexts, the Government accept the nature of the problem. For example, the Government have launched an advertising programme to encourage people, especially the elderly, to claim back tax on interest payments from banks and building societies. For some reason, one Department[Dr. Vincent Cable]
that understands that elderly people have a genuine problem in claiming tax benefit in respect of interest, does not understand that they should be entitled to the same help in relation to dividend income. I suspect that there are two divisions within the Inland Revenue which simply do not communicate with each other.
<P>
We ask the Government to think about the problem more sympathetically than they did last year. I accept that there are probably genuine technical problems in clearly differentiating non-taxpayers as a group. However, I understand from the tax experts to whom I have talked that the problem is by no means insuperable. Given good will I hope that the Government have good will towards a low-income, vulnerable group of people there is no reason why these technical problems should not be solved. Therefore, I fully support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I want to make a few comments in support of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He, like me, represents a west Sussex seaside constituency with a large elderly population who will be affected by the changes. It is a common misconception that the south coast is a somewhat cushy place to live, but in my constituency, as well as in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, there are pockets of deprivation. Many pensioners who live in council houses, or in some cases were fortunate enough to be able to buy their own homes, do not qualify for any benefits or relief against council tax because they have a modest amount of assets. In many cases, those assets comprise a few investments, which tend to be equity investments typically privatisation stocks or shares from demutualised former building societies. The numbers affected are considerable. Although two thirds of older people pay no tax at all, 300,000 people are likely tobe affected by the measure at a cost to them of about £22.5 million. That is not an enormous sum until it is put in the context of the £75 average, and amounts above that, which mean a great deal to those people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) rightly mentioned those people who, on losing their job, have received a pay-off as part of a redundancy package and who have to live off investment income, in many cases from shares gained through employee share schemes when they worked for their former employers, because they are unable to find new jobs. Not only are the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) bothered of Bognor, but my constituents are worried of Worthing.
<P>
The Paymaster General will, no doubt, try to make out that the elusive queue of 6 million new investors supposedly lining up outside the Treasury to throw their funds at the new ISA scheme, when we know how it will be constituted, will include the 300,000 people who will be disadvantaged by the change. However, as we have heard, ISAs are wholly inappropriate for poor investors who pay no tax and for whom capital gains tax concessions of £6,800 a year are meaningless. I hope that the Paymaster General will make it clear in his response that he does not envisage ensnaring, even with his clever marketing ploys he has said that marketing is key to the success of ISAs the 300,000 people who will lose out on an important part of their income.
<P>
Let us face it, Mr. Butterfill, the Budget I do not intend to go off at a tangent has provided little comfort for pensioners. We have discussed how a pensioner who may enjoy the odd glass or two of Lambrini Bianco is now to have that taxed. Fizzy wine, cigarettes, the odd flutter on Worthing or Bognor Regis pier will be taxed more, as will the occasional sojourn abroad because the tax on travel insurance has been increased. On top of that, the waiting lists of local hospitals in West Sussex have grown substantially. There is nothing in the Budget of comfort to pensioners. Their modest income which is an important percentage of their overall wealth is being snatched from them. The amount has already been reduced to 20 per cent. It is to be reduced further to 10 per cent.
<P>
There is another aspect to this matter. Undue pressure will be placed on more financially astute, less well off pensioners with a small portfolio of shares to switch investment strategy. Only by switching into fixed interest stocks or bonds will they be able to continue to receive gross interest. That is the only way for them to avoid falling into the trap of losing tax credit. Doing that is all very well except for the fact that the capital growth prospects for their investments will be less than they may have been, particularly if they were lucky enough to get stocks from privatisations and demutualisations.
<P>
The Government are saying to those pensioners, "Either you go into less capital growth intensive stocks and try to reclaim some of the income that we are taking away from you, or you lose out on a substantial amount of income which has been very important to you in the past."
<P>
I wholeheartedly support the amendment. I hope that the Government will see reason and give what is a small concession in terms of the value of revenue to the Exchequer. They should acknowledge in a commonsense way that their proposal, which came out of the farrago and mess of last year's smash-and-grab raid on pensions, requires pensioners and some of the poorer investors in our communities to receive some protection.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Professor Ross Cranston.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I hope to rise to the occasion. Although I am a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, I gave up my full-time chair.
<P>
It ill behoves Opposition Members to seek to speak on behalf of the poor. They are responsible for the fact that inequalities in this country are greater than in any other country in the OECD except New Zealand. It also ill behoves them to speak on behalf of pensioners. We have done more for pensioners in the past 12 months than the Conservative Government did in 18 years.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> No, I will not. I want to address the amendment, which was moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman is fighting the battles of last year. He is still unhappy with the changes in corporation tax 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): It is pensioners who are unhappy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Well, the right hon. Gentleman seemed to accept the argument for the change earlier today. Conservative Members must get on-message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman was perhaps asleep, because I said that all corporation tax systems had advantages and disadvantages, which applies as much to the previous system as to this one. One of the disadvantages of the present system is that it treats pensioners so badly. He is talking about one of the disadvantages of the present system, but he has so far not done a good job of recognising it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I will not rise to the bait that the right hon. Gentleman has laid for me. I will address the amendment.
<P>
I have received the submission from Age Concern, and I recognise that the transition to the new system poses problems and that certain pensioners will have problems. I am especially worried about the less well-off pensioners. I am not worried about the kind of pensioners who have dividend income of £100,000 a year, about whom the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) spoke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Let me develop the argument. I am worried about pensioners who rely on their pension income, who as the hon. Member for Twickenham said might have bought shares in a privatisation issue and, as a result, are supplementing their pension with a small amount of dividend income, which has until now been supplemented by tax credits. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General that the position of those people might merit further consideration, and that some sort of capping should be introduced. It would be impossible to provide a neutralisation mechanism to protect all pensioners as I said, it is only the poorest pensioners who need some kind of protection. In view of what Age Concern and other charities have said, I urge my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to consider the matter further and address it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am astonished by what the hon. Gentleman has just said. Unless I grossly misunderstood the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the concession that he seeks with his amendment is relevant only to those people whose total earnings are lower than the personal income tax-free earnings allowance that is, people with a total income of £5,000 to £5,500 a year. The hon. Gentleman's claim that Opposition Members argued for privilege and for wealthy pensioners with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of investments is ludicrous. It has nothing to do with our debate this afternoon or with the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
I want to speak briefly on the matter because I, too, have received considerable correspondence from constituents who stand to benefit from the amendment. They urge me to support my hon. Friend in his endeavour. I want to record my very strong support for the amendment and to congratulate my hon. Friend on such an eloquent speech.
<P>
The point that has been made by Conservative Members is that we are discussing not fat cats or privilege but the oldest and poorest people in our society some 300,000 people who have provided to a limited extent for their own support in their old age. They are often proud people who take great pride in having a small private income of their own. The measures introduced by the Government have had the undoubtedly unintended but unfortunate effect of hitting those 300,000 pensioners on very low incomes by an average of £75 a year.
<P>
The revenue implications for the Treasury are piffling £22 million or £23 million a year but to those 300,000 people, that small amount of income in reclaimable tax is a significant element in their annual budget. The odd £75, £100, £150 or £200 represents their annual luxury spending on something that they would otherwise be unable to afford. I can only summarise for the Paymaster General the tone of the letters that I have received from people in that position. It is one of absolute despair. They have no idea how, in the twilight years of their lives, they can make good the loss of a sum that to most of us is relatively small, but to them is significant.
<P>
The Evening Standard today characterised the Chancellor's action in removing the tax credit for 300,000 pensioners as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a nastier mugging than any street thug."
<P>
It rightly identifies the problem as one of collateral damage. The people concerned have been caught in the cross-fire of a Treasury exercise on ACT. No one would suggest that the Paymaster General or the Treasury set out to snatch a few hundred pounds from those very poor people.
<P>
We heard earlier that the Inland Revenue had described the tax credit as an anomaly. I can only urge the Paymaster General to use his political judgment to rise above the clinical rationality of the Treasury's analysis and to ignore the technical objections that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue will undoubtedly present. He should consider those 300,000 very poor, elderly people, many of whom will not realise, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, until next April, how they have been mugged. The hon. Gentleman should think about the politics and morality of the matter and ensure that those moral and social consideration triumph over the technical convenience of the Inland Revenue. This is a genuine test of the Government's good intentions and I hope that the Paymaster General will rise to it.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I rise in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who made a magnificent contribution to the debate. The Evening Standard has[Mr. David Ruffley]
already picked up his words of wisdom and Opposition Members compliment him on an excellent job.
<P>
On reading the clause, I am struck by the clear anomaly that the tax credit will be payable at the rate of 10 per cent. for those going into personal equity plans and ISAs for the next five years. There is an anomaly and some acceptance of the fact that a tax credit has policy rationale. Otherwise, the 10 per cent. figure would not have been retained.
<P>
As my hon. Friends pointed out, it is peculiarly worrying and very odd that the provisions should hit the lowest-income groups, including pensioners. It is also odd that the Government should proclaim themselves to be on the side of the people. Poorer older people did not seem to be in the Chancellor's mind when he published the "Financial Statement and Budget Report", or Red Book. As my hon. Friends said, in the tax measures that were announced on 17 March, there were precious few references to or proposals for older lower-income pensioners.
<P>
I urge Ministers to consider whether they could undo some of the damage that the Budget inflicted on older lower-income pensioners. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Working and Shoreham pointed out, there are many other ways in which that group has been hit for example, by the changes in indirect taxes on alcohol, travel and tobacco, and my hon. Friend gave many other examples.
<P>
Do Labour Members have a similar experience? Do they find the retention of the 10 per cent. credit anomalous? Do they intend to break their trappist vow of silence? Have poorer pensioners, who have written to us, also written to them? With the honourable exception of the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), no Labour Member has taken the time or trouble to discuss the plight of older, lower-income pensioners. Straightforward and heart-rending pleas have been made to Conservative Members perhaps such letters are not sent to Labour Members.
<P>
On 1 May, I received a letter from a constituent of mine who lives in Tostock near Bury St. Edmunds. He made the point which is all too typically made by those who support the Age Concern campaign that he had spent all of his savings on buying into the privatised utilities. That was the main nest egg with which he would supplement his very small occupational pension, which was sufficiently small to ensure that he was not an income tax payer. He said that he relied on his tax credit repayment to "eke out my pension". Many pensioners are on the cusp of having a respectable income on which to live. As he said, he relied on eking out his pension, and he added that he thought that the Labour Government could not have meant to have put him in the position that he was in. He asked me to ask whether the proposal had quietly slipped through Parliament by mistake, and whether I could
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"raise this matter at the highest level".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted to raise it in one of the most important Committees in the land. I ask and beg Ministers to reconsider their proposals in the light of public and parliamentary opinion and to favour this well drafted and well judged amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on the amendment, which we endorse and wholeheartedly support. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham on his excellent speech today.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is surprising that the Government should introduce legislation of this sort, because it attacks not only some of the poorest and most disdvantaged people in our society but people with medium savings of, say, £20,000, with dividend yields of 5 per cent. or about £1,000 a year. If they switch into an ISA, it will take them about four years to benefit from it. Therefore, those who can least afford it, and some others, will lose significant sums of money. They will not be sophisticated enough to switch investments. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, if they do, they will also lose a significant amount of income, because they will switch from income-producing investments to capital growth investments to come within the capital gains tax annual exemption. Therefore, I ask the Government on behalf of my party to think again and give these disadvantaged people the necessary relief.
<P>
I hope that I shall not be out of order if I revisit the tax disadvantages suffered by charities as a result of the abolition of ACT and say that I hope that the Government will extend the transitional relief for charities. Why cannot a fair system of relief be continued indefinitely for the charitable sector?

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): We may assess the impact of my hon. Friend's fine amendment by the lack of Labour Members on the Government Benches this afternoon. They have literally fled in response to this challenge on behalf of some of the least well-off. They have chosen to cover their embarrassment by not being here for this debate. Let us hope that other Labour members have more courage and speak with the same mind as the Hon. Member for Dudley, North, who, in his party's current climate and regime, showed stalwart characteristics in daring even slightly to step out of line. Labour Members who are professors and free-thinkings are clearly few and far between, and I fear that we may not find many more here this afternoon.
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the Government's proposal. Let us remember that it was not put into effect by last year's Finance Act. It was prospective last year and will come into force in the coming year. That is why it is relevant to talk about it today. Thousands in my constituency will be affected by the change. I speak on behalf of those who reclaim their £75, £100 or £125. I can well understand the clinical calculations of the Inland Revenue, which time and again we see running the Government's taxation policy. It considers that the cost of processing the claims is high and that it is a tiresome nuisance to deal with them, but this money is important to those who are savers. If the Government are serious about encouraging those who do not yet save to do so, they will send a strange message out today if they ignore the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North pulled himself up short. He was prepared to extend his courage and his magnificence to those in the lowest income streams. Some people with a slightly larger income will benefit from the amendment. Some among the elderly have so much income from this type of investment that, until a year ago, they could enjoy health insurance on which they could deduct the tax on their premiums. They have already been hit once. That benefit was taken away last year, so that VAT on fuel could be cut.
<P>
It is a curious anomaly that that cut in fuel duty benefited the Paymaster General 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be tempted too wide of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall demonstrate in a moment how relevant this is, Mr. Butterfill. It benefited the Paymaster General probably more than anyone else here this afternoon by reducing the cost of heating his many homes up and down the country. Therefore, a measure that we were told was directed at benefiting the poorest in our society most benefited someone who can hardly be described as poor.
<P>
If we accept that measures aimed at benefiting the poor sometimes benefit others as well, we should accept that the amendment, which is primarily aimed at benefiting some of the least well off, may benefit others as well. So be it, but that is not a good argument to advance against the amendment; it is particularly not a good argument for the Paymaster General to advance against the amendment, given his circumstances and the benefit that he received from the cut in energy duty last year.
<P>
I want to mention another group of people who are affected by the changes those who benefit from discretionary trusts. Again, when we consider discretionary trusts, we immediately bring to mind the sophisticated offshore vehicle that the Paymaster General was instrumental in setting up last year.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is going too wide. Will he please return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will, Mr. Butterfill. Typically, such trusts are also used for people who suffer from mental incapacity, for example, and for employee trusts, where employees have been involved in share schemes with their employer and the income that they receive from the trusts, often in retirement, is a small but important part of their income. I have received a copy of a letter sent to the Inland Revenue last month the Paymaster General may also have received a copy pointing out that former employees who benefit from such a trust will also now suffer a 20 per cent. cut in their income as a result of the Government's changes.
<P>
It is wrong for the Government to say that they will not accept the changes that we propose because they will benefit those beyond the poorest groups in society; it is also wrong for them to claim that they have offered new avenues for such people to save for instance, through ISAs or to say that people should change their investment portfolio.
<P>
We are proposing measures to create a fair tax system. What the Government are proposing is an arbitrary swipe at a certain group of people with a certain type of investment. Tax action of that kind does nothing to inspire confidence and nothing to encourage people to save.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): For once the Government cannot say that it was all the previous Government's fault, because this manifestly unfair and illogical situation is entirely of the Government's making.
<P>
Along with many of my hon. Friend's, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on trying to put right a manifestly unfair situation. Those of us who served on the Committee considering the previous Finance Bill debated for some hours the withdrawal of the associated tax credit. The consequence of that was that dividend credits were reduced from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. with effect from April next year. Much has been made of the 300,000 pensioners who, with their age allowance, would earn just below £5,410, but nothing has been said this afternoon about those who are below the tax threshold of some £4,300. Those who earn just over £80 a week could be denied the tax credit to which they are entitled on those dividends.
<P>
We thought that the hon. Member for Dudley, North who is a professor, was knowledgable. However, he was unable to understand the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He thought that it would benefit wealthy pensioners. On the contrary, it would affect only pensioners who receive up to £5,400, and those of us who earn up to £4,100. The Government allow tax to be reclaimed on building society interest, they encourage people to invest in ISAs, and they allow PEPs and tax-exempt special savings accounts to continue for five years. However, they intend to hit those who may have only one or two shares. That is disgraceful.
<P>
I have looked at the Red Book. If one multiplies 300,000 pensioners by £75, which is the average payment that each pensioner will lose under the measure, one finds that it would cost a mere £22.5 million to right this wrong.
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General's reply will not stray down the avenue that was explored at great length during last night's debate. Those earning under £82 which, coincidentally, is a similarly low level of earnings to that which we are currently debating will be denied the reduction in national insurance for this year and perhaps for subsequent years. Yet again, the lowest paid are being hit by a Government measure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North asked why we are speaking out on behalf of the low-paid. We do so because Government Members sit there like dumb mutes. It therefore falls to us to point out the unfairness and total illogicality of this anomaly.
<P>
The amendment is sensible, and would not impose a huge cost on the Treasury. The Government spend a great deal of time encouraging the low-paid to draw benefits in every other field, even to the extent of advertising certain benefits. For example, they advertised pensioners' failure to take up means-tested benefits. However, the Government are trying to pretend that this problem does not exist by sweeping it under the carpet.
[Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown]
<P>
Although we have made political capital out of the matter, I ask the Paymaster General to consider it seriously. The issue is one of equity. [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but the joke may well be on them when they receive complaints from low-paid pensioners in their constituencies. They will wonder what they did in this Committee to tackle the problem. I shall willingly quote the record to prove that only Conservative Members spoke on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This has been a remarkable debate, which has engaged the attention of representatives of all parties present in the Committee.
<P>
We welcomed some, at least, of the remarks by the hon. Member for Dudley, North. He began by missing the point entirely when he said that he thought that the amendment sought to defend the interests of better-off pensioners, although he quickly recovered. His words were mild and modest, but he did ask the Paymaster General to look again at the schedule. Compared to what we have so far heard from the Government Benches, that constituted a full-scale rebellion. His words will be rattling the Whip, who must wonder whether Government Members will shortly be supporting our amendments or requesting substantive changes to the Finance Bill.
<P>
Is it deliberate or unintended that part of the corporation tax changes manage to hit the poorest and most vulnerable people whom we represent? It is true that any major tax reform has unintended consequences, and it may genuinely be that the Government did not understand what the effects of the reforms on poorer pensioners would be. If that is the case, now is a good opportunity to put that right and at least undertake to come back with a remedial clause or amendment later during our proceedings.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough that the tax credit paid to people with investment income will halve in April next year it will go down from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. but it is inexcusable that the only way in which people with modest savings can retain their 10 per cent. repayment is to take out an ISA. The Government are requiring elderly people and pensioners to engage in a modest form of tax avoidance in order to receive the benefits of the tax break. The Government are saying that it is not good enough for them to continue to rely on the very modest savings that they have built up in accordance with express Government policy; they must now pay out management charges and take out an entirely inappropriate savings vehicle that was not designed for them. Individual savings accounts are designed to encourage the savings habit, but pensioners are not net savers; they are living off previously accumulated savings, so it is inappropriate indeed, misleading and wrong to encourage such people to switch their savings into a savings account, with the associated administrative and management charges, simply in order to continue to get the benefit of a 10 per cent. tax repayment. However, that is the logic of the Government's position.
<P>
The Red Book contained only six lines about pensioners. It is well known that the last Budget was not a Budget for pensioners. Indeed, it continued the damage begun in last year's Budget, which attacked savings and pension funds in particular. For that reason alone, I ask the Paymaster General to concede that a mistake has been made and to accept the amendment, which is carefully targeted to help not the better off but the poorest pensioners and people with modest means who have not yet retired.
<P>
I shall go even further and say that how the Government respond to the amendment will be a test of their commitment to the disadvantaged. The amendment clearly has the support of the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) and unless he receives the assurance that he seeks from the Paymaster General, he will wish to be consistent and join members of the Committee who support the amendment in a subsequent Division. I am pleased that we have the support of Liberal Democrat Members, who have turned out in force for the amendment a highly unusual event. The amendment has 100 per cent. support from Conservative Members. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who perceptively tabled the amendment, which will be widely welcomed by the country and, we hope, by the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I want to make some brief remarks and to anticipate the Paymaster General's reply because, during a similar Committee debate on last July's Finance Bill, the Economy Secretary said that people need not worry because they could use the investment vehicle of ISAs to get round the extra tax hike. I want to impress it on the Paymaster General that the provision is ludicrous and does not address the real situation of many of the people who will be affected by it.
<P>
Just imagine the type of person whom we are talking about someone like my grandmother. She is 82, she suffers from osteoporosis and is in permanent pain. She cannot see out of one eye and is registered as partially sighted. When I visit her, she asks me to look through her papers. They are not sophisticated financial papers but telephone and electricity bills. I set up direct debits for her several years ago so I do not need to pay the Bills, but the bills worry her and give her heart palpitations. The Treasury's argument that such people can switch their financial affairs does not bear scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because he is emphasising the point that I skipped over. This change will hit a lot of elderly confused people whose affairs are managed by their relatives and kept nice and simple. They might have only one or two equity holdings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention.
<P>
If Labour Members cannot imagine that real situation, let me give them an example. If we divide the 300,000 people affected by the tax change by the number of constituencies in Great Britain, more than 400 of them will be in each constituency. We are talking about the most disadvantaged and vulnerable elderly people in our constituencies. Do Labour Members really want to impose a savage tax increase on those people? I do not believe that they can defend that before their electorate or their consciences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Of course, Mr. Butterfill, I could seek your help in this matter and say that schedule 3 has nothing to do with payable tax credits, which we debated in last year's Finance Bill Committee. We are discussing ACT, which is a separate matter. [Interruption.] Of course it is. Payable tax credits were abolished in the last Budget, with effect from April next year. We are now abolishing ACT. However, I am sure that members of the Committee will be pleased to know that I intend to seek 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Is the Paymaster General suggesting that the amendment is not in order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am suggesting that we should debate the amendment and tackle the arguments head on. The hon. Gentleman may not have served on the Committee last year I cannot remember but we also debated the matter on the Floor of the House, and we decided to abolish payable tax credit. Let us take the amendment head on and see where it leads us.
<P>
The abolition of tax credit was widely welcomed by industry. Combined with the abolition of ACT, we have made a major improvement in the corporate taxation system. We are getting rid of the in-built bias towards paying dividends, which characterised the old tax credit. We are also getting rid of ACT and its associated problems, not least the problem of surplus ACT. That gave rise to the need for FIDs, which now of course also disappears. We have a more rational modern taxation system which, taken with the move from ACT to in-year instalments, puts this country on a par with, if not ahead of most of our competitors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall develop my argument a little further because I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to respond to other things that I say, especially when I deal with his amendment.
<P>
I am pleased to say that the Opposition, who voted against the abolition of tax credits and promised blood and thunder on ACT, have come round to accepting the necessity of both those steps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. Just this morning the right hon. Gentleman said RIP to the imputation system, ACT and the rest of it. Do the Opposition want to repeal the measures and reinstate the old system or not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point that I wish to repeat is that the change in the corporation tax system has been a shambles from start to finish and the schedule is a very good example of that. Instead of pretending that everything is marvellous and that the change is supported by everyone, including big business, the Paymaster General should address the issue because it is causing a lot of collateral damage to the very people whom we represent. We want some remedies from the Minister this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I am sure that we were all interested to hear that the Opposition now accept these measures as very good ones. The vast majority of those whom we consulted were in favour, including the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the accounting professions. There may be differences concerning the details how surplus ACT will be treated and the phasing of in-year PEPs but we are all agreed on the principle. Opposition Members, especially those in related professions, know that these measures have been accepted by their erstwhile employers.
<P>
The slighting comments by Opposition Members on individual savings accounts were unfounded, unjustified and unnecessary. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) managed to debase a serious debate in his own inimitable fashion. Where there might be sympathy, he finds none and he will have to learn about parliamentary debates.
<P>
I shall deal with ISAs. Two years at £5,000 a year in a scheme where the income has certain advantages, and a 10 per cent. tax dividend for five years plus capital gain are all steps in the right direction, and ISAs have been widely welcomed. They have been welcomed by the accounting profession, merchant banks and investing banks, institutiobns throughout the City, retailers 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not dwell on ISAs but will revert to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My comments are relevant to the points made by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The fact that I allowed Opposition Members a little latitude to snipe at ISAs does not mean that the Paymaster General may now make a major speech in their defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am trying to reply to the sniping. I shall do so briefly and say that there are advantages and it is not sensible to dismiss them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
We believe that the changes will have long-term benefits for all concerned and that they will increase investment in this country. The corporate taxation rates that we have introduced and getting rid of ACT will make the whole approach to dividends and investment much more neutral. The long-term benefits will come through to all concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Conservative Members do not accept that abolition of dividend tax credits will help industry, and even if we accepted that industry might welcome the change, and that it would benefit industry, the amendment would not affect any of that. It has been[Mr. Gibb]
carefully worded so that it will affect only non-taxpaying individuals. The Paymaster General could accept the amendment and retain the Government's reforms to the corporation tax system. Even under those reforms, he is retaining the 10 per cent. dividend tax credit. My amendment and the Government's reforms fit together and pensioners and poorer people could continue to receive a rebate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman intervened when he did because he leaves me a straight run at the amendment, which, I regret to say, I must urge the Committee to reject, not least because it is defective and would fail in its aim. The following subsection, which I shall quote in detail if the hon. Gentleman wishes, would prevent individuals from having tax credits paid to them. I regret to tell the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way. I do not want to return in depth to the subject of ISAs, but it is pertinent to our discussion. The hon. Gentleman, as we anticipated, is suggesting ISAs as an alternative for those people. For £10,000 in equities yielding 3 per cent. or perhaps £600 a year, what earthly attraction can there be for someone who will be deeply affected by the change to put their investment into an ISA? The minimum income advantage will be wiped out by charges.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Committee members' comments on the amendment are straying rather too widely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I accept your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. Sadly, it prevents me from replying to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): If the Paymaster General believes that the amendment's drafting is defective, does he accept the principles that lie behind it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall come to that in due course.
<P>
The calculations that were made by Opposition Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North are pretty much correct. The figures presuppose a sum of £10,000, and if there is a 3 per cent. yield one arrives at the figure that was referred to. The cost to the Government will be in the order of £25 million, which is a figure that is not to be sneezed at.
<P>
Sadly, I have to encourage the Committee to vote against the amendment, which was moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, because it would allow certain individuals who are outside the United Kingdom with sovereign immunity it does not take much imagination to guess who they are to enjoy unlimited advantages.
<P>
There was possibly more prospect in the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North, although I stress that I cannot make any promises. If the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton feels that he must try to make progress with his amendment, I shall not encourage him to withdraw it, despite the fact that it is defective in fundamental respects and unacceptable in its effects. My hon. Friend's point has more possibilities. I make no promises, other than to say that either I or another Minister will reply to it. Perhaps a case can be made for an overall limit on payable tax credits, which might be in the region that Age Concern described in its very good paper. That is not a promise; it is merely a promise to revert [Interruption.] I see at this critical moment that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary is invigilating. I reiterate for the benefit of hon. Members who participating in our deliberations and of those who are anxiously invigilating the fact that I make no promises, other than to revert to the matter on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> When he considers that matter, will he also consider the case that I mentioned earlier of people who saved in an employee trust, who are similarly affected by the proposals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Clearly, the matter was raised by varioius Committee members, and it will be examined in its generality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton may not be technically correct, but it is worth trying to interpret its intended purpose. There is no doubt about the fact that we are seeking to allow those pensioners to be able to reclaim tax credit under the tax allowance. Likewise, there is no doubt about our approach to those earning above the specified amount, who would be similarly encompassed, although that would be a much more wide-ranging and expensive measure. In this context, we are concerned about those who are on the lowest incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but he is trying to anticipate proposals that we may come up with if we come up with anything when we have reconsidered the matter. I do not want to be drawn further on this subject, because it is not profitable to discuss it further at this stage. I made my point in very cautious and reserved terms, and we shall return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On behalf of the Committee, I must say that we welcome the apparent concession that the Paymaster General granted, although it was somewhat Delphic we shall scrutinise Hansard to see exactly what was being offered. We noticed that he faltered slightly when the Chief Secretary was seen at the door, looking like a spectre at the feast. He cast a gloomy shadow over our proceedings. We look forward, nevertheless, to the Government looking again at this matter.
<P>
The amendment, which was so skilfully crafted and tabled by my hon. Friend, is pretty precise in its requirements, pretty easy for the Government to deliver and well targeted on poorer savers and pensioners. There should not therefore be any problem in correcting the technical deficiencies that are doubtless a feature of the amendment. The debate has shown that there is sympathy for the amendment among Labour and Opposition Members, which, added to the Paymaster General's concession, makes this a great day for my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The Committee as a whole can congratulate itself perhaps for the first time on having contributed constructively to the discussion of what is undoubtedly a defective feature of the tax system. On that note I speak on behalf of my hon. Friend, whose assent I hope that I have we will not press this amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall make brief reference to a problem arising from paragraph 26 of schedule 3. It involves pension funds invested in balanced authorised unit trusts. I should declare an interest which is in the Register of Members' Interests as a director of a company that runs balanced authorised unit trusts.
<P>
Paragraph 26, which makes changes to section 468Q of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, is yet another overhang from last year's smash-and-grab raid on pension funds. It puts pension fund investors in balanced authorised unit trusts at a disadvantage, following last year's Finance Act. They will be at a disadvantage to investors in other vehicles, such as life companies, as a pension fund invested in balanced authorised unit trusts cannot reclaim the tax incurred by the underlying unit trust.
<P>
Personal pension schemes, which are heavily regulated and therefore cannot change tack and invest in alternative vehicles, will be especially hit. Fund managers commonly use authorised balanced unit trusts for their pension fund clients. They are used to achieve exposure overseas or in certain sectors of the market, or as an asset allocation tool. They are also used to gain exposure to tracker funds. Although I do not wish to return to this subject, I am sure that, within the ISA framework, the people's tracker fund as the Paymaster General and his marketing gurus will no doubt dress it up will soon appear.
<P>
They also provide a method whereby personal pension fund investors can follow a fund manager who has a particularly good record or a house with a good track record. Regulated unit trusts, in which the manager and the vehicle are regulated, give the smaller investor, and especially smaller trustees of pension schemes, a double security safety net.
<P>
Balanced unit trusts are relatively common they will contain bonds, equities, cash and, in some cases, property. Unless 60 per cent. of the unit trust is invested in bonds, however, the payment of a dividend, not interest, is distributed. That is the source of the problem. It is unlikely that more than 60 per cent. of a balanced fund would be invested in bonds only a more equity-geared investment would achieve the desired performance.
<P>
As we have heard several times this afternoon, harking back to what happened last year, the 1997 Finance Act removed the ability of pension funds to reclaim the tax credits on United Kingdom dividends, thereby losing them 20 per cent. of their value at a stroke. Therefore, any tax paid by the unit trust on its unfranked income, which is usually from bonds, cannot be reclaimed by the pension fund investor. That contrasts with investments held directly via a separated authorised unit trust or an unauthorised unit trust, or via a pension fund pooling vehicle, a life company or even offshore, where tax would be reclaimable or not payable in the first instance. Therefore, personal pension scheme managers are put at a disadvantage to other vehicles, although they use what is in this case a safe and worthwhile vehicle for their method of investment.
<P>
The option is for the holders of these funds to restructure, but personal pension schemes cannot undertake restructuring, for regulatory reasons. Therefore, as a result of the clause, those fundholders will either be stuck with a fund offering a diminished performance, because of the 20 per cent. hit last year, or they will have to make increased contributions. Either way they will be disadvantaged.
<P>
Institutional funds can restructure, but even then there are costs involved the costs of transaction charges and of stamp duty. If they switch into an unauthorised unit trust, for example, an inferior regulatory framework looks after them.
<P>
One solution that I want to suggest to the Paymaster General is to introduce streaming in the case of these funds. The pension fund would then be able to receive the income from a balanced unit trust in the same form as the unit trust receives income from the underlying investments.
<P>
For example, if half the income was from equity dividends and half from bond interest, as is relatively common, half of the pension fund's dividend will be paid as interest, on which it could reclaim the tax that the unit trust had paid. That is not new: streaming already exists for corporate investors, so it is quite simple to extend it to the pension funds that I am describing.
<P>
The Paymaster General may say that previously it was not possible to extend streaming to such funds for private investors because certain unit holders might be able to reclaim more income tax than the unit trust had paid out in corporation tax, but that comes to an end anyway under paragraph 26 of the schedule. There are limits on the amount of income tax that may be reclaimed. Therefore, that is no longer an excuse.
<P>
This is an important area of the market. I shall give some examples. One of the largest funds is run by the Midland bank. The Midland balance fund is currently worth about £750 million and has over 120,000 personal pension-holder investors. Other companies operating similar funds include Schroder, Morgan Grenfell, Baillie Gifford, Gartmore and Newton. I deliberately do not include any of my own company's investments, but no doubt the Paymaster General will want to allude to them, as he frequently does, when either I, or one of my hon. Friends whom he misidentifies as me, gets up to speak.
[Mr. Loughton]
<P>
There is also the question of the viability and attractiveness of unit trust investments.
<P>
<H5>5.43 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.58 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I was coming to a conclusion when the Division bell went. I wanted to give a couple of statistics to underline the attractiveness of the forms of unit trusts in these schemes.
<P>
A comprehensive survey by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds in January of this year, the most up-to-date survey of the unit trust industry and some two years ahead of all the research on which the Paymaster General based his ISA conclusions I hasten to add that we will not come back to that subject again showed that the majority of those who purchase unit trusts do so for more than 10 years, which would certainly be in keeping with what the Government are trying to achieve. It also showed that the largest proportion of both current and prospective new unit trust holders comes from the C1 category. Therefore, contrary to some of the observations that the hon. Member for Dudley, North tried to make earlier, unit trusts are not the preserve of the rich classes with over £100,000 to invest. Over 39 per cent. of unit trust holders fall into the C1 category, which compares with the national average of 25 per cent. of the population. The survey also produced some interesting regional figures, showing how certain unit trust holders feature highly in the north and in Scotland, not simply in the south-east of England and in London.
<P>
That class of investment is much in keeping with what the Government supposedly, through their longer-term savings plans, are trying to encourage. We are all trying to encourage personal pension provision, and self-invested pension plans are another form of that, about which we shall hear a lot more. It is desirable that the investments have quality regulators, who regulate quality fund managers, who run well-regulated quality unit trust funds.
<P>
I leave the Paymaster General with three questions. First, have the Government considered the implications for authorised balanced unit trusts within person pensions? Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman consider my solution of streaming? It is a relatively simple device without some of the downside effects. If not, do the Government have something against authorised balanced unit trusts in general that we should know about?

<P>

<B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I have listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, and I should first say that we are aware of such concerns. We have had correspondence, but he may write again if he wishes. There is some concern about the balanced funds. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is much more knowledgeable about such matters than I, but there are relatively few balanced funds. Do not they tend to be either equities or bonds? I am not an expert in such matters as he is, but I do not believe that such concerns derive directly from section 468Q of the Taxes Act 1988. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman referred to AUTIF's views on such matters and it has welcomed the change to that Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> AUTIF is being quite vocal in pressing for the streaming solution. As for the right hon. Gentleman's point about how prevalent the funds are, I said earlier that the Midland balance fund is worth £750 million at present and has 120,000 personal pension investors. That is just one fund. I urge the Minister to respect the fact that such funds are not a small consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Clearly, the fund to which the hon. Gentleman referred is large. My argument was that there were not many of them. If it were a fairly well-defined area, it would be easier to examine whether the implications could be contained in that way.
<P>
Yes, we have received representations and we shall study the matter. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking but, as things stand, we do not think that there is a problem with the changes to section 468Q. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we were aware, to which the answer is yes. He then asked whether we would consider streaming. We have already received representations and I am sure that he will understand that a fairly widespread proposition is emerging from the industry. If there are concerns, we shall do our best to meet them. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will remind me of his third question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It followed on from the second point. Do the Government have something against the authorised balanced funds in general as a mode of investment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No. On one hadn, we take a long-term approach to such matters while, on the other, we are neutral. We have made good progress in that respect. We could argue about the advantages of balanced funds, but I do not want to get into that. The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned a large fund. We are aware of such matters and, if there are problems, we shall address them. No doubt he will have the opportunity and rightly so to be in touch with the Inland Revenue through his own organisation and others that are involved in such matters. I look forward to the outcome of the various consultations that have taken place.

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any regulations made under this section shall require the approval of the House of Commons.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My Front-Bench colleagues will be returning shortly from their duties on the Floor of the House.
<P>
It is a measure of the complexity of our tax affairs that the Government have produced a mammoth Finance Bill which promises even more weighty tomes of regulations, many of which we have not yet seen the draft regulations to be made under clause 32 appeared only yesterday. Some of my hon. Friends did not receive them before they had been broadcast on the internet. What does it say about the importance of the Committee's deliberations and how the Government's proposals will be investigated if information is put out on the internet before members of the Committee receive it? That is something of a discourtesy and I am sure that the Paymaster General will apologise to those affected. For some reason, I was one of the hon. Members who received the information. We were given less than 24 hours to consider the regulations and no opportunity to table amendments to the clause in the light of reading them. There was no possibility of identifying the parts of those regulations that an impartial observer might feel would sit better in the Bill.
<P>
In a Committee that I attended yesterday, we had a throwback to the Bank of England legislation, when I made the point that the order that we were debating could easily have been included in the original Bill. I suspect that when we have the chance to examine the regulations more closely, we shall probably find in the rather weighty number of pages quite a lot that could have been put in the Bill.
<P>
It is important to note that throughout the Bill so much flexibility and power is being claimed unchecked by the Executive and that many taxpayers will be left uncertain of the consequences of commercial and investment decisions when the Government suddenly decide to change the rules without reference back to the House of Commons. Even if the Government have a majority of more than 170, they still have to go through due process in the House of Commons. They must have a Finance Bill, so that there is an element of certainty. At least for the following year, business decisions can be made in the comfortable knowledge that people will not be surprised overnight by a sudden change of direction.
<P>
The Government are moving aaway from that principle. We see from clauses 32, 87 and 158 that the Government are taking the principle of regulations way beyond the enabling powers that were exercised by the previous Government and others before into what belongs in primary legislation. They have taken the exercise of Executive power so far that even members of the Law Society are beginning to blow the whistle and cry foul. We heard from an eminent adviser the other day who said that some of the Bill's provisions reminded him of ship duty, which, as we all know, led to a revolution. It is also worth bearing in mind the principle of "no taxation without representation", which led to another serious loss for this country in a later century.
<P>
The amendments are designed to place a vital check on the regulatory power that the Government claim. The idea that the Treasury "may" make provision to enable unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax to be set against corporation tax liabilities is preposterous. It is a Henry VIII provision. It is right that such provision should be made. There should be no doubt that the Government, having introduced the new regime, should make such provisions.
<P>
The amendments propose to change a "may" to a "shall". We object to the use of regulations, but if that is the mechanism proposed, it must be used in this clause. More importantly, regulations under this clause should require the approval of the House of Commons. I understand that at present, the Government can introduce changes to the Bill by negative resolution, without any democratic check or control. That is a prima facie unconstitutional proposal, which, as far as I am aware, has never been suggested before, although I look forward to hearing what the Paymaster General has to say. I have never voted for such a proposal, nor have many other hon. Members. They should not start now. New Labour members of the Committee, who are as new to the House as some Conservative members, should not taint their reputation as parliamentarians by voting for a clause that does not allow for a simple democratic test that the proposed regulations have the clear and emphatic endorsement of the House of Commons.
<P>
A wider case could be made for introducing an overall control on what can only be termed the Government's regulationitis. They would clearly love to build a massive bypass around the Houses of Parliament, and leave it to the trippers and tourists to hear how in days gone by, parliamentarians used to make decisions. We do not see it that way; we believe that, as parliamentarians, we have real powers, collectively, which we must exercise. One of the ways in which we do so is by placing limits on what the Executive can do of its own accord.
<P>
Since they introduced their first Finance Bill, the Government have had 12 months to conceive clause 32. They could not produce a comprehensive clause that set out exactly how provisions would be made for unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax. What have they been doing during the masterful planning of the tax changes, of which the Paymaster General was one of the architects, burning the midnight oil in all those years in opposition? Adding the years of opposition, they have had so long to conceive the clause that it begs the question why they could not have incorporated all the provisions in the Bill and why it was only yesterday evening that they dotted the final i's and crossed the final t's on the regulations that accompany the clause.
<P>
I am confident that Conservative Members will not hesitate to support the amendments. However, we must hear from the Paymaster General and from other Government Members, if they do not intend to support the amendments, how they can justify a further and major encroachment on the powers and standing of the House of Commons. As the technique of using regulations runs through the Bill, how members of the[Mr. St. Aubyn]
Committee vote on the amendment this afternoon will establish a principle that will apply to all the clauses that we will debate later.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Clause 32 is extremely important. A significant amount of money is at stake and the clause is extremely important to business, commerce and industry. I join the hon. Member for Guildford in saying that it is wholly inappropriate for the Government to use regulations to implement such a fundamental change in tax law. Clause 32(1) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Treasury may by regulations make provision".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Were the Government anticipating introducing regulations by primary legislation, or should the clause read, "The Treasury shall by regulations make provision"? In any event, the amendment should be carried and any such regulations should require the approval of the House of Commons.
<P>
I understand that the regulations were available on the internet last night or this morning. Will the Paymaster General tell us when those regulations became available? They are lengthy and complex and require scrutiny and amendment. I hope that the Paymaster General will assure us that the Government will make time for amendment and debate of those important regulations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise to support the amendment. I echo the point that has already been made. I do not know whether it is a matter of conspiracy or of cock-up, but either way the tardy delivery of the draft regulations to members of the Committee afforded us no time to table the all-important amendments to which members of the Committee have already referred. It really will not do to leave it so late for the Committee to have sight of such detailed and complex regulations. I hope that the Paymaster General will explain why they were delivered so late. We received them only through our persistent questioning of the Financial Secretary. She was repeatedly asked for timely delivery of the draft regulations. Sadly, those entreaties do not appear to have done the trick.
<P>
All practitioners who have examined the clauses and had a short time to look at the draft regulations agree on one thing and we agree with them. The new regime governing the setting off of unrelieved surplus ACT arising before 6 April 1999 against corporation tax for accounting periods after that date is massively detailed and complicated, and the regulations are commensurately detailed. In determining how effective the regulations will be, we are driven to read the notes on clauses, which tell us that this complicated regime will have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the effect of substantially preserving companies' existing expectations as to the use on or after 6 April 1999 of surplus ACT built up in the period before then."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key word is "substantially".
<P>
Those of us who read the Government's press releases of 17 March and the consultation paper this April and heard the various musings from Ministers, have been given the distinct impression that companies with unrelieved surplus ACT before the relevant date will be no worse off under the new regime.
<P>
The problem is that practitioners most notably Mr. Turnbull of KPMG in this morning's Financial Times can see no way on earth for any company to use the regulations in such a way as to be no worse off under the new regime. The consensus among practitioners is that companies that find themselves with unrelieved surplus ACT will be worse off. Why is that? We need not seek far to find some of the reasons. First, we are told that the regulations, especially those on companies that wish to qualify for treatment as tax groups, are much more restrictive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying far into the territory of a clause stand part debate. I hope that he will confine his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for your guidance, which, as always, is invaluable.
<P>
I was making the point that few practitioners believe that the regulations will operate effectively to ensure that companies are no worse off. That is the central thrust of our concern. No doubt, we shall go into the detail of the concerns about the regulations in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I should like to make a final point. I hope that I do not stray too far from the amendment, and I am sure that you do too, Mr. Butterfill. The regulations give Her Majesty's Treasury huge discretion. The two or three practitioners who have been able to glance at the draft regulations, which were delivered so late to us yesterday, have said that many companies have in-house tax managers, but they will not always be able to call on the services of experienced accountants, who would know of any draft changes to the regulations. There might be several such changes during a year.
<P>
There is deep concern that those who rely on expensive accountants to advise them on such technical changes at the year end might go through a financial year or an accounting period totally ignorant of the changes to the shadow ACT regime that the Treasury, in its wisdom, has been able to pass, more or less on the nod, without proper scrutiny or any publicity being afforded to them. That is a telling practical example of the concerns that have been voiced about the operation of the shadow ACT regime.
<P>
The way that the regulations have been presented is an affront to the House and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said, that is unparliamentary and verging on the undemocratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support my hon. Friends' amendments, especially amendment No. 33 on the regulations. The clause is extremely wide. Regulations that give unfettered powers to Treasury officials must be of great concern to the House and, indeed, to democracy in general. Amendment No. 33, which I support, would reduce and even eliminate some of that mischief.
<P>
The clause is wide ranging. Subsection (2) begins with the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1)"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Anything after that can deal with whatever the Treasury likes. Paragraph (h) goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in relation to the treatment of companies which have prescribed relationships or connections with each other".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the Treasury can decide through filings regulations how a group of companies should treat their ACT loses. Paragraph (i) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in relation to the treatment of prescribed events, arrangements or transactions involving companies with unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the Treasury may make wide-ranging powers.
<P>
Subsections (8) and (9) demonstrate some superb overkill in the making of the powers. Subsection (8) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations under this section"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may modify or apply provisions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as the Treasury think necessary or expedient"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (9) goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations under this section which apply any provisions of the Tax Acts may apply those provisions ... with such modifications as the Treasury think necessary or expedient for or in connection with giving effect to the provisions of this section."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, subsection (10) is wider still.
<P>
That is an unacceptable way to govern this country. At the very least, the Government should reintroduce the regulations before they go before the House, preferably in a positive resolution or, failing that, in a negative resolution. It is worth going over the same ground again. A negative resolution would give us an opportunity to inspect the resolutions and pray against them. But you know as well as anyone, Mr. Butterfill, that even if a large number of hon. Members were to pray against them, they would not necessarily be debated. When they are debated, they are often confined to a Committee Room. Although they are subject to a vote, they cannot be amended.
<P>
The difference between negative and positive resolutions is that regulations under a positive resolution have to be debated by the House before they can be brought into effect. That would be the most democratic and satisfactory way of proceeding. It would give the House an opportunity to examine whether the regulations are in accordance with the Bill or whether they are oppressive. I believe that the powers to make regulations that the clause 3 gives to Treasury officials, and which amendment No. 33 attempts to mitigate, will become oppressive.
<P>
The clause is anti-democratic. It does not allow us to scrutinise the regulations on behalf of our constituents and the professionals and tax practitioners who know about such matters, to ensure that they are satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the real danger is that if the regulations do not give effect to what we perceive to be their intention in a fair and even-handed way, there may be an element of retrospective taxation if ACT that has been paid under the previous regime is not fully, properly and fairly relieved? Is that not the key point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As usual, my hon. Friend makes a telling point. Indeed, had you, Mr. Butterfill, selected amendment No. 31, we would have been able to put right some of that mischief.
<P>
We are talking about tax that has already been paid.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 31 has been selected and will be debated after this amendment. However, I am not clear in my mind whether Opposition Members will also want to have a debate on clause stand part or whether they would prefer to have a general debate on this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> With your indulgence, Mr. Butterfill, that depends on the Paymaster General's reply. If he gives us a satisfactory response, we will probably wish to withdraw or vote on the amendment, depending on that reply, and might or might not wish to have a stand part debate 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether I allow a clause stand part debate depends on my judgment, not on what the Minister says. It also depends on how much latitude hon. Members wish to take in debating these narrow amendments because the debate is tending to range rather wide and deal with the generality of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Of course, Mr. Butterfill, I will take careful note of your guidance. The problem is that the clause itself is wide and the regulations grant such broad powers that amendment No. 33 needs to be thoroughly debated.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is an extremely serious matter, perhaps the most serious matter pertaining to the Bill. It applies to tax that companies have already paid and which they are entitled to get back. We are simply asking for fairness in the tax system and for the regulations to be properly scrutinised. There is a severe democratic deficit. If we are to allow Treasury officials, through wider and wider regulations 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am seeking the view of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on whether they wish to extend the debate on these subsections to a more general stand part debate, in which case I shall rule, under Standing Order No. 68, that we shall not have a stand part debate when we would normally have one. I am seeking guidance because I am prepared to allow that to happen. If not, I must bring the hon. Gentleman back to the amendment. It is the hon. Gentleman's decision. I do not deny the importance of the amendments or the clause; I am simply questioning the order in which we should debate them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On behalf of my hon. Friend, perhaps it would be appropriate to have a fairly wide debate on the amendment. It is impossible to speak to the amendments with any consistency without widening the debate and I am certainly willing to forgo a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, we all know where we stand. The debate has been fairly wide so far, so I am prepared to be tolerant about consideration of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Mr. Butterfill, I am grateful to you for your guidance. I am also grateful to my right[Mr. Clifton-Brown]
hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for clarifying the position. This is the first time that I have been asked to give instructions on behalf of my party and it was difficult to decide what was in the mind of my right hon. Friend.
<P>
This is an important clause. There is a severe democratic deficit. We need to think about the matter very carefully and hold the Government to account because this is a disturbing trend. In every Finance Bill, more and more provisions are to be prescribed by the unscrutinised regulations of Treasury officials. We all understand that tax matters are becoming increasingly complicated, none more so than the whole area of corporation tax and advance corporation tax credits. Therefore, it makes sense that, to some degree, the power to make regulations should be granted to Treasury officials. But we see in the clause an ever-greater widening of that power, which should be used sparingly by the Government. Otherwise, we might as well have a one-clause Bill, which says that every matter relating to taxes may be granted to Treasury officials, and not bother to have a Committee at all what the devil are we doing here?
<P>
We must be sensible about this; we must guard carefully the democratic powers that we have been granted by our constituents. I hope that Government Members will take note of this because, one day, they will be in opposition and, one day, they may make the same points that we are making now. [Laughter.] They may want the Government of the day to guard democracy very carefully.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friends and I will want to draft some form of new clause later on to tighten up the provision, so that we can scrutinise the secondary legislation more closely. I ask the Paymaster General to look carefully at what is a serious matter, and not a matter for mirth on the Government Benches. I hope that my hon. Friends and I can draft an an amendment that would make provision for a number of the regulations to be properly scrutinised by the House on a positive resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall be as brief as I can so that my right hon. Friend can continue. I rise with some confidence, having achieved a slight victory during the debate on the previous clause. I am confident that we will have a U-turn on these amendments as well.
<P>
I support amendment No. 15, which is in the name of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and which seeks to replace the word "may" with the word "shall". You were right to link amendments Nos. 15 and 33, Mr. Butterfill, because they have a consistent theme. They both seek to avoid handing too much power to the Executive, and to retain power in the hands of Parliament. If the amendment is accepted, the replacing of "may" with "shall" would require the Treasury to listen to the will of the House, and to produce the regulations specified by the clause. It is wrong to give more and more discretion to the Executive. It is for Parliament to decide whether regulations should be made, and that is why we have tabled the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 makes clear that important regulations that replace the ACT system with a shadow ACT system should be subject to scrutiny in the House by affirmative resolution. Such regulations should automatically be debated in Committee.
<P>
We are discussing a method of relieving surplus ACT of £7 billion, which is a very significant sum of money. The rules that govern how companies recover that money should not be subject to regulations that can be amended in the future. The fact that those regulations can be set up in the first place is less of a worry to us than their possible amendment in the future.
<P>
A company has the right to recover money that it has paid in advance of its corporation tax bills. It is only because of the quirks of international trade, double tax treaties and the payment of tax overseas that such surpluses have arisen. The question of how the surpluses are relieved and returned to such a company is crucial and should be debated on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Mr. Ross Upton of Ernst Young said in today's Financial Times that the measure is nothing more than a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"back door tax rise for UK multinationals".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree with that statement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for referring to that article. I shall also refer to it a little later because it raises some important points.
<P>
The Institute of Directors is also worried about the use of regulation by negative resolution. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This clause gives the Treasury very wide powers to make regulations. The rules for the recovery of advance corporation tax (ACT) have until now always been dealt with in primary legislation, and they should continue to be dealt with there."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concluded that the matter is not of less significance merely because no more ACT will be generated after 5 April 1999.
<P>
The Institute of Directors believes not only that such matters should be dealt with by affirmative resolution; it quite rightly points out that matters of such moment have in the past been dealt with on the Floor of the House.
<P>
I sometimes doubt whether the Government believe in the importance of Parliament, given their efforts to reform our constitution. However, if they do believe in the centrality of Parliament to the deliberation of this nation's events, they should accept the amendment as a small step towards restoring the democratic deficit.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the previous Government's last three Finance Bills provided for more than a dozen sets of regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is irrelevant. It is not the number of sets of regulations that matter. The regulations to which the hon. Lady refers concerned merely administrative matters. Under no previous Government, not even a Labour Government, were regulations put forward that dealt with significant tax issues. No regulations in the past have created a tax system.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Regulation-making powers covering direct taxes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is simple to say "direct taxes". What aspect of direct taxes does the hon. Lady mean? If it is to do with the minutiae of the way in which the PAYE system is administered, fine, that should be dealt with by regulation, but if it is the introduction of a new income tax system, including the rates, how it is paid, what date it should be paid on and how much is paid, it should be dealt with, and always has been dealt with, on the Floor of the House.
<P>
Everyone accepts that administrative matters can be dealt with by regulation, but not issues like the creation of a new corporation tax payment system or indeed the system for relieving shadow ACT, involving the way in which £7 billion of corporations' money should be handed back to them over forthcoming years. That is not a matter for regulation but a matter that should be dealt with on the Floor of the House and, at the very least, by affirmative resolution.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) referred to the Financial Times article this morning. I suspect that this is the first article that we will see over the coming months reflecting on the draft regulations. These regulations, which we have now had a chance to glance at quickly, are the latest incident in the saga of incompetence that goes right back to the July Budget. I describd that earlier and shall not try your patience, Mr. Butterfill, or that of the Committee by relaying it again. We have not seen the end of the saga. We saw the introduction of corporate payments and the abolition of ACT, but the way in which the surplus ACT is to be dealt with is another problem, which is purportedly being resolved by the introduction of the regulations.
<P>
The City's first comment is already critical. Robert Turnbull, from my, former firm of KPMG, and who was quoted earlier, says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The regulations contain tougher rules than the present system and some companies might find them difficult to use."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He goes on to say that the grouping arrangements are onerous. He says that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The arrangements amount to a parallel but incomplete tax system for companies."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He says that the hurdles that companies have to clear to use the system are much higher than under the previous ACT regime and he cites the treatment of groups, saying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The definition of group is much more strict than it was under the previous regime."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, the press release that announces the regulations says that they are deliberately "less finished". What kind of Government produce draft regulations for consultation that are deliberately "less finished"? It almost invites criticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend is making a good point. Will he agree that it is one thing to produce regulations in the full glare of the Finance Bill that is introducing them, but further regulations to be introduced down the track will not be subject to such scrutiny? It simply gives the Treasury the opportunity to come back time and time again if it gets them wrong, and the cost will have to be borne by industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The concern is not just about the regulations that we can see today, which Conservative Members insisted were published before we debated the clause. The concern is that in two or three years' time, when no one is bothered about the law relating to shadow ACT, further changes will be put through, Conservative Members will pray against them, if we are still in Opposition then, and that will be refused. The people, through their parliamentary representatives, will have no say in how the regulations are amended in the future.
<P>
This is an essential amendment that the Government would be best advised to accept. Tax changes of this importance should be debated on the Floor of the House or, at the very least, in Committee. The draft regulations that we have seen are enormously complicated and reflect the Inland Revenue's usual paranoia with tax avoidance and tax avoidance schemes. I urge the Paymaster General to reflect again and perhaps on Report to announce a change of heart on this issue too.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise, Mr. Butterfill, for missing the early part of the debate, but it has been well introduced by my hon. Friends, and I understand received support from Liberal Democrat Members as well, as it should, because it is an important subject. This is not the only clause where there is excessive and unjustified use of delegated legislation, nor is it the last that we shall debate in this way, but it is an important example. Our amendments seek to remedy the lack of information in the clause, whose heading, in the circumstances is somewhat misleading.
<P>
A member of the tax paying public or a representative of a taxpaying company might turn to the Bill in the hope of finding information about unrelieved advance corporation tax. That hypothetical person would expect the subject to be dealt with in the Bill because last July the Chancellor of the Exchequer signalled the end of advance corporation tax, as did the subsequent Finance Bill. Ministers stated at the time that the subject of unrelieved surplus ACT would be dealt with subsequently.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The pre-Budget report came a little later, in November. It announced a consultation paper and sought ideas about the development of the necessary changes. It would be entirely understandable if that member of the taxpaying public turned to the Bill in the hope that it would contain the relevant details. He would go to the Stationery Office and pay £19.95 for the Bill, which is a two-volume work in paperback, and he would take it home or back to his company and search in the arrangement of clauses for the information. He would be delighted to find that clause 32 is entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With trembling fingers, he would open the bill, hoping to find all the fruits of the extensive consultation that had taken place. Instead, he would find the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Treasury may by regulations make provision for or in connection with enabling unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. That would not get him very far, so he would take the Bill back to the Stationery Office and ask for his £19.95 back. The Stationery Office would undoubtedly refuse, and point him to the regulations.
[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
<P>
I hope that that member of the taxpaying public would not have the problems that we have had in trying to get the draft regulations from the Government. Several of my hon. Friends had to raise persistent points of order before the draft was sent to each of us. In an earlier sitting, it was airily stated that the regulations were in the Library somewhere. However, when my hon. Friends went to the Library, they found that they were not there, but that they would be delivered there. I suggested that it might have been courteous if all Committee members had received the regulations in time for our debate, but nothing happened. Then we had to insist that there could be no question of debating the clause without the draft regulations. At the end of a needlessly long and protracted series of exchanges, we finally got hold of the draft regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that, on Tuesday, the Financial Secretary responded to a point of order by assuring the Committee that the draft regulations would be delivered to Committee members in good time for our debate on the clause? We all know that those regulations were not available until late yesterday afternoon. Is that enough time for Committee members to prepare for our debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right I recall the exchange that he mentioned. It is a disgrace that we received the document only the day before this important debate.
<P>
As my hon. Friends know, this is a very important subject. It affects the interests of several large British companies, which we are trying to retain in this country. Veterans of last year's Finance Bill will recall the fact that many companies that are based here and which have large overseas earnings inevitably have large surpluses of unrelieved corporation tax. They have inadequate mainstream corporation tax to absorb the advance corporation tax that they have made on their dividend payments. Those are exactly the companies that are rather footloose in the global economy, and it is important to retain their interests in this country. However, they are being treated in a most dismissive way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will my right hon. Friend consider the following? A company with a large amount of unrelieved advance corporation tax could submit a scheme to the Inland Revenue, which might accept that it is not outlawed by any regulations. But the Government could then introduce further, retrospective regulations that outlawed the scheme with no scrutiny whatever by the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right and that scenario is entirely plausible. One of the attractions of this country has always been that we have a legal system which is impartial, fair and literal in its interpretations. People know where they stand. When people from overseas invest here and set up their headquarters or subsidiary companies here, they know in advance that their obligations will be to the Treasury and the Inland Revenue. All of that is being put at risk by the cavalier attitude with which they and the Committee are being treated, and the lack of provisions on how this important matter, which involves millions of pounds, will be dealt with.
<P>
The point has been made that secondary legislation is a familiar part of all Finance Bills. We have all served on the Standing Committees that considered previous Finance Bills on both sides of the House, and we know that extensive use is made of secondary legislation. The point, which has been noted by outside commentators, is that there is a new departure in the Bill whereby important matters of taxation the timing and amount of taxation, the circumstances in which taxes are paid, any relief that may be available are not stated in primary legislation, but are delegated to subsequent regulations that may not be debated. If the regulations are subject to the negative resolution procedure, it is highly unlikely that they will ever come before the House or any Committee. The Bill is taking away from elected Members of Parliament any right to scrutinise taxation powers. The Institute of Directors, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society have all deprecated sternly the new departure in the Bill.
<P>
There is a charitable explanation for clause 32. The Government may be in an enormous muddle about what to do. They may simply not know how to proceed. They may not be ready to bring before the House the necessary legislation. But those are not adequate excuses. They have had a year in which to draw up their proposals. their pre-Budget report in November included another consultation document, so there was plenty of time before the Bill was published. Any excuse that further consultation is needed is hollow. The truth is that this is part of a pattern whereby the House and its Committees are treated with increasing contempt by the Executive. It simply suits the Government to delegate to secondary legislation any controversial matters of taxation.
<P>
I have outlined the difficulty that even this Committee has had in obtaining draft regulations; the taxpaying public and companies that will be affected have had the same inconvenience. Our amendments would, albeit partially and inadequately, correct some of those deficiencies. Amendment No. 15 tries to limit the Treasury's enormously wide discretion because the words "Treasury may" are no constraint whatever. Paragraph 2, which lists some of the things that the Treasury may do, is no restriction on the discretion of the Treasury in any way. The Treasury can introduce additional measures that are not listed here, and fail to introduce measures that are listed here. The list in paragraph 2 is therefore simply a memorandum, a kind of White Paper or statement of intent relating to matters on which the Government may introduce regulations if they so wish. That is a form of contempt for the House, as it does not provide any assurance about the content or scope of such important regulations. We therefore want to delete those words and insert the words on the amendment paper.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 would attempt to ensure that such measures required the approval of the House of Commons. I genuinely appeal to Labour Members to take an interest in this matter, because there was a time when the essence of Parliament was to try to limit the tax-raising powers of the Executive. It could almost be said that Parliament came into existence to take control of such powers, to prevent their being used arbitrarily by the King.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have just taken advice, and it seems that all of the regulations under this clause may be introduced without either the negative or affirmative resolution procedure. In other words, they have to be signed by the Minister and passed as intra vires by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments to ensure that they conform to the terms of the Bill. There is no scrutiny whatever by the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have great respect for my hon. Friend, but I cannot believe that that is true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My right hon. Friend and the Committee might like to be aware that the Clerk has just given me that advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> All that I can say is that that would be such a clear outrage that the Committee could not allow it in any circumstances. We are considering the compulsory acquisition by the state of a citizen's property or money. That is the nature of taxation. That is why Parliament has always insisted on closely scrutinising the circumstances in which a citizen can be relieved of his property. It is bad enough that that should be delegated to secondary legislation, but it would be wholly unacceptable, by any criterion, if it were done in the manner suggested by my hon. Friend.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General enlighten us now on the scope and type of regulations in the Finance Bill? A number of ill-judged interventions from Labour Members have suggested that there is nothing new and it is just business as usual. I know that not to be the case, as do the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society, as I have already said. I have not quoted extensively from their publications, as I know that they have been sent to all hon. Members.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General tell the Committe, either now or in a future sitting, to what extent there has been an increase in the use of secondary legislation and regulation? Is the negative resolution procedure to be used rather than the affirmative resolution procedure, and are the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) in any sense true? Is the entire system of parliamentary scrutiny to be completely bypassed? That would be an outrage, and I must speak on behalf of any hon. Member who has even a glimmering of attachment to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty and the rights of those whom we represent.
<P>
I shall press the amendment unless the Paymaster General assures the Committee that he is seriously addressing the problem that I have outlined. We do not necessarily expect a full statement now, but we would be genuinely enlightened if he could tell us by how much the Bill will extend secondary legislation and the Government's use of it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> May I seek your guidance, Mr. Butterfill, on exactly where we are in the debate? We are on clause 32 and taking amendments Nos. 15 and 33 together. With the agreement of the right hon. Member for Wells, we shall not have a clause stand part debate. However, are we also debating clause 31, which has cropped up in the debate?
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman means amendment No. 31. We have not yet reached the debate on amendment No. 31, but are debating amendments Nos. 15 and 33 together. If the movers of the amendments wish, I shall allow separate Divisions on the two amendments. Although they are related in debating terms, they involve separate concepts. We shall then move to amendment No. 31. Because I have allowed the debate to range fairly wide of the narrow scope of the amendments, I do not intend to allow a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That makes everything clear. I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The Opposition are assembled before us in all their distinguished intellectual prowess and in amendment No. 15 they have decided that we should substitute "shall" for "may". Underlying their thinking is their view that we are seeking a degree of regulation that was previously unheard of.
 <P>
The hon. Member for Guildford moved this distinguished amendment, but the Opposition will find it embarrassing to vote for it after I have outlined the real position. He mentioned the fact he had not voted on anything like this clause, but that might reflect his short membership of the House rather than anything peculiar in our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Let me make a little progress. I will then be only too willing to give way.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 relates to whether the regulations are subject to a negative or a positive resolution. There is nothing in our proposals that was not standard practice in the 18 years that the Conservative party was in government. The word "may" stood unchallenged until the hon. Member for Guildford had the brilliant idea of substituting it with "shall". I compliment him on the brilliance of his thought.
<P>
Regulations have stood the test of time and have been placed before the House in the normal way.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment, but let me at least say something. I have never been shy or ungenerous in giving way to interventions.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee, but I want to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold. I assure him that the information he received from a Clerk, who I suspect was in a hurry, does not reflect what will happen. The regulations, as always, will be subject to a negative resolution. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was consistent with his speech. He said that the regulations should be subject to a negative or positive resolution. I assure him that they will be subject to a negative resolution.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 suggests that the regulations should be subject to a positive regulation. We reject that[Mr. Robinson]
because we are following a practice that has been established by successive Finance Bills. That practice has worked quite well given the amount of detail everyone taking part in the debate has referred to that in the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I merely point out that the previous Government never used regulations in the same way as this Government. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the way in which the clause is worded. I invite the Paymaster General to respond to my question. Can he name a single Act of Parliament introduced in the past 18 years by the previous Administration in which regulatory power was claimed for the Executive on the scale that his Government are claiming in this Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes, I can. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) referred to the Finance Act 1993, which is a classic example. I shall quote some figures to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I will agree with the hon. Gentleman if he admits that the Opposition were indolent when they were in government, and that they drafted shorter, less effective Finance Bills. If a Government sit around for years, do nothing despite advice when urgent reform is required, and are cosseted in the office that I now have the privilege of occupying, Finance Bills will be simpler and less complicated, and require less regulation. There is a direct correlation between the two facts.
<P>
I shall provide figures, and wait in anticipation to see how the hon. Gentleman, in his infinite wisdom, responds. In the financial year 1994-95, there were 42 negative resolutions and 15 positive resolutions. The previous Government's legislation was not as complicated as the Bill because they did not try to iron out anomalies and distortions. In the financial year 1995-96, the ratio was 69:3; in 1996-97, it was 87:9. Those are telling ratios. The hon. Gentleman, in his naivety or lack of experience, tries to pretend that a sea change has taken place in the Government's approach when we are working with the very officials who loyally served the previous Government. It is beyond belief.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. We can excuse the hon. Gentleman for naivety and lack of experience, but it is silly to imagine that any deep change has taken place in the procedures that infuse regulations, and the way in which they are presented to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way to the right hon. Gentleman in a moment, but first I give way to the hon. Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is not a question of naivety. The Paymaster General is being disingenuous. He knows that it is not the quantity but the content of regulations that matters. We are attacking the scale and content of the regulations in the Bill. The Paymaster General's flummoxed flannelling makes it clear that he cannot name an Act that the previous Government introduced to extend the power of the Executive in the way that the Bill does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have said all I had to say on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
To reply to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, the regulations were put on the internet, but they were made available to hon. Members beforehand. [Interruption.] That was our intention. We would never mean to be discourteous. Every effort was made to provide hon. Members with the regulations. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also experienced problems with obtaining a copy. The Government would always try to provide hon. Members with copies first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General claims that there is nothing new in the regulations. Does he claim that the Institute of Directors, the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants are wrong to state that the Bill provides for a new qualitative use of the powers? The Institute of Chartered Accountants stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a new and unwelcome development for substantive issues to be dealt with in this way."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the institute wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The longer the list of organisations grew, the more convinced I became that it was possible that the institute was wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Let me make progress.
<P>
It has never been the practice to publish all draft regulations before the relevant clause is debated in Committee. I shall provide another example of the way in which the Opposition behaved when in government. I do not think that it is an important point. However, a Committee in the House would be put into a much worse position in terms of the availability of regulations and the ability to debate them. Under the Finance Act 1993, there were 30 regulation-making provisions. Almost all the statutory instruments produced under those provisions were made after the calender year 1993. That was during the normal budgetary period, but there were between six and nine months during which the regulations were not available at all. Labour Members would not have made a particular fuss about that, because that is the way in which Governments must proceed.
<P>
The Government will publish draft regulations in time for the Committee to examine them, with the relevant primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. We will publish the draft regulations when we can and when it is sensible and practical to do so. The corporation tax draft regulations were published on 24 April. The shadow ACT regulations were published yesterday. I can assure Opposition Members that more will follow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Paymaster General has begun to break new ground by publishing secondary legislation on the internet. Our criticisms of the large amount of secondary legislation would be considerably reduced if he could urgently investigate with his Treasury officials whether all future secondary legislation could be published on the internet in draft form. Those outside the House might not be able to attend the Committees on statutory instruments and it is difficult for them to find out what is going on. Publication on the internet would improve the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is a novel suggestion. Not everyone in the country subscribes to the internet, but, no doubt, some people would find the suggestion interesting. We have considered the matter, and it might become a more standard practice, although I do not want to give a commitment that it would be done regularly.
<P>
The important point is that the publication of negative and positive resolutions whether on the internet or elsewhere is just the tip of the iceberg. The Government held wide consultations before the recent Budget on such matters as the corporation tax proposals, the abolition of ACT, the ISA and the control of foreign companies. The legislation was better because of the length and depth of that consultation. I will not strain the patience of the Committee by listing the other areas in which we are holding consultations, but they cover a wide range. We shall have better government as a result, as I hope Opposition Members will appreciate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General provide time for scrutiny and amendment of the regulations so that they can be debated properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have already said that we have a far better record on that matter than the previous Government. Much has been achieved by consultation. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon may have had at the back of his mind the idea that it has taken us a year to prepare the ACT legislation, but it was not until after the period of consultation that we were able to decide that we wished to proceed with ACT and the drafting could begin. That period of consultation was initiated with the pre-Budget statement, which was another good example of the openness and sensible debate that the Government are encouraging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I beg the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton not to intervene yet again on the same point.
<P>
As hon. Members are aware, the regulations are laid before the House. They are there for 40 days under the negative resolution procedure and they can be prayed against, as the hon. Member for Cotswold pointed out. If the House does not like them, all the legislation can be thrown out. There is no problem.
<P>
The Government have been as open as we can, although we have had to exclude such matters as income tax. When we can consult, we have done so and we have introduced better legislation as a result.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have just heard a eulogy to the virtues of regulation. Is there any area of taxation that the Paymaster General thinks is not appropriate for the extraction of taxation by regulation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I always get that sinking feeling when I give way to the hon. Gentleman and afterwards I regret that I did. It will have been about the fifth time in this Committee already.
<P>
I shall discuss the specific points made by Opposition Members. We have dealt with the points that the hon. Member for Cotswold raised about regulations. The mistreatment of large multinational does not arise. We shall be discussing the large multinational when we come to amendment No. 31 and I am sure that Opposition Members will have a lot to say on it. Getting rid of ACT has got rid of the biggest bugbear for the overseas companies Rio Tinto and Benetton are two good examples about which they could do nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of information, we are not talking about future ACT. That has stopped; we are talking about the unrelieved ACT built up from the past. Would the Paymaster General please address the clause that we are addressing, not some other clause? There is a problem about unrelieved advanced corporation tax, which is the subject of the clause and which engages the interest of Rio Tinto and other companies. That is a matter of fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that the right hon. Gentleman is anticipating amendment No. 31, which I tried to clarify. The amendment is tabled by him he leads the list proudly. I would willingly discuss surplus ACT without having had the benefit of the wisdom that he will bestow upon us, but I do not think that it would be in order.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds complained that the practitioners already knew about the implementation of the shadow ACT and about the mighty speech that was trailed this morning and leaked widely, I am sure, to an anticipating press. In the meantime, the practitioners, not having seen the regulations, have made up their mind that somebody will lose out. How they can do that 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, I will not give way. The debate is coming and we shall wait, trembling in our seats.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a point about the surplus ACT and its return to companies, with reference to amendment No. 31. I recommend that there should be no vote on either amendment. The substitution of "shall" for "may", which has stood the grammatical test of 18 years of Tory rule without being challenged by an Opposition too intelligent to get down to that level of textual[Mr. Robinson]
analysis, means nothing. As for negative and positive resolutions, we are continuing the traditions that have been well established, and we intend to respect every right that belongs to Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As usual, the Paymaster General has answered every question except the ones that we asked. He tried to assert that the regulations were of no interest to big British tax-paying companies such as Rio Tinto because all their problems had been solved elsewhere. Those regulations go to the heart of the quantity and timing of the tax that they will be paying, because they have vast unrelieved corporation tax. We shall be addressing the issue in a future amendment, but it is the substance of the debate. Those companies, too, want to know what the regulations are and want to be assured that they will come before the House and be voted on.
<P>
The Paymaster General has asserted that there has been no change in the use of secondary legislation contrary to the written comments of all outside observers. Undoubtedly, we shall return to this pointwhen we discuss other clauses, on which similar regulations will rely. I asked the Paymaster General whether he would help the Committee by showing us that there had been no qualitative change. He takes refuge as have some of his hon. Friends in the view that the numbers of regulations have not been matched. I am not sure whether that is true. However, our point is different. The type of regulation and the type of issues that are now being delegated to secondary legislation are of an entirely different order from previously, and we shall have to return to that subject. I presume from the Paymaster General's silence that he has no intention of helping the Committee to acquire this information, so we shall attempt to acquire it from outside sources and the Library, which will take longer, and it will be the subject of longer debates in future. For the present, I should like to announce that we shall be dividing the Committee on amendment No. 33.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
