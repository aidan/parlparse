<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000241"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Benton. I shall try to brief, although there are quite a
number of amendments to explain, some of which are linked. They
concentrate primarily on disability. Amendments 170, 171 and 173 are
related to the duty to make reasonable adjustments under clause 19 and
the comparator that focuses on persons who are not disabled. Our
amendments are supported by the Disability Charities Consortium. I want
to probe the Minister on such
matters.</div><a name="09061873000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consortium believes that the comparator provisions under the clause are
undesirable and should be removed as they could lead to serious
problems for disabled people when trying to enforce their rights in
respect  of goods, services and auxiliary aids, where
the  comparator concept does not currently exist under the
Disability Discrimination Acts. Although we understand the
Government&#146;s desire to provide consistency across reasonable
adjustment provision, my understanding and that of the DCC is that they
are doing so by introducing comparators in areas of disability
discrimination legislation where they did not previously exist.
Therefore, the worry is that such provisions will be
weakened.</div><a name="09061873000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with the comparator is whether we would then have a rerun of
the problems in the Malcolm case. Under clause 19(3), (4) and (5) a
reasonable adjustment is required only when a disabled person is put at
a substantial disadvantage in comparison with people who are not
disabled. The use of a comparator is not new in disability
discrimination legislation generally. The same language exists in the
employment provisions of the DDA, but the comparator is not used in
part 3 for goods, facilities and services when an anticipatory duty is
owed to disabled persons as a whole, and nor is it used in relation to
the duty to provide auxiliary aids and
services.</div><a name="09061873000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for the concern is that comparators were brought to light in the
Malcolm case when the concept of related discrimination was undermined
through the Law Lords&#146; reinterpretation of how the comparator in
a case should be decided. That had previously been established in the
case of Clark <i class="I">v.</i> Novacold. Indeed, that problem has been
recognised in the Bill in provisions that would put the legislation
back to where we thought it was prior to the Malcolm
case.</div><a name="09061873000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
172 inserts at the end of the clause new wording that would require
providers of goods and services to provide auxiliary aids and services
when that would facilitate the use of such services by disabled people.
Such a provision would remove the requirement for a comparator. Will
the Minister clarify the effect of the change in wording in the Bill,
compared with that in the DDA? In part 3 of the DDA, service providers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>already have to provide auxiliary aids when reasonable, if those aids
would facilitate or enable disabled people to make use of services. The
threshold&#151;or trigger&#151;for providing the aid is when it
would otherwise be impossible or unreasonably difficult for the
disabled person to make use of such services. A comparator would not be
needed to establish that discrimination has taken
place.</div><a name="09061873000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill provides that the aid should be provided when disabled people have
a substantial disadvantage in comparison with those who are not
disabled, and the DCC is concerned that that substantial disadvantage
must be determined through the use of a comparator. It considers that
that might weaken the legal protection that disabled people already
have under the DDA. The amendment would, in similar language, put the
threshold found in part 3 of the DDA back into the Bill. I seek an
explanation from the Minister of the changes and their effect in order
to ascertain whether the amendment is
required.</div><a name="09061873000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
174 would explicitly include the anticipatory nature of reasonable
adjustments. As I said, part 3 of the DDA says that the providers of
goods and services must anticipate the needs of disabled people,
ensuring that the services that they provide are accessible. They must
think about such matters in advance, not wait for problems to arise or
to be contacted by someone who has had a problem obtaining goods or
services. The anticipatory nature of the reasonable adjustment duty is
essential to its working. Again, the DCC, on behalf of a range of
disability organisations, wants to ensure that that aspect is
maintained in the Bill. We believe that the amendment would achieve
that.</div>
<a name="09061873000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
176, to schedule 2, deals with physical features. We wish to retain the
approach laid down in the DDA, which is that the focus must be on
removing or altering physical features that cause a barrier for
disabled people before considering other means that do not involve
eliminating it. One cannot just think of a way around the
problem&#151;a work-around. One must first consider whether the
barrier should be removed. Only if that was unreasonable could one fall
back on going around it.</div>
<a name="09061873000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would omit paragraphs (3)(a) and (3)(b) of the schedule, replacing them
with four new sub-paragraphs. The first is on whether the feature can
be removed; the second is on whether it can be altered; the third is
about providing a reasonable means of avoiding it; the last is about
reasonable methods of providing the service or exercising the function
in a different way. However, that order must be followed, so that one
first thinks about making it as easy as possible. The amendment would
provide a clearer and more systematic approach for service providers,
which would be an improvement. Will the Minister say how that compares
with the Bill, which is effectively different from the
DDA?</div><a name="09061873000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will forgive me for speaking at such length on
these wide-ranging amendments. I look forward to hearing the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments.</div>
<a name="09061873000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000242"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Benton.</div>
<a name="09061873000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
speak to amendments 154, 155 and 234, tabled by me and my hon. Friend
the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean made some interesting points, and I shall listen carefully to the
Solicitor-General&#146;s response. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div></div><a name="09061873000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment 154, we seek clarification from the Minister. The amendment
would emphasise that duty holders must not only make reasonable
adjustments, but that the asymmetry applied to those with disabilities
under discrimination law must be preserved, so that optimum reasonable
adjustments are made that are inclusive and a long-term solution,
rather than just a temporary one. An example of the latter would be if
a disabled customer wanted to enter a bank that had steps but no ramp,
and the bank&#146;s reasonable adjustment was to put up a doorbell
allowing the customer to ring for someone to get the wheelchair up the
steps. In our view, the optimum reasonable adjustment would be for the
bank to build a ramp to facilitate the same
service.</div>
<a name="09061873000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000243"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): In no sense do I wish to
subvert the substance of what the hon. Lady says, as I agree that it is
important that service providers should make the best possible
provision. Indeed, it is often in their own interests. Nevertheless,
does she not think that in legal terms it is slightly quaint to impose
a double duty&#151;to be both reasonable and optimal? One can meet
one without the other. I believe that she is hoping for people to meet
the optimum test. In that case, we need to change the law and should
say so.</div>
<a name="09061873000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000244"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. That may be a
helpful intervention, as I am not a legal expert. I am probing the
Minister on which is the best wording to arrive at an optimum solution
that maintains the asymmetry for people with
disabilities.</div><a name="09061873000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000245"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Following on from the
previous intervention, many people would consider it quite unreasonable
just to put a bell in and expect that to be the answer. It might not be
optimal, but we are trying to achieve the reasonable, and a bell seems
absolutely
minimal.</div><a name="09061873000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000246"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> That may or may not be the case. It would
have to be argued in law, but the purpose of the amendment is to try to
ensure that the reasonable adjustment is not simply cosmetic, but
affords equal access or access that is as near to equal as possible. In
particular, adjustments must be made to secure equal participation in
society. It is critical to disabled people that the duty is not diluted
in any way so as to reduce that participation. We should not be happy
with a minimum or a rudimentary gesture towards adjustment, and that is
what the amendment says. I am more than happy for the Minister to
adjust the wording if she thinks that I am making a point that is worth
responding
to.</div><a name="09061873000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Equality and Human Rights Commission supports the amendment. It
welcomes the introduction of the single substantial disadvantage
trigger, but it is concerned that the duty is constructed so that its
primary focus is avoiding disadvantage, rather than removing barriers
that prevent disabled people&#146;s full participation. The amendment
would have the twin benefits of consistency and clarity of approach and
would make it clear in the Bill that, for example, a service should,
wherever possible, be provided to a disabled person in the same way as
for a non-disabled person, and that might, could and sometimes should
deliver asymmetric effort.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div><a name="09061873000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 155
relates to the comparison by reference to circumstances, in relation to
reasonable adjustment. We want to remove the like-for-like comparator.
I shall give an example. We want to make it explicit&#151;there were
comments from the Conservatives along these lines&#151;that one
should compare a blind person with a guide dog going into a restaurant
with a seeing person who has no dog. The defence is not, &#147;We do
not allow dogs.&#148; The comparison is with someone who is sighted,
and a reasonable adjustment should be made. Therefore, there can be a
material difference between the circumstances, because again we come
back to the asymmetric nature of the protected
characteristic.</div><a name="09061873000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
234 relates to clause 195, page 138, line 44, which deals
with the regulations that apply to the provision. They are extremely
important regulations that deal with what is probably one of the most
fundamental real-world effects or changes that will enable people with
disabilities to get something that they need changed for the better.
However, that has been left out of the list of orders and regulations
in subsection (5), which require the affirmative procedure. Should
there be a change to the regulations, it is vital that that they are
subject the affirmative procedure; there should be debate and the
measure should go before both Houses. I shall be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s response to those
points.</div><a name="09061873000044"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000247"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to set out our response on these matters. The following is
a good point for me to make at the outset. Various parties on the
Committee may say that a particular provision is supported by x body
and another by y body. I am not suggesting for one moment that that is
not the case, but on many such occasions that body, rather than
asserting that there is something wrong with what we are doing, wants
to probe why we are doing something differently. We all need to put
assertions that the EHRC supports this or that provision in that
context. Of course, I am glad to seize the opportunity to discuss such
issues, because they are probably cases in point. The important thing
is to understand why we want to proceed, rather than necessarily to
find that there is something wrong with how we want to
proceed.</div><a name="09061873000211"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09061873000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measures deal with the duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled
people, which is obviously unique to the provisions of disability
discrimination legislation and a cornerstone of the protection that the
Bill provides. We need to ensure that the new provisions work, so it is
good to look at whether there are better ways to proceed, although we
are pretty satisfied that we have things right.</div>
<a name="09061873000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
170, 171 and 173 would remove the comparator entirely from clause 19.
The reasonable adjustment duty is triggered when the disabled person
is</div> <a name="09061873000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
a substantial disadvantage... in comparison with persons who are
not
disabled&#148;.</div><a name="09061873000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
substantial disadvantage is a disadvantage that is more than minor or
trivial.</div>
<a name="09061873000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
worth saying at this stage that the test of substantial disadvantage is
a significant clarification. It introduces better consistency to our
approach and is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>lighter test for a disabled person to discharge than what preceded it.
The hon. Member for Forest of Dean mentioned the trigger for services
provision in the DDA, and there are two thresholds&#151;that the use
of services is impossible or unreasonably difficult without the
reasonable adjustment. Clearly, &#147;impossible&#148; and
&#147;unreasonably difficult&#148; are much higher tests for a
disabled person to pass than &#147;substantial disadvantage&#148;.
The test is now also one single test, so that is definite
progress.</div><a name="09061873000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
employment provisions in the DDA contain a comparator like that in the
Bill. We have no evidence that the use of a comparator in that context
has led to any difficulty, and nobody has cited such evidence here. To
put things pretty straightforwardly, having a substantial disadvantage
test, which is good, raises the question, &#147;Substantial
disadvantage in comparison to whom?&#148; We therefore need a
comparator to make sense of that steadier, more consistent provision.
That comparator has worked well in employment, and we think it will
work well in this case. Removing the comparison with people who are not
disabled would make it far more difficult to pinpoint when somebody had
been disadvantaged.</div>
<a name="09061873000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 172
would really alter the dynamics of how the reasonable adjustment duty
is designed to work. It would increase the circumstances in which the
service provider was required to make a reasonable adjustment by
providing an auxiliary aid or service&#151;that is in subsection
(5)&#151;because it would replace the substantial disadvantage
threshold with a reference to enabling or facilitating the use of a
service.</div><a name="09061873000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
we have to balance the rights of the disabled person and the other
party, but the amendment would have the significant disadvantage of
removing the consistent test of substantial disadvantage. It would also
unfavourably move the balance towards the service provider. We think
that substantial disadvantage is the right approach.</div>
<a name="09061873000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
evidence that we have is that the reasonable adjustment duty has
greatly increased disabled people&#146;s access to services over the
years, and we are widening its application in the way that I have
suggested. With respect, I therefore invite the hon. Member for Forest
of Dean not to press the
amendment.</div><a name="09061873000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
174 is about the anticipatory duty against the three reasonable
adjustment requirements in relation to education and services. This is
not straightforward, but it is none the less clear that if one casts an
eye over paragraph 2(2) of schedule 2 on services, and over the
education provisions in paragraph 4(1) of schedule 13, one sees that
the content of the amendment is already present in the Bill, so there
is no need for
it.</div><a name="09061873000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an earlier debate, amendment 154, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, was
called the optimising amendment. It would achieve the outcome that we
seek by means of a service provider making a reasonable adjustment. The
disabled person would have similar or equal access to a service, but
there are drawbacks in doing it that way. It would introduce another
comparator&#151;one level of service against another&#151;which is
over-complicated. The example of the bell, which prompted the
intervention from the hon. Member for Glasgow, East, is a case in which
it was found that that was not
sufficient.</div><a name="09061873000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000248"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> A point that has troubled me a little in the
past, which might be behind the intervention on the bell, although I
cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean in this
matter, is whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>there is a frequency test. If that happens once a year, it is clearly
very different from something that happens with one bank customer per
day. Is that something on which the legislation will be
sensitive?</div><a name="09061873000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000249"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is almost the point that I was
going to come on to. The adjustments have to be reasonable. I suppose
if there was only one occasion a year when something happened or it was
foreseeable that it would happen, it might not be reasonable to require
those adjustments and they might not be reasonable
adjustments.</div><a name="09061873000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was coming on to talk about reasonableness, though briefly. The hon.
Member for Hornsey and Wood Green expressed the concern that we might
be in danger of requiring merely cosmetic changes, which would not be
reasonable adjustments. They cannot be cosmetic; they have to be
reasonable. That is the point of the definition, so that danger is not
really present. The outcomes of the duty that she seeks are best
ensured by the provisions that we have drafted, and there will of
course be a code of practice and guidance
afterwards.</div><a name="09061873000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
155 seeks to remove the need to make a comparison with a non-disabled
person, but it would not achieve that. Where provision or practice puts
someone at a substantial disadvantage compared with a non-disabled
person, clause 19(3) requires that reasonable steps must be taken to
avoid it. We have the comparator and that is the right approach.
Otherwise, how would an employer or service provider judge whether they
were putting disabled people at a substantial disadvantage? Again, we
need to ask the question,
&#147;Who?&#148;</div><a name="09061873000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
make the comparison work, we must compare like with like. As clause 22
sets out, that means comparing a disabled person with someone whose
circumstances are not materially different. Clause 22 makes it clear
that the comparator has to be like for like. It works well in clause 22
and the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="09061873000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
176 would bring the language of the DDA into the Bill where a physical
feature puts a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage. We heard
evidence in Committee that the absence of a reference to removing the
feature as an option is being interpreted as weakening the provision,
but that is not the intention and we do not think it is the case. The
emphasis is on taking reasonable steps to avoid the disadvantage, which
might require removal. If that is at the root of the thinking here, it
is not a danger that needs further
consideration.</div><a name="09061873000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exemplifying
how the duty might be delivered in different circumstances, which is
partly what the amendment proposes to capture, is best done in
practice. Clause 19 is essential to protect the disabled. Having
outlined how we see it working, I respectfully say that we have it
balanced, we have it right, and we have improved and simplified the
law, particularly the
tests.</div><a name="09061873000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
234 relates to the regulation-making power in clause 21, which carries
forward DDA section 21 powers, which have been exercised a
number of times&#151;for instance, when we extended to service
providers the duty to make reasonable adjustments. Most recently, they
have been used to make the Disability Discrimination (Transport
Vehicles) Regulations 2005, which relate to the duties of transport
service providers to make reasonable adjustments. There are all sorts
of examples of the powers having been used beneficially.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div><a name="09061873000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations tend to be a bit esoteric and technical, because they
involve meeting new developments to ensure rights, so I do not think
for one moment that Parliament ought to spend its time on them. It is
best that the changes are in regulatory power. It is correct that the
regulations use the negative procedure, but if we introduce regulations
that might change schedules in the Bill&#151;under clause 21(3), for
example, not this one&#151;they will use the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="09061873000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
such regulations will be affirmative where they can change legislation
and negative where they deal with technical, esoteric powers that, due
to their nature, we do not feel merit more parliamentary time. There is
absolutely no intention to usurp power; we just think that that is a
convenient location at the right level for subsidiary
legislation.</div><a name="09061873000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that is comprehensive and that I have persuaded hon. Members
that the clauses work well as they are and the amendments are not
necessary.</div><a name="09061873000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000250"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I thank the Minister for that and I should say at
the outset that I agree with her. When I expressed the concerns
supported by the DCC, it was very much because the DCC wants to
establish them. I was not intending to set up any kind of contest or to
pray in aid lots of people on my side.</div>
<a name="09061873000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
made a good point about the comparator test being in the employment
provisions and the fact that that has not led to any issues. I know
that the Government are keen to avoid nervousness, but the DCC is
concerned simply by the change of goods and services from the DDA to
the Equality Bill. I know that Ministers want to make absolutely
certain that there is no regression, to use a phrase that we have been
using throughout Committee proceedings, and no weakening. She made that
point
clear.</div><a name="09061873000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that concerns about the comparator have been particularly highlighted
by the Malcolm case, that clause 14 contains provisions to deal with it
and that the Minister said during a previous sitting that she is
working with the DCC and hopes to introduce changes to the wording of
clause 14 to deal with some of the concerns on Report, I think that we
can avoid the comparator&#146;s creating a rerun of the Malcolm
case.</div>
<a name="09061873000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
176, the Minister spoke about the Government&#146;s intentions in
making it clear to service providers what they should be doing to
remove physical difficulties. As long as guidance from Ministers and
the EHRC makes it clear that the first thought should be removing the
problem, not just looking for a quick work-around, that can be dealt
with in guidance. She addressed that concern. Given all those
reassurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061873000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="09061873000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the legal
equalisation of civil partnership and marriage, and where there is good

is
that</div><a name="09061873000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

that&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061873000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the implication is that this was a result of that
fact&#151;</div><a name="09061873000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many
Christian leaders supported the passage of that Act, including in
particular eight out of the ten Bishops voting in the crucial final
decision on the then Bill in the Lords, and indeed a former
Archbishop.&#148;</div><a name="09061873000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was because we have clerics in our Parliament as of right.</div>
<a name="09061873000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern is
expressed in the letter and this is the nub of
it:</div><a name="09061873000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be bizarre if the Bill led to those contracting civil
partnerships (or indeed marriage) being themselves treated adversely by
comparison with those who had chosen not to contract these
relationships. Indeed, this would negate the whole&#151;and
welcome&#151;purpose of including them in the protected categories at
all.&#148;</div><a name="09061873000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the letter is making the point, although I find it
difficult to sustain this argument, that sexual orientation may be a
distraction from the main reason for discrimination. I hope I have
given the Minister a chance at least to understand the concerns that
have been put to me, even if I do not necessarily recognise them as
justified.</div><a name="09061873000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000252"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have partially grasped the concerns.
Explanatory note 96 puts pretty simply the point of subsection (3),
which is that a civil partner who is treated less favourably than a
married person in similar circumstances is being discriminated against
because of sexual orientation. As to the issue about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>definition of civil partnership and its not necessarily having to be
sexual, I suppose that that is just a nod&#151;perhaps an important
nod, to some people&#151;in the direction of the fact that, in law,
for a marriage not to be void it must have been consummated. There is
no such requirement in a civil partnership. That may be where the
leeway arose, and it might not be unhelpful leeway to have available,
for several
reasons.</div><a name="09061873000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suppose that I should say that, for the purpose of discrimination law,
marriage and civil partnership are treated the same, so any
discrimination between the partner in one of those as opposed to the
other will be discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I hope
that that is comprehensive
enough.</div><a name="09061873000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000255"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I think that amendment 232 to clause 27 is
consequential on the amendments that I and my hon. Friend the Member
for Hornsey and Wood Green have tabled. I am happy to deal with it now
rather than on clause 27, if that is convenient, although obviously you
would need to agree to that, Mr. Benton. However, if I deal
with it appropriately now, I will not need to speak to it
later.</div><a name="09061873000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a threefold purpose to my amendments. The first is to extend the
protection from harassment in law to captive populations&#151;people
who cannot escape harassment, and vulnerable people in particular. That
could include people in the education system&#151;pupils at school,
for example&#151;or users of public services who, given the nature of
those services, might be vulnerable. They might rely on those public
services and they should not have to suffer harassment while accessing
them.</div>
<a name="09061873000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides protection from harassment to all the strands except two; I
will come to that during the clause stand part debate. However, other
parts of the Bill specifically exclude discrimination on the grounds of
sexual orientation, religion and belief, and gender
reassignment&#151;to use the Government&#146;s term&#151;in
certain areas.</div>
<a name="09061873000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000256"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For the information of the Committee, will the
hon. Gentleman clarify whether the definition of public services that
he has in mind regarding captive audiences and groups includes
prisoners? There are concerns about harassment and discrimination among
certain groups of sensitive
prisoners.</div><a name="09061873000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000257"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Indeed. Clearly, imprisoning people as part of the
criminal justice system is a public service. It is a public function,
even if it is delivered by the private sector under contract. There has
never been any argument about that and human rights laws apply. If we
are identifying a distinction between the general delivery of services
and public services, as I urge the Committee to do, and saying that
there should be greater protection where people are receiving public
services, that point applies.</div>
<a name="09061873000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us deal
first with education. In education, there is no protection from
harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender reassignment
and religion or belief. I understand that in respect of gender
reassignment that exclusion exists only in education. There is
protection from harassment on the grounds of gender reassignment in the
provision of services, but not in education. It is amazing that
education should be singled out as the one place where young people,
who are likely to be in education, are not protected against harassment
on the grounds of gender reassignment as defined in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061873000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Harassment
in those circumstances means violating the dignity of someone on the
grounds of gender reassignment. That might involve someone who is on
the journey towards gender reassignment, for example, or even before
that, if the House accepts the definition of gender reassignment
proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Under my amendment, harassment would
also include the creation of
an</div><a name="09061873000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for
B.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div><a name="09061873000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see how it can
be considered acceptable for any school to be allowed to get away with
that happening to a vulnerable pupil.</div>
<a name="09061873000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that gross cases of harassment might be dealt with by direct
discrimination legislation, but we need a protection that applies to
cases that fall short of that, just as other strands are protected. It
is not good enough to say that it is okay because if someone is picked
on in a specific way by a teacher, for example, that passes the
threshold for direct discrimination. On that basis, why have any
harassment provisions in schools when direct discrimination provisions
already apply in the worst
cases?</div><a name="09061873000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
sexual orientation, the evidence that harassment exists in schools is
even stronger. That is why the omission of some form of protection
concerning sexual orientation is a concern. I accept that issue has
been controversial for a while, and I have not always argued as
strongly as I do now that we need protection on the grounds of sexual
orientation in harassment provisions generally. Indeed, my party and I
were supportive when the sexual orientation regulations provided not to
do that&#151;when such matters were dealt with by
regulation.</div><a name="09061873000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of that was, first, a concern that free speech might be inhibited in
the general provision of services and, secondly, that primary
legislation was needed to delve into whether the definition of
harassment would be so strict that it fell on the wrong the side of the
balance, restricting freedom of speech&#151;chilling freedom of
speech&#151;and making some speech unlawful, which would have been
disproportionate to what we wanted  to
do.</div><a name="09061873000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case has been made that there is a problem in respect of the amount of
homophobic bullying that is known to take place in schools. Many
schools are failing even to develop policies specific to homophobic
bullying. In other words, they are not doing what they need to do to
start to tackle the problem. It is unacceptable in such circumstances
for there to be no legal protection against harassment on the grounds
of sexual orientation. That would focus the minds of governing bodies
of schools, whether faith or other schools, on the fact that they have
a legal obligation to protect vulnerable pupils and that the creation
of an environment that is intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating
or offensive is not
acceptable.</div><a name="09061873000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Government agree that such a thing is not acceptable.
The religious witnesses at the oral evidence sessions also agreed that
they would not want to see it, but for some reason they thought that
the law should not apply. That is an unsustainable position. If the
problem is serious enough to say that it should not happen and there is
evidence that it does happen&#151;there is no doubt about
that&#151;there is no reason to provide a legal exclusion on such
grounds.</div><a name="09061873000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Government do not share the view that such a thing is
unacceptable but that it does not have to be provided for in law. In
respect of sexual orientation protection in schools, we believe that
the case is at its
strongest.</div><a name="09061873000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arguably,
there ought to be protection from harassment on the grounds of sexual
orientation in the delivery of public services. It seems wrong that
people receiving public services, which are often their
right&#151;there is sometimes only one provider
available&#151;should have to suffer harassment without recourse to
law. The providers, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>because there is no legal obligation, do not prioritise the need to
educate their work force that harassment ought not to take place,
however strong the views about the morality of sexual orientation or
other
matters.</div><a name="09061873000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not good enough to rely on the argument that there may be a variety
of service providers available. In the case of discrimination on the
grounds of race, we did not argue that one was entitled to have a
whites-only bus on the basis that there was a bus with mixed passengers
following just behind and that that was all right for the lady in the
United States who objected. The Government quite rightly used that
argument&#151;I remember Ministers doing so, and I applauded
them&#151;when people sought an exemption from the injunction not to
discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation when providing
adoption services to lesbian and gay people. Catholic adoption agencies
argued, for example, that there would be other providers that lesbian
and gay parents could go to. That is not an acceptable way to deal with
unjustified discrimination, saying, &#147;Oh, we can, because there
is another organisation down the road.&#148; Sometimes a school or a
service provider is the only service provider in the village&#151;to
paraphrase a comedian in relation to sexual orientation. Therefore,
people in receipt of public services have a right not to be
harassed.</div><a name="09061873000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
those areas there is a clear argument for having the protection. The
question then moves on&#151;in this matter, I shall deal with the
amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East&#151;to the conjunctive versus the disjunctive version of clause
24(2). The  wording is that the &#147;purpose or
effect&#148; referred to in subsection
(1)</div><a name="09061873000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is...
violating B&#146;s dignity, or... creating an intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for
B.&#148;</div><a name="09061873000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original directive uses not the disjunctive &#147;or&#148;, but the
conjunctive &#147;and&#148;. The hon. Gentleman highlights that in
his amendment, but it would be difficult to change that protection,
which is clearly a higher protection, because it is easier to qualify
for an either/or definition than to satisfy both limbs. The principle
of regression probably means that it is not possible for us to go back
and undo protection against harassment on existing
grounds.</div><a name="09061873000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09061873000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
the merits of that argument, my proposal would not do that, but I
recognise that there is an argument for a slightly narrower definition
which is based on the need to have respect for freedom of speech and
the idea that too low a threshold for harassment claims might intrude
on freedom of expression. Clearly, the conjunctive version will be
narrower, because behaviour would have to have the purpose or effect of
violating the dignity of someone to whom it was directed and creating
an environment that was</div>
<a name="09061873000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061873000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposal
for harassment protection on the grounds of sexual orientation and
gender reassignment uses that version. People will argue that it is a
lesser protection than currently. They might argue that a one-off
occurrence of harassment is difficult to fulfil the limb, which would
be required with an &#147;and&#148;, that it creates an
environment&#151;it is hard to create an environment with a one-off
action. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>If the one-off action were sufficiently serious, it might well be caught
by provisions on direct discrimination; if it were not so serious, it
would be reasonable to take a &#147;two or three strikes and
you&#146;re out&#148; approach, as currently exists in harassment
law regarding the actions of third parties for which employers have
some responsibility. That is a reasonable balance.</div>
<a name="09061873000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I looked
carefully at whether creating an offensive environment&#151;that is
the easiest of the environments to create&#151;on the ground of
sexual orientation even when that is not intended goes too far, but I
cannot think of any scenario, even in the teaching of religious
education, in which it is acceptable to create an offensive
environment. There is no need to do so. If a teacher of religious
education needs to say that some religions believe that homosexuality
is sinful or worse, they can do so, but that does not create an
offensive environment unless they actually say, &#147;Homosexuality
is sinful.&#148; It is not appropriate for school teachers to tell
people that their lawful behaviour or that of their parents is sinful
and stands to be condemned. Describing what other people think would
not fulfil those grounds, but if people feel that it would create too
great a constraint, we would be willing to consider the matter, because
it is important to have some protection.</div>
<a name="09061873000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
provisions apply in principle to religion and belief: there needs to be
protection for people against harassment on the grounds of their
religion or belief in schools or when they are in receipt of public
services. Exactly the same arguments that I made in respect of sexual
orientation apply. Other forms of the law&#151;there is cross-party
support for this&#151;recognise that it is difficult to avoid causing
offence on the ground of religion based on the religious sensitivities
of B. Often, one religion&#146;s theology is offensive to
another&#146;s by definition. I make no criticism of that because it
is the way of such things. It is probably also true of politics,
although that is not covered. It is therefore reasonable to have a
significantly narrower definition of harassment to ensure that the
usual conduct of religious behaviour is not caught.</div>
<a name="09061873000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
therefore reasonable to argue that there should be protection from
harassment on the grounds of religion and belief on a conjunctive
definition that omits the term &#147;offensive&#148; with regard to
environment. No matter how sensitive or thin-skinned someone
is&#151;I do not use that term pejoratively&#151;I do not believe
that it is appropriate in education and in the delivery of public
services to create an</div>
<a name="09061873000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile,
degrading...or...humiliating...environment&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061873000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">So even if someone does
not find something such as a poster offensive, I do not see how we can
defend not outlawing the creation of an environment with the
characteristics I just described. Therefore, the amendments that stand
in my name, which are my best attempt to construct such an argument in
the frame of an amendment, rather than a new clause, seek to strike the
right balance between extending protection and preserving free
expression.</div>
<a name="09061873000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
read into the record the examples of homophobic bullying that exist in
schools, sent from organisations such as Schools Out, Stonewall and
OutRage!. However, I am sure that hon. Members are aware of them, and
do not need me to do that here. None the less, I want to pay tribute to
those organisations for their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>long-standing work, in partnership with parliamentarians of all parties
in this House over many years, to highlight the
problems.</div><a name="09061873000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the clause stand part, the issue with the test in subsection (3) is
interesting. The question is whether it is sufficiently objective for
the purposes of the existing protection, and whether it is sufficiently
objective to provide enough protection for the freedom of expression
and behaviour, where we seek, as I do, to extend protection from
harassment to new grounds. I will be grateful&#151;this is the reason
I am flagging it up&#151;if the Minister gives us the benefit of her
views, based on her experience and insight, regarding how objective she
believes the test
is.</div><a name="09061873000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording of the subsection
is:</div><a name="09061873000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
deciding whether conduct has that
effect,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061873000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
effect that I have described, in the currently disjunctive definition
in subsection
(2)&#151;</div><a name="09061873000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;each
of the following must be taken into
account&#151;</div><a name="09061873000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the perception of
B;</div><a name="09061873000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the other circumstances of the
case;</div><a name="09061873000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have that
effect.&#148;</div><a name="09061873000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether paragraph (c) is a stand-alone issue for the courts
to decide, or whether it still relates to the perception of B. It is
important not to argue that it is regression, but I hope that the
Government will agree with the following: separating out the
perceptions of B and A and seeing whether it is reasonable for the
conduct to have that effect would create a more objective test, so that
someone outside may ask, &#147;Is it reasonable that that behaviour
creates the environment without having as much reliance on the
perception of B as would exist if that was all in the same
paragraph?&#148;. In other words, it asks whether it is reasonable
for the conduct to have that effect by taking into account the
perception of B and all the circumstances, or whether that is the case
by taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including, in
particular, the perception of B. It strikes me that that is a slightly
more objective test. I hope that that is the case, because there needs
to be some objectivity
here.</div><a name="09061873000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know what we are trying to get at. Pictures of pin-ups in workplaces
clearly create the environment that is talked about, and indeed may
violate the dignity of a woman. It is not a question of subjective
perception or the need to be particularly sensitive, even if there were
a woman in the workplace who did not find that offensive&#151;that is
a reasonable, objective test to be made. I am not arguing that that is
regressive in any way, but I hope the Minister will agree that it
clarifies that the test of reasonableness does not relate to the
perception of B, but is, in a sense, a stand-alone
issue.</div><a name="09061873000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point that I want to raise on clause stand part is the exclusion
of marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity from the list
of protected characteristics. The missing characteristics raise the
question why there is no coverage at all, even in existing protected
environments such as the workplace, where we know this sort of
harassment currently exists. I believe that the Minister has been asked
about the matter by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, among others.
It would be useful if she could explain why the list of protected
characteristics in subsection (5) does not extend to those two
areas.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div><a name="09061873000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without giving
examples of the sort of mischief that I am trying to cover, I hope that
I have made a very strong case for the extension of harassment
protection on the grounds of sexual orientation to schools and the
provision of public services, on the grounds of gender reassignment to
schools and on religious grounds, on a narrower definition, to
schooling and provision of public services. This is a controversial
matter. After the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2006, which included a harassment provision, were
introduced by the Government, as a take-it-or-leave-it measure, they
were challenged in judicial review in Northern Ireland. The court
rightly upheld the regulations in general, and the only part that did
not survive the challenge&#151;rightly so, in my view&#151;was the
harassment provision. That was based mainly on a lack of consultation,
but the judge also referred to concerns by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights.</div>
<a name="09061873000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
mean, however, that there should never be any protection from
harassment. The Government did not get it quite right in the 2006
regulations, and were wise not to put them in the Great Britain
regulations, because by their nature they were unamendable. The Bill
gives us an opportunity to deal with this matter in a considered way,
and I hope that the Government will view my probing amendment&#151;it
would not be appropriate to divide on it&#151;as a way in which to
open this debate, so that we can hear either the Government&#146;s
justification or their willingness to consider the matter
further.</div><a name="09061873000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000258"></a><b class="B">Emily
Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): In the

the gay and lesbian community is now on the verge of absolute equality

most important areas on which people quite rightly focus is the way in
which young gay and lesbian people are treated at school. The extent of
homophobic bullying is frightening, and anything that we can do to
stamp it out is incredibly important. I also seek clarification from my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000259"></a>John
Mason:</b> I shall speak, in particular, to amendment 38,
although I shall refer to comments made already. Once again, I am
speaking in a personal capacity, rather than on behalf of my
party.</div>
<a name="09061873000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendment 38 primarily to probe why the definition of harassment
adopted in the UK is wider than that found in the relevant EU
directive. The test for harassment in the Bill, and in previous
legislation, including the 2003 employment equality regulations, has
two alternative limbs: the unwanted conduct has the &#147;purpose or
effect&#148; of violating the victim&#146;s dignity or
of</div><a name="09061873000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;creating
an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive
environment&#148;</div>
<a name="09061873000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
him.</div><a name="09061873000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition first appeared in the Employment Equality (Sexual
Orientation) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality
(Religion or Belief) 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>Regulations 2003. Those regulations implemented EU directive 2000/78/EC.
Article 2.3 of that directive defines harassment in these
terms:</div><a name="09061873000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Harassment
shall be deemed to be a form of discrimination within the meaning of
paragraph 1, when unwanted conduct related to any of the grounds ...
takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a
person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating
or offensive environment. In this context, the concept of harassment
may be defined in accordance with the national laws and practice of the
Member
States.&#148;</div><a name="09061873000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a difference here. Instead of violating dignity or creating a
hostile environment being alternatives, in the directive they are
cumulative. To prove harassment under the EU definition, it must be
shown that the conduct violated dignity and created an offensive
environment, which is clearly a higher
test.</div>
<a name="09061873000214"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061873000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not claim to be an expert in this area, but I am curious about
whether the Solicitor-General can explain why, in implementing the 2000
directive, the wording was altered in this important way. It is
important, because it is obviously easier to prove harassment under the
UK test than under the EU test. For example, if I cannot persuade an
employment tribunal that someone violated my dignity, I might still be
able to persuade it that the person created an offensive environment.
In other words, under the UK test I get two bites at the cherry,
whereas the EU test would require me to prove not one but both limbs
before my claim would
succeed.</div><a name="09061873000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not underestimate the importance of tackling harassment in the
workplace or anywhere else. On Tuesday, we considered the Ladele case,
in which it was clear that the Christian woman involved was poorly
treated by her employers and, at the first instance, the tribunal made
a finding of
harassment.</div><a name="09061873000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000260"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> That person was a registrar in my
constituency, where a large number of gay weddings, as we call them,
take place. Every day, many gay couples leave the town hall, finally
having been allowed to have some sort of union. This woman decided
that, despite the background in my constituency, her religious beliefs
were more important than those of the people whom it was her job to
marry, by registering their union. She put that above her employment
obligations and, quite rightly, her case was turned down on
appeal&#151;and so it should have been, because she was employed to
do a job and she should have just done it. If she did not like it, she
should have got another job.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000261"></a>John
Mason:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her heartfelt
intervention, but is there not room in a diverse
community&#151;especially one like her constituency&#151;to allow a
place both for gay marriages and for people&#146;s individual
consciences? Can we not have a society where both those things live
together?</div><a name="09061873000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000262"></a><b class="B">Ms
Diane Abbott</b> (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) (Lab): I
do not want to prolong this argument, but the hon. Gentleman has asked
the Committee a question and I should like to answer it. I am familiar
with the part of London where this took place and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>familiar with the community from which that registrar came. I am clear
that some people use their religion as a vehicle for cultural bigotry,
clearly and simply. Precisely because I know those communities well, it
is important to draw a line and say, &#147;You cannot use your
religion to allow your bigotry to affect how you carry out your duty to
the public.&#148; If we do not draw the line, bigotry will encroach
ever more on the delivery of public services. Parliament has to take a
stand against
that.</div><a name="09061873000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000263"></a>John
Mason:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her heartfelt
intervention. We are clearly dealing with a difficult area. If one
thing comes out of this Committee&#146;s consideration of the Bill, I
hope it is that the Government will realise that we are in a difficult
area. That does not mean that we should not talk about this matter, but
the Government need to be wary of trying to restrict religious belief
and practice too much.</div>
<a name="09061873000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I totally
agree that we should come down on bigotry, but the problem is defining
it, because one person&#146;s bigotry is another person&#146;s
belief. Sadly, it appears that, in society, and perhaps in this
Committee as well, it is okay to call religious people bigoted, but it
is not okay to call other people
bigoted.</div><a name="09061873000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061873000264"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman represents the Scottish National party on this Committee and
I am beginning to wonder when we will get the SNP view of the
situation. He implies that we should be weaker and should comply with
the EU situation, rather than have stronger provision for this country.
Why is he suggesting
that?</div><a name="09061873000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000265"></a>John
Mason:</b> I am suggesting that the EU has set a reasonable
standard. There is a danger that we will either catch out too few or
too many people under the provisions on harassment. It is for the
Government, this Committee and the wider House to judge and decide
where they want that line to be. All I am trying to do is to point out
that there are two different standards, and some people feel that they
are being too easily caught out on the grounds of
harassment.</div><a name="09061873000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the previous point, can we allow a person any room at all for
conscience? We do so on the issue of abortion. It is argued that the
registrar should not have the job if she will not perform all the
functions of her organisation, but by the same logic, every nurse and
doctor in this country must carry out abortions. However, we have
decided to allow a bit of freedom for conscience. It seems to me that
we and the authority are surely big enough to do the same in this
case.</div><a name="09061873000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000266"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I have several points to make, although we are
straying somewhat off the topic of harassment. First, that exemption,
which I support, does not permit discriminatory behaviour. It involves
provision of a service and falls short of discrimination, although some
people might feel that they must go further. It does not involve
picking on people; it involves a
procedure.</div><a name="09061873000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
on the Ladele case, it is only fair to say that what she wanted to do
was discriminate, which is why the employment tribunal found against
her. It is also right to say that the Employment Appeal Tribunal did
not uphold the findings of harassment. It needs to be recognised that
not every sentence and every letter was written as well as it might
have been, but in the end, the council was cleared of that charge. That
is important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div><a name="09061873000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it is
not illegal to be bigoted on any grounds, because that is included in
freedom of belief, but what we try to do is constrain that when it
affects other people, particularly in the workplace. That is why I
think that there is a particular responsibility to protect people from
being discriminated against in the workplace. One does not need to
discuss whether it is cultural bigotry or not&#151;I am sure that the
beliefs are sincerely held&#151;but there must be some protection for
the victims of that belief, if I can put it that
way.</div><a name="09061873000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000267"></a>John
Mason:</b> Yes, and I see Ladele as the victim in that
situation. She might not be the only victim, but I certainly see her as
one.</div><a name="09061873000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000268"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree at least that
the major test in terms of the service users&#151;in that case, the
gay couple who wished to recognise and celebrate their relationship in
a civil partnership&#151;is whether they are able to use the service?
If the registrar is the only registrar in a local authority area and
such a couple are unable to discharge their wishes because there is no
other person who can fulfil them, that perhaps makes the case
significantly different from whatever reservations of conscience an
individual registrar might
have.</div><a name="09061873000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000269"></a>John
Mason:</b> As I see it, a health service must provide
abortions and a local authority must provide registration of civil
partnerships. The organisation must provide all those services, but I
do not see that it automatically follows that every individual in that
organisation must provide every
service.</div><a name="09061873000149"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000272"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> This is a difficult area, and we are trying
to get the balance right, but as discrimination law has advanced so far
as to bring into play factors that did not exist before, it is
important that we get it right. That extends to a whole range of
issues. There might be people who do not wish to police a gay march, or
firemen who will not attend certain incidents. On the execution of
public duty, it is important that we make it clear here and now that
carrying out public services cannot be a matter of conscience in the
way that the hon. Gentleman might wish. That is not signalling against
a genuinely held conviction or people&#146;s conscience; it is a
necessity in the modern age. People with such convictions might
ultimately make different choices about their
careers.</div><a name="09061873000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000273"></a>John
Mason:</b><b class="B"> </b>The logical extension of that is that anyone
with a conscience on certain issues, whether religious or otherwise,
will be squeezed out of public services. Anyone with a serious problem
of conscience will no longer be able to work at a state school or a
public hospital. Surely we want a more diverse and inclusive society
than that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000274"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will accept the
argument in these terms: a registrar&#146;s duty is to ratify a
contract that is justified in law passed by Parliament. Parliament
passed a law allowing civil union between gay couples, so it is her job
to ratify that contract. If she does not like the law, she has to get
another job&#151;she has to move out and do something
else.</div>
<a name="09061873000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000275"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies, let me
say that we are in danger&#151;we are not quite there yet&#151;of
discussing the merits of the case concerning the registrar, which is
not part of the amendment. It is fair enough to use examples, and I
have no objection to that, but I do not want the debate to be any more
personalised. We are moving in that direction&#151;I can sense it
coming&#151;so I want to add a cautionary note that we must not
personalise these issues by referring to a specific case. We should
keep to the merits or demerits of amendment
38.</div>
<a name="09061873000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000276"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you very much for that guidance,
Mr. Benton.</div>
<a name="09061873000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to
finish the point. I take the point about the legal duty, but I see the
legal duty to provide the service as being primarily on the local
authority. We will touch on schools later, and there are similar facets
there. As I see it, however, every individual in the authority does not
necessarily have to carry out every duty, and that is clearly the case,
because some people do one job, while others do another job. If the
authority had only one registrar, there would be more of a
problem&#151;sorry, I should not have mentioned the registrar.
However, if lots of people do the same job, it is possible for them not
to carry out every duty.</div>
<a name="09061873000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000277"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way, because there are a couple of important points. If the local
authority&#146;s charter says that its employees will not
discriminate on grounds of race, sexual orientation or whatever in the
delivery of services, the authority has to be able to live up to that
charter without employees saying that they want to opt out without any
come-back.</div>
<a name="09061873000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through the
hon. Gentleman, I would also like to say to the hon. Member for
Daventry, for whom I have huge respect and genuine affection, that it
is not acceptable to say that everything is all right as long as
someone else fulfils the duty. Someone may have sincerely held beliefs
that mixed-race marriage is wrong, and one could respect those beliefs
by saying, &#147;All right, you don&#146;t have to do the marriage,
because no one else has those views.&#148; However, it would still be
wrong for a public authority to give
credibility&#151;</div><a name="09061873000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000278"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div>
<a name="09061873000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000279"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am intervening on the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East, so the hon. Lady will have to intervene on him. It would still be
wrong for a public authority to give credibility to a prejudice,
because that would give it the green light. Even if some forms of
discrimination are sincerely held beliefs, we should not allow them to
be exercised.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000280"></a>John
Mason:</b> I must make some progress or I will get in trouble
with the Government Whip.</div>
<a name="09061873000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000281"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> If I undertake not to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman again, may I just make one last point? A high number of
marriages end in divorce, and a registrar might have firmly held
beliefs that someone should not enter into a second marriage after they
have been divorced. If they began to discriminate on that
basis&#151;even if they were one of five&#151;and other registrars
held that view, a large number of people in my constituency would be
unable to get married.</div>
<a name="09061873000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000282"></a>John
Mason:</b> Even most religious people would accept that
marriage is perfectly acceptable after a divorce, so that is a bit of a
red herring.</div>
<a name="09061873000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000283"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In the spirit of the last two interventions, will
the hon. Gentleman at least concede that, in a sense, we are not
pursuing absolutes in this matter, whatever people&#146;s consciences
are? There will be some quite proper reservations about the employment
in a public job of persons who, for example, support a minority or
extremist party, and that is defensible in certain conditions. My
concern is that people should have the widest possible freedom to
exercise their conscience as long as, and to the extent to which, it is
consistent with the discharge of the public authority&#146;s duties
and its provision of public services. That is a difficult balance to
find, but it is not an absolute
one.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000284"></a>John
Mason:</b> The word &#147;balance&#148; is one that I
like. I hope that the Solicitor-General will take the points made on
board. This is an incredibly difficult area. I had better move
on.</div>
<a name="09061873000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
for asking the Solicitor-General to explain the position is the concern
in some circles that specific laws against harassment, especially if
they are widely drawn, may create a risk to free speech. I presume that
there is a risk that someone could claim that mere disagreement with
them over an issue related to a protected characteristic had created an
offensive environment or made them feel violated. However, those are
subjective terms.</div>
<a name="09061873000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The law on
harassment is controversial. In 2005, the Government considered
introducing harassment on the grounds of religion in the provision of
goods and services. Since then, they have undertaken a discrimination
law review and they concluded that the Bill should not introduce
harassment on the grounds of religion or sexual orientation in the
provision of goods and services. Indeed, clause 27(8) specifically
excludes those grounds. I assume that the Government saw that
introducing the right to sue for offending feelings while receiving
goods or services had the potential to unleash a wave of
litigation.</div>
<a name="09061873000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Harassment
has a more limited application in the provisions of goods and services,
but on employment it applies to all strands. One obviously has less
choice in the working environment than in the marketplace. For example,
if one does not like the atmosphere in one shop, one can go to another;
but it is much harder to switch if one does not like the atmosphere at
work. If we are to have a harassment law on all grounds for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>employment, and if we are to apply it also to the provision of goods and
services and some other grounds, we must be careful about the threshold
in order to prevent misuse. The definition of harassment is already set
about with limitations. The question is not whether we have
limitations, but what they should be. Why is it necessary for us to go
further than the
EU?</div><a name="09061873000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000285"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I intervene to deal with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point while he is still on his feet. He is right
that the EU test is narrower than ours. He said that our wider test, as
he characterises it, has been in our law since 2003, although we think
that it has been in our law since 2000. We would break the principle of
non-regression if we narrowed it to the EU test. Does he have an answer
other than that which is
prohibited?</div><a name="09061873000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000286"></a>John
Mason:</b> I raise these points for discussion. If it is
impossible to wind things back, I must accept it. However, I am
grateful for the clarification provided by the Solicitor-General,
although perhaps she is not aware of why, in 2000 or 2003, a different
definition was brought
in.</div><a name="09061873000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
and I hope briefly, I touch on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member
who represents Abingdon&#151;I wish to save time by not saying the
full name of his constituency, or will that upset the people of west
Oxfordshire? I wish to speak to amendments 230 and 231&#151;and
possibly 232 and 233, which are related. They seek to extend the
harassment provisions to cover religion and sexual orientation in the
provision of public services. I am naturally interested to see that the
definition uses the &#147;and&#148; formulation of my amendment
rather than the &#147;or&#148; formulation used by the Government.
However, given what I have said, I obviously oppose extending the Bill
to cover harassment on those grounds.</div>
<a name="09061873000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall touch
on some of what the hon. Gentleman said. He mentioned the question of
schools, and specifically mentioned homophobic bullying. I am sure that
we are unanimous in agreeing that such behaviour should not happen. I
know that schools&#151;both faith schools and other kinds&#151;are
desperately trying to tackle bullying of all kinds, and I fully support
them in that. I understand that faith schools in England and Scotland
want to teach, for example, that sex outside marriage is wrong; indeed,
that forms part of the ethos of such schools. However, we do not want
such a statement to be thought of as bullying. For example, in Glasgow
every child lives in the catchment areas of two schools, so every
family and every child can choose between a faith school and a secular
one.</div>
<a name="09061873000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000287"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> What, therefore, would happen to a young man
whose Catholic parents want him to go to a particular school, but who,
at the age of 13 or 14, decides that he is gay, and finds himself
bullied by teachers who tell him that there is something profoundly
wrong with him because he wants sex outside marriage?</div>
<a name="09061873000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000288"></a>John
Mason:</b> There is a difference between making a statement
such as, &#147;I believe it is wrong to have sex outside
marriage,&#148; and bullying. The two are not the same. I
hope&#151;I certainly have faith in Glasgow schools of all
descriptions&#151;that schools are attempting to tackle bullying at
all levels, but that is not to say that they accept all forms of
behaviour as just being okay.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div><a name="09061873000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000289"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman is saying that there are some
schools&#151;state schools, state-funded schools&#151;providing
that public service that want to teach that gay sex is always wrong.
They can cover it on the basis of sex outside marriage but, as the hon.
Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, that means that gay sex
is always wrong, always sinful and something to be condemned, to put it
mildly. I cannot believe that this Committee, this
House&#151;certainly this applies to my party&#151;and the
Government think that that is acceptable. A school must not do that. A
school can say that certain organisations or religions believe that,
but it has a terrible effect on young people who are gay, lesbian,
bisexual and so on.</div>
<a name="09061873000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The evidence,
which I have not read out, although I could, shows that the feeling
that one is being bullied and instances of bullying are a particular
problem in faith schools, precisely for the reasons that the hon.
Gentleman gives. It is not right for him to hide behind the argument
that their ethos says that sex outside marriage is wrong. That means
that being gay is always wrong if people express it sexually, which
every gay person is entitled to do within the
law.</div><a name="09061873000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000290"></a>John
Mason:</b> Our policy&#151;this is our party policy, for the
benefit of the hon. Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock&#151;is that
if sufficient parents want a particular type of school, be it
religious, non-religious or whatever, we would aim to provide that type
of school. It could be Catholic or we could be talking about other
Christian denominations. We have at least one Jewish school in Scotland
and we are looking at Muslim schools in Scotland as well. Those would
be schools run by the public
sector.</div><a name="09061873000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe in
diversity. If there is one thing that I am trying to get across in
Committee, it is the idea of diversity, of live and let live, of being
inclusive and of allowing different views. We do not have to have all
schools saying that marriage is unnecessary or not particularly a good
thing. We can have some  schools saying that marriage is a good
thing. We  can have other schools taking a more relaxed view
about the issue. Parents would have a certain amount of choice about
which one they wanted their child to go
to.</div><a name="09061873000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
take another example, is it unrealistic to imagine that someone could
walk into a parish church or faith school on polling day, cast their
vote and then claim to have been religiously harassed while in receipt
of public services because of the presence of a cross or
Bible  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>verses on the walls? The amendment is dabbling in dangerous territory,
and the Government have taken the wise course and left that
alone.</div><a name="09061873000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon seems to be treating religion
or belief less favourably than other characteristics. His harassment
test for sexual orientation and for gender reassignment in his proposed
new subsections (2A) and (2B) in amendment 231 is
an</div><a name="09061873000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading, humiliating or
offensive&#148;</div><a name="09061873000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">environment,
but for religion in subsection (2C), the test
is</div><a name="09061873000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intimidating,
hostile, degrading or
humiliating&#148;.</div><a name="09061873000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Offensive&#148;
has been left out. That seems a little
inconsistent.</div><a name="09061873000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000291"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I must take issue with the hon. Gentleman.
Actually, the amendment would provide protection for religions. He
gives the example of a cross or another religious symbol in a school
that is used on polling day. That should not be forced to be covered up
just because another public service is being delivered there. In fact,
I would find it hard to argue that it was offensive. That is why my
definition leaves out &#147;offensive&#148; from the idea of being
harassed on religious grounds&#151;to protect the religious freedom
of other people. In fact, the motivation is opposite to that which he
suggests.</div><a name="09061873000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061873000292"></a>John
Mason:</b> I can deal only with the words that the hon.
Gentleman uses, but I am happy to accept his reassurance about the
intention. He also used the term &#147;thin-skinned&#148;. I think
that he was perhaps referring to religious or similar people. The word
&#147;bigoted&#148; has already been used&#151;again aimed at
religious people. I find both difficult. If I was using those words
about other people, people would rightly be offended, but there we
go.</div><a name="09061873000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful that the Minister has said that she does not want to create
a hierarchy of rights. I hope that she will reject amendment 231 for
that reason. I do not agree with harassing anyone, but we have to be
wary  of turning schools, if this is what is intended, into a
battlefield for competing world views. The Government seem to realise
that there is too much scope for causing division, hence clause 80(1)
specifically excludes the
religion&#151;</div><a name="09061873000186"></a>
